Pregnant women are at greater risk of this complication because of several reasons e.g. lower baseline plasma sodium level in pregnancy， altered secretion of Anti Diuretic Hormone (ADH)， inappropriate fluid management in labor or increased oral intake and the anti-diuretic effect of oxytocin. We present a case which illustrates complications associated with hypervolemic hyponatremia as a result of positive fluid balance in labor. A caesarean section was required for failure to progress in first stage， chorioamnionitis， hyponatremia and acute kidney injury. She developed narrow complex Supra Ventricular Tachycardia (SVT) immediate post-delivery which was terminated with adenosine.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】In the literature， and national guidance framework， there is a paucity of guidance for the fluid management of laboring women. This group is at a high risk of dehydration， and fluid overload if careful management of fluid intake， both oral and intravenous， is not undertaken. This can lead to risk of acute kidney injury， electrolyte imbalances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and cardiac arrhythmias associated with fluid overload， and well as neonatal risks， including transient neonatal tachypnoea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， jaundice， hyperbilirubinemia， fluid overload and seizures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】Ms X， a 26 year old primiparous Caucasian woman was low risk with a BMI of 27 kg/m². Her pregnancy was uneventful and she presented to our Midwifery Led Unit (MLU) following spontaneous rupture of membranes at 40+8 weeks. Following a delay in the 15 stage of labor at 5 cm cervical dilatation，she was transferred to the Consultant Led Unit (CLU) for oxytocin augmentation.\n\n【6】In terms of fluid intake and output record in labor； she had 4L of intravenous Hartmann's in labor in consultant led unit， but prior oral intake in labor was unknown. She had required 9 h of oxytocin infusion in labor with titration rates of 8 to 12 ml/hr according to uterine contractions. Her total urine output in 9 h was recorded as 700 ml. She subsequently developed pyrexia in labor. In view of poor urine output and pyrexia in labor， she had septic screen and bloods taken， including FBC， CRP， U&Es and lactate. This showed her sodium level as 120 mmol/l and creatinine 139umol/l. Nine hours prior to deterioration， her creatinine level was 72 umol/l； however sodium was recorded low at 123 mmol/l. There were no preceding sodium levels to compare to.\n\n【7】Following review of blood results， identification of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)， suspected chorioamnionitis and delay in the 15 stage of labor at 8 cm cervical dilatation，the decision was made to expedite delivery by caesarean section. Blood loss at delivery was 800 ml and fetal weight as 4215g. Neonatal Apgar reported as 7 at 1 min and 5 at 10 min. Cord gases were 7.29 BE -3.7 (arterial) and 7.31 BE -4.6(venous). Baby required neonatal special care input with IV antibiotics and sodium replacement in view of neonatal hyponatremia.\n\nImmediately following delivery， she developed narrowcomplex supra ventricular tachycardia and required cardio version with IV adenosine. She was subsequently transferred to Intensive Therapies|删除段之间换行|Unit (ITU) for cardiac monitoring， and strict fluid monitoring in light of hyponatremia and AKI. She required multidisciplinary care with further input from intensive care team， medical and renalteams for ongoing management.\n\n【9】At time ofSVT，her GCS remained 15 with normal blood pressure and oxygen saturations. Her spot sodium test showed sodium of 117mmol/l and potassium of 3.2 mmol/. She developed second episode of SVT in ITU 6 h later， which required further cardio version with IV adenosine.\n\n【10】She required potassium and magnesium replacement in ITU. Her cortisol and thyroid function tests were reported as normal. Her initial urine creatinine was 2.48 mmol/l with urine sodium as 17.8mmol/l and urine sodium to creatinine ratio as 7.2. She made full recovery and was discharged home with baby on day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Following cardiology review， she had an EP (Electrophysiology) study which confirmed the suspicion of an accessory pathway which has now been ablated.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Hyponatremia ishbroadlycharacterized as euvolemic， hypervolemic or hypovolemic hyponatremia. In pregnancy， the most common manifestation is hypervolemic hyponatremia (also referred to as dilutional hyponatremia or water toxicity). This is caused due to the woman taking on more fluid than she is able to excrete， resulting in a relative drop in serum concentration of sodium. Acute hyponatremia may cause cerebral edema in severe cases， but most cases are asymptomatic. Early signs and symptoms of hyponatremia are often difficult to identify. These indlude lethargy， agitation， headache， confusion and altered mental state.\n\nAccepted values for normal sodium levels in pregnancy are 130mmol/L to 140 mmol/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>， due to the dilutional state induced by pregnancy， particularly in the third trimester 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4，7\\]</u>. This is due to increased water retention - a result of physiologically increased ADH secretion in pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Oxytocin， another hypothalamic neuropeptide，has a similar chemical structure to ADH and increases the risk of fluid retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Compounds with this effect as well as over-judicious administration of fluids， both IV and oral can lead to hypervolemic hyponatremia. In many cases hyponatremia is mild and asymptomatic |1，10|.\n\n【15】Previously reported cases outline that administration ofhypotonic fluid (e.g. 5% dextrose) significantly increase the risk of dilutional hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，11，12\\]</u>， so there has since been a shift in trends towards more physiological fluids (e.g.， Hartmann’s solution for fluid resuscitation， and normal saline for oxytocin administration). One Swedish observational study demonstrated that 26% of women who received more than 2500 mL fluid in labor (both oral and intravenous) were hyponatremic in the postpartum period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，13，14\\]</u>. Interestingly， in this same group there was no statistically significant relationship between oxytocin augmentation and hyponatremia.\n\n【16】Hyponatremia has been reported in cases of pre-eclampsia npregnancy. It's hypothesized that release of vasopressin in hypervolemic state in cases of deranged circulating volume in pre-eclampsia and ascites may be related to this pathology. It’s important to keep this in mind while investigating for causes ofhyponatremia in labor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. Our case did not have problem with blood pressure or proteinuria in pregnancy or labor and did not exhibit any signs and symptoms of Pre-eclampsia.\n\n【17】It's important to keep a strict fluid balance while being admitted to maternity wards especially for women undergoing induction of labor and in established labor. We have introduced a local guidance to guide fluid management in labor， recognition of hyponatremia and treatment since this case. We would encourage maternity units to devise their local guidance to increase awareness and management of fluid balance in labor to avoid a potentially serious complication of unrecognized hyponatremia for mothers and neonates.\n\n【18】Maternal Hyponatremia risks the cases of neonatal hyponatremia， which can cause fetal hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice， feeding difficulties， respiratory distress and convulsions. It's important to inform pediatrician about maternal hyponatremia in labor so that a neonatal management plan is devised in a timely manner.\n\n【19】Electrolyte disturbances can cause conduction problems in heart There have been case reports of atrioventricular block with severe hyponatremia which improved following correction of hyponatremia通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Electrolyte disturbances can also cause changes in sino-atrial node and pulmonary vein electrical activity leading to atrial fibrillation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. An ECG should be offered to women with severe electrolyte disturbance to rule out consequent cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n【21】Pregnancy itself can predispose to arrhythmiaasSwithout underlying heart disease because of increasing heart rate， circulating plasma volume changes and autonomic and hormonal changes and increased catecholamine.\n\n【22】To our knowledge， this is first case report of occurrence of supra ventricular tachycardia in a woman with concomitant severe hyponatremia. Her subsequent investigations revealed the presence of an accessory pathway which needed further management. This could have triggered her SVT with other biochemical changes in immediate postpartum period.\n\n【23】Treatment of SVT in pregnancy includes vagal maneuvers first and it fails to terminate tachycardia， adenosine is usually used as first line. Metoprolol or verapamil can be used in pregnancy too.\n\n【24】Learning Points\n\n【25】1\\. Accurate fluid balance is important in labor as women are at high risk of dehydration as well as fluid overload.\n\n【26】2\\. Hyponatremia is a potentially life-threatening complication for women and their neonates. It's important to recognize， diagnose and treat accordingly.\n\n【27】3\\.

These disorders start early during the insufficiency Chronic Renal Disease (CRF)， they are seen from stage 3 of the chronic kidney disease. They include at least one of these three components which are often associated： Abnormalities of the metabolism of calcium， phosphorus， Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) or vitamin D， abnormalities in bone turnover， mineralization， its volume， its growth and its solidity and vascular calcifications or other soft tissue通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. These complications and their impact on the vital prognosis justify appropriate prevention and treatment. The objective of our study is to determine the phosphocalcic status and the prevalence of OMT in our chronic hemodialysis patients and to assess the degree of adherence to the KDIGO2017 recommendations.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】We carried out a retrospective multicenter study in nine hemodialysis centers (2 CHP，6 private，1 CHU) in the region of CASABLANCA， including 658 hemodialysis patients on a 12-month urea(03/01/2017 to 02/28/2018).\n\nWe collected our patient data from medical records and dialysis notebooks as well as history and|删除段之间换行|physical examination.\n\n【11】The socio-demographic and clinical parameters used were as follows： Age， sex， length of hemodialysis， the different hemodialysis parameters： weight sec， Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (SBP， DBP)， dialysis dose (Kt/V) and number of sessions/week. The presence of functional signs including pain bone pain， arthralgia， muscle fatigue， pain during walking， itching， and the presence of a red eye， with a detailed osteoarticular examination.\n\n【12】Radiological signs of hyperparathyroidism or a dynamic osteopathy have been researched on standard radiographs by stereotypes profile skull， hands， lumbar spine and pelvis. The cardiac ultrasound allowed us to assess the condition heart and also to look for valvular calcifications. Parathyroid ultrasound was performed in all patients who had hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid scintigraphy was not systematic； indicated in patients who had tertiary hyperparathyroidism requiring treatment surgical.

The clinical manifestations include chronic headache， cranial nerves affected and epilepsy， a few patients present with bilateral or unilateral moderate visual loss. We describe the case of a patient who presented with bilateral visual loss without any other positive manifestations； the patient was initially diagnosed with Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (ION)， but further investigation revealed IHCP. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the 6h Medical Centre of Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. Written informed consent forms were obtained from the patient， who gave his consent that findings and images about himself were published in the journal and associated publications.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 59-year-old male patient presented with 4-day acute painless bilateral visual loss， with no headache， eye distension， photophobia， lacrimation or diplopia. The patient denied a history of diabetes，hypertension， coronary heart disease or auto-immune disease.Ofnote，ION diagnosis was considered， and medical cared such as intramuscular injection of mouse nerve growth factor prior to hospitalization did not result in visual recovery.\n\n【9】Upon examination， the Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) of the right eye was Hand Movement (HM)， and the left eye demonstrated nothing in Light (NIL).

The cavernous sinus and temporal lobe demonstrated possible aggressive signals. No significant high signal was found with diffusion-weighted imaging. In summary， the patient was considered to have IHCP based on laboratory tests and MRI data. Treatment with methylprednisolone via intravenous drip infusion was continued， followed by oral prednisone acetate tablets. Twenty days after treatment， the BCVA of the patient was significantly restored： that of the right eye reached 20/20， and that of the left eye was 20/200. Unfortunately， visual field examination showed that the visual light sensitivity in the right eye had decreased， and examination of the left eye showed that one-quarter of the visual field was completely loss.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\nHypertrophic Pachymeningitis (HP) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by fibrous thickening of the cerebral and/or spinal dural mater 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. HP is divided into two types， Idiopathic Hypertrophic Pachymeningitis (IHP)， for which no identifiable cause has been found， and secondary HP， for which is described inassociation with trauma，infections， tumors， autoimmune/inflaarmrmatory disease and cerebrospinal fluidhypotension syndrome. IHCP， the most common features of which is chronic intermittent headache， can also be expressed as cephalagra， local or whole brain blunt pain， or progressive palsy of cranial nerves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. One important reason for the ease of cranial nerve damage is the narrowing of the skull gap， in which cranial nerves pass， due to endocranial hypertrophy. The thickened dura might invade the oculomotor nerve， abductor nerve， trochlear nerve， trigeminal nerve and optic nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Severe injury of the optic nerve alone occurs infrequently but can lead to painless rapid bilateral visual loss. Mathew et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， reported one case of IHCP presenting as acute|删除段之间换行|left-sided painless visual loss， and the patient complained of persistent left-sided headache and numbness on her forehead in the past few years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our case presented as rapid bilateral visual loss as the initial clinical manifestation， and we have not found similar previous reports.\n\n【14】The diagnosis of IHCP can be made by combining clinical manifestations， imaging examination results， laboratory test results and pathological features. The pathological characteristics are diffuse fibrous hypertrophy of the dura matter and lymphocytes as well as plasma cell infiltration； IHCP can also present with glass-like changes or caseous necrosis. It can also be observed on MRI and defined pathologically on biopsy； the performance of MRI was correlated with the clinical state in 80% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Imaging demonstrated the diffuse thickening of the dura； the lesions appeared hypointense or isointense on T1-weighted sequences and hypointense 厂T2-weighted sequences.

According to others， laboratory findings might show increased ESR or CRP levels in patients， and some patients show positive results for auto antibodies including ANA，P-ANCA，ACA and RF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Intracranial neuropathy might occur rapidly and progressively， and the damage is difficult to recover. A clear and correct diagnosis as soon as possible and timely treatment are critical. In this report， the visual acuity of the left eye in the patient was lost three days earlier than that of the right eye； as a result of treatment， the BCVA in the left eye was lower than that in the right eye. The results of this study demonstrate that we should pay attention to intracranial changes as soon as possible in patients with a sharp decline in visual acuity but with no obviously positive signs in the eyeball.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Pharmacologic therapeutic options include tricyclic antidepressants， serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors， and gabapentin as first line treatments followed by weak (e.g.， tramadol) and strong opioids (e.g.， morphine and oxycodone) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The medication refractory CNP are treated with non-pharmacological treatment including interventional therapies(e.g.， sympathetic nerve/ganglion block， epidural steroid injection， peripheral nerve blockade)， physical therapies (e.g.， Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS))， and psychological therapies (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Minimally invasive interventional procedures such as sympathetic nerve blockade/neurolysis/neuro-ablation， Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injection (TFESI)， and Pulsed Radiofrequency (PRF) have been introduced recently for the management of chronic neurological pain including CCNP.\n\n【6】We present a rarely performed minimally invasive intervention ofbilateral lumbar sympathetic nerve block at L3 and subsequently ultrasound guided PRF of bilateral sciatic nerves at the popliteal fossa in SCI related CCNP that was refractory to medical and physical therapy.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】In February 2021， a female (60 to 70 years old) was referred to the Pain Clinic (Toronto， Ontario) for severe， persistent bilateralleg pain after a remote anterior spinal cord infarct 8 years ago. After her SCI she had a full recovery of her motor and sensory function but had severe bilateral burning leg pain diffusely from her hip to toes， covering both volar and dorsal aspect of the limbs. She described her pain as 10/10 constant electrical and burning pain throughout that was worse at night. In addition， her skin was extremely sensitive to touch. The pain disrupted her functional ability to ambulate，perform physical exercise， and sleep. She denied any major weakness， sensory loss， muscle movements， cramps or tremors which were concordant with the findings on physical examination. Her current sensory and motor examination did not show any neurological deficits. She did not have any allodynia on examination， but she did have diffuse hyperalgesia to pin prick in bilateral lower extremities. In the past she had trialed a few analgesics， including gabapentin (30000 mg/d to 32000 mg/d) and duloxetine (60 mg/d) without significant pain relief. The diagnosis of CCNP secondary to SCI likely involving small fiber mediated pain was made. At this time bilateral L3 lumbar sympathetic block under fluoroscopic guidance was performed with each side receiving a total of solution injected .\n\nIn 3 month follow up the patient reported complete pain relief of0/10 of the proximal limbs from her back to the distal thigh. She still had residual burning pain of the lowerlegs at an intensity of 7/10. She had functional improvements of increased ambulation duration and improved sleep. She was able to reduce her gabapentin dose to 1500mg/d. Physical examination revealed bilateral hyperalgesia to pin prick diffusely over her lower leg and feet. Subsequently， ultrasound guided bilateral sciatic nerve pulsed radiofrequency simulation at the popliteal fossa was performed.

At this time， approximately 6 months after her bilateral lumbar sympathetic block， her proximal leg pain continued to be tolerable， with a severity of 3/10.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The current findingshighlights that the multimodal and multistage approach， including targeting both the autonomic and somatic pain systems with sympathetic blocks and pulsed radiofrequency in the SCI related CCNP， which has been barely studied， can lead to lasting significant pain reduction.\n\n【12】Generally， there is no robust or sufficient evidence to support the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatment in SCI-related CCNP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Sympathetic nerve or ganglion management (including blockade， neurolysis， or ablation) with medication， neurolytic modalities， and radiofrequency ablation have been used in CNP mainly in PCNP， including pain associated with herpes zoster， post-herpetic neuralgia， diabetic peripheral neuropathy， and complex regional pain syndrome通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. With SCI-related CCNP， other modalities including spinal cord stimulation， intrathecal medication delivery， deep brain stimulation， and dorsal root entry zone lesion have been commonly investigated in literature. The level of evidence for this has been low and the recommendation for its use is inconclusive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， this case report supports the individualized approach can make the seldom-or non-studied interventional options in the SCI-associated CCNP，i.e.， sympathetic nerve block， available and useful.\n\n【13】Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have yielded that PRF can lead to decreased pain， improved function， and quality of life， and reduced oral medication use in Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， trigeminal neuralgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， knee osteoarthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， perineal pain after delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， while non-effective in radicular pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Merely， one case report was found presenting the efficacy of PRF on a refractory complex regional pain syndrome due to sciatic neuropathy with a disabling pain in the unilateral lower leg and foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The current finding shows that bilateral lumbar sympathetic blockade can reduce SCI-related CCNP within the proximal bilateral lower limbs. Then with the residual bilateral lower leg neuropathic pain， PRF of the sciatic nerve bilaterally was able to reduce the unresolved pain and hyperalgesia.\n\n【15】This case spotlight that individualized， multimodal， minimally invasive interventions for CCNP can be safe and effective in achieving high quality ofpain control， and， ultimately， improve patient function and quality of life and earn patient satisfaction. Lumbar sympathetic nerve blockade can be a therapeutic option for spinal cord injury related chronic central neuropathic pain and， subsequently， PRF can be effectively applied primarily to the peripheral nerve system as the second stage of the management of SCI associated central neuropathic pain.\n\n【16】StatementofAuthorship\n\n【17】SK： Generated idea， collected data， drafted， edited， and critically appraised the manuscript.\n\n【18】MP： Collecteddata， edited， and1criticalIlyaappraisedthe manuscript.\n\n【19】AS： Generated idea， collected data， drafted， edited， and critically appraised the manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In this case study we discussed about a 65 years old male patient received prolonged immunosuppression therapy emphasized on risk factors and the mechanisms which induces the reactivation of HBV and helps to understand and quantify the risk ofHBV reactivation and its consequences.\n\n【2】We report an observation of an immunodeficient patient in whom viral B reactivation occurred one year after renal transplantation.\n\n【3】Keywords： Reactivation of viral hepatitis B； Renal transplant patients； Immunosuppression\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) reactivation is defined as the increase in viremia (>1 log10 IU/ml) in a known patient with chronic or HBV-resolved infection. Since Covalently Closed Circular Deoxyribonucleic Acid (cccDNA) is not removed from the hepatocytes， any event affecting the immune status promotes viral reactivation， sometimes severe or even fatal.\n\n【6】Serological profiles combining significant titles of anti-HBs and anti-HBc antibodies have long been considered as serological scars indicating a former HBC viral hepatitis. However， the development of PCR techniques has revealed the persistence of the Hepatitis B genome (HBV)， which is a potential source of viral reactivation.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Male patient aged 65， followed since 2005 for renal failure in the Nephrology department. In2010； the patient had received a kidney transplant. A pre-transplant assessment revealed a level of anti-HBs Antibody at 50 IU/ml associated with HBc Ab’s defining post-contact immunization against HBV.\n\n【9】One year after the kidney transplant， during which the patient has received immunosuppressive treatment， the evolution was marked by the appearance of hepatic cytolysis (ALAT： 230UI/ml). The markers of acute hepatitis A (anti-HAV IgM)， hepatitis E (anti-HEV IgM) and hepatitis C were negatives. Acute infection or reactivation of Herpesviridae (cytomegalovirus， Epstein-Barr virus， varicella-zoster virus， and Herpes simplex virus) has been eliminated. In contrast， the serology confirmed the diagnosis of active viral hepatitis B (positive HBs antigen and anti-HBc antibodies) with high viral replication confirmed by quantification of viral DNA using real-time PCR COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HBV (8.45 log IU/ml； 284，000，000 IU/ml). The antigen and anti-hepatitis Delta antibody were negative. The diagnosis of reactivation of the hepatitis B virus in relation to immunosuppression was retained； the patient was put under Entecavir. The evolution was marked by a rapid biological response with un detectable viral DNA.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\nHBV reactivation can be classified into two broad categories based on the initial serologic profile： reactivation of HBV in patients who are positive for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) in serum with or without the presence of HBV DNA. The reverse seroconversion is defined as the reappearance of viral DNA and HBsAg in an individual's serum， which was initially negative for|删除段之间换行|both before immunosuppression.\n\n【12】The HBV reactivation maybe variable depending on the status of the host， the underlying disease， and the type of immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This can occur either early in the first two weeks after the beginning of chemotherapy or more than one year after the end of immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Understanding the risk factors and the mechanisms that may induce the reactivation of HBV helps certainly to understand and quantify the risk of HBV reactivation and its consequences 3\\].\n\n【13】The grafted patient has multiple risk factors favoring the development of active hepatitis B： transfusion contamination， transmission by a chronic carrier donor of HBV， or reactivation of a latent B virus in an asymptomatic carrier or in a patient who is nevertheless immunized as in our observation 4\\].\n\n【14】It is， therefore， necessary to evaluate the infectious risk due to ciclosporin and corticosteroids that these patients receive after the transplant， which may decrease the immune reaction of the body. As in our observation， it is only at the time of the immune rebound at the end of the intense and prolonged immunosuppressive treatment， that hepatitis has manifest itself， sometimes dramatically considering a large number of infected hepatocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【15】This immune revival can sometimes lead to the elimination of the virus， but in other cases， such as in our case， the selection pressure may favor the appearance of a mutated B virus in the pre-C region通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5\\]</u>.\n\n【16】These reactivations are potentially serious： risk of fulminant hepatitis， cirrhosis or even death， increased risk of veno-occlusive disease or graft vs. host disease， but the evolution is most often favorable with even cases of spontaneous elimination of the virus despite the immunosuppression context通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nThe management of HBV reactivation is centered on the likelihood of the risk of reactivation based on the risk factor profile of an individual patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. All patients who are either at high or moderate risk of HBV reactivation should be considered candidates for prophylactic anti-HBV therapy. Usually， we recommend starting anti-HBV therapy before starting immune-suppressive therapy and a baseline complete metabolic profile， complete blood count， prothrombin time， and serum HBV-DNA levels are recommended通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is important to evaluate if the patient has chronic hepatitis B and should be a candidate for the treatment of CHB based on serum ALT level， AST level， albumin level， platelet count， and other laboratory parameters and physical examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In endemic areas， if a patient presents with increased ALT level in the setting of immunosuppressive therapies， it is prudent to consider checking for serum HBV DNA.

Consideration of referral to either hepatology or infectious disease specialist before cancer chemotherapy in those at risk of hepatitis B reactivation is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Prevention after transplantation in a patient with positive anti-HBs and anti-HBc antibodies requires regular monitoring of the anti-HBs Ab title. In case of a significant decrease of this one， several approaches can be discussed： active immunization by vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-10\\]</u>， passive immunization by regular injection of specific anti-HBs immunoglobulins， or daily oral administration of antivirals capable of inhibiting the replication viral 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

As we all know， tumors in gastrointestinal system are closely related to living habits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. These bad habits include alcoholism， deep-frying， barbecue， high-salt and high-fat diet， coupled with environmental changes and fast life rhythm， such as staying up late， high-load work and other factors， which damage the body's immune defense function and lead to the occurrence of benign and malignant tumors including polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. These factors comprehensively act on the human， resulting in different physical changes.

However， so far there are no relevant researches on the distribution of TCM syndromes and related risk factors of patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen. Therefore， this paper discussed the distribution of TCM syndromes in patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen， and analyzed the correlation between related risk factors and TCM syndromes.\n\n【20】Methods Complicating diseases\n\n【21】Case data\n\n【22】This was a case retrospective study design. The patients who underwent electronic colonoscopy in the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine (People's Hospital of Shenzhen Baoan District) were collected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria from January 2016 to June删除4:<u> 2021</u>. The basic information including registration number， age， sex， admission diagnosis and TCM syndromes were recorded. A total of 296 eligible patients aged 27 to83 (52.62±9.85) were researched in this study， including 174 male patients (58.8%) and 122 female patients (41.2%).\n\n【23】We also collected the complicating diseases， that is， whether there Was hyperglycemia，hypertension， hyperlipidemia and Hyperuricemia (4H). The diagnostic criteria of the diseases were as follows： hyperglycemia (fasting blood glucose >6.1 mmol/L)， hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg)， hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol>5.17mmol/L or triglyceride >1.43 mmol/L).\n\n【24】Statistical analysis\n\n【25】Diagnostic criteria\n\n【26】Diagnostic criteria of TCM： TCM syndrome types refer to “Diagnostic Criteria for Common TCM Syndrome”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and“Internal Medicine of Traditional Chinese Medicine”published by Zhou Zhongying 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The syndromes are jointly determined by an attending physician and a senior doctor.\n\n【27】All the data in this study were performed by SPSS 23.0. The measurement data was presented by mean and standard deviation. One-Way ANOVA was used for comparison of age among multiple groups， and LSD method was used for multiple comparisons among groups， the correlation of age with TCM syndromes was analyzed by Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The qualitative data including sex and complicating diseases were presented by proportion， and the overall distribution among groups was analyzed by Chi-square test， and the correlation was evaluated by Spearman Coefficient. P<0.05was considered to be that the difference was statistically significant.\n\n【28】Diagnostic criteria of western medicine： Colon polyps or rectal polyps were diagnosed according to electronic colonoscopy.\n\n【29】Result\n\n【30】Inclusion criteria Basicinformation of patients with various TCM syndromes\n\n【31】These patients had no household registration and lived in Shenzhen for more than 5 years， and conformed to the diagnostic criteria of colorectal polyps. The age was over 18 years old. Allpatients had been examined by electronic colonoscopy.\n\n【32】Exclusion criteria\n\n【33】These patients had ahistory ofcolonic polyps in the past but could not provide a detailed examination report or did not find polyps after colonoscopy again. Patients had incomplete case data or familial adenomatous polyposis or colon cancer confirmed by pathological diagnosis.\n\nA total of 296 eligible patients with colorectal polyps were collected in this study. Eighty patients were deficiency-syndrome，and the highest proportion of patients (33%) was deficiency of spleen and stomach energy， followed by deficiency-cold of spleen and stomach(cold-syndrome due to deficiency of spleen and stomach-yang) and deficiency of yin fluid， each accounting for 24% . There were 179 patients with sthenia-syndrome， among which the highest proportion was the stagnation of phlegm-wetness (55%)， followed by stagnation of vital energy and damp-heat or phlegm-heat， which were15% and 12% respectively . Among them， damp-heat/phlegm-heat was mainly wetness-heat in large intestine or phlegm-|删除段之间换行|heat stagnation in lung. There were 37 patients with Asthenia-Syndrome Accompanied with Sthenia-Syndrome (ASASS)， of which the highest proportion was deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis， accounting for 35%， followed by deficiency of spleen energy and phlegm dampness/dyspepsia syndrome， accounting for 32% .\n\n【35】Appearance of intestinal polyps of all patients under electronic colonoscope\n\nAs shown in Figure 2， appearance of intestinal polyps of all patients under electronic colonoscope was different. The polyps in the patients with asthenia-syndrome were light， pale and tender， especially in these with deficiency of spleen and stomach energy， deficiency-cold of spleen and stomach， and deficiency of both vital energy and blood. While the intestinal mucosa was thin and the blood vessels were obviously exposed . On the contrary， significant hyperemia and edema was be found in the colon mucosa of the patients with sthenia-syndrome ， especially in the patients with wetness-heat or phlegm-heat stagnation， and heat-evil of liver and stomach. The blood vessels in the mucosa were purple and visible in the patients with blood stasis. As for the patients with ASASS， the mucosa was obviously marked with edema， while the polyp in the colon with phlegm-wetness with deficiency of yin fluid was red and swollen， and the blood vessels were clearly visible (Figure|删除段之间换行|2C).\n\n【37】Comparison of age and sex distribution of all patients\n\n【38】The results revealed that there were more men {47 cases) than women (33 cases) in the deficiency-syndrome group ， but there is no statistical difference in the overall distribution of gender among various deficiency syndromes， and there is no statistical difference in the average age between each group. As shown in Table2， there were 102 male patients in the sthenia-syndrome group， which was higher than 77 female patients， but there is no significant difference in the overall distribution among the groups. Although the age of patients with wetness-heat and phlegm-heat stagnation was lower than that of patients with other syndromes， there was no significant difference in the mean value among the groups. Similarly， there were more male patients than female patients in ASASS group(P>0.05)， however， there was a significant difference in age between each group (P<0.05)， and had certain correlation (Pearson coefficient was -0.451，P=0.005). As shown in Table 3， the patients with deficiency of spleen energy and phlegm-dampness/dyspepsia syndrome are the youngest， and significantly lower than those with deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis (P<0.05) and sthenia of liver yang (P<0.05).

Most patients have no clinical manifestations， only found during physical examination or treatment of other diseases. Although most of colorectal polyps are benign lesions， some polyps also have canceration tendency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Therefore， early resection and identification of colorectal polyps are of great significance.\n\n【48】Although there is no name for colorectal polyps in Chinese medicine， as early as in ancient China， there are records and descriptions about the etiology and pathogenesis of polyps. For example， primitive theories documented by “The Yellow Emperor’s Canon of Internal Medicine (722-221 B.C) (Huangdi neijinig)\"point out that the occurrence of polyps was related to invasion of exogenous evils. Stagnation of cold-wetness evil (a pathogenic factor blended by evils of cold and wetness) results in obstruction in the channels and stasis of vital energy and blood， leading to occurrence of polyps.(Huangdi neijinig) said， \"Healthy energy (referring to the resistance of the human body against diseases) existed inside， but evils could not be done\"， suggesting that deficiency of healthy energy is also an important factor in the occurrence of colorectal polyps in addition to exogenous evils.\n\n【49】Guangdong in China belongs to the Ling nan region. Some statistics studies on TCM syndromes of patients with colorectal polyps in Guangdong have performed， and found that deficiency of spleen-energy and evil wetness accounted for the highest proportion， followed by asthenia of the spleen and stomach and wetness-heat and blood stasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. These researchers considered that deficiency of spleen-energy is the root of trouble and phlegm-evil and blood stasis are the causes of the disease. Our study found that the proportion of patients with asthenia of the spleen and stomach was the highest in all colorectal polyps'patients with asthenia-syndrome in Shenzhen， which is consistent with other research results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. Our observation revealed that the proportion of patients with phlegm-evil was the highest， up to 55%， followed by stagnation of vital energy and phlegm-wetness or wetness-heat evil. Shenzhen is a southern city in Guangdong Province， and located in Ling'nan region which has a unique climate with heavy humidity and heat. These results have suggested that， tangible sthenia-evils including phlegm-wetness and blood stasis can be produced in the human body living in Shenzhen.\n\n【50】Table 4： Distribution and comparison results of \"4H\" diseases in patients with deficiency syndrome groups.\n\n| Groups (80 cases)  | Hyperglycemia (N/Y)  | Hypertension (N/Y)  | Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)  | Hyperuricemia (N/Y)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Deficiency of spleen and stomach energy (27 cases)  | 22/5  | 20/7  | 14/13  | 17/10  |\n| Deficiency-cald of spleen and stomach (19 cases)  | 19/0  | 17/2  | 11/8  | 17/2  |\n| Deficiency of both vital energy and blaod (15 cases)  | 13/2  | 13/2  | 8/7  | 10/5  |\n| Deficiency of yin fluid (19 cases)  | 15/4  | 15/4  | 11/8  | 9/10  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.221  | 0.55  | 0.969  | 0.052  |\n\n【52】Note： “4H\" represented Hyperglycemia， Hypertension， Hyperlipidemia， and Hyperuricemia. \"N\" represented no \"4H\"， and \"Y\"mean existence of \"4H\" (The same below)\n\n| Groups (179 cases)  | Hyperglycemia (N/Y)  | Hypertension (N/Y)  | Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)  | Hyperuricemia (N/Y)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Wetness-heat or phlegm-heat stagnation (22 cases)  | 18/4  | 17/5  | 22-Oct  | 17/5  |\n| Retention of cold-wetness (8 cases)  | 8/0  | 7/1  | 6/2  | 7/1  |\n| Stagnation of phlegm-wetness (99 cases)  | 88/11  | 76/23  | 43/56  | 66/33  |\n| Depression of vital energy (27 cases)  | 26/1  | 25/2  | 14/13  | 21/6  |\n| Blood stasis (17 cases)  | 14/3  | 15/2  | 7/10  | 8/9  |\n| Heat-evil of liver and stomach (6 cases)  | 5/1  | 6/0  | 2/4  | 4/2  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.478  | 0.305  | 0.565  | 0.22  |\n\n【54】Table 6： Distribution and comparison results of \"4H\" diseases in patients with ASASS groups.\n\n| Deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis (13 cases)  | Hyperglycemia (N/Y)  | Hypertension (NY)  | Hyperlipidemia (N/Y)  | Hyperuricemia (N/Y)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Deficiency of vital energy and blaad stasis (13 cases)  | 12/1  | 11/2  | 7/6  | 8/5  |\n| Sthenia of liver yang (7cases)  | 6/0  | 1/6  | 2/5  | 4/2  |\n| Spleen deficiency with phlegm-wetness/ dyspepsia (12 cases)  | 9/3  | 9/3  | 4/8  | 10/2  |\n| Phlegm-wetness with deficiency of yin fluid (5 cases)  | 5/0  | 5/0  | 3/2  | 4/1  |\n| Pvalue  | 0.252  | 0.003  | 0.52  | 0.648  |\n\n【56】These tangible evils can block the functional activities of vital energy for a long time， leading to depression of vital energy and further heat-syndrome resulting from disorder of vital energy. In this case， phlegm-heat or wetness-heat evil is formed， further stagnating the functional activities of vital energy in turn. Depressed vital energy， phlegm-evil and blood stasis in conflict with each other within gut and leads to occurrence of polyps. Therefore， deficiency of spleen-energy， phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and depression of vital energy are the important pathological factors of colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. Our study found that， in the patients with stagnation of wetness-heat， some patients suffered from stagnation of phlegm-heat in the lung， which may be due to the fact that the lung and large intestine share s paired relationship， phlegm-heat evil in the lung can enter the large intestine along the channel system and block the functional activities of vital energy in gut， further affecting the blood circulation. This consequence leads to the stagnation of phlegm， depressed vital energy and blood stasis in the local intestine， resulting in formation of polyps.\n\nIt is considered that the occurrence of colorectal polyps is the results of many risk factors. Although these factors are related to histological type of polyps and family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， other risks have been paid more and more attention. Some studies have shown that age is considered as one of the risk factors related to the occurrence of colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-20\\]</u>. The older the age， the higher the incidence of colorectalpolyps， especially after 40 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. This is consistent with the observation of our study. We found that the average age of polyp patients is over 50 years old. This may be related to the decrease of intestinal peristalsis， intestinal flora imbalance and weakened immunity with increasing age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The age of patients with deficiency of spleen-energy and stagnation of wetness-evil， and deficiency of yin-fluid and phlegm-wetness syndrome (average age was lower than50 years old) was lower than that of other syndromes (average age was higher than 55 years old). This suggests that the patients younger than 50 years old should be paid more attention to invigorating the spleen and eliminating wetness-evil during determination of treatment based on the differentiation of symptoms and signs. While eliminating wetness， we should take care of nourishing yin fluid， and we should not use drugs that are too pungent and dry. The results of|删除段之间换行|this study also found that the proportion of male patients was more than that of female patients， which is consistent with the results of big data analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. It may be that men prefer smoking and drinking， and work and life are more stressful than women.\n\n【58】In this study， we found that some patients with colorectal polyps were complicated with Hyperglycemia， Hypertension， Hyperlipemia and Hyperuricemia (4H). Whether these complicating diseases are related to the formation of asthenia- and sthenia-syndrome of colorectal tumor? Although some studies have suggested that there was no direct correlation between the number of colonic polyps and hyperglycemia， hypertension and hyperlipidemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>， a research by Yunfeng Dong shown that the high risk factors of adenomatous rectal polyps are eating fat and having high triglyceride/cholesterol通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Our research results also shown that， in the colorectal polyp patients with asthenia-syndrome， the asthenia of spleen and stomach， and deficiency of yin fluid in these with hyperuricemia accounted for a large proportion. Although the difference was not statistically significant， drugs for reducing uric acid can be complemented each other while invigorating vital energy and spleen and nourishing yin fluid for such patients in clinic.\n\nIn view of the recurrence of colorectal polyps， based on the theory of insidious toxin (a pathogenic factors) in Traditional Chinese Medicine， some studies suggest that the primary cause of colorectal polyps is that the insidious toxin deeply invaded the intestinal collaterals. Therefore， the insidious toxin and chronic consumption of essence and blood are the key mechanisms of occurrence and recurrence of colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>， which indicates that toxic evil is also a pathological factor in the occurrence of intestinal polyps. In our study， we found that the patients with wetness-heat or phlegm-heat evil also accounted for a large proportion， while the patients with cold-wetness only accounted for a small proportion， which may be related to the unique climate environment in Shenzhen. Therefore， invigorating spleen， clearing away heat and eliminating wetness has become a strategy to prevent and treat colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26-31\\]</u>. Consistent with previous studies， it is easy to appear the syndrome of vin fluid deficiency because toxic and heat evil can consume essence and blood. As shown in our study， the syndromes of deficiency of yin fluid including yin-deficiency of liver and kidney， deficiency of|删除段之间换行|stomach-yin， deficiency of lung-yin， and deficiency of both vital energy and yin also occupied a large proportion in the asthenia-syndrome. After statistical analysis， we found that there was no significant difference in the “4H” diseases between the patients with sthenia-syndrome， suggesting that there is no significant correlation between sthenia-syndromes and “4H”diseases.\n\n【60】Clinically， the occurrence of diseases is often presented by Asthenia-Syndrome Accompanied with Sthenia-Syndrome (ASASS)； therefore， there are quite a few patients with the ASASS in this study. Among them， deficiency of vital energy and blood stasis was the major ones， followed by deficiency of spleen-energy and phlegm-wetness syndrome. Ultimately， asthenia is still rooted as the occurrence of intestinal polyps， with phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and stagnation of vital energy as the symptomatic manifestation， which is consistent with the treatment thinking of supplementing vital energy and invigorating the spleen， and promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis to treat colorectal polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. A large number of studies have suggested that most patients with hypertension presented the syndrome of sthenia of liver-yang， and a significant correlation existed between the sthenia of liver-yang and hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33-35\\]</u>. Therefore， in this study， we also found that the difference ofhypertension in the syndrome of ASASS was statistically significant. The proportion of patients with hypertension and sthenia of liver-yang was more than other syndromes， so it is necessary to pay attention to the prevention and treatment of hypertension in the therapy of colorectal polyp patients with sthenia ofliver-yang.\n\n【61】Conclusion\n\n【62】Deficiency of vital energy of spleen-stomach and stagnation of phlegm-wetness are the primary syndromes for the patients with colorectal polyps in Shenzhen， and the pathological factors involve phlegm-wetness， blood stasis and stagnation of vital energy. Yin-deficiency is mainly caused by liver， kidney，lung and stomach. There is no obvious correlation between sthenia-syndrome and age， Sex，“4H”. Age should be considered in the treatment of patients under 50years old with ASASS syndrome. The patients with sthenia of liver-yang syndrome often have hypertension， thus， hypertension should also be considered for such patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In this article， a case of a premature infant with a gestational age of 24+1 weeks was successfully treated， but no sequelae were found during follow-up. It is reminded that the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of tertiary hospitals in China through careful and standardized management， enables children to smoothly pass through the three major barriers of breathing， nutrition， and infection， as well as the subsequent kangaroo care and family participatory management， which can fully realize the Preterm infants aged 24 to 25 weeks survived without obvious defects.\n\n【2】Keywords： Super premature infants； Gestational age 24 weeks； Dyspnea； Sequelae\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hospital admission\n\n【5】The patient， a female， was admitted to the hospital on September 24h，2019 because of“gestational age of 24+1 weeks and dyspnea for 40 min after birth\". The child is the second child of the second child， and the gestational age is 24+1 weeks. The mothers prenatal measurement of blood pressure is high， urine protein is +， suffering from\" bacterial vaginosis\" and given \"cefoxitin anti-infection and topical vaginal medication\"treatment. Before childbirth，\"dexamethasone needle1 course\" has been given to promote fetal lung maturity. She gave birth naturally and weighed770 g. Amniotic fluid， umbilical cord， and placenta were normal. After birth， the child breathes like breath， weak spontaneous breathing， Apgar score of 1 min， 5 min and 9 points (respiration deduction 1 point)， the gestational age of the child is less than 26 weeks， and requires prophylactic administration of pulmonary surfactant and endotracheal intubation the rewarmed porcine lung phospholipid injection 160 mg was dripped into the tube. After the drug was used up， he still had difficulty breathing and had weak spontaneous breathing. He was transferred to the neonatology department under tracheal intubation and resuscitation balloon positive pressure ventilation. Both mother and father are 32 years old. One brother is 5 years old and healthy. Physical examination：Body temperature 36.6C，heart rate 145 beats/min， breathing 68 beats/min， weight 770 gm. Ultra-premature babies have appearance， poor response， thin and shiny skin， nails not reaching the fingertips， unobvious foot texture， no nodules in the breast， and unobvious areola. The fontanelle is flat and soft， the spontaneous breathing is weak， the mouth is cyanotic， and the three concave signs are positive. Breath sounds in both lungs were low， and no wet rales were heard. The heart sounds are strong， regular and without noise. The abdominal examination was normal. The labia majora does not cover the labia minor. The muscle tone of the limbs is low， and the original reflex is not elicited. Admitted to the hospital for diagnosis of Extremely Preterm Infants (EPI) and ultra-low birth weight infants.\n\n【6】Diagnosis and treatment process\n\nKeep warm in an advanced incubator with a humidity of 90%. Give the ventilator assisted breathing SIMV mode，initial parameters： Peak Inspiratory Pressure PIP 14cmH20 (1cmH，0=0.098kPa)， Positive End Expiratory Pressure PEEP 5 cm H，O， Respiratory frequency (Respiratory Rate RR) 35 times/min， inhaled oxygen concentration (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen FiO，) 30%， Inspiratory time (Inspiratory time Ti) 0.35 S. Blood sugar and blood pressure were normal on admission. No pathogenic bacteria grow in sputum culture. Afterwards， the ventilator parameters were gradually lowered. On the third day of admission， the ventilator parameters were： PIP 12 cm|删除段之间换行|H0， PEEP 4 cm HO， RR 30 times/min， FiO， 23%， Ti 0.35 S. The gestational age was corrected at 26+1 weeks (2 weeks after birth) and mechanical ventilation was stopped. Because ofapnea， a noninvasive ventilator was given bi-level positive pressure ventilation. Corrected the gestational age of 28+3 weeks and stopped the non-invasive ventilator， changed to nasal cannula oxygen inhalation， corrected the gestational age of 29 weeks， changed to incubate oxygen. Correct gestational age and stop oxygen at 31 weeks. After admission， he was given penicillin combined with ceftizoxime for anti-infective treatment， penicillin for 1 week， and ceftizoxime for 10 days. Pulmonary infection occurred at 36 weeks of gestational age was corrected， cefoperazone and sulbactam anti-infective treatment was given for 1 week and the drug was stopped after recovery. Correct gestational age at 37 weeks and start kangaroo care. After birth， he was given umbilical vein catheterization for 14 days， and then PICC catheterization was given for 2 times， which was maintained until drug withdrawal. After 2 weeks of admission， the rat nerve growth factor was used to nourish the nerves. After the condition was stabilized， the premature infants were treated with massage and music. On the second day of admission， caffeine citrate was given to treat apnea， and the maintenance dose was 10 mg/kg until the gestational age was corrected 36 weeks. After birth， give vitamin K and sulfacetamide to prevent bleeding for 3 days， keep quiet， avoid sound and light stimulation， reduce movement， and maintain internal environment stability. Head ultrasound was monitored once a week， and there was no abnormality. Cardiac color Doppler ultrasound examination was performed 2 weeks after birth： Atrial level and left-to-right shunt were recorded， aortic level and small left-to-right shunt were recorded， and the shunt beam width was about1 mm to 2 mm， indicating patent foramen ovale and patent ductus arteriosus. The child had no hemodynamic changes， and the arterial catheter was not given specialtreatment. Correction of gestationalage at 27 weeks and re-examination of cardiac color Doppler ultrasound showed that the foramen ovale was patent and the arterial duct was closed. Reexamination of cardiac color Doppler ultrasound every two weeks afterwards showed that the foramen ovale was patent. After admission， he began to actively support parenteral and parenteral nutrition， monitor height and head circumference every week， and monitor weight gain trends every day. Nasal feeding started on the4th day after birth， micro-feeding， deep hydrolyzed milk powder，and non-nutritive sucking. Each time the stomach tube was fed 1 ml， once every 3 h， and then every 3 to 5 days with 1 ml each time， the feeding was well tolerated， and the gestational age was corrected 26+2 weeks and the breast milk nasal feeding was started. Correct the gestational age of 28+4 weeks and start partial oral feeding. After correcting the gestational age at 32 weeks， all oral breast milk was fed 13 ml/time， weighing 1300 g， and breast milk fortifier was added. Amino acids were administered intravenously within 24 h after birth to prevent negative nitrogen balance， fat emulsion was added 24 h later， and parenteral nutrition was used to supplement energy and various nutrients. Three weeks after birth， the blood routine examination revealed anemia， and erythropoietin was added， oral iron was used to prevent anemia， and a blood transfusion was given. Corrected the gestational age from 32+4 weeks， check the ophthalmology fundus every 2 weeks， and continue to return to the ophthalmology clinic after discharge. No abnormalities were found. Corrected for 41weeks of gestational age， the head MRI showed no abnormalities. The patient was hospitalized for 128 days. At discharge， his length was50 cm， his head circumference was 34 cm， and his weight was 3210g. The Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment (NBNA) score|删除段之间换行|was normal. Six months after birth (corrected age of 2 months)， the length is 58 cm， the head circumference is 38 cm， the weight is 4900g the NBNA score is normal，and the hearing screening and brainstem auditory evoked potential are normal.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】EPI less than 28 weeks has a high mortality rate， mainly due to perinatal asphyxia， intracranial hemorrhage， congenital malformations， hyaline membrane disease， pulmonary hemorrhage， persistent pulmonary hypertension， and various infections. In recent years， there have been more and more reports on the successful treatment of preterm infants with gestational age less than 28 weeks. There have been reports of survival at the minimum gestational age of 21 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The survival rate of EPI at 23 weeks and 24 weeks in European and American countries is 44.4% and 69.2%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There is still a big gap between my country and foreign countries.\n\n【10】Our department successfully treated a case of 25+3 EPI in2016， and the follow-up developed well. The patient who has been successfully treated is one of the youngest premature babies in the region. The experience is summarized as follows：\n\n【11】Body temperature management\n\n【12】Close cooperation with obstetrics and pediatrics medical staff， the temperature of the delivery room is 24 to 28 degrees， the radiant table is preheated， the umbilical cord ligation is delayed for 1 min after the baby is born， and then placed on the radiant table to keep warm， the child has weak breathing， provide rescue treatment such as tracheal intubation and intra tracheal application of pulmonary surfactant， which is the first step for the successful treatment of children. After entering the neonatology department，live in an advanced incubator， maintain a constant temperature and humidity， and a humidity of90% to avoid excessive weight loss， reduce insignificant water loss， and restore birth weight 10 days after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Respiratory management\n\n【14】Respiratory distress syndrome： The child's prenatal mother gave a course of adrenocortical hormone treatment to promote lung maturity. Prenatal application of adrenocortical hormone not only promotes lung maturity， but also accelerates the production of alveolar surfactant and reduces premature birth the incidence and severity of hyaline membrane disease in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. After birth， he was weak in spontaneous breathing and breathing like a wheeze. He was given tracheal intubation and preventive pulmonary surfactant treatment immediately. At the same time， the T combined resuscitator is used to assist breathing， which ensures that a certain end-expiratory pressure is maintained and prevents the open alveoli from collapsing again. After being transferred to the neonatology department， he was given mechanical ventilation and adopted a protective ventilation strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The child’s breathing was assessed in time， and mechanical ventilation was stopped 2 weeks after birth and changed to non-invasive ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Apnea： The chance of apnea in ultra-premature infants is very high. Caffeine citrate treatment is started on the second day after birth， which shortens the time of mechanical ventilation，reduces the number of apneas， and effectively protects brain cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nPreventionofbronchopulmonarydysplasia： Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is a major cause of death from EPI. We mainly evaluate breathing in time， adopt permissive hypercapnia strategies， constant volume mode， and minimize PIP and tidal air. In order to avoid the|删除段之间换行|occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia BPD)， early mechanical ventilation was stopped and changed to non-invasive ventilation. Oxygen was completely stopped at 31 weeks of gestational age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Nutritional support\n\n【18】Early micro-feeding： The child will start nasal micro-feeding 48h after birth， starting from 1 ml each time， once every 3 h， adding milk once every 2 to 3 days， adding 1 ml each time during the feeding process， there was no feeding intolerance such as gastric retention， vomiting，and abdominal distension. Early micro-feeding contributes to the integrity of the gastrointestinal tissue structure， improves the secretion and activity of digestive enzymes， and promotes the development and maturity of gastrointestinal motor function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Early breastfeeding： Premature babies choose breastfeeding first通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， and inform mothers and family members of the importance of breastfeeding. The mother is very cooperative and insists on delivering breast milk until discharged from the hospital. When breastfeeding volume reaches 80 ml/kg.d， add breast milk fortifier， start with half fortification， and give full fortification after 3 days. During the hospitalization of the child， vomiting， abdominal distension， gastro esophageal reflux， and necrotizing enterocolitis did not occur.Mother feeding can reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections， reduce the number of days， and reduce the cost of children with children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Parenteral nutrition： 24 h after birth， internal and parenteral nutrition is given amino acids via the umbilical vein to provide sufficient energy， reduce catabolism and prevent negative nitrogen balance. After 24 h， add fat milk， vitamins， trace elements and other intravenous nutrition to ensure the supply of liquid and calorie 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Monitor the baby’s weight， length， and head circumference. The growth process is smooth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， and all indicators are above the 10h percentile when discharged from the hospital.\n\n【21】Infection prevention and treatment： Prevention is the first， strict implementation of aseptic operation technical specifications， attention to hand hygiene， centralized operation，dedicated operation and care， prevention of cross-infection， rational use of antibiotics， and active control of infection.\n\n【22】Prevention of brain injury in premature infants： Brain injury is an important factor affecting the prognosis of the nervous system of EPI. How to reduce and avoid brain damage is a problem that everyone faces. After birth， the patient should minimize movement and irritation， and regularly perform bedside cranial ultrasound monitoring. Hemostatic drugs and a course of neurotrophic therapy were used prophylactically for 3 days after birth. Pay attention to maintaining vital signs and internal environment stability. After the condition is stable， give music therapy and touch premature infants， pay attention to nutritional support， and ensure the needs of brain development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Give kangaroo nursing and family participatory nursing， and teaches parents the methods and skills of nursing premature babies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. After active intervention， the NBNA score was normal after correction for age 2 months， and the hearing screening and brainstem auditory evoked potential were normal.\n\nPrevention of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)： Reasonable use of oxygen， the inhaled oxygen concentration is less than 30%， shorten the time of oxygen use as much as possible， and correct the gestational age of 31 weeks and have stopped oxygen. Corrected the gestational age from 32+4 weeks and the fundus were checked every 2weeks. After discharge， the ophthalmology clinic continued to follow|删除段之间换行|up，and there was no abnormality in the monitoring of the retina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Other aspects： Maintainfluiddbalance， prevent excessive fluid from causing arterial ducts to open， maintain blood sugar stability， phototherapy to reduce jaundice and prevent bilirubin encephalopathy， erythropoietin and iron agents prevent anemia in premature infants， research suggests that erythropoietin has brain protection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. At present， the development of vision， hearing， intelligence， and motor functions are normal， and there is no abnormality in head MRI.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Emergency coronary angiography excluded significant coronary artery obstruction and hence the tentative diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction with Non Obstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) was made. The following diagnostic work-up highlights the importance of a standardized approach to patients with MINOCA.\n\n【2】Keywords： Chest pain； Acute coronary syndrome； Coronary angiography； MR sequences\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】ECG： Electro Cardio Gram； IVS： Inter Ventricular Septum；IVUS： Intra Vascular Ultra Sound； LAD： Left Anterior Descending Artery；LVEDD： LV End Diastolic Diameter； MINOCA： Myocardial Infarction with Non Obstructive Coronary Arteries； MRI： Magnetic Resonance Imaging； OCT：Optical Coherence Tomography； RCA： Right Coronary Artery； STEMI： ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction\n\n【5】Learning Objectives\n\n【6】To understand the importance of a standardized approach to establish the diagnosis of MINOCA.\n\n【7】Tobe able to identify the different etiologies ofMINOCA and their respective management.\n\n【8】History of Presentation and Past Medical History\n\n【9】at\n\n【10】A 59-year-old female patient experienced a sudden episode of heavy chest pain after work， upon which she called the emergency ambulance service. Except for a history of cervical syndrome and chronic lower back pain， not requiring medication， the patient was previously fit and well. Upon arrival of the emergency physician a 12-channel ECG was recorded ， which showed atrial fibrillation with inferior and antero lateral ST-segment elevation (II， III， aVF & V4-V6) on top of hyper-acute T-waves in the antero lateral leads (V4-V6). Accordingly， the physician contacted our coronary care unit for emergency coronary catherization based on the tentative diagnosis of acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI). The patient was loaded with 250 mg of intravenous Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) and 60 mg of oral prasugrel. Additionally， 5000 IE of unfractionated heparin and 80 mg of atorvastatin were administered on site. The transport to our hospital byhelicopter was uneventful and according to protocol. The fulminant ST-segment changes in the initial ECG， however， were nolonger visible on follow-up ECG . Instead， inverted T-waves were recorded in leads V2-V5 without evidence of significant ischemia in the inferior leads.\n\n【11】Investigations\n\n【12】Emergency coronary angiography  (Videos 1-8) revealed non-significant coronary artery disease with 20% proximal Right Coronary Artery (RCA)stenosis and 10% distal Left Anterior Descending (LAD) stenosis after the origin of the second diagonal branch. Hence， excluding a type I myocardial infarction. Left ventriculography was unremarkable with preserved ejection fraction and no signs ofregional wall motion abnormalities or a Takotsubo-like pattern.\n\nThe findings of left ventriculography were confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography， which showed a virtually normal echocardiogram. The thickness of the Intra Ventricular Septum (IVS) was measured at 11 mm alongside a regular Left Ventricular End Diastolic Diameter|删除段之间换行|thesecond diagonal branch.

The only pathological findings were a left ventricular diastolic relaxation abnormality (E/A=0.81，E/e'=9.67) and a slightly enlarged left atrium(Left atrium =40 mm). Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed a structurally and functionally normal heart without evidence of fibrosis， edema or late gadolinium enhancement on T1- and T2-mapping. In-hospital ECG monitoring showed stable sinus rhythm without episodes of atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. The isolated episode of atrial fibrillation on admission had no recurrence and was hence interpreted within the scope of the acute myocardial event without a need for long-term oral anticoagulation. Ambulatory七twenty-four-hour electrocardiographic (Holter) monitoring confirmed normal sinus rhythm without any arrhythmic events.\n\n【14】Management\n\nThe case at hand presents a typical example of MINOCA of|删除段之间换行|unclassified origin. Significant coronary artery disease was excluded by emergency coronary angiography and extended non-invasive cardiac work-up revealed no signs ofsignificant cardiac disease. While an additional in vasive diagnostic work up is sometimes warranted，it is not always feasible. Upon recognition of non-significant coronary artery disease further diagnostics， including coronary imaging and acetylcholine provocation testing for vasospastic angina， had to be delayed due to the arrival of another acute STEMI. Repeat coronary angiography was denied by the patient for now. Hence， potential differential diagnosis includes vasospastic angina， coronary artery dissection， plaque rupture/erosion or thromboembolism. Upon3-months follow-up the patient was fine and free of symptoms\n\n【16】Discussion\n\nMINOCA is a growing entity in the differential diagnosis of acute chest pain. At present， it occurs in approximately 5% to 6%of cases with acute myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， there is a large variability in its reported prevalence (up to 15% in selected studies)， which may be attributed to the lack of a universal definition of the disease. The introduction of the Fourth Universal Definition of myocardial infarction finally offered specific diagnostic criteria|删除段之间换行|for MINOCA， which were revisited by a scientific statement paper from the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2019 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The three key diagnostic criteria for MINOCA include the presence of acute myocardial infarction (a rise and fall pattern of troponin and clinical evidence of ischemia)， non obstructive coronary arteries (including moderate coronary atherosclerotic stenosis of up to 50%) and the absence of an alternate diagnosis for the clinical presentation， such as sepsis， pulmonary embolism or myocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Coronary angiography is the main diagnostic tool in the initial workup of patients with chest pain and myocardial infarction. After exclusion of significant coronary artery stenosis， coronary vascular imaging and coronary function assessment should be performed. Intra Vascular Ultra Sound (IVUS) and Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) allow visualization of plaque disruption， coronary thrombi or emboli and coronary artery dissection. Provocation testing with intracoronary acetylcholine may help to facilitate the diagnosis of coronary vasospasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. While an acceptable level of safety has been reported recently for provocativetesting，significant arrhythmicevents occur in up to 6% of cases (including 3% ventricular arrhythmias) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. If coronary angiography remains inconclusive， left ventriculography should be performed to assess left ventricular function and look for wall motion abnormalities，resembling Takotsubo Syndrome or other cardiomyopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The following non-invasive diagnostic work-up should include echo cardio graphic assessment as well as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in most cases. While availability is still a concern in some regions，cardiac MRI has emerged as a key diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with MINOCA. Myocarditis and Takotsubo syndrome， which is rather its own entity than a part of MINOCA， are the most frequent conditions mimicking MINOCA and can be diagnosed by MRI based on specific late gadolinium enhancement patterns and imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Management of MINOCA is diverse and should be individualized based on the specific etiology， such as calcium channel blockers for vasospastic angina， antianginal therapies for micro vascular dysfunction， anticoagulation for coronary embolism and cardio protective therapy in accordance with current AMI guidelines for plaque disruptions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】MINOCA is an important differential diagnosis in the work-up of patients with acute myocardial infarction. A standardized diagnostic approach allows identification of a specific etiology with respective treatment in most cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Metastasis to the placenta is an uncommon finding in pregnant women， and there is only one reported case causing placental abruption， which involved a cancer of unknown primary. Triple-negative breast cancers tend to be more aggressive overall and have a worse prognosis.\n\n【2】Results： A 35-year-old Hispanic woman was diagnosed at 24 weeks gestation with widely metastatic triple-negative breast cancer to the lungs， liver， peritoneum， lymph nodes， and thoracic spine. Chemotherapy was subsequently started with carboplatin and paclitaxel. She was induced at 36weeks and had a placental abruption despite lacking significant risk factors. Pathology of the placenta revealed intervillous malignant cells consistent with the placental spread of cancer.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Breast cancer in pregnancy can be difficult to manage regarding therapy options and timing of therapy. Chemotherapy after the first trimester is relatively safe to mother and fetus. However， common agents like trastuzumab and tamoxifen are not recommended due to their teratogenic effects. Pregnancy itself does not increase the risk of mortality in breast cancer； however， diagnosis and treatment are delayed， and pregnant women are more commonly diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer compared to their non-pregnant counterparts. Although placental involvement of cancer is rare， it relays a poor prognosis， and any underlies the importance of placental micro examination in all women with known cancer.\n\n【4】Keywords： Metastasis； Chemotherapy； Breast cancer\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】org\n\n【7】One in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Unfortunately， the incidence of breast cancer in young women aged 24 to 35 is rising 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Women who are diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40 or less have a higher mortality rate in Hormone-Receptor (HR) positive breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Recent data suggests that annual screening in women beginning at age 40 has greater mortality reduction than current mammogram screening recommendations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This new screening recommendation has now been endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)， the American College of Radiologists (ACR)， the National Consortium of Breast Centers (NCBC)， the National Cancer Center Network (NCCN)， and the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI). Since the incidence of breast cancer in young women is increasing， and women are delaying childbearing until later in life， it is likely that breast cancer in pregnancy will become more common in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We describe a case of a 35-year-old woman who was diagnosed with aggressive， Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) at 24 weeks gestation， which metastasized to her placenta， causing placental abruption.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 35-year-old G3P2 Hispanic woman at 22 weeks and six days gestation presented to her obstetrician complaining of pain in her left breast and swelling in her axillary region for the past four days. Her physical examination revealed a large， firm and immobile mass of her left breast at the 1 o’clock region with associated lymphadenopathy of her left axilla along with areolar erythema and dimpling. The mass was confirmed by ultrasound， and a core biopsy revealed grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma. Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that the tumor was estrogen receptor， progesterone receptor， and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\n\n【10】(HER2) negative. Further analysis revealed a low tumor mutational burden and 0% programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Additional immunohistochemical information includes positive cytokeratin (CK)删除4:<u> 7</u>. A CT scan of her chest revealed a large breast mass with pulmonary and hepatic metastases， pericardial effusion， ascites， peritoneal implants， a T4 lytic bone lesion， as well as hilar， axillary， and mediastinal adenopathy. An endobronchial biopsy and cytology from her ascites fluid revealed malignant cells positive for CK7 and negative for GATA3， thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)， and ER. Shortly after， she began chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel. After three cycles of chemotherapy， repeat imaging showed a decrease in the size of her metastases. Chemotherapy was then held for her labor induction at 36 weeks and 0 days gestation. Prior to delivery， she began to have significant vaginal bleeding with worsening tachycardia and was diagnosed with placental abruption. She underwent amniotomy， and the infant was successfully delivered via forceps assisted vaginal delivery. Placental pathology revealed retroplacental hemorrhage consistent with abruption， as well as atypical intervillous cell clusters. These cells had a high mitotic rate and did not stain as trophoblastic. The cells stained positive for CK7and CK20 and were negative for GATA3， TTF-1， and ER. This was consistent with metastatic breast cancer to the placenta. The patient's health declined， and she elected comfort measures. She died shortly afterward.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Cancer during pregnancy is not a rare phenomenon and has a reported incidence ofapproximately 1 in 1，000 women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The most common cancers reported in pregnancy are breast cancer (incidence of 1 in 3，000)， followed by cervical cancer， Hodgkin's lymphoma， and melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Treatment of breast cancer in pregnancy can be a complicated decision as many common agents are teratogenic， especially older alkylating agents (e.g.， procarbazine， busulfan)， antimetabolite drugs (e.g.， aminopterin， methotrexate)， tamoxifen， and trastuzumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. The decision of when to initiate chemotherapy should be a mutual decision between the patient and physician after a thorough explanation of the risks and benefits. Teratogenic effects have been noted primarily in the first trimester， while administration of chemotherapy in the 2n and 3 trimester has been shown to have minimal fetal effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. While paclitaxel and carboplatin， the agents used in the above case， do not appear to increase fetal malformations， there have been reports of cytotoxic therapy causing growth restriction， death， prematurity， and myelosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The data is limited to small numbers of case reports.\n\n【13】Pregnancy itself does not appear to lead to increased mortality， although there is an average delay of 5 to 7 months in diagnosing breast cancer in pregnant women which leads to more advanced staging and worse outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. A 2007 case review revealed that65% to 90% ofpregnant women would present in stage II or stage III disease compared to 45% to 66% for non-pregnant women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\nMetastasis to the placenta is a rare occurrence. A 2003 case series showed 87 cases of placental and/or fetal metastasis between the years of 1866 and 2003 with the most common cancers being melanoma， breast， lung， leukemia， and lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Fetal metastasis is even more uncommon， with only 15 of the 87 cases involving the fetal transmission and nearly half of those cases secondary to melanoma. Placental metastasis indicates a poor prognosis for the mother， and fetal metastasis has a poor prognostic factor for the fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In most cases placental metastasis is limited to the intervillous space；|删除段之间换行|however， there are cases reporting the villous invasion of cancer， placing the fetus at risk for involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. There has only been one reported case of abruption from placental metastasis， which was from cancer of unknown primary associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our case， the patient lacked major risk factors for abruption， including smoking， hypertension， pre-eclampsia， alcohol use， cocaine use， trauma， thrombophilia， or previous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Although a slightly increased risk of abruption exists in women over 35 years old， the abnormal cells at the abruption site suggest aggressive cancer as the cause of abruption.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Ultimately， it is predicted that more women will be affected by malignancy in pregnancy. Although rare，there is a risk for metastatic involvement of the placenta that can affect both mother and fetus. Microscopic examination of the placenta is important in all cases of abruption， especially in the setting of women with known or prior cancer. Chemotherapy remains a suitable and relatively safe option in women after the 1 trimester. Breast complaints during pregnancy are common， but they should be thoroughly evaluated as there is a notable delay in diagnosis of breast cancer in pregnant women.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Over the past decades， the rate of CS has increased both in developing and developed countries. The WHO issued a disclosure in 1985， stating the CS regional rates must not exceed 10% to 15%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Nonetheless， China is one of the countries with the prevalence of CS averagely of 46.2% over the past decades that are higher than the recommended threshold. Coincidentally， this high prevalence of CS began during the implementation period of the one-child policy introduced in 1979 to reduce the then growing population in China. CS is considered safe under medical indications， but most women who had CS under the one-child policy opted for it without any medical indications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3\\]</u>. In 2015， the one-child policy was replaced with the universal two-child policy. This new policy has encouraged most couples to consider having a second child. As a result， it suddenly increased the number of pregnancies with an obstetrical history of previous CS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Hence， previous CS has become a new medical risk for clinicians in China.\n\nA study on previous CS and its association with adverse pregnancy outcomes has been studied extensively in other countries. However，literature on such studies in China is sparse， mainly due to|删除段之间换行|the one-child policy， which could not all ow for subsequent pregnancies that could be used to access previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. However， these previous studies' findings have been reported to be associated with some pregnancy complications通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>， but the results were inconsistent. Some studies have indicated previous CS to be associated with pregnancy complications such as pregnancy-induced hypertension disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>， placenta previa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-10\\]</u>， placenta abruption， placenta accreta/adhesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. In contrast， other studies showed that previous CS had no significant effect on placenta disorders such as placenta previa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，11\\]</u>， placenta abruption通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，9\\]</u> and placenta accrete 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Furthermore， other pregnancy complications are not well known to be associated with previous CS due to the limited number ofstudies on these outcomes. Few studies have reported an increased risk for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and polyhydramnios 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u> in pregnancy after CS when compared with vaginal delivery. Also， a previous study indicated high incidence of pregnant women with a previous CS diagnosed with fetal anomaly when compared with women with previous vaginal delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Studies conducted to support the hypothesis of previous CS association with GDM， polyhydramnios， and fetal anomaly remains sparse to the best of our knowledge. Given the limited evidence on the influence of previous CS on these pregnancy complications such as GDM， polyhydramnios and fetal anomaly and the inconsistencies in the association between previous CS and the placenta disorders shown in other studies， there is a need for research attention on these pregnancy complications to update clinicians and women on the risk associated with CS.\n\n【10】The implementation of the universal two-child policy provides an ideal situation to study previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. Therefore， this study examines previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications such as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus， polyhydramnios， fetal anomaly， Pregnancy Induced Hypertension(PIH)， placenta disorders (placenta previa， placenta abruptions and placenta accreta among women with singleton delivery in the second pregnancies.\n\n【11】Methods\n\n【12】Subject's section\n\n【13】This study used clinical data of 2018 women with singleton delivery in the second pregnancies delivered between January 2015and October 2017 at the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. These women were identified from the electronic medical records and enrolled in the study. The 2018 women were selected based on the following inclusion criteria： (i) women who had live delivery at ≥ 24 weeks gestation； (ii) had singleton delivery for both the first and this second pregnancy. Women were excluded if they do not meet the criteria above or； (i) women whose pregnancy were as a result of Artificial Reproductive Technology (ART)； (ii) women whose records had missing information on the previous mode of delivery， pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy as well as maternal characteristics of second pregnancies.\n\nClinical data on theeprevious delivery mode， maternal characteristics and the pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy were retrieved from the electronic medical records and further validated and maintained by our research team. Women with a singleton pregnancy with previous CS in the first pregnancy were categorized as the study group. In contrast， those with spontaneous vaginal delivery for the first pregnancy were categorized as the|删除段之间换行|reference group.\n\n【15】We obtained ethical approval for this study from the Xiangya School of Nursing and the Institutional Review Board from the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University， Hunan， China.\n\n【16】Definitions of variables\n\n【17】Maternal characteristics included demographic and obstetric information such as maternal age at second pregnancy， Body Mass Index (BMI)， which was obtained from the weight and height of the pregnant woman at the first prenatal booking and was calculated as (weight in kg)/(height in m)， the number of prenatal care visits2 4 (standard prenatal care according to doctor’s suggestion)， Interpregnancy Interval (IPI) was also defined as the interval of years between the first delivery and the second pregnancy， history of Terminations of Pregnancy (TOP) before this second pregnancy and preexisting medical conditions which were all diagnosed by an obstetrician (pre-pregnancy diabetes， chronic hypertension， angiocardiography， anemia， systemic lupus erythema， asthma， fibroid， ovarian and fallopian cyst， syphilis， hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism).The continuous yvariables of the maternal characteristics were further sub-grouped into categories.\n\n【18】The pregnancy complications for this study are defined as disorders or diseases that occur during the second pregnancy period. Hence the pregnancy complications that obstetricians diagnosed were selected for this study and included Gestational Diabetes Mellitus{(GDM)， Polyhydramnios，Fetalanomaly， Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH)， Placenta Previa， Placenta abruption， Placenta accreta. Gestational Diabetes Mellitus GDM was diagnosed using a 2-h， 75 g oral glucose tolerance test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Polyhydramnios was defined as an abnormally sizeable amniotic fluid of 24 cm or greater during pregnancy and diagnosed through ultrasound examination通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The fetal anomaly was defined as a delivery defect or congenital malformation during the intrauterine life and can be identified prenatally or at delivery (WHO). Pregnancy Induced Hypertension(PIH) was defined as diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg on two occasions， four hours apart or a single reading of >110 mmHg from20 weeks gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Placenta previa is an implantation of the placenta over or near the internal opening of the cervix. Placental abruption is the premature separation of a usually implanted placenta from the uterus， and placenta accrete refer to the clinically apparent morbidly adherent placenta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The study's covariates included significant maternal characteristics and the possible pregnancy complications (in the second pregnancy) known in the published literature as risk factors of the pregnancy complications in this study (potential confounders). For significant maternal characteristics that were used as covariates， we excluded pre-pregnancy diabetes and chronic hypertension when analyzing for GDM and PIH， respectively. We considered potential risk factors for the following： GDM (PIH通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>)， polyhydramnios (fetal anomaly通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>) and PIH (placenta disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>).\n\n【20】Statistical analyses\n\nThe maternal characteristics were described and summarized by frequencies and percentages. Chi-square and Fisher's exact test was used to compare the groups. Probability values of <0.05were considered statistically significant. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression to ascertain the influence of previous CS on pregnancy complications. The influence of the covariates was analyzed. First， maternal age， Body Mass Index (BMI) at booking，|删除段之间换行|history of pregnancy termination， and significant preexisting medical condition (diabetes， chronic hypertension， asthma， fibroid， ovarian and fallopian cyst) were added as covariates. For the covariates of GDM and PIH， we excluded pre-pregnancy diabetes and chronic hypertension， respectively. Then potential risk factors for GDM(placenta disorders， PIH)， polyhydramnios (fetal anomaly， GDM) and PIH (placenta disorders， GDM) were further analyzed. We presented the logistic regression results as crude and adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). The data was analyzed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp.，Armonk，NY，USA).\n\n【22】Maternal characteristics\n\n【23】Amongthe 2018 eligible women with singleton second pregnancy，942(46.7%) had experienced one previous CS， while the remaining1076 (53.3%)had one previous vaginal delivery.\n\n【24】Women with previous CS were older and had advanced age (≥35years) than women withprevious vaginal delivery. Those with previous CS had a higher BMI>25.0kg/m'and a longer IPI (5years and above) than those with previous vaginal delivery. Both women with previous CS and previous vaginal delivery had the recommended number of prenatal visits 2 4 visits. The history of pregnancy termination was slightly higher among those with previous CS than those with previous vaginal delivery. Furthermore， women with previous CS had a higher rate of preexisting medical diseases such as diabetes， hypertension， asthma， fibroid， cyst of the ovary and fallopian tube than those with previous vaginal delivery .\n\n【25】Analysis of previous CS on pregnancy complications\n\n【26】Regarding the pregnancy complications， women with previous CS had a significantly higher rate of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus， fetal anomaly and placenta previa when compared with those with previous vaginal delivery. When these pregnancy complications were analyzed using the univariate binary logistic regression (odd crude ratio)， they were all associated with previous CS .\n\n【27】After the multivariate logistic regression (adjustment for the covariates， which include significant maternal characteristics and potential risk factors)， there was an association between previous CS with GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa. Comparing the adjusted odds ratio of the pregnancy complications among women with previous CS and previous vaginal delivery (reference group)， women with previous CS were 1.44 times more likely to have GDM(95%CI， 1.09-1.89) and 14.26 times more likely to have fetal anomaly(95%CI， 4.21-48.25). Furthermore， women with previous CS were2.89 times more likely tohave placenta previa (95% CI，1.62-5.15)than those with previous vaginal delivery. In contrast， polyhydramnios， pregnancy-induced hypertension， placenta abruption and placenta accreta were the pregnancy complications that were not associated with previous CS compared with previous vaginal delivery in our study .\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】This study examined previous CS’s influence on pregnancy complications among women having their second pregnancy under the Chinese two-child policy's implementation. The main findings of this study indicated that GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa are the pregnancy complications associated with previous CS independent of maternal age， BMI at admission， IPI， history of termination of pregnancy， significant preexisting medical conditions\n\n【30】Table 1： Maternal characteristics of women with second pregnancies by the first previous mode of delivery in Hunan， China.\n\n| Previous Mode of delivery， n(%)  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Maternal characteristics  | Previous vaginaldelivery n= 1076  | Previous CSn=942  | P value  |\n| Age， (years)  |  |  |  |\n| <35  | 716(66.5)  | 447(47.5)  | <0.001  |\n| 235  | 360(33.5)  | 495(52.5)  | <0.001  |\n| BMI on admission (kg/m?)  |  |  |  |\n| <18.5  | 1(0.1)  | 1(0.11)  | <0.001  |\n| 18.5-24.9  | 359(33.4)  | 198(21.0)  | <0.001  |\n| 25.0-29.9  | 606(56.3)  | 558(59.2)  | <0.001  |\n| 230  | 110(10.2)  | 185(19.6)  | <0.001  |\n| IPl (years)  |  |  |  |\n| \\>2  | 365(33.9)  | 149(15.8)  | <0.001  |\n| 2-4  | 262(24.3)  | 217(23.0)  | <0.001  |\n| 25  | 449(41.7)  | 578(61.1)  | <0.001  |\n| Prenatal care visit ≥ 4  | 938(87.2)  | 796(84.5)  | 0.085  |\n| History of termination of pregnancy  | 625(58.1)  | 625(66.4)  | <.001  |\n| Preexisting medical conditions  |  |  |  |\n| Pre-gestational Diabetes  | 21(2.0)  | 44(4.7)  | 0.001  |\n| Chronic Hypertension  | 8(0.7)  | 19(2.0)  | 0.013  |\n| Angiocardioparthy  | 68(6.3)  | 54(5.7)  | 0.581  |\n| Anaemia  | 52(4.8)  | 43(4.6)  | 0.777  |\n| Systemic lupus erythema  | 4(0.4)  | 9(1.0)  | 0.941  |\n| Asthma  | 13(1.2)  | 23(2.4)  | 0.037  |\n| Fibroid  | 22(2.0)  | 35(3.7)  | 0.024  |\n| Fallopian and ovarian cyst  | 11(1.0)  | 39(4.1)  | <0.001  |\n| Syphilis  | 3(0.3)  | 10(1.1)  | 0.47  |\n| Hypothyroidism  | 21(2.0)  | 15(1.6)  | 0.543  |\n| Hyperthyroidism  | 16(1.5)  | 12(1.3)  | 0.683  |\n\n【32】BMI： Body Mass Index； IPI： Interpregnancy Interval\n\n【33】and potential risk factors (pregnancy complications in the second pregnancy that are confounders) for the pregnancy complications in this study.\n\n【34】This paper has shown that previous CS is associated with increased risk of GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa but not polyhydramnios， PIH， placenta abruption， and placenta accreta. To our knowledge， this is the first study to support the hypothesis of previous CS's influence with GDM and also the first recent study to show an association between previous CS and fetal anomaly.\n\nPregnant women with previous CS were 1.44 times at high risk of GDM. The results of Hu’s study also presented this relationship 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， although there is an unknown exact biological relationship between previous CS and GDM. Nonetheless， there has been speculation that inefficient placenta function due to abnormal trophoblastic invasion that may occur due to the uterine changes induced by prior CS can interfere with uteroplacental blood flow leading to subsequent gestational complications， including GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Furthermore， a normal placenta's buffer action against hyperglycemia in the mother通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> may impede due to placenta insufficiency as a result of placenta abnormalities associated with previous CS. Therefore， this may cause GDM in pregnancy.

This placenta insufficiency may result in hyperglycemia in the maternal circulation that may contribute to GDM. GDM in previous pregnancy can be recurrent in the subsequent pregnancy. However， a study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> indicated that recurrent GDM in previous pregnancy does not significantly reduce previous CS’s influence on GDM. Also， advanced maternal age and overweight or obesity is identified as risk factors for gestational diabetes mellitus. Although most of the women with previous CS were of advanced maternal age and were overweight， we adjusted for these confounders. Nevertheless， there remained an association between previous CS and GDM. However， further studies elucidating the current findings on the relationship between previous CS and GDM and the possible biological and physiological relationship need to be appraised.\n\nFurthermore， previous CS showed a significant impact on the fetal anomaly in our study. To our knowledge， this is the first recent study that shows the association between previous CS and fetal anomaly. These findings of this study， might be due to the increased risk of placenta disorders associated with previous CS， which can predispose the women to placenta insufficiencythat may affect the fetus s normal development leading to increased risk for fetal anomaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26，27\\]</u>. It could also be speculated that the risk of fetal anomaly may be due to the uterine cavity changes induced by a uterine scar from previous CS， which can alter the uterus s anatomy that predisposes women to have|删除段之间换行|a fetal anomaly. Although advanced maternal age， pre-gestational diabetes， and chronic hypertension are considered high-risk fetal anomaly factors， there remained a higher risk for fetal anomaly associated with previous CS when adjusted for our studies. However， most of the pregnancies with fetal anomaly were terminated at the first or second trimester， which may not represent the exact number of women with a fetal anomaly. Therefore， more studies focusing on the association between previous CS and fetal anomaly need to be conducted in the future.\n\nAmong the placenta disorders， only placenta previa has an association with previous CS in our study. Previous CS was associated with an increased risk of placenta previa with an adjusted Odds Ratio(ORs) of 2.89， higher than some previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，28，29\\]</u>. These previous studies have indicated the association between previous CS and placenta previa， but the Odd Ratios (ORs) were lesser than our study. However， parity and multiple gestations，considered to increase the risk of placenta previa in a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>， were excluded from our study. Furthermore， when adjusted for the covariates(significant maternal characteristics)， which were also considered potential confounders to placenta previa in previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28，31\\]</u>， it remained a higher risk. This higher Odd Ratio (OR) may be due to the study conducted with data from a tertiary hospital where women with high-risk pregnancies such as placenta previa are referred to. Currently， the exact cause of placenta previa is unknown. However， placenta previa is hypothesized to be related to a failure of apparent placental migration， impaired differential growth of the lower uterine|删除段之间换行|segment， and deficient decidua basalis in the presence of previous surgery injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，32\\]</u>.\n\n【47】However，polyhydramnios was not associated with previous CS in our study； this is in variance with previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. The difference might be attributed to the small number of pregnant women with polyhydramnios in our study， which contributed to a small effect size that did not associate previous CS and polyhydramnios. This is supported by the wide Confidence Interval (CI) observed in its Odds Ratio (OR). Furthermore， among the placenta disorders associated with previous CS in the previous studies， placenta abruption and placenta accreta did not show any association with previous CS. This finding is in variance with other previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，8-10\\]</u>. An observation of no increased risk between previous CS and Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH) existed in our study. This may be due to a smaller number of women with PIH in our study which could not predict the association.\n\n【48】Our study also confirms the high CS rate of 46.7% in the first delivery as the previous CS. This finding is congruent with the WHO study， which indicated China to be the country with the highest CS rate of 46.2% among the 24 Asian countries. This present study is one of the few studies conducted after the two-child policy that examines previous CS's influence on pregnancy complications. This study also adjusted for several confounding factors that could have influenced our result. The study was conductedthree years after implementing the two-child policy that accurately represents pregnancy complications among women with a second pregnancy.\n\n【49】The present study also had some limitations， primarily due to the retrospective nature of the design. Firstly， misclassification of the pregnancy complications may exist just as other administrative databases， which can lead to bias， but this may have occurred randomly and therefore could have the tendency of reducing the bias that could have occurred in this stuidy.\n\n【50】Secondly， some details of information on the first pregnancy， such as the pregnancy outcomes and indications for previous CS， were not present due to the transitioning from paper medical records entry to electronic medical records. Information regarding their first pregnancy， which happened very long ago， was not captured. There can be a reduction of bias from lack of indication for the previous CS since most women during the one-child policy had CS without any medical reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3\\]</u>. Also， some women did not have their first child at our hospital； hence the available details ofthe first pregnancy were obtained from maternal self-report， of which there could be a P presence of recall bias.\n\n【51】Thirdly， the BMI used for the study was BMI at admission for delivery， which may not represent the exact BMI since the fetus’s weight could have influenced maternal BMI at admission. Lastly， there could be selection bias since most women who had obstetric complications in their first pregnancy might opt for a tertiary hospital or be referred to a tertiary hospital to seek medical help during their subsequent pregnancy.\n\n【52】Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion， our study revealed the association of previous first CS with pregnancy complications such as GDM， fetal anomaly and placenta previa on singleton pregnancy among women having their second child under the universal two-child policy. Hence， this study provides the needed information for obstetricians， nurses|删除段之间换行|and midwives to acquaint themselves with knowledge pertaining to pregnancy complications and provides intensive management and follow-ups of women with previous CS to ensure a healthy mother and baby throughout the pregnancy and delivery periods. Such information obtained from this study could help the decision-making process regarding CS for the health care providers and expectant mothers alike， mainly when there are no clear medical indications for CS.\n\n【54】Data Availability\n\n【55】The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

We hypothesized that a shortened course of antibiotics would not lead to adverse outcomes in patients who underwent surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis as compared to a longer course.\n\n【2】Methods： This is a retrospective analysis of 940 patients admitted to a tertiary urban hospital. We included adult patients who underwent appendicectomy for acute， uncomplicated appen dicitis and who had medical records available from at least one follow-up outpatient visit. We excluded patients who were found to have perforated appendicitis intra operatively， as well as those who had other intra-abdominal infections that may have required treatment.\n\n【3】Patients were divided into two groups： those who received 24 h or less of antibiotics (intravenous and oral)， and those who received more than this. Outcomes were then compared between the two groups. The primary outcome was rate of intra-abdominal collection， while secondary outcomes were rates of surgical site infection， re-admission to hospital for infectious issues and antibiotic complications.\n\n【4】Results and Conclusion： We found no statistically significant difference in the rate of intra-abdominal collection， or of any of the secondary outcomes between the two groups. Our data suggests that patients who have undergone appendicectomy for uncomplicated antibiotics should not receive a prolonged course of antibiotics as a routine unless other indications are present.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Acute appendicitis is one of the most common diseases faced by general surgeons today， with an estimated annual incidence of 10 per 100，000 populations . The gold standard treatment of appendicitis has traditionally been surgery， although recent studies have called this into question通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The laparoscopic approach has become widely accepted in many parts of the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>， which has led to significant changes in the rate and complications encountered after surgery.\n\n【7】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\nIt is well known that laparoscopic surgery results in alower wound infection rate than open， at the expense of an increased risk ofintra-abdominal collections. The WSES Jerusalem guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> advise against prolonging the duration of postoperative antibiotics beyond three to five days even in cases of complicated appendicitis once adequate source control is achieved. Given that most (75%to 87%) patients have non-perforated appendicitis， we hypothesized that most patients who have undergone surgery do not need a prolonged course of antibiotics|删除段之间换行|Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) is a busy urban hospital in Singapore with one of the highest numbers of emergency admissions daily. We perform over 450 appendicectomies for adults yearly， and there has been a switch from the open to the laparoscopic approach over the past 15 years. The absence of an acute care team means this surgical load is evenly distributed throughout the department，and hence some differences in clinical practice (such as antibiotic choice and duration) were present. We therefore set out to compare the outcomes of patients receiving a shorter couSe(24 h or less) of antibiotics against those who received a longer course.\n\n【9】Methodology\n\n【10】This is a retrospective study using available medical records for patients undergoing appendicectomy (both laparoscopic and open) for non-perforated appendicitis.

These records were reviewed，and patients who were found to have perforated appendicitis or abscess formation intraoperatively were excluded. Out of a total of 2，247 appendicectomies performed，1，228 patients' records were screened and a further 288 patients who had defaulted their follow-up appointments were excluded as data on outcomes was not available.\n\n【13】Variables and Outcomes\n\n【14】The remaining patients were then divided into two groups， one which received 24 h or less of antibiotics (n=673 patients) and those who received a longer course (n=267 patients). This cut off was based on the WSES Jerusalem guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. For the purposes of this study， both intravenous and oral antibiotics were considered to be equivalent.\n\nThe primary outcome was the rate of development of intra-abdominal abscess， while secondary outcomes were superficial|删除段之间换行|surgical site infections， side effects from antibiotic usage and hospital re-admission rates for any related issues. Rates of intra-abdominal abscess， readmission rate and antibiotic complication rates were compared between the two groups using Fisher’s Exact Test while superficial surgical site infection rate was compared using the Chi-Squared Test. All statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics v删除4-1:<u>26</u>.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】A total of 940 patients were analyzed， and they were divided into2 groups those who received 24 h or less of antibiotics while the other group received a longer course than 24 h. The demographics of the patient cohort are shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. As expected， the majority of the patients were young with a median age of 33 and 37 years in both groups. While a difference in age was observed between the groups， we feel this is unlikely to have any clinical significance particularlyon patient outcomes.\n\n【18】While patients found to have perforation intra operatively were excluded from our study， a small number of patients were thought to have non perforated appendicitis whose histology returned as perforation. As Table 1 shows， a higher proportion of patients in the>24 hantibiotic group were foundtohave perforation comparedto the<24 h group (7.2% vs. 3.7%). These patients were therefore excluded from the subsequent statistical analysis to avoid contamination of the results.\n\n【19】On comparing the outcomes， we found the rate of intra-abdominal abscess formation was higher in the longer antibiotic group， despite it not reaching statistical significance in our study. On univariate analysis， patients who received >24 h of antibiotics were found to be more likely to be readmitted (p=0.036) although this difference disappeared on multivariate analysis. There was no difference between the two groups in the other secondary outcomes studied .\n\n| Outcomes  | Patients who had received 24 hours or less ofpostoperative antibiotic therapy (n=673)  |  | Patients who received more than 24 hours ofpostoperative antibiotics (n=267)  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Intra-abdominal abscesS  | 6  | 0.89%  | 7  |  | 2.62%  |\n| Readmission for re-infection  | 4  | 0.59%  | 6  |  | 2.25%  |\n| Superficial Surgical Site Infection  | 12  | 1.78%  | 6  |  | 2.25%  |\n| Histology showing perforation  | 24  | 3.56%  | 18  |  | 6.74%  |\n| Side effects of antibiotics  | Total：1  | 0.14%  | Total：2  |  | 0.74%  |\n|  | \\-Diarrhoea： 1  |  | \\-Diarrhoea： 1  |  | 0.37%  |\n|  |  |  | \\-Oral thrush： 1  |  | 0.37%  |\n\n【21】\\-Oral thrush： 1 0.37%\n\n| Table 3： Primary outcomes.  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | ≤24 h antibiotics(n=673)  | \\>24 h antibiotics(n=267)  | p-value  | OR (95%CI)  |  |\n| Intra-abdominal Abscess  | 6  | 7  | 0.059  | 2.993(0.996-8.990)  |  |\n| Superficial surgical site infection  | 12  | 6  | 0.64  | 1.266(0.470-3.409)  |  |\n| Hospital re-admission  | 4  | 6  | 0.036  | 3.845(1.076-13.735)  |  |\n| Antibiotics complication  | 1  | 2  | 0.196  | 5.072 (0.458-56.167)  |  |\n\n【23】Our results therefore suggest that in patients without frank intraoperative evidence of perforation or gangrene， a longer course of post-operative antibiotics did not lead to a higher rate of complications and potentially could have contributed to additional morbidity.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Our results， while counter intuitive to historical surgical pedagogy， do fit with the findings of several previous groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. This finding is significant because the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> recently released a report advocating for the restriction of antibiotic use to rein in antibiotic resistance. Given that appendicitis is one of the most common diseases treated by general surgeons， it is crucial to restrict antibiotics to the patients who require it. This would help slow the proliferation of microbial resistance to antibiotics while also avoiding unnecessary complications from antibiotic use.\n\n【26】Like previous authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， we found a number of patients who had surgical notes indicating no perforation (hence included in our study) although their histological reports showed perforation. This could be from recording errors (the surgeon typing the note wrongly recorded or left out perforation) or from specimen handling during transfer to the pathologist. Regardless， clinical decision making on antibiotic duration would have been based on the recorded finding in most cases， and our initial data shows that these patients did not suffer from a higher rate of infective complications (though these patients were later excluded in the final analysis).\n\n【27】Interestingly， the results we had showed a trend towards a higher odds ratio of complications in patients given more than 24 h of antibiotics. None were statistically significant except for the rates of readmission i.e.， patients who were given more antibiotics having a higher rate of readmissions. Some possible reasons for this include these patients being more ill and/or having baseline poorer co-morbidities to begin with， which then predisposed them to a negative outcome (For example， patients on immunosuppression， history of diabetes etc)， and developing complications in spite of being given more antibiotics.\n\nOur study was retrospective and from a single institution， so care should be taken when generalizing to other settings. It is also possible|删除段之间换行|that other factors played a role in the managing clinician deciding to give alonger course of antibiotics， and this might not have been picked up. Even so， the lack of a difference in patient outcomes between both groups is reassuring and will hopefully lead to a change in future practice patterns. Given current evidence， it is difficult to envision prospective studies in this setting as it would not be ethical to give patients antibiotics when they have been shown to be unnecessary.\n\n【29】In summary， we advocate stopping antibiotics within 24 h post-surgery for patients who have uncomplicated appendicitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

There is no vaccine or therapeutic proven options to prevent COVID-19 infection. It has been speculated that some immunomodulating drugs may have an effect on the progression of this infection. It is reasonable that colchicine may be tested in the context of COVID-19 to detect its immunomodulatory effects which may prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome. We discussed a case with COVID-19pneumonia using colchicine successfully treated and reviewed the literature.\n\n【2】Keywords： COVID-19； Colchicine； Pneumonia； LDH\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】WBC： White Blood Cell； C-RP： C-Reactive Protein； LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase； BUN：Blood Urea Nitrogen； sCr： serum Creatinine； ALT： Alanine Aminotransferase； AST： Aspartate Aminotransferase\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) by named the World Health Organization is a newly emerged disease that has become a global public health challenge. The search for drugs against COVID-19 is continuing. This new viral infection characterized by dry cough， fever， dyspnea， fatigue， and lymphopenia， which can be complicated by interstitial pneumonia leading to severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) which results from an unmodulated inflammatory response and leads to death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Because specific drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been revealed. Currently several potential drugs are used for COVID-19 patients； however， none of the therapies have been proven to be completely effective. Antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 and immunosuppressive treatment have to continue concomitantly for preserve vital organ functions. Immunomodulating drugs such as hydroxychloroquine， chloroquine， tocilizumab (an anti-interleukin-6 receptor antibody)， are widely used in different stages of the disease since high uncontrolled inflammation is responsible for deaths \\[3-71.\n\n【8】Colchicine is utilized for the treatment of gout， Behcet’s Disease， and also for prevention of pericarditis and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Colchicine disrupts the microtubule formation and reduces chemotaxis， phagocytosis， and migration of neutrophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore， it is reasonable that colchicine may be tested in the context of COVID-19 to detect its immunomodulatory effects which may prevent Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).\n\n【9】At the present time， several randomized studies regarding colchicine in COVID-19 patients have been announced. Nevertheless there are opposite opinions claim that colchicine doesn't prevent ARDS moreover may be harmful for patients with COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case， we report a patient who has been under colchicine treatment for three years and diagnosed COVID-19pneumonia and recovered without any complications associated with COVID-19 infection.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 38 years， Caucasian， old female patient admitted to emergency unit complaining of cough and fever for 2 days. The patient is a nurse and she has been active working in hospital. She had been diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis and been using colchicine 1 mg/day for three years.\n\n【12】On admission， the patient had cough， and her vital signs were as follows： Arterial blood\n\n【13】Table 1： Clinical laboratory results.\n\n| Parameters  | 1\\t day  | 3dday  | 6th day  | gth day  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| WBC (10/uL)  | 7.13  | 5  | 6.52  | 7.22  |\n| Lymphocyte (10\\/uL)  | 1.5  | 1.72  | 2.07  | 2.03  |\n| Neutrophil (10/uL)  | 5.12  | 2.97  | 3.84  | 4.4  |\n| Hemoglobine (g/dL)  | 12.5  | 10.6  | 11.1  | 10.9  |\n| Platelets (10/uL)  | 226  | 178  | 225  | 229  |\n| C-RP(mg/dL)  | 0.2  | 0.2  | 2.2  | 0.6  |\n| Procalcitonin (ng/mL)  | <0.05  | <0.05  | <0.05  | <0.05  |\n| D-Dimer (ng/mL)  | 388.71  | 778.9  | 571  | 455  |\n| Ferritin (ng/mL)  | 39.29  | 89.9  | 95  | 97  |\n| Fibrinogen (mg/dL)  | 334  | 336  | 405  | 473  |\n| LDH (U/L)  | 135  | 138  | 224  | 152  |\n| BUN (mg/dL)  | 19.26  | 12.8  | 10.7  | 19  |\n| sCr (mg/dL)  | 0.66  | 0.58  | 0.54  | 0.62  |\n| AST (u/L)  | 21  | 19  | 87  | 37  |\n| ALT(wL)  | 16  | 14  | 89  | 24  |\n| Albumin (g/L)  | 42  | 36  | 37  | 38  |\n| Troponinl (ng/mL)  | 0.001  | 0.003  | 0.001  | 门  |\n\n【15】pressure， 100/70 mmHg， heart rate， 73 beats/min； body temperature，37.3°C； respiratory rate， 20 breaths/min and oxygen saturations of99% on room air. Physical examination was unremarkable. Chest CT(Computer Tomography) scan revealed ground-glass opacification at lower lobes oflungs. COVID-19 was confirmed by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Laboratory findings revealed white blood cell count7.13×10/uL，lymphocyte 1.5×10°u/L，c-reactive protein (C-RP) 0.2mg/dL and procalcitonine<0.05 ng/mL. D-dimerlevel was 388.71 ng/mL， and ferritin was detected 39.29 ng/mL， Fibrinogen was 348 mg/dL， while lactate dehydrogenase level was 135 U/L on admission. The laboratory findings are given in Table 1 during the patients follow-up in the hospital. Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day， azithromycin 250mg/day， enoxaparin 4000 units per day were started for COVID-19pneumonia. Colchicine therapy was maintained unchanged. On the4 day of her hospitalization CT scan showed progression， although her vital parameters were stable. Favipiravir treatment 1200 mg per day was started. Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin ended up in 5 days. Enoxaparin dosage was raised up to 8000 units per day. After completing five days of favipiravir therapy as her clinical and laboratory findings were stable， she was discharged from the hospital.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\nColchicine has been approved for gout， Behcet’s Disease and familial Mediterranean fever. Colchicine is a lipid-soluble alkaloid which within 24 h to 72 h of oral administration accumulates in granulocytes and monocytes. Colchicine reaches much higher concentrations within leukocytes than in plasma and persists there for several days after ingestion. In recent years， colchicine has attracted attention in the management of cardiovascular diseases by suppressing their inflammatory component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Its mechanism of action is thought to be the potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization and microtubule generation and，possibly， effects on cellular adhesion molecules， inflammatory chemokines， and the inflammasome. Colchicine may inhibit activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and additionally may inhibit directly the synthesis of TNF-a，IL-1B，and IL-6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，7\\]</u>. Colchicine is an antimitotic substance that blocks cell|删除段之间换行|division during metaphase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Also， COVID-19 enters the cell using the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme2(ACE2) as a host receptor and causes infection. Especially， in low cytosolic pH the virus increases its entry into the cell by penetrating to ACE2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Although colchicine is known to play an important role in intracellular protein traffic and has poor binding to microtubules at alkaline pH， its effect on the penetration of the virus into the ACE2 receptor is controversial通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，9\\]</u>. All these compounds enhance the inflammatory process and are responsible for alveolar damage， interstitial infiltration， and ARDS. Therefore some authors suggest that colchicine may decrease the tissue damage in COVID-19 pneumonia by these pathways and can be used in patients with increased risk of ARDS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】However， it has been suggested that colchicine may be effective in COVID-19 infection and reduce cytokine storm seen during the COVID-19 infection. Cumhur et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> disagree with this suggestion and claim that since colchicine does not decrease intracellular pH enough， there will be a high viral load leads to more severe cytokine storms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In addition toxic doses of colchicine affect alveolar type II pneumocytes， inhibiting the release of surfactants and causing ARDS and also toxic doses leads to DIC and multiorgan failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. So that the colchicine treatment in COVID-19 pneumonia may increase the risk of ARDS and DIC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】A trial has been done in Israel with patients under treatment of hydroxychloroquine or colchicine and COVID-19 test was performed. There was no significant difference between the groups found positive and negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Also there are several trials investigating the efficacy of conventional therapeutic doses of colchicine have been registered for the treatment of COVID-19 (NCT04322682，NCT04328480， NCT043267901.\n\n【20】In this case we report a patient under treatment of colchicine because of rheumatoid arthritis for three years and diagnosed COVID-19 pneumonia. In our case， severe complication of pneumonia like ARDS was not observed. We think that this result may be related to early detection of pneumonia and early antiviral therapy. It is interesting in that it has been shown that colchicine does not prevent the development of COVID-19 pneumonia， even if this specific case. Patient was a nurse and she was in the high-risk group for the infection so just by this case we cannot reach a definite conclusion for general population. More data's and results of the ongoing trials are awaited to decide whether colchicine will take place in therapeutic protocols for COVID-19 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Japan is likewise aging more rapidly than any other country， the percentage of the population aged 65 and over reached 23% in 2009， the highest in the world. Furthermore， by2030， one in three people will be 65 or older，and one in five will be 75 or older 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Deterioration in physical and cognitive health with aging increases the risk of developing disability in older adults. Older adults remain at great risk for cognitive decline and， as a result， for increasingly poor quality of life. As for those reasons， previous studies have shown that (a) a decline in information-processing speed， (b) failure to engage in elaborative processing， (c) deficits in various types of problem-solving ability，(d) decrease in working memory capacity， and (e) lack of controllability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-8\\]</u>. Suzuki et al. developed an intervention program in the form of a dual task in which physical exercise and cognitive tasks are performed simultaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Dual tasks require executive functions that are particularly important for Activities of Daily Living (ADL).

Cultural activities include daily events for enjoyment， entertainment， recreation， or social contribution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Participation in cultural activities can be“passive\" or \"active，\" interestingly， active cultural participation has been shown to be more effective|删除段之间换行|in cognitive function than passive participation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In recent years， theatrical approaches have been reported to improve the health and cognitive function of older adults through active cultural participation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u>. However， most of the studies reported to date have focused on cognitive function. Theatrical approaches may have a positive impact on physical and social function because they promote rich experiences and interaction among participants. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of a theater program intervention on the cognitive， physical， and social functions of older adults living in the community.\n\n【20】Materials and Methods\n\n【21】Participants\n\n【22】Participants were recruited in Akita prefecture， Japan. Our study was performed from June to October删除4:<u> 2022</u>. The participants aged 65years old or over， had the ability to walk independently and living at home without personal assistance. The exclusion criteria were dementia， major depression， severe hearing or a visual impairment， stroke，Parkinson's disease， another neurological disease， intellectual disability， need for support of care as certified by the Japanese public long-term care insurance system due to disability， and inability to complete cognitive tests at the baseline assessment. The demographic data comprised age，gender，education， and health variables including Body Mass Index (BMI) \\[kg/m²\\].\n\n【23】Intervention\n\n【24】Of the 43 participants who gave informed consent， they were assigned to the control group and theatre intervention group. Each group also received a 90-minute program once every two weeks for three months.\n\n【25】Multicomponent exercise program for the control group\n\n【26】As previouslyreported通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>，amulticomponent exercise interventionWasperformed1。where cognitiveetrainingWas incorporated into the sessions combined with resistance and aerobic training. The control group was conducted by health and fitness instructors or trained care workers. The content of the program is to maintain and improve ADLs and lead to preventive care for the elderly. Each session included as follows； first， started with bending exercises such as per and lower limb stretching. After that， physical training was 10 min of aerobic exercises with cognitive stimulation and 20 min of resistance exercises with cognitive stimulation. The therapist adjusted the level of aerobic exercise and resistance exercises according to each participant's ability， and the participant rested when needed. The cognitive exercises included dual-task training.\n\n【27】Theatre intervention group\n\n【28】The theatrical intervention consisted of a basic program and an application program， and was conducted by longtime theater professionals and teaching staff. The basic program consisted of stretching， aerobic exercise， and vocal and emotional expression exercises for 30 min. Emotional expression exercises involved rhythmically imitating the words and emotions (anger，joy， sadness， etc.) of the instructional staff . The application program included chorus practice， dance， and dialogue practice based on a script created by the participants. The theatre script was produced by the Warabiza， but the lyrics to the theme song were written by the participants themselves . In addition， participants prepared their own costumes and props to be used in the play.\n\n【29】Assessment and outcome\n\n【30】We evaluated a physical performance consisting of grip strength(kg) and usual walking speed (m/s). Four cognitive subtests of the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology Functional Assessment Tool (NCGG-FAT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> were also assessed for each participant. Cognitive subtests are indicated as follow；\n\n【31】Components of NCGG-FAT\n\n【32】The computerized multidimensional neurocognitive test was performed on an iPad (Apple， Cupertino， CA， USA) with a 9.7-inch touch display. The task instructions were presented with aletter size of at least 1.0×1.0 cm’on the display. For this study， a trained operator supported each participant by setting up the tablet PC and running each test. Participants completed the NCGG-FAT subtests as follows.\n\n【33】Tablet Version of Word Recognition (WR)： This test is comprised of two computerized tasks of immediate recognition and delayed recall. In the first task of immediate recognition， participants were instructed to memorize 10 words， each of which was displayed for 2 s on the tablet PC. After that， a total of 30 words including 10target and 20 distracter words were shown to participants， and they were required to select the 10 target words immediately. This task was repeated for three trials. The average number of correct answers was recorded as a score ranging from 0 to 10. In another task， participants were asked to correctly recall the 10 target words after 20 min. The number of correctly recalled target words was scored ranging from0 to 10. Finally， we calculated the sum score of the two tasks of immediate recognition and delayed recall.\n\n【34】Tablet Version of Trail Making Test Version A (TMT-A) and Version B (TMT-B)： In the Trail Making Test Version A (TMT-A)\n\n【35】Table 1： Comparison of participant characteristics between Control and Theatre group.\n\n|  | Contral groupn=25  |  | Theatre groupn=18  |  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Median  | IQR  | Median  | IQR  | p value  |\n| Gender (% female)  | 88.0  |  | 50.0  |  | 0.000\\  |\n| Age (year)  | 73  | 6  | 71.5  | 9  | 0.407  |\n| Education (year)  | 12  | 2  | 14  | 4  | 0.286  |\n| BMI(kg/m²)  | 22.2  | 3.3  | 22.2  | 8.7  | 0.506  |\n\n【37】\\p<0.01， Mann-Whitney test， x2test\n\n【38】task， participants were instructed to touch the target numbers in a sequence as rapidly as possible. Target numbers from 1 to 15 were randomly displayed on the tablet panel. In addition， the Trail Making Test Version B (TMT-B) instructions required participants to touch target numbers (e.g.， 1-15) and letters in turn.\n\n【39】Tablet Version of Symbol Digit Substitution Task (SDST)： In the Symbol Digit Substitution Task (SDST)， nine pairs of numbers and symbols were shown in the upper part of the tablet display. A target symbol was shown in the center of the tablet panel， and selectable numbers were displayed at the bottom. Participants were asked to touch the number corresponding to the target symbol shown in the central part of the tablet display as rapidly as possible. The number of correct numbers within 90 s was recorded.\n\n【40】Criteria of physical frailty\n\n【41】Frailty status was defined based on five dimensions of the Fried frailty index， including i) shrinking， ii) exhaustion， iii) low level of activity， iv) weakness， and v) slowness， 0 for robust， 1 to 2 for prefrail， and 3 to 5 for frail， and the frailty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Criteria of social frailty\n\n【43】Makizako's social frail index was applied for this study， consisting of i) Living alone (yes)， ii) Talking with someone every day (no)， iii) Feeling helpful to friends or family (no)， iv) Going out less frequently compared with last year (yes)， v) Visiting friends sometimes (no)，0for robust， 1 for social prefrail， and 2 to 5 for social frail. According to the change of social frail status at the following-up period， robust persons classified at the baseline were grouped into three categories， such as robust， social prefrail， and social frail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Statistical analysis\n\n【45】We compared the controlgroup and theatre group in demographics for age， gender， education， and BMI by using the Mann-Whitney test. Next， The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to compare the results of physical function and UWS， GS，\n\n【46】Table 2： Comparison of physical and cognitive function pre-test and post-test in each group.\n\n【47】WM， TMT-A & B， and SDST between pre-test and post-test of this program for participants. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to compare the results of the physical frailty ratio and social frailty between pre-test and post-test. Moreover， the Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare amount of change the physical and cognitive items for the control group and theatre group. SPSS Version 27.0 for Windows (SPSS INC.， Chicago. IL， USA) was used for the analysis， and the level of significance was set at p=0.05.\n\n【48】Results\n\n【49】The 43 participants were divided into 25 from the control group(mean age， 72.1 years) and 18 from the theatre group (mean age， 70.7years). The comparison demographics of participants for the control group and the theatre group were shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. According to the result of y test， the theater group had a significantlyhigher percentage of males. Table 2 lists the results of physical functions and cognitive functions for the pre-test and the post-test. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to analyze the differences between pre-test and post-test and revealed significant differences in the UWS (p<0.05) for the control group， and the UWS (p<0.01) for the theatre group， however， there was no significant improvement in cognitive function both the control group and the Theatre group. Next， comparisons of the physical frailty and social frailty for the control group and the theatre group at the pre-test and the post-test were shown in Table删除4-1:<u>3</u>. As a result of the Wilcoxon signed rank test， physical frailty， and social frailty improved significantly after the intervention in the control group (physical frailty； p<0.01， social frailty； p<0.05) and theatre groups (physical frailty； p<0.05， social frailty； p<0.01).\n\n【50】Finally， as a result of the Mann-Whitney test was applied to compare the amount of change in the physical and cognitive items for control group and theatre group， the amount of the change in UWS in the theatre group was significantly higher than in the control group (p<0.05) .\n\n【51】Discussion\n\n【52】This study population was a significantly higher percentage of males for the theatre group than control group. Previous studies have similarly reported that social exchange is less likely in male older adults， thus theatre interventions may be effective in increasing male participation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\nThis study sought to determine whether 3 months of theater training would enhance aspects of cognitive functions and physical functions essential to independent living.

Especially，amount of the change in UWS in the theatre group was significantly higher than in the control group from pre-test to post-test. Pua et al. were reported that walking speed is strongly associated with balance ability and agility. In other words， we believe that walking speed improves when both balance capacity and agility are combined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The theatrical approach in this study may have been effective in improving gait speed because it incorporated dynamic and quick rhythmic movements， as well as mid-backposture and crouching movements in the play . On the other hand， WM and SDST for cognitive function showed a trend toward improvement after the intervention， but no statistically significant improvement was observed. However， because this participant consisted of healthy， independent-living participants， the cognitive functions were quite high to start with， and ceiling effects might have been present. Theatrical training requires the simultaneous execution of the characters lines and accompanying actions. The ongoing practice of this kind of complex multitasking may improve the efficiency of real-world dual-task processing. Therefore， we would like to further increase the number of participants and conduct further validation with participants with cognitive decline， such as MCI.\n\nMost interesting in this study， the significant improvement in physical frailty after the intervention， especially was that the improvement in social frailty was markedly more pronounced in a theatre group. Several previous studies have found that increasing age， cognitive impairment， obesity， presence of multiple diseases，low education，andhospitalizationare risk factors forworsening frail status， whereas increased physical activity， women， overweight， low alcohol intake， higher education， living alone， and low baseline disability increase the likelihood of improving frailty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24-27\\]</u>. Although factors|删除段之间换行|other than training need to be examined in detail， theatrical training may provide similar physical frailty improvement benefits as multi-component training. As Japan's population ages at an accelerated rate， social challenges faced by the elderly are increasing， and social frailty resulting from social challenges is attracting more attention. Also， the emergency situation of thorough social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic has consequently affected the spread of the epidemic， and our previous study also reported an increase in social frailty after the COVID-19 expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Moreover， Makizako et al. reported that among independent community-dwelling older adults who are not physical frail， those who are socially frail may be at greater risk of developing physical frail in the near future， and social frail may precede (and lead to the development of) physical frail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Therefore，prevention and improvement of social frailty is considered an important issue in aging society around the world. Jasmine et al. were reported that evidence on the effectiveness of complex interventions targeting reduction in socialvulnerability for improving health related outcomes (mortality， function， cognition， subjective health and healthcare use) in older adults living in the community通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. According to that report， social support and strengthening the community in which elderly people live in the area are necessary to improve social frailty， and furthermore， reducing social frailty may also help improve the condition of their health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，31\\]</u>. Seeman et al. were identified that theater requires each person to perform in front of everyone and that a very powerful group dynamic was created when everyone experienced the same play. The participants in this study were also able to join forces and make friends to accomplish a play， and furthermore， not a single person dropped out. We have confirmed that theater programs can engage and motivate the elderly， and we have also shown that they can strengthen bonds in social situations.\n\n【62】The present study had several limitations. First， the sample sizes for both the control group and Theatre group were quite small. In a further study， we plan to increase the sample size. Second， the participants were not blind to interventions， and this study lacked a control group with no treatment. Case-control comparisons with blinding are needed in addition to before and after the intervention. Third， participants in this study may be healthful and higher cognitive function than non-participants. These requirements should be adjusted for further additional research in the future.\n\n【63】Conclusion\n\n【64】We have shown that a theatrical intervention can be as effective as the multicomponent exercise recommended in previous frailty prevention. Furthermore， the theatrical intervention was suggested to be effective in strengthening the community of participants， and improving social frailty. Therefore， theatrical intervention needs to be further studied to become a new intervention method for the prevention of frailty. Authors should discuss the results and how they can be interpreted from the perspective ofprevious studies and ofthe working hypotheses. The findings and their implications should be discussed in the broadest context possible. Future research directions may also be highlighted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Asymptomatic renal tumor was noted under computed tomography accidentally. The image showed a heterogeneous tumor around 4 cm in diameter with calcification and septa in the upper pole of the left kidney. Due to the suspicion of malignancy， she received surgical resection of renal tumor. Immunohistochemical stains were performed with resected tumor cells， which revealed immunoreactivity for Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) and Muscle Actin. Pathology report showed renal glomus tumor. No adjuvant therapy was given to this patient. There was no recurrence during follow-up so far.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Renal glomus tumor is rare and there are few cases reported before and most cases are benign tumor. Malignant glomus tumor is relatively scarce and the diagnosis is based on pathological characteristics.

Glomus tumors are rare soft tissue tumors that have similar incidence in both genders. Mostly， diagnosis is made in people between 20 to 40 years old and symptoms may precede years before 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are several variants of glomus tumor besides classic histology， including glomangioma， glomangiomyoma and glomangiomatosis. Glomus tumor often occurs in the skin of distal extremities like subungual region of finger， palm， wrist， forearm and foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Occurrence in the visceral organ is rare， including gastrointestinal tract，lung， mediastinum， pancreas and kidney通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There is no definite guideline on treatment ofrenal glomus tumor.\n\n【9】In this report， we describe a 54-year-old woman who presented with a rare primary glomus tumor in the kidney， along with a literature review.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 54-year-old female with past history of dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism\n\n【12】A left renal mass around 4 cm in diameter with calcifications and septa in the upper pole was noted under Computed Tomography (CT) accidentally . The tumor was partially enhanced， heterogenous and border was clear. She denied hematuria nor palpable mass except occasionally left flank pain during these days.\n\nAfter fully discussion with the patient， she decided to receive laparoscopic partiall nephrectomy under the suspect of renal cell carcinoma. The operation course was smooth and no acute complication was noted. Macroscopically， the resected tumor was measured 45 mmx30mm x 30 mm in size and was confined to the renal parenchyma|删除段之间换行|From histopathological examination， immunohistochemical stains of tumor showed immunoreactivity for Smooth Muscle Actin(SMA) and Muscle Actin . No expression within the tumor cells for Desmin， CK， PAX-8，INSM-1，Synaptophysin， CD31， CD34， HMB-45 nor GLUT-1. Glomus tumor was impressed based on immunohistochemical stains features mentioned above. Other part excised along with the tumor showed chronic pyelonephritis microscopically. Discharge was arranged for the patient on the sixth day after the operation.\n\n【14】As of now， no renal function impairment was noted during follow-up after the operation. Computed tomography followed four months after the operation showed no recurrence of tumor. The patient received follow-up with CT annualy and was free of disease at sixteen months after the operation.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The normal glomus body is a specialized form of arteriovenous anastomosis that regulates heat. The most distribution site of glomus body is extremities，including digits and palms and it is usuallylocated in the stratum reticularis ofthe dermis. Based on report from Masson， the normal glomus body is composed of afferent arteriole and turns into four preglomic arterioles， which blend with an irregular， thick-walled segment known as the Sucquet-Hoyer canal containing the arteriovenous anastomosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Glomus tumors are tumors of mesenchyme that resemble the normal glomus body with smooth muscle and vasculature. Masson firstly proposed the concept of glomus tumor in 1924， according to three cases diagnosed as upper extremity tumor with intermittent sharp pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Symptoms subsided after tumor excision. He found out the tumor structure was similar to glomus body and suggested that it was related to hyperplasia or overgrowth of glomus body.\n\nAccording to report from Mayo Clinic， estimated incidence of glomus tumor was 1.6% among 500 consecutive soft tissue tumors. Both genders have equivalent incidence， while patient with subungual lesions are mostly female.

Few literatures may also have reported glomus tumor in gastrointestinal tract， the genital organ， oral cavity， trachea， mediastinum， heart and lymph nodes. So far， there are several cases of renal glomus tumor and were summarized in Table 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4-13\\]</u>. Classically， glomus tumors are solitary， while Okada O et al. and Sawada S et al. ever reported multiple subungual glomus tumors in patients with Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Symptoms of glomus tumor often disproportionate with size. Some reported radiating pain away from the lesion and may be induced by changes in temperature， especially to cold， and tactile stimulation of even minor degree.\n\n【22】Mostly， renal glomus tumors behaved as benign tumor， while malignant glomus tumors were also reported in some case reports通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8，11\\]</u>. There are no specific symptoms among these cases， include flank or abdominal discomfort and microscopic hematuria.Overall， most cases were diagnosed accidentally under image examination.\n\n【23】Radiology image is widely used for differential diagnosis of renal mass. Currently， due to low incidence rate and radiologic characteristics， it is not easy to diagnose glomus tumor of the kidney depends on only image 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Many previous reported cases showed enhanced， heterogenous lesion under CT with clear border. In our case， image revealed diffused calcification and malignancy was suspected. During the operation， firm texture of tumor was noted， which was different from common renal tumor.\n\n【24】Glomus tumor usually occurred in middle-aged people. Zhao et al. ever reported one case of a young girl with past history of tuberous sclerosis complex diagnosed as renal glomus tumor at the age of age通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The patient received partial nephrectomy and was free of disease at 16 months of follow-up.\n\n【25】Tissue biopsy or pathology from surgery is necessary for confirming the diagnosis of glomus tumor. Immunohistochemical diagnosis is made based on immunoreactivity for both common muscle and smooth muscle actin regardless of different location of tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. Renal glomus tumor is distinguishable from renal cell carcinoma because it is positive for muscle markers while negative for epithelial markers including cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen. Immunoactivity of desmin of tumor was variable， ranging from focal positivity to no expression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. It is reported that peripheral/subcutaneous glomus tumor expressed CD34 positivity more frequently than visceral glomus tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. S-100 protein， various cytokeratin's and other markers induding CD31，HMB-45， CD117， CD20， CD45， C56 and CD57 showed negative result mostly通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7，18，20\\]</u> .\n\nPrevious study has defined the criteria for possible malignancy， which includes 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> tumor size larger than two centimeter and deep location inkidney； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> display ofatypical mitotic figures； 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> significant nuclear grade and mitotic activity (5 mitoses/50 HPF) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In our cases， tumor size was larger than two centimeter and located deep in upper pole of left kidney， while pathology report showed no obvious increased mitosis or necrosis. Surgical resection remained mainstay treatment in previous reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6-9，11，13\\]</u>. Mostly， the prognosis was acceptable， either pathological report showed atypical and malignant or benign glomus tumor. Lamba et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， however，|删除段之间换行|firstly reported malignant renal glomus tumor with pelvic bones and spine metastasis. Palliative chemotherapy and radiation therapy was given while poor response was noted. The patient passed away within six months after diagnosis. To our knowledge， there was only one malignant renal glomus tumor ever reported in our living district according to the criteria. The patient received radical nephrectomy and adrenalectomy for the tumor and he was free of disease at six months of follow-up通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【27】In conclusion， renal glomus tumor is an uncommon tumor that encompassed unspecific clinical symptoms. It is challenging to distinguish renal glomus tumor from other renal tumors including renal cell carcinoma bysymptoms，laboratoryandimage data. Definite diagnosis was always made based on histopathological examination. There are still limited data and consensus for treatment of renal glomus tumor due to scarcity. Because of the acceptable outcome and recurrence， surgical resection of the tumor may be considered， either partial or radical nephrectomy.

In 2018， cancer of the cervix affected 4.1 per 100，000 women in western Asia  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> including Lebanon， thus the incidence in our country seems ideal.\n\n【8】However， in 2008 the lowest Age Standardized Incidence Rate (ASIR) values of cervical cancer were found in western and south-central Asia， with Lebanon having only 3.8 cases per 100，000women per year  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

In fact， according to the Lebanese ministry of public health cervical cancer cases are increasing， with 192 new cases in 2018 compared to less than 100 in2005 .\n\nIn western Asia， the highest incidence of cervical cancer is found in women aged 45 to 49 years， whereas in Lebanon the most affected age group is women above 75 years old  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Furthermore， when comparing new cases in Lebanon vs. Western Asia countries according to each age group， we found a ratio of 3.2% vs. 8.36% in|删除段之间换行|the young (45 to 49 years) and older group (above 75 years old) respectively  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thus， cervical cancer in Lebanon is more frequent in women after 75 years compared to our neighbors. This may be caused by an inadequate previous screening in these women.

In our practice， patients are treated according to the international guidelines， thus the higher mortality rates seen in our country are probably related to patients presenting with more advanced disease and consequently less chance of survival. Likewise， the crude incidence rate， crude mortality rate， ASIR and cumulative risk at 75 years are higher in Lebanon compared to the other western Asia countries (6.3 vs. 3.9， 4.1 vs. 2.3， 5.7 vs. 4.1 and 0.6 vs. 0.4， respectively)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\nCervical cancer is preventable through HPV vaccination， a|删除段之间换行|Table 1： Cervical cancer incidence in Lebanon and Western Asia in 2018.\n\n| Indicator  | Lebanon  | Western Asia  | World  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Annual Number of New Cases  | 192  | 5092  | 569847  |\n| Death  | 125  | 2995  | 311365  |\n| Crude Incidence Rate  | 6.3  | 3.9  | 15.1  |\n| Crude Mortality Rate  | 4.1  | 2.3  | 8.2  |\n| Age-Standardized Rate  | 5.7  | 4.1  | 13.1  |\n| Age-Standardized Mortality Rate  | 3.6  | 2.5  | 6.9  |\n| Cumulative Risk (%) at 75 years  | 0.6  | 0.4  | 1.4  |\n| Cumulative Risk (%) at 75 years  | 0，4  | 0.3  | 0.8  |\n\n【18】vaccine that is not vet included in the Lebanese vaccination schedule.

Metastatic carcinoma of the tonsil is uncommon，but tonsillar metastasis from gastric cancer is very rare. The review of the literature reports only 12 cases of tonsillar metastasis of gastric carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. To our knowledge， this is the first reported case that combines tonsillar and cutaneous metastases. We report a case of metastasis to palatine tonsil from a primary gastric signet-ring cell carcinoma.

The Pre-operative CT scan showed no evidence of distant metastasis. He underwent a subtotal gastrectomy with a D1， five lymph node dissection. Histologically， the tumor was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells invading the subserosa without lymph node metastasis. Additional histologic findings were venous and lymphatic vessel invasion. After the surgery， a concomitant chemo-radiotherapy was indicated. The treatment was well tolerated. Two years and three months after， the patient developed a locoregional recurrence. He underwent surgery and post-operative chemotherapy by 12 courses of flox regimen including 5FU， folinic acid， and oxaliplatin. Grade 2 neuropathy was reported.\n\n【8】During the follow-up period， one year and nine months after the recurrence， the patient presented pharyngeal discomfort. A mass of 4 cm was observed in the palatine tonsil with multiple cutaneous mass of the head. The CT scan showed a left adrenal metastasis. The biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， a metastasis from gastric cancer. The cutaneous nodules were also a metastasis of gastric cancer.

The longest survival was 30 months， with a mean survival of 14.6 month for the patients who was treated. The survival of our patient did not exceed one month. This can be explained by the presence in addition to the cutaneous metastasis which are darkened the prognosis in the gastric adenocarcinomas.\n\n【13】Although for the patients receiving BSC，the mean survival was 3.8months.

Six patients were male and 3 were female with the mean age of 67 years (range，57-83). The diagnosis of infected AAA was determined by clinicalevidence ofinfection (pain， fever andleukocytosis)，aortic image， and positive results from blood cultures， pus culture (from CT guide percutaneous and surgical drainage) and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Empirical parenteral antibiotics were administered on admission. At the time ofan operation， all were saccular and 4 of the 9 aneurysms (44.4%) were ruptured (3 contained，1 free ruptured). All patients have undergone EVAR for AAA；5 used Bifurcated stent grafts， 2 Tube stent grafts and 2 Aorto-uniiliac stent grafts with femoro-femoral bypass grafting. The parenteral antibiotics were continued in the postoperative period for 4-6 weeks.\n\n【4】Results： Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) was present in 66.66 %(6/9)， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was present in 55.55% (5/9)， Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD) present in 44.44%(4/9) with diabetes mellitus present in 22.22%(2/9). The most common pathogen was Salmonella species (n =5)， Escherichia coli (n=2) and B. pseudomallei (n =2). Forty-four percent (4/9) of the patients presented with ruptured that needed an emergency surgery. There was no 30 days mortality and significant morbidity. Three patients (patient no. 1，5 and 7) had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and 2 patients (patient no. 1 and 5) needed later stent graft explantation. One patient (patient no.7) refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia.\n\n【5】Conclusions： The immediate results of EVAR for Infected AAA are fair with no 30 days mortality and few complications. The midterm results are not satisfied due to high rate of Infected Stent Grafts(ISG) 33.33%(3/9). EVAR is not a definitive treatment of Infected AAA； it could be a temporizing treatment prior to definitive open surgical repair， or a therapeutic alternative in critically ill patients who may not survive open surgery.\n\n【6】Keywords： Infected stent grafts， infected abdominal aortic aneurysm， endovascular treatment\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Management of infected AAA is a challenging and difficult clinical problem for the vascular surgeon.

Infected AAA are associated with high morbidity and high mortality 21-44% because they are frequently associated with complicating factors， such as late or delay in diagnosis， rupture， sepsis， and comorbid diseases of the patients通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The gold standard for treatment of infected AAA is aggressive surgical resection， debridement of infected periaortic tissues， and reconstruction of the aortic flow by anatomic or extra-anatomic techniques. However； the presence of unfavorable anatomy， a hostile operative field after previous surgery， a contained rupture， or a physiologically debilitated state can elevate operative risk and morbid level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>.

Patients were a mean age of 67 years (range， 57-83 years). All patients had positive blood cultures showing five Salmonella， two Escherichia coli， and two B. pseudomallei. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in all9 patients. Mean C-reactive protein level was 188 mg/L (range， 67mg/L to 486 mg/L) and mean white blood cell (WBC) was 11 (range，8-18 x 10/L). The diagnosis of aortic aneurysm was confirmed by abdominal CT scan and by CT angiography. All of the patients had aortic pseudoaneurysms with a mean size of 5.2 cm (range， 4.3 cm to7.2 cm). There was no 30 days mortality. After 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotics postoperatively， lifelong oral antibiotics were maintained， if possible. All patients were followed in an outpatient clinic at 1， 6， and 12 months and thereafter once a year. The mean follow-up period was 74 months (range， 54-81 months). Three patients had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at 10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and needed later stent graft explantation. Patient no. 1 underwent axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting and stent graft explantation. Patient no. 2 underwent stent graft explantation and In-situ Dacron graft interposition. Patient no. 3 refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia. All nine patients consented to publication of this report.\n\n【14】Patient 1\n\nA 71-year-old man with a past history of arterial hypertension， chronic smoking， and myocardial infarction underwent elective EVAR for primary Infected AAA using a Cook Zenith Endograft for the main body TFFB-23-111-2T： legs TFLE-15-78-2T and TFLE-16-62-2T.

Thirty-six months after， he presented with abdominal pain， anorexia， 3kg weight loss， and fever in the last 10 days. On physical examination， the abdomen was tender in the epigastric area to deep palpation. His blood results showed an elevated white blood cell count to13 x 10°/L with 81% of neutrophils and anemia of 8.5 g/dL. A CT scan revealed the stent graft surrounded by an abscess with air. CT guided percutaneous drainage was performed and yielded 25 cc pus with negative culture for organism. The patient underwent an elective operation. Through a midline laparotomy the endograft was completely removed. Aortic reconstruction with in situ Dacron graft placement with aortobi-iliac graft configuration was performed and covered with omentum. Debridement of the abscess and lavage of the cavity were performed. Hemocultures， microbiological cultures of aortic tissue， endograft and the abscess were negative. The patient received empirical intravenous antibiotics during 6 weeks of hospitalization. The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged in good clinical conditions. Twenty-four months after surgery， both the clinical syndrome and CT scan showed no evidence of recurrent infection.\n\n【23】Patient 3\n\nA 58-year-old man with a past history of chronic kidney disease and gouty arthritis underwent emergency EVAR for primary Infected|删除段之间换行|AAA using a Cook Zenith Endograft for the main body TFFB-30-111-2T： legs TFLE-10-88-2T and TFLE-18-56-2T.

On physical examination， the abdomen was tender in the epigastric area to deep palpation. His blood results showed an elevated white blood cell count to 15x10/L with 83% of neutrophils and anemia of 8.1 g/dL. A CT scan revealed the stent graft surrounded by an abscess with air. CT guided percutaneous drainage was performed and yielded 15 cc pus with positive culture of E. coli. The patient refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from aorto-enteric fistula with gastrointestinal bleeding and E. coli septicemia.\n\n【25】Results\n\n【26】Between January 2009 and December l 2011， 9 consecutive patients (six men， three women) with primary infected infrarenal AAA were treated using this EVAR strategy. Patients were a mean age of 67 years (range， 57-83 years). The demographic data and the pathogens are presented in Tables 1 and删除4:<u> 2</u>.\n\n【27】All of the patients presented with abdominal or back pain， and five had recurrent fevers. All patients had positive blood cultures，3 patients had positive tissue cultures (33.33%) and 2(22.22%) had positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Broad-spectrum antibiotics were used in all 9 patients. Mean C-reactive protein level was 188 mg/L (range， 67 mg/L-486 mg/L) and mean White Blood Cell (WBC) was 11 (range， 8x10-18x10/L). Chronic Renal Disease(CRD) was present in 66.66 %(6/9)， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was present in 55.55 % (5/9)， Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease (COPD) present in 44.44% (4/9) with diabetes mellitus present in 22.22%(2/9). None of the 9 patients had evidence of immune deficiency. The diagnosis of aortic aneurysm was confirmed by abdominal CT scan and by CT angiography. All of the patients had aortic pseudoaneurysms with a mean size of 5.2 cm (range， 4.3\n\n【28】cm-7.2cm).\n\n【29】Four patients had ruptured aneurysms； 3 had focal aortic pseudoaneurysms with contained ruptures (33.33%) and 1 free rupture with signs of hemodynamic instability (11.11%)， all received urgency EVAR operations. Fever was present in two of the four urgency operative cases. Fever was controlled in most of the patients undergoing elective operations preoperatively. In addition to the typical infectious presentation and the imaging appearance on CT， all patients had positive blood culture reports showing five Salmonella， two Escherichia coli， and two B. pseudomallei. One patient (patient no. 6) developed left graft limb occlusion， which underwent successful thromboembolectomy； one (patient no. 3) underwent a minilaparotomy for open debridement due to persistent fever. There was no 30 days mortality. After 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotics postoperatively，lifelong oral antibiotics were maintained， if possible.\n\n【30】All patients were followed in an outpatient clinic at 1， 6，and 12months and thereafter once a year. The mean follow-up period was 74months (range， 54-81 months). Three patients (patient no. 1， 5 and 7) had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at 10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and needed later stent graft explantation . Patients with Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) Patient no. lunderwent axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting and stent graft explantation. Patient no. 5 underwent stent graft explantation and In-situ Dacron graft interposition. Patient no.7 refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from gastrointestinal bleeding and septicemia.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】Primary arterial infections have been classified into 4 types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【33】1\\. Mycotic aneurysm due to septic emboli (embolomycotic)； usually from endocarditis.\n\n【34】2\\. Microbial arteritis-Bacteremiacaiisesinfection in aan atheromatous plaque leading to destruction of the wall and aneurysm formation； this is most common in the aorta.\n\n【35】3\\. Infection of a pre-existing aneurysm.\n\n【36】4\\. Post traumatic false aneurysm， such as following penetrating injury， invasive intra-arterial cannulation or drug abuse.\n\n【37】There are several theories to explain the pathology of aortic infection. Infected microemboli may lodge in the aortic infection. Infected microemboli may lodge in the vasa vasorum causing occlusion and damage to the aortic wall， which leads to degeneration and aneurysm formation. Emboli can also lodge in the irregular intima or the thrombus in the aneurysm during bacteremia. Aortic wall infection can occur due to direct inoculation into the arterial wall. Organisms may colonize the intact vascular wall through the vasa vasorum， where a local suppurative process， which results in Microbial arteritis with aneurysm formation， weakens the arterial wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>.\n\nWith the introduction of antibiotics during the past 50 years， the incidence of infective endocarditis decreased gradually， and infected aortic aneurysms associated with endocarditis became rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In nonendocarditis bacteremia or secondary to septic emboli， the most commonly reported site of infected aneurysms was the abdominal aorta due to infection of existing atherosclerotic plaque and aneurysms with a larger vasa vasorum， where infected emboli may dislodge. An interesting feature is that Salmonella spp.， rather than|删除段之间换行|Staphylococcus spp.， seem to cause most infected aortic aneurysms in Eastern countries. It may be plausible that people in Eastern countries eat foods which in general have a greater than average risk of contamination with Salmonella spp.\n\n【39】Salmonella species in particular have a strong predilection to infect damaged aortic intima and abnormal arterial intima， especially arteries harboring atherosclerotic plaque 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，10\\]</u>. Characterization of the different bacteria is important， since gram-negative sepsis results in higher rupture rates than infection with gram-positive bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The virulence species， Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella chloeraesuis， account for over 50% of the reported cases of infected aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，10\\]</u>. Other common organisms are Streptococcus， Bacteroides， Escherichia coli， and Staphylococcus aureus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In our report， Salmonella sp. was responsible in 55.55%(n =5) of patients . E. coli 22.22% (n =2)， and Burkholderia pseudomallei 22.22%(n =2). Gram-negative organisms were by far the most common isolates from hemocultures. Salmonella sp. responded in66.66% (4/6) of patients and is thought to exhibit a more virulent course because of its ability to invade the normal intima and cause early aneurysm rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【40】The complicated early outcome in patients with infected aortic aanIeurysms probably reflects the combination of an aggressive presentation， high rupture rate， and complex aneurysm location in hosts with chronic comorbid conditions. This study shows 44.44%(4/9) incidence of aneurysm rupture. All of our patients had at least one chronic comorbid condition； Chronic Renal Disease (CRD) was present in 66.66 %(6/9)， Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) was present in 55.55 %(5/9)， Chronic Pulmonary Obstructive Disease(COPD) present in 44.44%(4/9) with diabetes mellitus present in22.22%(2/9).Despite the fact that infected aneurysms occur in all age groups， the elderly comprised the largest group in our series. All of the 9 patients； 6 were men and 3 were women of mean age of 67 years(range， 57-83 years).\n\n【41】In our series， all patients were symptomatic， with symptoms having lasted for more than 7 days， and even up to 2 months. Classic manifestations include abdominal pain， fever， and a pulsatile abdominal mass. The presence ofleukocytosis-elevated sedimentation rate and positive blood cultures strengthen the surgeon's suspicion of the diagnosis of infected aneurysm. Symptoms of sepsis may be discrete and may easily go unrecognized，especially in the early stages. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started preoperatively after taking blood cultures. Positive blood cultures are helpful to signal the need for the specific antibiotic therapy. CT scan is also in establishing the diagnosis of infected aortic aneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Although a period of antimicrobial therapy before EVAR is advised， immediate EVAR is indicated， irrespective of bacteriologic status， when there are signs of rupture. Emergency surgery was performed in 44.44%(n =4) of patients due to rupture. Three patients had focal aortic pseudo aneurysms with contained ruptures (75%) and 1 free ruptures (25%)； CT scan confirmed all these. Three of the4 (75%) ruptured infected abdominal aortic aneurysms were infected by Salmonella species .\n\nThe surgical management ofinfected abdominalaortic aneurysms includes extensively resect the infected aorta， aggressively debride the periaortic tissues，andreconstruct the aortic flow usingextra-anatomic or anatomic bypass prosthetic grafts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4，13\\]</u>. Adequate drainage， administration of organism-specific parenteral antibiotics， extensive debridement and excision of infected aortic tissue are the strategies|删除段之间换行|used to resolve infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5，14\\]</u>. The virulence of the organism and severity ofthe arterial infection are more important determinants than any single operative procedure or method of arterial reconstruction通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The associated mortality was still high， ranging from 25% to 40%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5，13-15\\]</u>. Death is usually related to persistent sepsis with multi-organ failure. The magnitude and long duration of the operation， especially in shocked and unstable patients， are major contributing factors to the perioperative mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，14，15\\]</u>. Late graft infections occurred in 7% to 10% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4，14\\]</u>， and extra-anatomic bypass had worse outcome than in situ reconstructions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，13\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Endovascular treatment with stent-grafts has been introduced， as an alternative， less invasive， especially in the septic patient with considerable co-morbidity， will reduce the risk of cardiopulmonary， neurological and renal complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. This could be a temporizing treatment prior to definitive open surgical repair， or a therapeutic alternative in critically i patients who may not survive open surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-20\\]</u>.The potential benefits of endovascular repair include small incisions， minimal aortic cross-clamping time with reduction in end-organ ischemia，avoidance of general anesthesia， full heparinsation， single lung ventilation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Endovascular repair should reduce the length of stay in intensive care units， high dependency units and in hospital，with an earlier return to activities of daily living and consequent improvement in the quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-22\\]</u>. An additional drainage procedure is usually required either via CT guided drainage or by open surgical approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.On our previous experience on open surgical management of infected AAA， we had a disease-specific mortality was 31.25% (5/16). 30-day mortality rate of the ruptured cases is high 25%(4/16) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We started EVAR for treatment of infected AAA since 2009 and hope that this alternative and less invasive procedure will decrease the patient's morbidity and mortality rates. We would go over on EVAR for treatment of infected AAA whenever the stents are available.\n\n【45】Immediate results are fair impressive； one patient (patient no. 6) developed left graft limb occlusion， which underwent successful thromboembolectomy； one (patient no. 3) underwent a minilaparotomy for open debridement due to persistent fever. There was no in-hospital death both in elective and emergency ruptured cases .\n\n【46】Antibiotic administration according to postoperative sensitivity testing is crucial： the duration of antibiotic therapy is not well established， but most authors recommend a minimum of 6 weeks intravenously and orally for another 6 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，21\\]</u>. Longer durations and even life-long antibiotic therapy have been recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，20\\]</u>. Some authors believe that patients with a prosthetic reconstruction should continue on low-dose antibiotics for life. However， the advantage of a more prolonged therapy has not been confirmed.\n\n【47】The midterm results are not satisfied due to high rate of infected stent grafts 33.33%(3/9). Three patients (patient no. 1， 5 and 7) had Infected Stent Grafts (ISG) at 10， 26 and 36 months after EVAR， which are disease specific complications， subsequently received CT-guided percutaneous tube drainage and needed later stent graft explantation due to unresponsive conservative management. Patient no. 1 underwent axillo-bifemoral bypass grafting and stent graft explantation. Patient no. 5 underwent stent graft explantation and In-situ Dacron graft interposition. Patient no. 7 refused stent graft explantation and died 1 month later at another hospital from aorto-enteric fistula with gastrointestinal bleeding and E. coli septicemia.\n\n【48】Placing a foreign body in an infected field seems to be against the surgical infection principles. There is always concern about persistent infection after placing a stent graft in an infected field. Persistent infection after EVAR treatment of infected aortic aneurysms is usually associated with a poor prognosis. The endoprostheses become infected so compounding the problem over a greater length ofaorta， and they may cause rupture of a fragile vessel because of the necessary oversizing used to hold the device in place. Additionally， if the fever persists after the EVAR， This would be an indication to keep the patient on long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics until a definite surgical treatment is considered. Several reports have described a high incidence of recurrent infection and late mortality after endovascular repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，22\\]</u>.\n\n【49】Conservative management of infected stent grafts consists of antimicrobial therapy and percutaneous drainage (CT guided)； is accepted in high-risk patients with multiple comorbidities and patients with minor， low-grade infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，21-25\\]</u>. Mortality in these patients has been up to 40% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. In the series of Lyons et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> reported that their patients who did not have stent grafts explantation died of aortic disease progression， contrasted with a mortality rate of 30% when the graft was explanted. In suitable patients： when an infected graft is not manageable by a conservative approach， surgical treatment should be considered通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【50】The virulence of the organism and severity of the arterial infection are more important determinants than any single operative procedure or method of arterial reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29-32\\]</u>. When there is gross contamination from infected stent grafts， excision and extra-anatomical bypass is the treatment of choice. The argument in favor of extra-anatomic bypass is the theoretic advantage of reducing the risk of graft infection， because revascularization is generally performed in a location remote from the site of infection.\n\n【51】When contamination is less severe， the aorta may be replaced in situ. The choice of the ideal conduit is still controversial. Rifampin soaked grafts may prevent graft infection by reducing early graft seeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28，31-33\\]</u>. Antibiotic-coated Dacron grafts presented an attractive adjunct. Prolonged anti-staphylococcal activity ofrifampin-bonded， gelatin impregnated Dacron grafts has been demonstrated after implantation in the arterial circulation， in experimental and human studies. Infection rates， as well as mortality and morbidity rates， are much lower for rifampin-treated grafts than for plain in situ graft replacement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Encouraging results have also been reported with the use of cryopreserved human allograft and silver coated polyester grafts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. Other safe alternatives include autogenous superficial femoral vein grafts and cryopreserved arterial allografts删除4-1:<u>36-39</u>.\n\n【52】The duration of antimicrobial treatment in patients after removal of an infected aortic stent graft is controversial. No current guidelines exist on this issue and some authors suggest prolonging antibiotic administration until the C-reactive protein level has returned to baseline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.\n\n【53】The immediate results of EVAR for Infected AAA are fair with no 30 days mortality and few complications. The midterm results are not satisfied due to high rate of infected stent grafts 33.33%(3/9). Endovascular treatment of Infected AAA is feasible and should be a durable treatment option； late infection-related complications do occur and are often lethal. EVAR could be considered a palliative treatment option， or a bridge to later elective radical open surgery， once the patient has recovered from the initial emergency.\n\n【54】Conclusions\n\n【55】Endovascular treatment of primary Infected AAA is feasible and for most patients a durable treatment option. EVAR is not a definitive treatment of Infected AAA； it could be a temporizing treatment prior to definitive open surgical repair， or a therapeutic alternative in critically ill patients who may not survive open surgery.

In those cases， EVAR could be considered a palliative option or a bridge to later elective open repair.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "207b4353-38cf-4a0a-8caa-4aa4fe0ba14c", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder， second only to Alzheimer's disease. It has been the object of growing interest since its frequency tends to augment as life expectancy has increased globally considered. In this work， we study the eventual neuroprotective effect of Progesterone (P) injected a few days before establishing a Reserpine (R) model of Parkinsonism in adult male rats. We focused on cognitive (Novel Object Recognition test； NOR)， affective (Forced Swimming Task； FST) and motor (Catalepsy Test； CT) outputs. We performed the appropriate tests along with the administration for two weeks of low doses of R. Our results show very clearly that P prevents the impairment of several tasks regarding the deleterious effects of R， without affecting negatively other areas of the subject behavior. In total accordance with current information， we show here that P -in particular- and neuroactive steroids -in general- are promising molecules to delay diverse manifestations of neurotransmitters depletion.\n\n【2】Keywords： Progesterone； Neuroactive steroids； Parkinsonism； Neuroprotection； Male rats\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Parkinson's disease is a threatening health problem in the world. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Besides many advances in the management of the illness， it remains complicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This is so -at least in part-because what was once the hallmark of the disease， the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra， has since changed to consider the disease as a multi-systemic degenerative process involving several pathways， structures and neurotransmitters通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Ongoing research is highly interested in the possibility of using neuroprotective drugs to avoid the damages of the disease or at least delay them long enough to give the patient a better quality of life.\n\n【5】Neuroactive steroids are a well-known set of molecules that comprise steroids from any source that show effects on the Central Nervous System (CNS). Among them， there are a group of neuroactive steroids-collectively named neurosteroids- that are synthesized the novo in the CNS， and that exert autocrine and paracrine effects only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Both groups of molecules have a renowned target as putative molecules regarding neuroprotection. Progesterone (P) is one of the major players among them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Parkinson’s disease remains elusive in terms oftreatment， being one major reason that the disorder， once thought as merely a motor illness， is a complex set of signs and symptoms that involve cognitive， affective and motor expressions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Today， a major goal is to recognize early subtle behavioral (cognitive， affective and motor) signs of malfunctioning to promptly begin with the treatment.\n\nThere are several animal models of Parkinsonism that have proved to be very useful in researching several essential aspects of the disease， from behavior to molecules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In this work， we try to study whether or not P. could be eventually neuroprotective when administered just a few days before of injecting our subjects with severallow doses of Reserpine (R) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We selected R as our model since it affects not only dopaminergic neurons but also catecholamines and indoleamine as a whole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. What was once a disadvantageous situation， today it has been reverted since the human disease involves a much more complex landscape that the mere loss of dopaminergic|删除段之间换行|neurons. Additionally， the method-comparatively- is a rapid way of establishing the deficits in the subiects and also testing the effects of putative protective molecules.\n\n【7】Methods\n\n【8】Subjects\n\n【9】Male Sprague-Dawley rats， 60 days old， and 450 g average weight were used. Animals were housed in groups of three individuals per cage. Room temperature was maintained at 22℃±2C， on a 12 h artificial light/dark cycle (light from 7：00 am to 7 pm). Commercial rodent food and water were provided ad libitum. All procedures were approvedbythelocal committee for care and use ofanimals in medical research (CICUAL， Facultad de Ciencias Medicas， Universidad Nacional de Cuyo， cicual@fcm.uncu.edu.ar)， and experiments were performed in accord with the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of laboratory animals.\n\n【10】Reagents and solutions\n\n【11】Reserpine (R) and Progesterone (P) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich St Louis MO， USA. R was diluted in glacial acetic acid (final concentration 0.5% acetic acid in distilled water) and subcutaneously administered (SC) at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. P was dissolved in ether， benzyl alcohol was added， and finally， it was resuspended in corn oil. P administration was also SC， at a dose of 4 mg/kg.\n\n【12】Experimental design\n\n【13】The experimental protocol was carried out along 21 days， according to Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. From day-5 to-1 animal received either a daily Intraperitoneal (IP) injection of sterile saline or an SC injection of P. On odd days from 1 to 13 animals received either daily reserpine or sterile saline according to the group . Catalepsy test was carried out on even days from 2 to 14. Novel Object Recognition test(NOR test) was performed on day 8， and Forced Swimming Test(FST) was performed on day删除4:<u> 9</u>.\n\n【14】At the beginning ， animals were randomly assigned to one of 4 groups (n=10 each) injected with： 1) Sham (S)， saline-saline；2) saline-reserpine (R)； 3) Progesterone-Reserpine (P+R)； and 4) Progesterone-Saline (P+S).\n\n【15】Reserpine model\n\n【16】Reserpine (R)， a monoamine depleting agent， is an ester alkaloid derived from Rauwolfia sp. root utilized initially for the treatment of hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. R was underused for years as a useful reagent to induce animal Parkinsonism since it was not selective for dopamine， the hallmark neurotransmitter whose lack by death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantial nigra was always considered to be the responsible for the pathophysiology of the illness， according to Jenner in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Today this is not the case anymore as different monoamines besides dopamine (noradrenaline， serotonin) and different nuclei besides the substantia nigra (raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus) are all known to be affected by the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Today， R is a well-established model to induce animal Parkinsonism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Catalepsy test\n\nIn the catalepsy test， the subject is placed in an unusual posture and then the observer measures the time that takes to the animal to correct this unusual posture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. We used a horizontal Plexiglass bar held between two vertical support bars located at 9 cm from a smooth surface. Animal's front limbs were positioned on the bar and the latency time to step down from the bar was recorded. Three trials were made per rat on each observation. Result for each observation|删除段之间换行|was the mean value. We establish catalepsy like behavior criteria， considered as immobility posture time. Maximum time allowed for the whole test was 180 sec.\n\n【19】Novel object recognition\n\n【20】The experiment was realized as described elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. Briefly， the apparatus consisted of a wooden box (70 cm x 45 cmx30 cm) with a white acrylic floor. It was located in an isolated testing room that was dimly lit by constant indirect illumination from the primary source， a 25 Wlight bulb suspended over the box. The objects utilized as familiar (previously experienced object) or unfamiliar(object not previously experienced， i.e. the novel one) were three copies of a pink truncated pyramid and a grayish-opaque candlestick of approximately the same size， all of them heavy enough to prevent accidental displacement by the subjects.\n\n【21】The animals were allowed to get used to the experimental room for at least 1 h. The day before training， each animal freely explored the apparatus with no objects for 2 min. A training session (T1) was followed by a test session (T2) 24 h later. During the training session， animals were placed in the arena containing two identical objects(pink truncated pyramids). In the test session， a familiar object was changed for an unfamiliar one (grayish opaque candlestick). Both training and test stages were 3 min each. The position of the objects(familiar and unfamiliar) and the extreme of the box used to place the objects were randomly exchanged for each experimental animal to avoid the use of potential confounding spatial clues. Exploration was defined as the orientation ofthe animal’s snout toward the object within a range of 2 cm or less from the object. Running around the object or sitting on it was not recorded as exploration. The objects and floor were carefully cleaned with ethanol (10%) after each trial to equate olfactory cues. The experiments were recorded with a camcorder digital camera JVC Everio GZ-MG330 (Japan) using a black and white recording mode to improve the register. The measures in the object recognition test were as follows： 1) total time spent by the subject exploring both objects during training (T1)； 2) total time spent by the subject exploring just the novel object during T2； and 3) discrimination index， the difference between time spent exploring unfamiliar and familiar objects during T2.\n\n【22】Forced swimming test\n\n【23】The FST was slightly modified from the original one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The device consists of a plexiglass cylinder 38 cm in diameter and 60 cm in height. The cylinder contained water at 25C， 45 cm in height. Rats were individually introduced into the cylinder for 5 min and removed to be dried before returning them to their home cages. The test was videotaped . The following parameters were scored：1) Immobility time： time spent with the head above the water surface， and the necessary movement to maintained it； 2) swimming time： movements through the apparatus with front limbs inside the water； 3) climbing time： Movements with the front limbs against the cylinder wall； and 4) diving： Events of exploratory movements under the water with all the body submerged\n\n【24】Statistical assays\n\n【25】All data were analyzed by a one-way ANOVA test followed by a Tukey post hoc test and expressed as the mean ± SEM. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【26】Results\n\nIn the present work， when compared to another study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， relatively small but repeated doses of R (0.1 mg/Kg) were used to|删除段之间换行|C= Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group. Results are expressed as mean ±SEM. p<0.05， \"p<0.01，p<0.001.\n\n【28】obtain subtle but reliable motor changes as well as cognitive and affective ones. In this sense， we were able to induce Parkinsonism signs in our subjects since all of the animals treated with R developed changes in each of the testing conditions.\n\n【29】These changes included： a) More time spent in the bar during the catalepsy test， indicating a definite impact on motility， particularly from day 10 of R treatment until reaching a peak on day 14 ； b) subjects significantly spent less time swimming during the forced swimming task， which is a clear indication of what is known as a \"depression\" like behavior in rodent models when compared to controls without treatment or subjects treated with P alone . The diving activity was measured by the number of accumulated events. Control group made 21 dives， while in the reserpine group we observe only 4 events.\n\nReserpine group previously treated with progesterone obtained a cumulative result of 11 dives， while for the group treated only with progesterone the cumulative result was 16 dives； c) also in the|删除段之间换行|recognition of the novel object during the test， controls， and P alone treated subjects did not have any problem at all in recognizing the new object. On the other hand， R treated subjects， nonetheless spending the same total amount of time in exploratory behavior -also a clear indicator of what is supposed to be expected from animals that did not suffer from any lack of motivation and/or translation problems ignored the condition of new object during the test day， indicating an impact on memory， a cognitive component of the model. These results， when taken together， allow us to consider our subjects as a valid model of monoamine depletion. By extension also as a modelofpremotor and motor signs of Parkinsonism， suitable for being used to study eventual neuroprotection by the neuroactive steroid P.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\nRegarding P， it was striking the effect when administered for five days before the injections of R. In fact， in every condition tested， P. prevented the impairment of all the components previously|删除段之间换行|C =Control group； R=Reserpine group； P=P group； P+R=P plus reserpine group. Results are expressed as mean ±SEM. Swimming time in seconds. p<0.01，“p<0.001.\n\n【33】described， resulting in motor， cognitive and affective performances quite comparable to control subjects. It is important to note that P had not any effect per se. Additionally， we must stress here that the model we used in the present work allows us to study the acute effect of neuroprotection instead of addressing neurorestoration， being more useful for the later models based on intrastriataladministration of toxins like 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\nSeveral papers stress the importance of sex steroids and neurosteroids as neuroprotective factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Men are more susceptible than women to Parkinson's disease， at least until women reach menopause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， which is highly suggestive for a role of sex steroids like estrogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover， steroid hormones synthesized by the brain have been shown to display neuroprotective properties eventually useful for the prevention and treatment of|删除段之间换行|neurodegenerative diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Probably， what it is particularly interesting here are twofold：1) the validity of reserpine as a reagent suitable for generating a deficit constellation in rodents that remembers what happens -at least in part- in Parkinson's disease. It does so relatively quickly when compared to another method通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， and it does consistently every time according to our results. Additionally， the whole picture is reversible when R is discontinued； and 2) P. prevented impairments in all areas-again consistently-when administered for a short time before R administration. There are advantageous animal models of Parkinsonism that are widely used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， all of them involved some cumulative changes and cell death with compensatory changes as well. In this work， we show short bursts of P. before Rtreatment， and a short Rtreatment to induce the reported malfunctions.\n\n【35】Parkinson's disease is a very complex disorder in which probably many factors contribute to the onset and later stages of the disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. At present， there is no single successful treatment to stop the progression of the illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. As such it results interesting the possibility of addressing the role of several treatments at once acting synergistically to prevent neuronal death or restore brain damage. In this sense -among others- gonadal steroid hormones have been shown to result promising. As we mentioned earlier， since women are less prone than men to present Parkinson's disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> at least until menopause- it looks promising to think about gonadal steroids as putative candidates to be one of the combined strategies to treat the disease. In fact， and besides that estrogens have been less contradictory that progestin's in showing beneficial effects， P also has been reported to be useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In our lab， treatment with P. for 3 days after 6-OHDA injections improved behavioral targets as well as normalized glutamatergic and dopaminergic activities通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，18\\]</u>. However， here we are dealing with acute effects， instead of the chronic model of neuronal death by 6-OHDA， which poses the question of that， apparently， at least， we could talk of dysfunctional neurons here more than dead cells. Since one of the possible targets of Parkinson’s disease is neurotrophic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， it would be possible that P. before administration of reserpine could -acting quickly- exert their protective effect on membrane progesterone receptors， stimulating neurotrophic factors， such as BDNF. In our lab we have seen an increase in BDNF levels in response to administration of allopregnanolone， an endogenous neurosteroid derived from progesterone that acts as a GABAA positive allosteric modulator (unpublished data). Since nigral Dopamine (DA) neurons are sensitive to several neurotrophic factors (BDNF among them) it would not be impossible to think of P as inducing an increase of such neurotrophic factors and then， preventing DA neurons of becoming dysfunctional and hence， avoiding the potential proinflammatory damage of reserpine. Interestingly， Jarras et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> reported that in mice gut -gastrointestinal symptoms are also common in Parkinsons disease- lesioned with 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1，2，3，6-Tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) they showed neuroprotection and immunomodulation of DA neurons (they had previously shown also neuroprotection in brain DA neurons；通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>).\n\nIn brief， we suspect (being careful of taking into account the great complexity ofthe first motor disorder in human beings) that， at least in early stages ofthe disease there could be a possible proinflammatory situation enhanced by some kind of oxidative stress that would be deleterious for-among others-DA neurons in substantia nigra. Based on the evidences， we suggest that neurotrophic factors could protect the neurons under dysfunctional state. In this sense， P. could be in|删除段之间换行|part responsible for stimulating such trophic factors； however， more studies become necessary to test this hypothesis. Actual efforts are underway to increase our understanding in this devastating disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Therefore， whenever an insufficient FLR function is predicted， different surgical techniques can be applied to reduce morbidity and mortality due to PHLF by promoting FLR function improvement prior to a major hepatic resection. Associating Liver Partition and Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy (ALPPS) constitutes one of the latest and promising technical advances among these|删除段之间换行|complex groups of surgical strategies. More recently， a less invasive ALPPS variant， Mini-ALPPS， has been described by our group minimizing the first stage impact to promote rapid patient recovery and leaving the main surgical procedure for the second stage， thus decreasing morbidity and mortality.\n\n【4】This report presents the case of a 41-year-old female patient who presented severe diarrhea due to a pancreatic functional gastrinoma with synchronic hepatic metastases. Preoperative assessment of FLR function through a newly developed dynamic measure calculated using Hepatobiliary Scintigraphy (HBS)-HIBA index- is described. The present case report underlines surgical management consisting of Mini-ALPPS procedure which allowed primary and secondary lesions to be fully resected.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nForty-one-year-old female patient without relevant prior medical history， who presented at our institution with episodic， watery， and sometimes explosive diarrhea consisting of approximately 10 to 15bowel movements per day， that had been gradually worsening over a 30-month period. The patient had undergone several uneffective empirical and symptomatic treatments at a different center. At our institution， clinical tests were performed， ruling out celiac disease and both bacterial and parasitic infections. Upper and lower endoscopies were performed. Lower endoscopy showed no relevant findings； whereas upper endoscopy revealed a hyperplastic polyp and mild chronic gastritis. Helicobacter pylori were not detected in the gastric biopsy. Consequently， a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) was prescribed (20 mg/day). Interestingly， her severe case of diarrhea improved after the first dose of omeprazole. Afterwards， with an etiological diagnostic purpose， an abdominal ultrasound was|删除段之间换行|performed which revealed multiple solid and hypoechoic liver nodules ranging from 45 mm to 20 mm in diameter. Subsequently， an abdominal multislice computed tomography was performed which confirmed numerous bilateral hepatic hypodense nodular lesions with prompt brief arterial hypervascularity and rapid wash-out during the portal venous phase. These images were compatible with secondary locations of a hidden primary malignant tumor . A magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed the known hepatic nodules as well as a 12 mm nodular image in the distal section of the body of the pancreas . Routine laboratory tests， serum Chromogranin A levels， serum tumor markers (cancer antigen 19-9， alpha-fetoprotein， and carcinoembryonic antigen) and urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were within normal parameters. However， serum gastrin was 2.100 pg/ml， with a normal reference value from 13 pg/ml to 115 pg/ml.\n\n【7】Based onthepresumptive diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome due to pancreatic gastrinoma with liver metastasis， a radical two-stage surgery was performed. Two weeks prior to the first-stage surgery， the patient received one dose of intramuscular octreotide long-acting release.\n\nDuring the first stage a distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Moreover， the hepatic metastatic disease was approached as well， by performing the first procedure of Mini-ALLPS technique as previously described by our group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Distal pancreatectomy was carried out with a mechanical lineal suture(Echelon Flex” Endopath’ Stapler. Ethicon， Johnson & Johnson， New Jersey， U.S.) With Gore Seamguardbioabsorbable staple line reinforcement (W. L. Gore &Associates， Inc.， Delaware， U.S.) . Simultaneously， the first procedure of Mini-ALLPS consisted of|删除段之间换行|partial liver partition through a line that is marked in the proximities of the falciform ligament insertion， FLR clean-up using “corkscrew technique\"by resecting 6 metastases on segments II， III， and IV and intraoperative right portal vein embolization with Histoacryl (Braun GmbH， Kronberg im Taunus， Germany) . Two surgical drains were left in place and subsequently removed on postoperative day 5 after having obtained a normal amylase level in drainage fluid. Eight days after the first stage， a multislice computed tomography was performed which showed the expected postoperative modifications：Hyperdense images in the hepatic right lobe compatible with previous intraoperative right portal vein embolization. No new lesions were observed in the left liver. A hypodense image with air bubbles corresponding to partial transection of the liver parenchyma was observed . The patient was discharged on postoperative day 9 without complications.\n\n【9】In order to prevent PHLF and based on the notion that FLR volume is not equivalent and sometimes overestimates FLR function， a HBS using 99mTc-mebrofenin was performed to assess FLR function. As previously described by our group， the HIBA-index was used to estimate the risk of PHLF (being the risk higher if HIBA-index was <15%). During the first HBS performed 10 days after the first stage， functional analysis through single photon emission computed tomography revealed a FLR function/total liver function of 21%， while HIBA index was 14.76% and Amsterdam index was0.76% min/m. Consequently， the second stage was postponed. A second HBS was performed 30 days after the first stage revealing a FLR/total liver function of 25%，HIBA index of 17% and Amsterdam index of 0.8% min/m.\n\nThe second stage procedure was carried out 51 days after the first stage and it consisted of a right hepatectomy . Once|删除段之间换行|again， the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6 without complications or signs of PHLF.\n\n【11】Histopathological analysis ofthe surgical specimen corresponding to the first stage procedure revealed a pancreatic well differentiated pNET (G2， Ki 67 12%)，6 liver metastasis and one metastatic lymph node out of 9 resected lymph nodes. The right liver resected during the second stage presented metastatic lesions from NET as well.\n\nOne month and a half after the second stage surgery a follow-up|删除段之间换行|abdominal multislice computed tomography was performed which revealed normal postoperative changes .\n\n【13】The patient is currently receiving a monthly dose of intramuscular octreotide long-acting release. To the date， four months after her primary first-stage procedure， the patient remains with good clinical evolution without evidence of disease.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Gastrinomas make up 16% to 30% of functional pNETs and hyper-secretegastrin resulting in Zollinger Ellison syndrome， the classic symptoms of which are refractory peptic ulcer disease and secretory diarrhea. Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time and， frequently， its etiological diagnosis entails a trying task 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， when it presents associated with acid-related peptic disease and improves after prescription of proton pump inhibitors， functional NETs such as gastrinoma， must be ruled out.\n\nMetastases are detected at diagnosis in about 40% to 80% of patients with pNETs. Surgery remains the treatment of choice in selected patients with pNETs and resectable liver metastases， because it may provide cure. Primary tumor resection combined with neuroendocrine liver metastasectomy may have either curative intent， when complete resection is possible， or palliative intent， when the majority of the tumor burden is removed to control the symptoms of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Liver resection for neuroendocrine metastases is associated to long-term survival advantages and disease control. Furthermore， this incremental increase in survival time has been described to have occurred regardless of tumor grade. According to guidelines and related studies， the minimum criteria for cytoreductive surgery of liver-metastatic pNETs are as follows：1) G1/G2 liver-metastatic pNET； 2) the primary is resectable； 3) no unresectable extrahepatic disease； 4) younger patients with an acceptable morbidity and low mortality； 5) tumor volume with <25%liver involvement； 6) up to 90% or at least >70% of tumor load is thought to be resectable preoperatively； and 7) treatment decision|删除段之间换行|making requires a multidisciplinary approach；8) either one-stage or two-stage surgery may be recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Post-hepatectomy liver failure remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after major liver resection. Although the etiology of PHLF is multifactorial， an inadequate functional liver remnant is thought to be the most important modifiable predictor of PHLF. For people with a normal liver， an FLR ≥ 25% of total liver volume is adequate to avoid PHLF. Patients with chronic liver disease but without cirrhosis usually require an FLR of at least 30%while patients with cirrhosis but without portal hypertension require an FLR of at least 40%. A shift toward parenchymal-preserving operations has led to a decrease in morbidity and mortality， with excellent oncologic outcomes even in patients with significant disease burden in the liver. Parenchymal-preserving liver surgery is ideal for these well-encapsulated tumors. Non-anatomic resections in combination with ablation offer comparable oncologic results in small tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Two-staged hepatectomies also provide a feasible resective approach for these patients. Moreover， ALPPS， a novel technique first described by Schnitzbauer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> in 2012， thoroughly accelerates FLR hypertrophy increasing the feasibility to complete both stages. As originally described， the technique consists of right portal vein ligation combined with in situ splitting ofliver parenchyma during the first stage， followed by a second stage(resective procedure) performed at surgeon discretion after assessing FLR sufficiency， usually within 7 to 10 days. In 2016， our group put forward a new surgical paradigm for ALPPS called“Mini-ALLPS”， aiming to maximally reduce the aggressiveness and surgical impact of ALPPS first stage. The proposal incorporated the combination of Partial Parenchymal Transection (PPT) with Intraoperative Portal Vein Embolization (IPVE) as well as minimum liver mobilization， without hilar dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This approach proves useful in cases such as the one presented in this review， where considerable bilobar hepatic disease requires FLR clean-up and functional enhancement， apart from primary pancreatic tumor resection.\n\n【18】FLR function assessment before indicating a mayor hepatic resection or to postpone second-step surgery until satisfactory activity has been reached， is key to the success of this complex procedure. Dynamic 99mTc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy was developed as a quantitative method for evaluating total and regional liver function， including FRL function. In 2017， Serenari et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> described inter stage assessment of FLR function in ALLPS using HBS and found that HIBA index a newly developed dynamic measure representing the proportion of radionuclide accumulated in the FLR- of <15% to best predict clinically significant PHLF in patients with an already sufficient FLR volume.\n\n【19】To summarize， this case comprises at least three uncommon and/or novel subjects. Firstly， the unusual diagnosis of a pNET after a two-year history of misdiagnosed diarrhea. A high level of diagnostic suspicion must be maintained when pNETs are involved， since their early diagnosis allows for the treatment of a localized disease rather than an advanced one， with the management and technical vicissitudes that this brings about， for the patient， the medical team and the health system.\n\nSecondly， primary pancreatic tumor resection associated with two-stage hepatectomy is a challenging but feasible approach in this type of metastatic disease. Patients with advanced pNETs without extrahepatic involvement benefit greatly from RO resection and the Mini-ALLPS technique proves a useful tool to achieve this goal； its|删除段之间换行|primary advantages being： 1) A less aggressive first stage which allows the patient to recover rapidly and uneventfully， 2) induced FLR hypertrophy through PPT and IPVE， and 3) a second stage facilitated by lesser perihepatic and hilar inflammation.\n\n【21】Lastly， in extended liver resections， function rather than volume alone， should dictate the minimal FLR Preoperative or interstage measurement of 99mTc-mebrofenin uptake in the FLR on functional HBShas proved more valuable than measurement ofthe volume ofthe future remnant in the assessment of the post hepatectomy risk of liver failure and liver failure-related mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Using HIBA index， the parameter developed by our group， with a 15% cut-off value， second-stage surgery can be postponed until a safe FLR function is achieved in order to reduce the risk of PHLF.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】In conclusion liver metastatic pNETs can be approached through an aggressive RO resection with curative intent as long as a meticulous appraisal of FLR function is conducted to ensure the patient's postoperative safe and uneventful recovery.\n\n【24】When pNETs are involved， early diagnosis allows a higher rate of respectability. Primary pancreatic tumor resection associated with two-stage hepatectomy is a feasible approach when managing metastatic pNETs. In order to prevent PHLF， using HIBA index and second-stage surgery can be postponed until a safe FLR function is achieved.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Within this group， one of the most frequent lesions is pancreatic serous cystadenoma. Usually， this is a benign pathology， with very low risk for malignancy.\n\n【3】We present a case of a woman， operated on because ofa long-standing pancreatic lesion， with a pathological diagnosis of serous microcystic pancreatic cystadenoma.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 69-year-old female patient， diabetic， with a tumor on the head of the pancreas， compatible with serous pancreatic cystadenoma， negative cytology for malignancy and negative tumor markers， which conditions compression of the stomach and duodenum causing abdominal pain and abdominal bloating. An abdominal mass was palpated on physical examination. The abdominal CT and MRI revealed a huge heterogeneous lesion in the head of the pancreas， well-defined contours， multiloculated， moderately hyperintense in sequences with long TR and hypointense in T1， parietal and septal enhancement . In upper gastrointestinal endoscopic ultrasound showed a lesion of more than 9 cm in the head of the pancreas， formed by microcysts giving the typical honeycomb image.

Its prevalence is estimated between 2.6% to 15%of cystic lesions， increasing its incidence with age. It also represents 1% of pancreatic neoplasms通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. The most common are mucinous cystic neoplasms， serous cystadenoma， mucinous papillary intraductal neoplasms， and solid-papillary cystic neoplasms. The main challenge is to differentiate the lesions that will benefit from a conservative management from those that require surgical treatment due to their potential for malignancy.\n\nIn the European evidence-based guidelines on pancreatic cystic neoplasms published in 2018， it is established， with a high degree of recommendation， that MRI is the gold standard test for diagnosis and follow-up of this entity. It is especially useful to identify the possible communication between the main pancreatic duct and the cyst as well as the presence of mural nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. CT|删除段之间换行|should be considered when disseminated disease is suspected， or vascular involvement， or in the differential diagnosis of pseudocysts in chronic pancreatitis. The performance of an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy allows a better characterization of the lesion and allows to do a biopsy for histological analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【11】One of the most frequent is serous cystadenoma， the second most frequent pancreatic cystic tumor of this pathology. Its prevalence is estimated around 10% to 16%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-10\\]</u>. It is considered a benign tumor， which originates from the centroacinar cells of the pancreas. The risk of malignant progression is very low， less than 1% of cases are malignant serous cystadenomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In a multinational study， Jais et al. includes the largest cohort of patients diagnosed with pancreatic serous cystadenoma， which includes 2，622 cases， and only 0.1% were diagnosed with pancreatic serous cystadenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【12】It predominantly affects women， around 75%， with a mean age at diagnosis between 58 to 65 years，according to the series \\[7，9，10，121.\n\n【13】Most of serous cystadenoma are asymptomatic but depending on the location of the tumor and its size， symptoms such as abdominal pain， jaundice or episodes of acute pancreatitis may appear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，12\\]</u>. Jais et al. in their article， around 61% of the cases were asymptomatic.

They are usually located in the body and tail of the pancreas， although they can be located in any part of the pancreas删除4-1:<u>7，10，12</u>.\n\n【15】Morphologically， four different types can be established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，12\\]</u>. The most frequent variety is microcystic， characterized by presenting multiple cysts smaller than 2 cm separated by fibrous septa， which gives it a typical “honeycomb”image and， in some cases， an area of fibrosis or central calcification can be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and they are usually found in the body-tail of the pancreas. The next most frequent is the oligocystic or macrocystic type， which shows cysts in a smaller number than the previous one but larger in size and they are commonly located in the pancreatic head. There is a mixed variety among those previously described and finally， the variety of solid cystadenoma， characterized by a single cyst with a solid appearance with enhancement on CT but histologically they are serous cystadenomas.\n\n【16】Despite advances in imaging tests， the definitive diagnosis can be difficult， so the main goal is to identify those cystic lesions that are malignant or those which could progress into a malignant lesion. For this， the combination of at least two imaging techniques (CT and MRI) are useful.

CEA and amylase levels will be low in intracystic fluid. In fact， high levels of CEA almost completely rule out serous cystadenoma and would be reason to consider another entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.

It was found on admission that the patient had had psoriasis vulgaris； the patient had no therapy for six years and he had no regular checkups. Due to progression and high CT scan severity score and elevated serum IL-6， the decision was made to administer the patient tocilizumab. Upon administration， psoriatic lesions were in retreat. Even though there are some reports describing tocilizumab induced psoriasis， some studies have demonstrated a high level of IL-6 in psoriatic plaques. Therefore， therapies that disrupt IL-6 signaling could be a treatment option for psoriasis.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 38-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with bilateral pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. On admission， the patient’s history showed that he had had psoriasis vulgaris for eight years. At the time of disease onset， the patient went to a dermatologist where he was prescribed methotrexate. As the patient reported， he was in remission while using this drug. However， six years ago， he stopped taking the therapy and stopped going to regular checkups. With no therapy， the disease was active again. On admission， the physical examination revealed well-demarcated， non-coherent， silvery plaques overlying a glossy homogeneous erythema on extremities and trunk.\n\n【4】The patient also reported fever， fatigue and cough a few days before the admission. He was prescribed vitamins and antipyretic by his general practitioner， but he was not feeling better. On the day of the admission， he was examined in our hospital and the X-ray imaging revealed bilateral pneumonia. Inflammation markers were elevated (CRP 113 mg/L) and nasopharyngeal swab was taken for a PCR analysis to a SARS-CoV-2. As a part of the regular procedure for physical examination， oximetry was performed， and the patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was about 95%， so he was given oxygen support. During the hospital stay， he was prescribed therapy as per COVID-19 guidelines and it included intravenous antibiotics， probiotics， vitamins and low molecular weight heparin. The following morning， during the regular visiting round， it was observed that the patient wasn’t clinically and subjectively better， so it was decided to perform a CT scan of thorax. This diagnostic procedure confirmed bilateral interstitial pneumonia in progression with a CT severity score 17 out of 25. This score indicated that the pneumonia was severe and IL-6 blood analysis was done. Serum IL-6 was elevated (50.84 pg/mL)， so our anesthesiologist coordinator was consulted about the next step. The decision was made to administer tocilizumab i.v.(in recommended dose 8 mg/kg). Two days after the administration oftocilizumab， the patient was clinically and subjectively better， inflammation markers in laboratory analysis showed a drop while the psoriatic lesions were in retreat . The ongoing hospital stay was without complications and the patient's peripheral oxygen saturation was about 98% without oxygen support. Ten days later， the patient was discharged from the hospital.

It is an approved biologic medication for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Several cases of tocilizumab induced psoriasis have been described do far. Studies about these|删除段之间换行|unwanted events imply that approximately ten to fifteen days after the induction dose of tocilizumab， psoriatic plaques developed (skin biopsies confirmed diagnosis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Tocilizumab-induced psorias is was suspected and the treatment was stopped while the psoriatic lesions resolved quickly with corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. One report showed that after the administration of intravenous tocilizumab， as a therapy for rheumatoid arthritis， psoriatic-like lesions developed (lesion biopsy was not performed because the patient's consent was not obtained)； however， on administration of subcutaneous tocilizumab on same patient， as higher doses of tocilizumab could be administered by subcutaneous injection rather than by intravenous injection， also shortening the dosing interval， psoriatic-like lesions improved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【8】On the other hand， there is a report about a young woman with juvenile idiopathic arthritis who was given etanercept but it induced psoriasiform skin lesions diagnosed by skin biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Because of this adverse reaction to etanercept， intravenous tocilizumab was induced in the therapy and four weeks later， an improvement was observed in the skin lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

Therefore， we propose here to use an inexpensive fiberscope as an endoscope for cow in the barn.\n\n【15】Experimental\n\nand reproduction in any medium， provided the original work is properly|删除段之间换行|cited.\n\nIn this study， the inexpensive endoscope developed by NIDAGE was used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This endoscope has two cameras with a pixel count of 1980x1080 installed at the tip and side. Thus images of both the external uterine ostium and vaginal wall can be acquired at the same time. This number of pixels|删除段之间换行|corresponds to a Full-HD image， and an endoscope image can be acquired as a photo and a movie. In addition， it has a total of 7 LEDs on the tip and side， allowing taking bright images of the inside of the vagina. Since this endoscope has a waterproof function equivalent to IP67， it can be safely used even in the vaginal environment.\n\n【18】It is difficult to take single photo during diagnosis using endoscope， because this diagnosis is huge burden on the cow. Therefore， we limited the diagnosis time within 1 min in total. Hence we shot a video and saved as MPEG4 file， and then， Adobe Premiere Pro  was used for taking single photo image (JPEG file). It was possible to acquire single photo image with Windows Media Player as well， but the image quality deteriorated significantly and it was not possible to obtain images of blood vessels.\n\n【19】ImageJ-win64 (free software) was used to decompose the single photo image into RGB signals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. As you select Color-Split Channel from Image icon， the JPEG file will be split into R， G and B files. Since hemoglobin strongly absorbs G and B light， blood vessels appear as dark color.\n\n【20】In order to further improve the contrast of the blood vessel image due to the absorption of hemoglobin light， the G and B images were combined using RegiStax V6 (free software) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. You select G and B JPEG image files， and then， perform set aligns points， align and limit are automatic process work. The image misalignment will be automatically corrected and the composed image will be displayed. Finally， stacked (composed) image can save the composited image.\n\n【21】Results and Discussion\n\n【22】A stick fixed with an endoscope and a mucus collection tool was inserted into the vagina of an estrus cow in the barn. Figure 1 (White) shows an image of the external uterine ostium. This image was saved from a video file obtained by endoscope. It was clearly seen that the external uterine ostium illuminated by white light. Next， the images obtained by decomposing the white image into RGB are shown as Red， green， and blue images in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. Red image illustrated the distribution of minor blood vessels that seemed to be capillaries. Green and blue images depicted the distribution of thick blood vessels in the folds of external uterine ostium.\n\n【23】The composed images of green and blue images of the external uterine ostium and the vaginal wall are shown in Figure删除4:<u> 2</u>. Thick blood vessels could be clearly observed. Image of the vaginal wall also showed blood vessels and it was different from white image.\n\n【24】In estrus cows， the blood flow increases due to the excitement， and the endometrium looks reddish as a whole. We believe that the blood flow can be seen in the amount of hemoglobin in the blood vessels as a result of the increase in the activity of cow.\n\n【25】Currently， it is attempted the prediction of the estrus period by accurately grasping the estrous cycle from diagnostic imaging and monitoring of pregnancy signal substances. We hope that diagnostic imaging can be used as the primary screening for the diagnosis of pregnancy.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】In this study， it is attempted to observe blood vessels in the external uterine ostium and vaginal wall of cow using an inexpensive endoscope. It was possible to obtain an endoscopic image more easily than the method using a conventional large-sized endoscopic image processing device. Since the blood vessel image could be clarified by image processing， it can be expected to be used for the primary screening for the diagnosis of pregnancy in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The patient's case was studied 13 months after DC through high-resolution CT， assessing brain， skull and scalp data， that were used for virtual Three-Dimensional (3D) analysis and planning， in order to produce hypoprojected PEEK implants that prevented both an excessive tension on the severelyscarred scalp and an excessive intracranial dead space. The patient was treated with a one-stage cranioplasty that reconstructed 208 cm’ of the cranial vault while obtaining tensionless scalp closure； a total of 46cm² of skull surface in the lower temporal areas were left unreconstructed as they could work as a warning sign for the rise of ICP in case of swelling. The 12-months follow-up showed satisfactory aesthetic and structural results.\n\n【3】Discussion： Whether it’s for treatment of the syndrome of the trephined or for aesthetic purposes， the need to reconstruct calvarial defects remains a challenge， especially for very large defects (>150cm’) which are rarely described in literature. To overcome the potential intra- and extracranial complications to the procedure， available surface-guided CAD-CAM programming represents an optimal solution.\n\n【4】Conclusion： In this report， use ofundercorrection in planning and finalizing subtotal custom-made cranioplasty， appears able to restore skull integrity and aesthetics while avoiding excessive skin tension and reducing intracranial dead space.\n\n【5】Keywords： Cranioplasty； Subtotal cranioplasty； Custom-made cranioplasty； Decompressive craniectomy； Traumatic brain injury\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】In cases of large skull defects， reconstruction currently represents a necessity， with the aim to provide structural protection for the underlying brain， a barrier against infection， and the solution to correct aesthetic deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These skull defects are frequently the result of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) -related Decompressive Craniectomy (DC)； in other cases， craniectomy is performed due to intracranial aneurysm， Arteriovenous Malformations (AVM)， cerebral abscess， ischemic stroke-related cerebral edema， and tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Since ancient history， great efforts have been made to solve the problem of skull defects， but it was only after World War I that cranioplasties were performed in greater number 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Between the reasons that support reconstruction， the main one is undoubtedly the treatment of the Syndrome of the Trephined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> which consists in the rapid neurological deterioration while changing the posture of the patient is specific positions (from orthostatic to horizontal or Trendelenburg position)， together with modifications of Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). In these patients， cranioplasty has a therapeutic effect in preventing these sudden neurological symptoms by avoiding the flaccid scalp portion covering the cranial defect from being sensitive to atmospheric pressure， causing direct force over the cortex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thanks to the vast knowledge of materials and design refinements while programming a Computer-Aided Design and Computer-\n\n【9】Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) cranioplasty， it is now possible to perform subtotal cranioplasties， although uneventful results still represent a challenge. This work has been reported in line with the Scare Criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】Informed written consent was obtained from the patient’s legal guardian for the writing and publication of this case report. A22-year-old patient was sent to the Emergency Room of our IIIlevel University Hospital 1 h after a 7-meter fall from a roof while working. Neurological examination assessed a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 6， and the patient underwent a brain CT scan  that showed bilateral cerebral swelling with multiple cerebral contusions and a suspected intracranial right carotid artery rupture.\n\n【12】He was transferred to the emergency operating room and under general anesthesia， he underwent right temporoparietal DC. After 24 h， the patient’s Intracranial Pressure (ICP) was still high(23 mmHg) and a left temporoparietal DC was performed . The patient’s Glasgow Coma Scale score was 6 on postoperative day 11 and continued until discharge. Due to the trauma， the patient suffered irreversible traumatic brain damage， and despite the DC， a long-term outcome of Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E)=2 was assessed.\n\n【13】The patient suffered 3 episodes of skin flap dehiscence along different parts of the surgical incisions， that healed by secondary intention with the aid of medicated dressings.\n\n【14】A High-Resolution CT of the craniomaxillofacial complex was acquired (Siemens SOMATOM Definition AS+， Siemens， Erlangen， Germany)， assessing both the brain and the skull data ， which were processed using Materialise's Interactive Medical Image\n\n【15】Control System 10.0 (Materialise， Leuven， Belgium).\n\n【16】All data regarding the surface of preoperative and postoperative cranial defect were acquired， together with the scalp surface and the intracranial dead space between the brain and the scalp. Using this data， 16 months after decompressive craniotomy， the patient underwent bilateral Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) custom-made cranioplasty (implants were fabricated by 3dific， Perugia， Italy) for the skull defect along the original incision approach . After discharge， the patient was checked at the 1-week， 2-weeks 1-month， 6and 12 months clinical and radiological follow-up.\n\n【17】The data details regarding the area of skull surface reconstructed\n\n| Skull surface before DC  | 651 cm²  | Skull surface after DC  | 397 cm²  | Skull surface after cranioplasty  | 605 cm²  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Scalp surface before DC  | 686 cm2  | Scalp surface after DC - multiple flap dehiscenceevents  | 663cm2  | Scalp surtace after cranioplasty  | 664 cm2  |\n|  | /  | /  | /  | Total area reconstructed  | 208 cm²  |\n|  |  | 7  | /  | Area left unreconstructed  | 46 cm2  |\n\n【19】are summarized in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. The data acquired from the CT scan prior to the cranioplasty and processed with virtual Three-Dimensional(3D) analysis showed a total cranium surface of 397 cm， compared to 605 cm\"after surgery， with the implants representing a total of 208cm’ of skull surface. Bilaterally， in the temporal region， a total of 46cm’were non-reconstructed for reasons that will be discussed below. The patient did not show any complications related to cranioplasty and was discharged 7 days after surgery. Atthe 12-months clinical and radiological control ，noimplantloosening or dislocation were noted， and the aesthetic aspect and the structural strength of the cranium were restored.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Under the circumstances of brain insults， such as trauma or intracranial hemorrhage， inflammatory cascade， impaired osmolyte transport and oxidative stress， combined to the eventual direct injury， lead to serious brain swelling and subsequent damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It is not a coincidence， in fact， that the first neurosurgical operation performed was indeed a trephination， performed by the Incas over 3000 years ago，probably with the purpose to treat the consequences of a trauma. However， we will have to wait the sixteenth century to see the first description of a cranioplasty， done by a Flemish physician named Fallopius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\nIn modern times， treatment of such harmful events as TBI|删除段之间换行|includes， in the first instance， DC together with a specific medical treatment and， in the case of really extended TBI， bifrontal or bilateral craniectomy is advised. Even though current guidelines do not specify nor the extension of the craniectomy neither the optimal time to perform subsequent cranioplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， some authors suggest that at least 60 cm² of cranial vault should be removed for DC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>and Hawryluk et al. conclude that a large fronto-parieto-temporal (15 cm in diameter) DC should be preferred over a smaller DC in order to reduce mortality and improve neurological outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【23】However， whether it’s for treatment of the syndrome of the trephined or for aesthetic purposes， the need to reconstruct calvarial defects remains a challenge， especially for very large defects (>150cm) which are rarely described in literature.\n\n【24】Historically， replacement of the patient's stored autologous bone flap has represented the first-line treatment for reparation of post-decompressive skull defects， usually taking place between 6 and 12months after surgery. However， complications like bone resorption， infection or chronic scalp wounds can result in a composite skull defect that should be approached by alternate means 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Nowadays， multiple options for restoring skull integrity following DC or previous autologous bone repositioning failure have been described， and in these cases， reconstruction planning should consider previous scalp incisions， to avoid scalp vessel damage that could bring to necrosis. Moreover， a thorough study of the scalp surface available should be performed， to obtain a tensionless closure. In an article of Nout et al. a CAD-CAM implant for parietal reconstruction was slightly decreased in projection， in order to facilitate wound closure通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In these cases， CAD-CAM surface measurement can help predict the total skull surface before and after surgery， allowing to prevent potential complications such as skin dehiscence， or in cases when it is most suitable， to suggest the need for free soft tissue transfer or scalp expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， as advised by Baumeister et al.\n\nAnother important factor to consider for a successful cranioplasty is the choice of the material， which should be carefully made： A recent systematic review reported a 20.64% risk of complications with alloplastic materials， but each of them has advantages and disadvantages that must be considered. Titanium offers low rates of infection (10.7%) and can be easily screwed directly to the adjacent bone； however， it has a higher extrusion rate compared to the|删除段之间换行|other materials， and being radiopaque， it gives problems for tumor surveillance follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Polyether Ether Ketone (PEEK) offers the advantage that it is radiolucent and hypodense and does not cause radiographic artifacts on CT scans or MRIs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. It has a 7.3%infection rate and a lower overall complication rate (17.3% vs. 31.8%for titanium). Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) implants benefit from this material's strength， radiolucency and relatively low cost compared to the others. Prostheses made of PMMA can be modified intraoperatively using a bur， but， during handling and fixation， cases of prosthesis fracture are described， and account for an overall complication rate of 19% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【27】In our patient， a large bilateral DC was performed， bringing the total calvarial defect to 254 cm. Due to this impressive bilateral defect， which represented approximately 40% of the total neurocranium， the patient had to rest only in supine position， causing a high risk of pressure sores and making it difficult to move the patient during bed changes or daily hygiene. For these reasons， the patient could not be left to the care of his family and had to stay at along-term care facility.\n\n【28】In the months following DC， several episodes of skin flap dehiscence along different parts of the surgical incisions occurred， treated by the neurosurgery and plastic surgery units. After complete healing of the scalp dehiscence， the maxillofacial surgery team was asked to reconstruct the calvarial defect， and with the aid of an engineering team， started programming the reconstruction， and two possible complications were highlighted. The first one is related to the skin quality and its surface； after several episodes of flap dehiscence， the skin resulted heavily scarred， thickened and contracted. The second potential complication is given by the dead space that would follow a cranioplasty which brings the calvaria to its original shape， while the brain would maintain its post-traumatic volume. Free tissue transfer was at first considered as a possible solution； it offers several benefits， including providing durable coverage for skull reconstruction， obliteration of dead space， and is of great benefit in revision cranioplasty patients with chronic overlying wounds lacking adequate soft tissue coverage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. However， free tissue transfer often limits the retention of native hair-bearing scalp skin at the defect site and would have necessitated a two-step surgery for both bringing soft tissue and calvarial custom reconstruction. Moreover，the relatives of the patient denied their consent to the free flap option to preserve a potential donor site from further surgery on such a delicate patient， and they preferred for us to find a solution for the problem without harvesting a free flap.\n\nIn order to overcomethe potential complications to the procedure， the program of developing adequate implants for cranioplasty firstly focused on the scalp surface， that was measured in the 3D rendering of the TC， giving an estimate of the scalp available (663 cm²). With this data， the biparietal implants for cranioplasty were designed to utilize all the skin surface available for cranioplasty without stretching the already scarred parietal skin， obtaining an undercorrected skull surface . Another concept that was taken into consideration was the volume of the dead space between the implant and the brain； by undercorrecting the custom-made implants， the amount of dead space was dramatically lowered. Despite the large area reconstructed with cranioplasty， thelower portion of the temporal area on both sides|删除段之间换行|was not covered by the implant ， since due to the presence of the zygomatic arch， it was the safest area to leave unreconstructed and could work as a warning sign for the rise of ICP in case of swelling.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】Cranioplasty oflarge calvarial defects with poor soft tissue quality represents a challenge in which the surgeon could need to think\"outside the box\" to solve the problem he is put in front of. We have achieved durable aesthetic and functional results in this setting using undercorrected CAD-CAM PEEK implants for reconstruction，both reducing the risk of skin dehiscence and drastically reducing the intracranial dead space. For these patients， an accurate planning， that takes into consideration both soft and hard tissues is paramount. Further investigations are needed to better examine the long-term results of undercorrected CAD-CAM in cranioplasty patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

However， these PSG studies require high costs withal long waiting time for appointments due to the limited number of sleep laboratories despite the presence of increasing demand 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Respiratory stability of subjects can be easily monitorized and recorded with overnight PO in home conditions.

Fortunately， it seems that a new promising opportunity arises with the wide usage of Smartphone's (SP) and their applications(apps) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Recently， program creators have presented several SP apps to record snoring sounds during sleep.Some of these apps can convert the recorded data to the numerical values and provide a|删除段之间换行|snore score using a special algorithm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Despite the wide availability and ease of usage， only one in vitro study has been published about sleep apps yet 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The present case report was aimed to describe utilization of a novel home-based evaluation technique that was consisted of sleep app and PO in short-term follow-up of Mandibular Advancement Device (MAD) therapy applied for a moderate OSA patient with habitual snoring.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 43 year-old Caucasian male patient was referred to the otolaryngology， head and neck surgery clinic ofour hospital with the complaint of severe snoring， witnessed apnea and excessive daytime sleepiness. In clinical interview， he reported he had a serious traffic accident one year ago caused by daytime sleepiness. The patient’s history did not contain any systemic disorders， cigarette smoking and alcohol or drug abuse.\n\n【13】On the physical examination， the waist and neck circumferences and body mass index of the patient were 108 cm， 42 cm， and 29.8kg/m²respectively. Not any signs were detected during temporomandibular joint examination. On intraoral examination， presence of elongated soft palate， moderate macroglossia and slightly narrowed oropharynx were noted. Oropharengeal relationship of the patient was classified as Class 4 according to the Mallampati scale. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale (EPSS) was 16 and the provisional diagnosis was OSA. Thus， overnight PSG evaluation was required for definitive diagnosis.\n\n【14】According to the medical history， the patient had been referred to a sleep laboratory by a chest physician two years ago. However， having had difficulty in falling asleep and felt discomfort arising from cables and electrodes he had left the test unfinished. Therefore， it was decided to perform overnight PO recording at home in order to check his cardiorespiratory stability during sleep. In addition， snoring monitorization was planned concurrent with the PO recordings. Thus， a sleep app (SnoreLab， Reviva Soft works Ltd， London， UK) was downloaded and set as the creators'instructions. To obtain the most accurate data， the noise level of the patients' bedroom was checked with a sound level meter (LM-8102， Lutron Ltd， Taipei， Taiwan) and conveniences of the room conditions were confirmed. The patient was informed in detail about the working principals of the PO and the app. The Smartphone (IPhone 4S， Apple， CA， USA) was switched and the app was activated before sleep. Finally， the PO (Beurer PO80， Beurer Medical， Ulm， Germany) was inserted by a sleep technician and overnight recordings were performed at the patient’s home. In total， three recordings were executed in order to minimize the error margin.

Impressions were made with irreversible hydrocolloid material (CA37， Cavex， Haarlem， Holland) and the master casts were obtained from Type III dental stone (Moldano， Heraeus Kulzer， Hanau， Germany). Maxillary and mandibular occlusal splints were manufactured with Autopolymerising Clear Acrylic Resin Material (ACARM) (Ortocryl， Dentaurum， Ispringen， Germany) on isolated master models such as to cover occlusal and incisal surfaces of the existing dentition. Prepared splints were inserted in the mouth and adjusted on dental arches. Afterwards，intermaxillary relationship was recorded at 75% of maximal mandibular protrusion and intraoral records were mounted on a semi-adjustable articulator (Artex Type NK， Amann Girrbach， Pforzheim，Deutschland). The vertical openingamount was increased up to 10 mm，approximately. Maxillary and mandibular splints were|删除段之间换行|attached to each other using ACARM and finishing procedures were performed. After intraoral adjustments， the MAD was delivered to the patient with recommendations. Three Follow-Up Recordings(FRs) were performed at the end of the 6th month of the MAD treatment. The same recording procedure applied in the DRs was also performed during Frs. Insertion of the MAD during sleep was the only difference between DRs and FRs protocols. The results of the last snoring recording were shown in the Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\nAt the end of the six months follow-up period， the EPSS of the patient dramatically decreased at删除4:<u> 3</u>. The mean ODI of the patient was improved significantly with the MAD therapy. In addition， significant improvement in HRV was observed with the MAD therapy. Moreover， therapeutic effect of the MAD was recorded successfully with the sleep app. All snore scores obtained by the sleep app showed|删除段之间换行|highly compatible alterations both with EPSS and PO values. Not any serious complaints were reported by the patient except dry mouth that generally occurred in mornings.\n\n【25】Discussion\n\n【26】According to our knowledge， this is the first report describing the utilization of a sleep app and PO in the management of a moderate OSA patient with habitual snoring. Gradually increasing usage of the PO in sleep studies can be observed from the current literature， and its diagnostic value has been qualified by previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. However， there exist some studies notifying the variable sensitivity of PO according to the severity of the OSA. Chung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> stated that PO recordings could be more sensitive for the patients having ODI above 10 (93%). The reason of the highly coherent ODI values obtained from three DRs could be arisen from the moderate severity of the OSA in the present case. In fact， three ODI values obtained from the DRs was extremely close to each other. However， a little less proximity was detected among ODI values obtained from FRS Nevertheless； strong and coherent relations was seen among EPSS， PO and sleep app values in terms of DRs and FRS Moreover， EPSS， PO and sleep app values dramatically decreased in chorus at the end of six months.\n\nAs seen in the present case， snoring may be the foremost signs of OSA directing the patients to seek a medical assistance. However， there is no agreement in the literature on the accuracy of snoring severity predicted with the provided information by bed partners. In fact， objective findings may affect the treatment planning of patients or have an importance for avoiding elective surgical interventions通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In the present case， simultaneous decrease in EPSS， IDO， HRV and snoring scores displayed not only treatment efficiency of the MAD therapy for a moderate OSA patients， but also problem solving capacity of sleep apps on the existence of an objective method to score the snoring severity of subjects in home conditions. Thus，using a sleep app in the scoring of snoring severity may be an option for the home based sleep studies at the foreseeable future. However， some unknown titles should be made clear to take yet another turn， as previously stated by Stipping et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Numerous brand of SP with different hardware and software have been presented in market up to now. Thus， structural properties of the Smartphone's can be quite varied from each other’s and their recording quality may be affected from these variations. In addition， some of them may record human|删除段之间换行|snoring sounds more effectively than the others. However， there are not any comprehensive studies in the literature which responds to these queries， yet. Therefore， absence of data about the reliability and repeatability of sleep apps algorithms should be fulfilled.\n\n【28】Unfortunately， an in vivo study about the usage of sleep apps has not been published yet. Thus， impossibility of making a comparison is one of the most important limitations of the present case study. However， absence of any PSG data， which can be enabled the verification of obtained results， is the major limitation of the present case. Additionally， findings of this single case cannot be extended to all related population. Therefore， present findings need to be verified by further studies conducted with inclusion of more participants. Moreover， not only sufficiency of widely used SPs but also accuracy and repeatability of existing sleep apps should be evaluated with further studies. More preferably， standard PSG evaluations can be used to constitute a reference point to compare accuracy and repeatability of both SPs and sleep apps. Despite it is as yet too early to make a definite decision， using a sleep app in the scoring of snore sounds seems like a promising innovation for the future sleep studies to be executed in home conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Thelong-term goal is restoration of function but in the short-term we often focus on obtaining adequate soft tissue coverage.\n\n【2】These injuries， when untreated or poorly managed， lead to sequela and limitations that are often irreparable， causing great harm to the economicaly active population.\n\n【3】There are many techniques described in the literature for wound coverage and normally， the most common options are free flaps， skin grafts， Vacuum-Assisted Closure (VAC) dressings and“second intention healing\". Different factors must be considered when choosing one surgical technique over another， especially the pattern of lesion， patient， surgeon and institution. However， many techniques are not reproducible in other locations due to the cost and population type.\n\n【4】On our case report， we describe a fairly cheap and effective treatment used on a patient with a severe soft tissue injury on the dorsum ofthe foot.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】In January 2022，21 years-old male was involved in a motorcycle accident with an important soft tissue injury on the dorsum of the left foot， associated with an open dislocation of the Chopart(midtarsal) joint. He was first treated at another institution to approach the open dislocation 14 days before admission in our institution.\n\n【7】At our facility we observed a 14 cm × 8 cm wound covered by dry necrosis and important exsudate， in addition to medial and plantar wounds， sutured in the previous hospital . After the X-ray trauma series for foot and ankle， we identified a remaining dislocation of the midtarsal joint which was confirmed with a CT scan. Urgent surgical treatment was performed on the same day in order to restore articular congruence.\n\n【8】Due to the severity of the soft tissue lesion， a closed reduction of the Chopart articulation was performed and fixed with two 1.5 mm Kirschner wires in talonavicular joint and one 1.5 mm Kirschner wire in calcaneocuboid joint. In addition to the bone procedure， we surgically debrided and washed the wound with 6 liters of 0.9% saline solution. The vast soft tissue loss didn't allow for primary wound suture and we chose to close the injury with a sterile polyethylene prosthesis . Patient remained hospitalized for 5 days to monitor wound healing.\n\n【9】Weekly visits were made for 60 days， followed by fortnightly follow-ups for another 60 days.\n\n【10】Forty-eight days after the operation， the patient was admitted to our emergency room due to leakage of secretion in the dressing， and partial loosening of the polyethylene prosthesis was observed. Suture of the distal component of the dressing was performed with nylon thread，under local anesthesia.\n\n【11】Weight bearing was planned to start six weeks after surgery， but due to this minor episode of dressing loosening it was postponed to eight weeks after major healing of the injury was visualized through the prosthesis. Full weight bearing on the operated limb was allowed 70 days after surgery通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-7\\]</u>.\n\n【12】technique， coverage was maintained for a period of 6 weeks.\n\n【13】Four months after the first procedure， although the excellent aspect of the wound， a minor lesion remained on the central area of the wound and surgeons proposed another intervention with removal of the dressing and a minimal skin graft coverage . He was readmitted for operative treatment on May 2022 but after removal of the prosthesis the injury was completely granulated and no additional procedure was necessary .\n\n【14】Considering that the technique was adapted for larger lesions， this coverage maintenance period will be influenced according to the location and size of the lesion to be treated. It is common during the treatment that some stitches may becomeloose over the weeks. When this loosening occurs， the patient should be submitted to a partial revision and a new suture， on an outpatient basis， to avoid leakage of secretions and contamination ofthe wound. The suture used must be adapted to the lesion site as well as the thickness of suture thread. In general， simple， or U-shaped stitches are suitable and facilitate revision in case of loosening.\n\n【15】Last follow-up visit was on June 2022， 30 days after removal of the prosthesis and five months after the surgery. Patient remained with excellent outcome， with minimal complaints regarding residual edema and paresthesia. The wound on the dorsum was completely healed and patient was allowed to return to work as tolerated.\n\n【16】In very large wounds， complete or partial healing may occur， leaving small， but already granulated areas that can be supplemented with grafting. In general， coverage with a propylene orthosis restores a very close to natural shape and appearance， with good sensitivity to the area.\n\n【17】Surgical Technique\n\n【18】The technique used in this case report consists of an adaptation of the technique proposed by Figueiredo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， initially for cutaneous losses from the fingertips and later expanded for greater cutaneous losses， both in the hand and in other parts of the limbs.\n\nThe original technique consists ofusing a synthetic polypropylene cover that is flexible and resistant to cover the entire bloody area， to contain all the inflammatory exudate， preventing its extravasation. This exudate is later progressively converted into fibrinous tissue and this later replaced by granulation tissue. In the original initial|删除段之间换行|In the case presented， the patient was taken first to the operating room for debridement of the wound and bone fixation. Coverage with polypropylene was performed at the same time. In the first week， it is likely for that the dressing to become slightly moist due to a slight extravasation of secretion. After the first week， a weekly dressing change was performed with a superficial cleaning of the covering with 70% alcohol. It is common for the patient to be anxious with the appearance of fibrinous over the weeks， mistaking it for pus. It is important to reassure the patient to maintain adherence to treatment. Over the weeks， some areas take on a darkened color due to the differentiation of the granulation tissue.\n\n【20】At approximately 6 weeks， the patient underwent revision of the sutured covering due to loosening of some stitches.\n\n【21】At approximately 12 weeks， the removal of the coverage and grafting of an area that had not yet been epithelialized was programmed.Bythe dressing appearance it seemed to beconsiderable. After removing the cover it was observed that the epithelialized tissue was larger than estimated， leaving only a discrete central area fully granulated.\n\n【22】Antibiotics were not used for prophylaxis or treatment during the patient's follow-up.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】The foot and ankle area is a common site of traumatic injuries that generate a loss of skin coverage and possible exposure to deep structures. These lesions will require coverage methods that may need a variety of reconstruction procedures to reduce the risk of infection， necrosis of noble structures and specially to avoid other undesirable outcomes such as amputations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Autologous grafts and flaps require a trained team， not always available in treatment centers， in addition to generating an additional damage to the donor site， which increases treatment morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Negative pressure therapy is a relative expensive treatment， not always covered by the healthcare insurance， whether public or private.\n\n【26】The use of polypropylene prosthesis is a technique of low complexity of execution， besides being accessible and low cost， making it viable and reproducible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， regardless of the level of technical capacity of the surgeon and the structure of the center where the treatment is being instituted.\n\n【27】Therefore， it is believed that the technique in question should be part of the arsenal of alternatives for the treatment of skin lesions followed by traumatic events， especially at the level of the foot and ankle， given the good result that can be obtained， as well as exemplified in the reported case.\n\n【28】The application ofthis technique on foot and ankle area transcends the indications primarily described by Figueiredo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and some details should be considered due to its weight bearing characteristics. First， we recommend at least six weeks non weight bearing on the operated limb but this period could be extended according to the severity and the progression of the wound. Second， we suggest that suture of the prosthesis should be performed with very close stitches to avoid leakage of the secretion.\n\n【29】Respecting these instructions， we believe that excellent outcomes could be achieved with very little expenses， and we recommend that the technique should be widespread to other surgeons especially in areas with budget limitations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

He was found to be saturating in the low 90s， heart rate of 89/min， and blood pressure of 143/87 mmHg. He was placed on oxygen nasal cannula with improvement of his oxygen saturation to the high 90s. While awaiting the remainder of his evaluation， the patient decided to light up a cigarette. This resulted in an immediate combustion reaction and significant facial burns. The emergency room team quickly removed the patient’s oxygen and extinguished the fire. The patient was noted to have facial， nasal， and oropharyngeal burns as well as edema. He was brought to the operating room for emergent intubation. An awake fiber-optic intubation was performed and a 7.5 oral endotracheal tube was placed .

Therefore， it is important to conduct dengue vector surveillance activities during the rainy season to assess the dengue vector abundance under COVID-19 pandemic situation. Meanwhile， neighboring country， Singapore reported the dengue outbreak in 2020 with the recorded number of more than 14，000 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Another study conducted in Peru also suggested the increase of dengue incidence in all endemic regions during COVID-19 pandemic period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. According to WHO， vector surveillance and control activities should be carried out continuously while observing the measures adopted by health authorities to control the pandemic of COVID-19with the participation of community 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In the present study， the main objective was to perform dengue vector surveillance in dengue endemic areas， particularly South Dagon and Htantabin Townships in Yangon Region. This study\n\n【12】Table 1： Proportion of Aedes infested container types in South Dagon and Htantabin townships.\n\n| Container Type  | South Dagon  |  |  | Htantabin  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Container Type  | No. of inspected container  | No. of Aedes infested container  | %  | No. of inspected container  | No. of Aedes infested container  | %  |\n| Barrel  | 180  | 57  | 31.7  | 49  | 21  | 42.9  |\n| Bucket  | 75  | 33  | 44  | 39  | 13  | 33.3  |\n| Cement drum  | 180  | 60  | 33.3  | 117  | 15  | 12.8  |\n| Cement tank  | 9  | 3  | 33.3  | 35  | 7  | 20  |\n| Ceramic jar  | 87  | 30  | 34.5  | 188  | 39  | 20.7  |\n| Flower vase  | 438  | 9  | 2.1  | 612  | 99  | 16.2  |\n| Spiritual bowl  | 33  | 3  | 9.1  | 68  | 28  | 41.2  |\n| Discardec  | 63  | 51  | 81  | 108  | 87  | 80.6  |\n| Total  | 1065  | 246  | 23.1  | 1216  | 309  | 25.4  |\n\n【14】provided the crucial information for implementing of dengue vector control activities during COVID-19 transmission period in selected dengue endemic areas.\n\n【15】Materials and Methods\n\n【16】A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in South Dagon (16°51'0\"N，96°140\"E) and Htantabin (17°8'0\"N 95°55'0\"E) townships from August 2020 to May删除4:<u> 2021</u>. South Dagon was one of the high dengue cases-reported townships in last 5 years (VBDC， Annual Report 2019). Meanwhile， Htantabin， a suburban area and located at outskirt of Yangon city， reported the highest dengue cases from January to June删除4:<u> 2020</u>. Thus， those two townships were selected purposively for the present study.\n\n【17】As precaution measures for COVID-19 transmission， the following measures were precisely performed during the activity：Applied minimum workforce (one entomologist， one epidemiologist， one Basic Health Staff (BHS) and one local ward authority)， applied personal protective measures (masks and face-shields)， routine temperature checking of survey team members and reduced the contact time with inhabitants.\n\n【18】Inspections of potential breeding habitats (presence or absence of Aedes mosquito immature stages) in and around household premises were inspected thoroughly by survey team following precaution measures as mentioned previously. Container type， size， place and type of water were noted down using checklist. Residents were requested to bring flower vases which were placed indoor to outside of the houses. In order to reduce communication time with residents， larvae and pupae were not counted and also water containers inside of the houses except flower vases were ignored in the present study.\n\n【19】Data analysis\n\n【20】Entomological data were analyzed by using R studio software and categorical data were shown in percentage. Following entomological indices were also applied to check the dengue vector abundance situation in the study areas.\n\n【21】1) Container Index (CI)： No. of positive containers/No. of inspected containers x 100%\n\n【22】2) Household Index (HI)： No. of positive houses/No. of inspected houses x100%\n\n【23】3) Breteau Index (BI)： No. of positive containers/No. of houses inspected×100\n\n【24】Total of 160 and 189 households were participated in South Dagon and Htantabin Townships， respectively. In South Dagon Township， total of 1，065 potential mosquito breeding containers were inspected and Aedes immature stages were found in 246 containers. Meanwhile，309 Aedes infested containers out of 1，216 inspected containers were found in Htantabin Township. In terms ofthe number of containers， flower vase was the highest number of containers in both townships with 438 and 612， respectively， and followed by barrel and cement drums in South Dagon and ceramic jars in Htantabin Township. However， discarded container type was the highest Aedes infested proportion among all types of containers with the percentage of 81%in South Dagon and 80.6% in Htantabin Township .\n\n【25】Container Index (CI)， Household Index (HI) and Breteau Index(BI) were 23.1% and 25.4%， 65.6% and 71.4%， and 153.8 and 163.5， respectively， for South Dagon and Htantabin townships .\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】Among those 8 common types of containers (barrel， bucket， cement drum， cement tank， ceramic jar， flower vase， spiritual bowl and discarded)， flower vase container type was the highest number in both townships as a part of the Myanmar culture. One study conducted in Yangon 通用删除7(英):<u>(2018)</u> reported the very low proportion of Aedes infestation in flower vase container type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However， two studies conducted in Yangon in 2010 and 2011 stated that flower vase was one of the key containers for mosquito breeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，10\\]</u>. In the present study， proportion of Aedes infestation in flower vase was noticeably high in Htantabin Township which was the highest dengue case-reported township in 2020.\n\nDiscarded container type was the highest proportion of Aedes infestation in both townships and the same situation was reported in previous studies conducted in Hlaing Thar Yar 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and South Dagon townships in Yangon. Majority ofthe health staff fromtownships were assigned to prevention and control of COVID-19 activities (MOH，2020) which led to the gradual decrease of dengue vector surveillance and control activities.

The main objective of this article is to describe a technique for fabricating a hollow ocular prosthesis with the help of a soap spacer.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hollow； Ocular prosthesis； Soap spacer\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Loss of an eye can be caused by cancer， trauma， or congenital defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Such a loss leads to severe emotional trauma which affects the social and professional aspects of the individuals'life. The term“anophthalmic socket”is defined as an orbit not containing an eyeball， but with orbital soft tissues and eye-lid structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In cases of large anophthalmic sockets， the use of a solid ocular prosthesis may lead to lower lid laxity and deep superior sulcus due to the weight of the prosthesis. A hollow ocular prosthesis would be lighter and yet large enough to occupy the evident residual ocular space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Numeroustechniques have been recommended to achieve weight reduction ofocularprostheses. Edias et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> proposed a technique for making ocular prostheses for large anophthalmic cavities by introducing expanded polystyrene (Styrofoam) to the acrylic resin at the time of making the prosthetic sclera， aiming at reducing the weight of the prosthesis. The Styrofoam would be a part of the prosthesis； thus， adding some weight to the definitive prosthesis. Aggarwal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> described a two-step technique for acrylic resin packing with a wax spacer in between， which was later removed by lost wax technique. Kavlekar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> described a single-step， lost-salt technique to obtain a lightweight ocular prosthesis. Worrell 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> used sugar matrix (sugar mixture with egg white， i.e.， caster sugar in the ratio of 1：5) to fill the hollow portion of an ocular prosthesis that was evacuated by immersing in hot water. Maskey et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> described a technique using putty spacer and matchsticks to aid in creating a hollow cavity. This paper describes a single step technique to create a hollowed ocular prosthesis using soap spacer.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 42 Year old male was referred to the Department of Prosthodontics，Crown and Bridge， Goa Dental College and Hospital， with a discolored ocular stock eye prosthesis which he had been using since past two years.\n\n【8】The patient presented with a history of trauma 3 years back to his eye followed by surgical enucleation of the socket. On examination， the eyelids were intact， the tissue bed was healthy and adequate depth was present between the upper and the lower eyelids sufficient enough for the retention of an ocular prosthesis.\n\n【9】Procedure\n\n【10】A stock eye was selected which matched the iris color of the patient’s eye.\n\n【11】2) A putty impression (Zhermack Elite HD+) of the stock eye was made to create a mold. A special tray was fabricated using clear auto polymerizing acrylic resin (DPI， India) in the putty mold . The borders of the tray were adjusted in the socket and vent holes were made. A mixing tip was attached to this tray which served as a handle and also allowed the flow of the light body addition silicone material (Aquasil Dentsply) to record the impression of the tissue bed .\n\n【12】3) A mold type III dental stone was obtained using a two pour technique.\n\n【13】4) Modeling wax (Modeling Wax， Deepti Dental Products of India Pvt. Ltd.) was poured in this cast to obtain a wax pattern which was modified on the patient to obtain proper contours .\n\n【14】5 The wax pattern was invested and de waxed.\n\n【15】on the tissue bed surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. These holes were then sealed using clear auto-polymerizing resin.\n\n【16】6) To create a putty spacer two sheet thickness of modeling wax was adapted on the inner surface of the mould， putty was placed and the flask was closed .\n\n【17】8) The iris positioning was done on the scleral blank using vernier caliper 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> . The iris was transferred from the stock eye to the sclera blank to verify the iris positioning.\n\n7 During packing， the putty spacer was used during trial closure in-order to create a hollow space. Soap spacer made from melt and pour soap base (Melt and pour soap base， Soapy twist) was placed in the space created ， which was flushed out after acrylization by using hot water through two holes which were created|删除段之间换行|9 The tinting of the sclera was done using composite paints(SR Adoro Stains， Ivoclar Vivadent， Germany). A protective coating(G-Coat Plus， GC America Inc.) was applied after which a thin layer of wax was poured on the sclera. The prosthesis was re-invested， dewaxed， packed with clear acrylic resin. Processing was done and|删除段之间换行|the prosthesis was polished and finished  and delivered to the patient . The patient was happy with the esthetics and comfort of the prosthesis.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】The aim of any prosthetic treatment is to bring the patient back to the society with a normal appearance. Glass was the material of choice for fabrication of ocular prosthesis till 1940s. With the invention and development of polymers， Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) became the material of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Custom made ocular prosthesis using PMMA has various advantages such as- it is non brittle， better adaptation hence adding comfort to the patient， improved esthetics， longer serviceability， and easy to repair or polish.\n\n【21】Various impression techniques have been reported in literature such as direct impression/external impression technique， using stock ocular tray， impression with custom ocular tray， impression with stock ocular prosthesis， and wax scleral blank technique. Various impression materials like irreversible hydrocolloid， ophthalmic alginate，polyvinylsiloxane，tissueconditioners， and dentalimpression waxes can be used. For iris positioning different techniques using grid， glasses， facebow， vernier caliper， arbitrary marking have been reported. Light cure stains， paints， emax veneer， digital photography have been used to match the shade of the sclera 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>.\n\nIn this case report， the impression is made with a custom ocular tray using polyvinyl siloxane impression material， a vernier caliper was used for recording the iris position and shade matching was done with acrylic paints. The use of a soap spacer which can be flushed out post acrylization makes the fabrication of a definitive hollow|删除段之间换行|prosthesis easier. The described technique improves the adaptability of the prosthesis and allows for customization of the sclera with artistic skills. The hollow prosthesis reduces the weight and improves the acceptance of the prosthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，13\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】The prosthetic rehabilitation of an anopthalmous eye is a chalenging process. It is crucial to match the esthetics and also improve adaptability of the prosthesis. Hollowing out the prosthesis reduces the weight， improving patient acceptance towards the prosthesis. Painting the sclera allows full control ofthe prosthodontist to match the sclera of the natural eye.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Changes in mean gait parameters appear universal in all neurological deficits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， increasing its impact soon after orthopedic surgical interventions. Gait disturbances can lead to impaired mobility， disability， fear of falling or falls， which can result in lower quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The gait abnormalities are mainly caused by spasticity or abnormal muscle tone， decreased motor control and impaired balance. However，because gait abnormalities are primarily caused by spasticity or abnormal muscle tone， often resulting in continued life-course abnormalities if left untreated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， surgery should be considered in order to improve mobility， the walking potential and quality of life of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6\\]</u>.

Wearable inertial sensor was used to fulfill this need.\n\n【17】Methods\n\n【18】This study was carried out in compliance with the regulating guidelines and norms regulating research involving human subjects stipulated by the National Health Board in October 1996， and it received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of University under process number 2.424.085. The patient signed a statement of informed consent declaring that he was aware that the procedure to which he would receive was experimental and free of charge.\n\nA male child diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy aged 12 years(weight： 48 kg， height： 1.64 m)， functionally classified with level GMFCS II， was referred to surgical procedure of bilateral tenotomy of tendon of gastronomies muscles due to increased spasticity in the plantar flexor muscles， causing the child to walk on tiptoes. After the surgical procedure， by medical recommendation， the patient used plaster in the distal lower limbs for one month. The patient|删除段之间换行|performed physiotherapy after the removal of the plaster， by his own physiotherapist， by twelve sessions， three times a week， for four weeks. Each session lasted 60 minutes and the treatment applied to the child was based on conventional techniques， such as stretching， strengthening and proprioceptive training and gait.\n\n【20】The spatio-temporal parameters were obtained with a wireless inertial detection device (G-Sensor， BTS Bioengineering s.p.a， Italy). This new wearable system based on inertial sensors and a dedicated algorithm for precise and accurate assessment of spatiotemporal gait parameters has been described and validated for gait analysis in children with CP通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The portable G sensor is a wireless system of inertial sensors for human motion analysis. The sensors are controlledbya data recording unit (up to 16 elements) by a zigbee type radio communication. Each sensor has 62 mmx36mmx 16 mm dimensions， weighing 60 g，and consists of a three-axis accelerometer (maximum scale ±6g)， a 3-axis gyroscope (full scale ±300°/s)， and a magnetometer of 3 axes (full scale ±6 Gauss). This device is calibrated with acceleration of gravity immediately after manufacture.

In order for the device to acquire gait values it was necessary for the patient to perform 5 full gait cycles of gait on each leg to be recorded. The distinction of the right and left legs was recorded through the oscillations of accelerometers， gyroscopes and magnetometers during the gait analysis. The inertial sensor was attached in the lower lumbar level (covering the L4-L5 inter-vertebral space) with a semi-elastic neoprene belt. The device acquired acceleration values (along three|删除段之间换行|orthogonal axes： anteroposterior，mid-lateral and super-inferior) that were transmitted in real time by bluetooth to a PC and processed with dedicated software (BTS Bioengineering G-Studio) to derive the following parameters：|删除段之间换行|1\\.

The spatio-temporal parameters found in pre-surgical and post-physiotherapeutic wasn’t well within normal ranges for their age and sex 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The small variation between the left and right mean values probably occurred due to the asymmetry of the lower limbs found in the patient during his inspection (left leg 89 cm， right leg 86 cm). However， this may lead to further investigation of each experiment on foot to find out the source of variation.

The orthopedist and physiotherapist are responsible for preventing and correcting lower limb deformities， contributing to the patient being as independent as possible in his Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and in his locomotion. The results showed that walking ability was not improved after surgery and rehabilitation compared to the preoperative situation. From our point of view， this study may demonstrate the need for the follow-up of physical therapy after the orthopedic surgical procedure for a long term period.

Some limitations of this study should be recognized：since we wanted to replicate a realistic use of the inertial sensor in a outside the laboratory environment setting， and extend the possibility of using portable and user-friendly solutions， obtaining different types of data acquisition， we recruited only one patient before，during and after their surgical intervention and physiotherapeutic. Second， the study evaluated only general gait parameters. It would have been interesting to discuss kinematics of the knee and ankle (since the surgery was a tenotomy of the gastronomies tendon)， but it was not possible to detect these kinematic parameters with the device used by this study. Future studies should investigate larger groups of patients with the same disability， providing more detailed information on kinematic gait parameters in these individuals.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In current study， the hepatoprotective aptitude of T. cordata was evaluated against Aceclofenac (ACF) instigated oxidative stress in rats. Leaves of T. cordata were extracted in methanol and various fractions were prepared by polarity-based method. Qualitative and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis along with HPLC-DAD analysis was performed on samples. Antioxidant potential of extracts was identified by DPPH method while BSA method was used to assess the anti-inflammatory activity. Rats were divided into various groups and oxidative stress was induced by ACF in liver of rats. T. cordata Methanol extract (TCM) was used to mitigate the oxidative stress. Serum analysis for liver enzymes and tissue analysis for enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants was performed. Qualitative and quantitative spectrophotometric analysis of various extracts depicted the presence of phenolics， flavonoids， andtannins. In vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory studies further elaborated the protective potential of plant extracts. Furthermore， treatment of rats with ACF showed decline (p<0.05) in the level of liver antioxidant enzymes， in contrast，elevation was found in the concentration ofhydrogen peroxide and nitrite in hepatic tissues. Increased serum markers of the liver were revealed after ACF treatment. Hepatocyte inflammation and injuries were prominent in histopathological studies of the liver in ACF-treated rats. However， the administration of TCM to ACF-intoxicated rats reduced liver injuries and restored the levels of antioxidant enzymes and free radical towards normal rats. T. cordata possess strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential due to presence of polyphenols and can help in development of drug against liver injuries with strong antioxidant potential.\n\n【2】Keywords： Telosma cordata； Antioxidants； Anti-inflammatory； Oxidative stress； Aceclofenac\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】通用间距删除-1:<u>OPEN ACCESS</u>\n\n【5】通用间距删除-1:<u>\\Correspondence：Mehreen Fatima， Department of Biochemistry， Quaid-j-Azam University， Islamabad， Pakistan， E-mail： mfatima@bs.qau.edu.pk Received Date： 30 May 2023</u>\n\n【6】TCM： Telosma cordata Methanol extract； ER： Endoplasmic Reticulum； TPC： Total Phenolic Content； TFC： Total Flavonoid Content； TTC： Total Tannin Content； HPLC： High Performance Liquid Chromatography； DPPH： 2，2-Diphenylpicrylhydrazyl； BSA： Bovine Serum albumin； ACF：Aceclofenac； TLC： Total Leukocyte Count； MCH： Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin； PTC： Platelets Count； MCV： Mean Corpuscular Volume； ALT： Alanine Transferase；AST： Aspartate Transaminase； ALP： Alkaline Phosphate； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase； POD： peroxidase； CAT： Catalase\n\n【7】删除7:<u>Accepted Date： 12 Jun 2023</u>\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】删除7:<u>Published Date： 17 Jun 2023 Citation：Fatima M， Rashid Khan M.

ROS have the ability to initiate lipid peroxidation， known as a chain reaction， and cause oxidation of other cellular components， such as DNA and proteins. The main cause of liver ailment is lipid peroxidation which arises due to prolonged exposure to hepatotoxins. These free radicals enhance the production of Thiobarbituric Reactive Substances (TBARS)，when they interact with the polyunsaturated fatty acids，henceleading to necrosis. Therefore， Oxidative stress causes several ailments i.e.， cancer， atherosclerosis， nervous disorder， diabetes， idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis， asthma， and liver fibrosis. General metabolic reactions and some biological factors including air containments aid in the production of ROS in living organisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>.\n\n【11】删除1:<u>Copyright @ 2023 Fatima M.

Injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa， bleeding peptic ulcer， gastrointestinal complications， and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis is directly linked to the|删除段之间换行|continued intake of ACF. Biotransformation of ACF into diclofenac leads to selective inhibition of COX-2. Furthermore， some previous research on NSAIDs has discovered that these drugs can cause liver toxicity and other side effects； however， the extent of these side effects is uncertain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Silymarin is an extract of Silybum marianum (milk thistle) containing polyphenolic flavonoid compound， silybin being the most important one. It acts as a radical scavenger and therapeutic agent by reducing free radical production and ameliorating damage caused by xenobiotics. Silymarin is used to treat liver injuries and severe hepatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

The main reason of oxidative stress is loss of proportion between ROS production and antioxidants； thus， this oxidative stress interferes with a lot of cellular functions and leads to different pathological conditions such as inflammation， asthma， aging， and carcinogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Vitamins also known as antioxidants， such as vitamin C， are also important in regulating metabolic signaling pathways that lead to the organs'perfect activities. Synthetic medicines for treating liver injuries can be less efficient and have disastrous effects. Different natural plants and microbes are used as the main component in the manufacturing process of medicinal products. Plants naturally contain different nutrients and antioxidants that integrate into their defense system to protect the plant itself and other organisms from damage induced by reactive substances.

In contrast， silymarin treatment showed ameliorating effects against ACF-induced toxicity as body and organ weights of this group were similar to normal rats. Co-administration ofTCM (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) with ACF suppressed the toxic effects of ACF and showed an increase in body weight whereas restoration of absolute and relative liver weight was also observed.

Though， albumin showed a significant decrease in its level. Increased levels of various serum enzymes are associated with hepatic damage with loss of integrity of cells. By contrast， co-administration of ACF with silymarin significantly (p<0.05) restored the level of these serum enzymes towards the control rats. Likewise， simultaneous treatment of Aceclofenac and TCM doses (150 mg/kg bw and 300 mg/kg bw) showed a remarkable effect (p<0.05) in repressing the levels of serum markers， yet an increase in albumin level was also notable.\n\n【96】T. cordata restored antioxidant enzymes in liver\n\n【97】CAT： Catalase； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase： POD： Peroxidase： GSH：Reduced Glutathione\n\n【98】T. cordata reduced toxicity in liver tissues\n\n【99】Table 7 summarizes the hepatoprotective ability of TCM on levels of H，O。 nitrite， TBARS， and total protein. Total protein was decreased， while a significant (p<0.05) increase in H，O。 nitrite， and TBARS was noticed in ACF-treated rats compared to normal rats. TCM administration with ACF markedly (p<0.05) reduced the concentration of biochemical markers while an elevation was observed in protein level. Rats treated with TCM alone did not affect the levels of biochemical markers. By reducing the hepatotoxicity caused by ACF， silymarin administration showed a significant(p<0.05) restoration of nitrites， TBARS， H，O， and total protein toward the normallevel.\n\n【100】Protective role of T. cordata on histology of liver\n\n【101】Liver of normal rats showed a normal architecture with intact hepatocytes， central vein and equally distributed cytoplasm. Liver of ACF treated rats showed severe injuries such as sinusoidal obstructions， necrosis， fibrosis， and hepatocellular degeneration as alterations were prominent in morphology of tissue. Administration of high dose of TCM with ACF showed improvement in morphological structure of liver by reducing the liver damages and injuries hence showing protection against liver toxicity while rats administered with low dose of plant TCM along with ACF showed necrosis and some injuries. Liver of rats from TCM alone treated groups had shown normal morphological features of liver . Silymarin (200 mg/kg bw)， a standard drug， was given to restore structural abnormalities and cellular anomalies as shown in Figure 3 and 5C.\n\n【102】Discussion\n\n【103】Toxic chemical substances cause liver injuries in body which induces oxidative stress and inflammation. Natural antioxidants and food additives help to reduce induced stress and toxic effects of xenobiotics by scavenging free radicals. Humans have been using plants as a source of conventional medicines for hundreds of vears. Many herbal extracts， prepared from plants， have been examined for their antioxidant， anti-inflammatory， andhepatoprotective properties against liver injuries in various experimental animal models 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. In the present study， a phytochemical qualitative study confirmed the presence of alkaloids， flavonoids， tannins， coumarins， phenols， and saponins in T. cordata fractions.\n\nThe production of ROS is correlated with a number of severe|删除段之间换行|and persistent body disorders which embraces liver， pulmonary， neurodegenerative， and digestive infections. Diet is a rich source of antioxidants and can help the body to regulate the deficiency of antioxidants endogenously and thus restore all the damage caused because of oxidative stress.\n\n【105】Phenolics and flavonoids such as rutin， quercetin， gallic acid， catechin and caffeic acid were found in the HPLC analysis of TCM. Rutin is a well-known standard antioxidantandprotective compound against toxicity and getting recognition due to its medicinalproperties通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. On the other hand， catechin shows strong activity against free radicals thus having antioxidant activities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Thus， the presence of these compounds in TCM extract could be the reason for scavenging free radicals when evaluated against DPPH and showing antioxidant activity. The presence of antioxidants in TCM is also linked with the inhibition of denaturation of bovine serum albumin and showing anti-inflammatory potential. Our findings are similar to the studies of Naz et al. which claimed that phytochemicals of Pilea umbrosa have antioxidant properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【106】ACF has been identifieddascommonly associated with hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress and it is also assumed as the major cause of cellular disorder by damaging the antioxidant enzymatic system， acute hepatitis， and increasing peroxidation of lipids. Hepatotoxicity from NSAIDs can be found at any time after initiation of treatment， but like most severe drug reactions， it occurs after 6 to12 weeks after administration. In the liver， ACF causes activate lipid peroxidation， necrotic and apoptotic cell death， and deterioration of membranal structure leading to the secretion of enzymatic components in blood. According to previous research， a significant increase in levels of biochemical markers i.e.，ALP， ALT，and AST can be seen after oral induction ofanimal models with Aceclofenac 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，37\\]</u>. Toaccess the protective potential ofour plant， an Aceclofenac exposed system is created in rats. Our research has clearly demonstrated that treating the animal models with Aceclofenac at higher dose for about eight weeks on alternate days resulted in the induction of hepatic damage and oxidative stress， while T. cordata showed promising protective results against stress and organ damage. Our results are in line with a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.\n\n【107】This study has also found that TCM did not cause injurious alterations in hematological markers， including the count of HB， MCV， WBC， HCT，RBC，and platelets in rats， even at a high dose of3000 mg/kg. TCM is found to be non-toxic， as any signs of discomfort or pain was not obvious in TCM-treated rats. Similar results for the methanolic extract of the plant are declared by previous findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【108】Body weight is an important factor in the conflicting effects of hepatotoxins and is replicated as an element that limits toxicity studies. In the current study， the percent increase in body weight of rats was reduced， whereas absolute and relative liver weight was enhanced with ACF administration. Basically， NSAIDs induce oxidative stress by producing free radicals in the body that cause an increase in the organ weight by affecting the metabolic process of different organs. Same results are represented by previous research Bort et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>.\n\nNaturally， our body has a specific antioxidant defense mechanism that includes endogenous enzymatic antioxidants such as CAT， SOD， POD， and glutathione. These enzymes along with exogenous antioxidants protect the organ and body from damage caused by oxidative stress by capturing ROS. Catalase has ability to neutralize hydrogen peroxide H.O， via a catalytic transformation or through|删除段之间换行|peroxidation metabolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u> while superoxide dismutase is a metallic enzyme that helps in the conversion of superoxide radicals to H，O， and O， by dismutase reaction to reduce the toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Glutathione peroxidase causes the neutralization of peroxides and thus providing protection against toxicity of ROS. Abnormal necrosis in liver is stimulated by decreased levels of GSH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. All these antioxidant enzymes and GSH level in cells were reduced markedly in ACF treated group， which have caused injury in liver cells through deposition of ROS. Administration of TCM along with ACF has significantly restored antioxidant enzyme concentration near to normal range. TCM contains many bioactive components which are efficient in balancing the levels of antioxidants as well as in combating different infectious diseases. Increasedlipid peroxidation is associated with higher levels of TBARS that result in tissue destruction and failure of antioxidant defense mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，35\\]</u>. ACF-intoxicated rats treated with TCM (300 mg/kg) reduced the lipid peroxide levels compared with rats treated with ACF only.\n\n【110】An extreme notch of disruptions in hepatic cells consisting of cellular hypertrophy， intrusion of inflammatory cells， intrusion of the central lobule，and sinusoidal obstruction was observed in rats treated with ACF dose through histological examination of tissues.Low/high doses of TCM with ACF dose reduced these losses in the bodytissues. No morphological changes were observed in the liver anatomy of groups treated with TCM doses alone. Similar results have been declared by Gupta and Pandey， who claimed that Terminalia bellirica fruit extract has a protective aptitude against Aceclofenac endured hepatic damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Many biocomponents and polyphenols are present in TCM extract， which have potential antioxidant properties and thus help the plant to prevent tissue damage by reducing peroxidation of lipids in body organs， including the liver.\n\n【111】Conclusion\n\n【112】The current study illustrated the potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory propensity of T. cordata extract. The presence of flavonoids and polyphenols are claimed for the possible antioxidant， anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective mechanism of T. cordata. Our data also revealed protective effect of TCM by regulating the levels of enzymatic markers， anti-inflammatory mediators and serum markers against the intoxicated effects of ACF. Moreover， TCM reduces the injuries of liver architecture， hence restoring the hepatic morphology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Topiramate is a first line agent for migraine prophylaxis； however25% of migraine sufferers are unable to tolerate its side effects. Topiramate can cause fatigue and cognitive dysfunction mimicking the symptoms of CFS/ME therefore there is uncertainty if this group is able to tolerate Topiramate.\n\n【2】Aim： To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Topiramate in Migraine prophylaxis in CFS/ME patients\n\n【3】Design： A retrospective study.\n\n【4】Methods： Data was gathered from two specialist CFS/ME rehabilitation services who serve a population of >600.000 in the north of England. Patients started on Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis were contacted and their feedback regarding Topiramate including current dose， efficacy， side effects and reason for withdrawal if appropriate were noted.\n\n【5】Results： 27 patients were started on Topiramate. 24 were females with a mean age of 37(SD27). The dose ranged between 25 mg to 125 mg with mean 79 mg daily.5 patients (18.5%) could not tolerate Topiramate because of increasing fatigue； cognitive side effects and paresthesia. 3 patients had side effects of self-limiting paresthesia and continued with the medication.

As the physical examination and investigations are invariably normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， the diagnosis is made using diagnostic criteria such as Fukuda criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> or Canadian consensus criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Symptoms such as debilitating fatigue which is not relieved by rest and is associated with post exertional malaise are the hallmarks of the illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Other symptoms such as unrefreshing sleep， physical pain and cognitive impairment are also common. All diagnostic criteria include headaches as a common feature of CFS/ME. Headaches can present in different forms such as tension headaches， episodic or chronic migraines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. More than two thirds of Migraine sufferers fulfill the criteria for diagnosis of CFS/ME 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and more than 80% of CFS/ME patients complain of migraine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Recent advances in the understanding of the two conditions suggest that a common pathology may explain such strong association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The focus on a vascular phenomenon as the primary pathology of migraine has proven an inadequate explanation as the complex interplay between the peripheral trigeminal vascular and the complex central networks are suggesting a much more complex pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Recent research has also shown that the approach to CFS/ME as a solely functional disorder with psychosocial factors\n\n【12】Table 1： Comparison between our cohort and the pooled data analysing topiramate use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n|  | Studied cohort  | Topiramate pooled data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \\>50% reduction in frequency of migraine attacks  | 19/27(70%)  | 46%  |\n| \\>75% reduction in frequency of migraine attacks  | 10/27(39%)  | 25%  |\n| Average dose  | 79mg  | 100mg  |\n| Topiramate discontinued (not tolerated)  | 5/27(18.5%)  | 25%  |\n| Side effects (total  | 8/27 (29%)  | \\>50%  |\n\n【14】predisposing， precipitating and also perpetuating the condition is a simplistic explanation for this common and disabling condition. The persistent symptoms can be at least partially explained by a central sensitisation process， a process shared with migraine， fibromyalgia and Gulf War Illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Such strong correlation between CFS/ME and migraine is not just of interest to neuroscientists but also has significant implications in clinical practice. Stress and anxiety are strong perpetuators of both conditions and a successful reduction of its burden is likely to help both conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. Pharmacological management of the2 conditions can be a challenge in some patients with many CFS/ME patients either having several medications to manage other symptoms such as physical pain， insomnia or mood disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Paradoxically， some CFS/ME patients find it difficult to tolerate many medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> especially with associated conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome， idiopathic environmental intolerance or because of the medications impact on already depleted energy levels.\n\n【16】Propranolol and Topiramate are suggested as the first line migraine prophylactic treatment in patients older than 12 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. We could not identify any scientific literature reporting on the use of either drug in migraine patients suffering also from CFS/ME. In this short paper we are reporting our experience using Topiramate in a cohort of CFS/ME for migraine prophylaxis.\n\n【17】Methods\n\n【18】Two specialist services for CFS/ME management serve a population of more than 600.000 residents (Wigan， Bolton and Bury) in the north west of England. The first author provides medical input for both services. The standard practice is to use Topiramate as a first line treatment with Propranolol and Pizotifen occasionally used if specifically needed for a clinical reason. All CFS/ME patients prescribed migraine prophylaxis in a period of 24 months were identified from the patients'electronic records. Those patients were contacted either by phone or face to face during a clinical review. The patients demographics and type of medication prescribed were documented. The patients still on the medication prescribed were asked about their response (no attacks， more than 50% improvement in frequency， less than 50% frequency or no improvement)； the patients were asked about any side effects and what the dose they are on. The patients who decided to discontinue the drug prescribed were identified and asked about the main side effects that led to discontinuation of the drug.\n\n【19】Results\n\nProphylactic management wasFprescribed for 37Ppatients but only 33 could be contacted. 3 patients decided not to start the medication. Two patients were started on Propranolol as they had poorly controlled anxiety and Propranolol was deemed uniquely suitable to tackle the anxiety as well. Both patients reported reduction of migraine frequency ofaround 50%. Another patient was started on|删除段之间换行|Pizotifen because of an associated nutritional problem. The Pizotifen reduced the migraine frequency by more than 50%. Full data was available for 27 patients who started Topiramate. Their age ranged between 18-62 years with a mean 37 (SD11.9). 3 were males. 5 patients(18.5%) could not tolerate Topiramate and discontinued it (2 because of paraesthesia and 3 because of cognitive impairment).\n\n【21】Patients 22 (81.5%) on Topiramate were on doses of 25 mg to125 mg daily 79 (SD27.9). Only 3 reported self-limiting paraesthesia and the other 19 (70%) denied having any side effects. 10 patients(39%) reported complete control of their migraine， 9 (33%) reported more than 50% improvement in frequency whilst 3 (11%) reported less than 50% improvement.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Three double blind randomised controlled trials published in 2004reported the positive impact of Topiramate in Migraine prophylaxis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>. MIGR 1 MIGR 2 showed Topiramate to be significantly better than placebo whilst MIGR 3 demonstrated the equivalence of both Topiramate and Propranolol in migraine prophylaxis. A daily dose of 100 mg was superior to 50 mg dose which failed to significantly improve migraine control， whilst 200 mg daily had a similar impact in the frequency of attacks. A dose of 100mg/day was duly recommended as the standard recommended dose for migraine prophylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The pooled data from the 3 trials was presented by D'amico in2006 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The data suggested that almost half of the patients on Topiramate should expect at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of migraine attacks. On the other hand， the pooled data highlighted the problems many of the patients may experience with side effects especially paraesthesia which affects half of the subjects； other side effects such as fatigue， speech problems and cognitive impairment are also common complications of Topiramate use. The severity and refractory nature of the side effects resulted in a high level of intolerance ofthe drug with roughly quarter of the subjects having to discontinue the drug according to the pooled data.\n\n【25】Such high levels of intolerance of Topiramate may discourage clinicians from prescribing it especially in a patient group such as CFS/ME sufferers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Problems with drug intolerance， fatigue， cognitive impairment and/or chronic pain are cardinal features of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>； therefore， concerns about Topiramate worsening these symptoms seems to be a valid issue when consideringtreatment strategies.\n\n【26】The comparison between the outcomes and tolerance of our cohort in comparison with the pooled data reported by D'Amico shows in . The comparison suggests at least a similar favorable response to Topiramate if not a superior control of the migraine frequency. Less patients in our cohort reported side effects or discontinued the drug compared to the pooled data as well.\n\n【27】Several aspects in our clinical practice and the nature of CFS/ME patients may explain such a positive result. Our standard practice is to initiate pharmacological management simultaneously with the CFS/ME rehabilitation programmed which often includes concepts such as stress management， relaxation techniques， pacing among other strategies that may have a positive impact on migraine management通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The patient also receives detailed information about the potential side effects with explicit recommendations to build up the dose slowly with an offer for support from the team if needed. The potential for weight loss as a common side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> is also highlighted. One would expect some patients to welcome such side effect especially that many CFS/ME patients find it difficult to control their weight because of lack of physical activity or side effects of other medications (e.g. GABA agonists)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【28】We also feel that the similarities between the common side effects of Topiramate and the main symptoms of CFS/ME may paradoxically help some patients tolerate these side effects as they experience it readily. A migraine sufferer experiencing paraesthesia or cognitive impairment for the first time to may be more concerned about such symptoms and more likely to report them or discontinue the drug.\n\n【29】This is a short retrospective study reporting the outcomes of a small number of subiects. We would like to stress the caution that must be exercised when interpreting the results or attempting to generalize the conclusions. The authors are the clinicians treating the subjects so a bias from both sides (patients and clinicians) cannot be excluded. Having said that， we feel that our observations should be in the public domain to at least encourage further evaluation of the pharmacological management in such complex population of overlapping co-morbidities.\n\n【30】In conclusion， we feel that reluctance to use Topiramate for migraine prophylaxis when associated with CFS/ME because of the concerns about intolerance is unjustified. Further research evaluating pharmacological interventions in patients with complex co-morbidities is needed to provide more informed guidance for clinical practice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It can be diagnosed antenatally， especially in male fetuses. Megalourethra is a cystic dilation of the anterior urethra， mainly resulting in pulmonaryhypoplasia and renal insufficiency in the neonatal period. Techniques are available (vesico-amniotic shunt， fetoscopy) to remove or overcome the obstacle and thus improve the neonatal and subsequent prognosis. It is essential to look for associated malformations， which are more common in megalourethra than in other conditions of the anterior urethra.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Megalourethra is a cystic dilation of the urethra that can be identified antenatally. It results from an obstruction of the distal urinary tract that can affect the bladder and kidneys in the fetus and in the neonate. This condition belongs to Lower Urinary Tract Obstructions (LUTOs). It is a rare entity with few cases reported in the literature， and its descriptions have mostly been included in more general publications concerning LUTOs. Based on a case encountered in August 2021， this article is aimed at describing and better understanding this condition， providing avenues for its management， and addressing neonatal prognosis.\n\n【5】Clinical Case\n\n【6】A 31-year-old patient， G4P1 (one elective abortion， one full-term vaginal delivery of a healthy boy， one early spontaneous miscarriage)， with no relevant medical or surgical history， was referred at 19+2 Weeks of Amenorrhea (WA) for megabladder， bilateral ureterohydronephrosis， and suspected hypospadias.\n\n【7】The first trimester ultrasound (12+6 WA) was unremarkable and noninvasive prenatal testing was normal. A Cytomegalovirus (CMV) seroconversion was noted in the second trimester of the pregnancy.\n\n【8】The ultrasound performed at 19+2 WA revealed bilateral nephromegaly associated with megabladder and cystic dilation of the penis . The amniotic fluid volume was low-normal (Phelan Index： 8.7 cm) and the fetus was eutrophic. There was no evidence of fetal CMV infection on ultrasound. A first vesicocentesis was performed at 19+4 WA and a second one was scheduled at 19+6 WA to evaluate the fetal renal function. The urinary ionogram was pathological and B2-microglobulin was increased in the urine， indicating fetal renal failure. The molecular karyotype performed on the amniotic fluid was normal.\n\n【9】The follow-up ultrasound performed at 21+0 WA showed the same abnormalities as previously described， but with the addition of oligohydramnios (index： 5.2 cm)，and hyperechoic renal cortices.\n\n【10】After explanation of the situation and prognosis  in our fetal medicine center， the couple requested medical termination of pregnancy. This request was accepted by the medical ethics committee.\n\n【11】The feticide (intracordal sufentanil and intracardiac potassium chloride) and expulsion (induced by mifepristone at D-2 and misoprostol) occurred at 22+0 WA. The patient gave birth to a male child， 520 g and 29 cm.\n\n【12】As the couple did not want an autopsy， no exhaustive post-mortem examination was performed. We noted an enlarged penis ， no palpable erectile body and an unremarkable abdominal wall. Macroscopically， the urinary meatus appeared permeable . These findings， although\n\n| Vesicocentesis  | 19+4WA  | 19+6WA  | Normal values \\[11  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Osmolality (mOsm/L)  | 252  | 245  | <200  |\n| Sodium (mmol/L)  | 122  | 118  | <100  |\n| Potassium {mmol/L)  | 5  | 5  |  |\n| Chloride (mmol/L)  | 98  | 95  | <90  |\n| Calcium (mmol/L)  | 2  | 2  | <0.95  |\n| 32-micraglabulin (mg/L)  | \\>4  | 18.345  | <0.3  |\n\n【14】Table 2： Differential diagnosis.\n\n【15】not comprehensive， are consistent with a diagnosis of primary megalourethra .\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n| Cystic dilation of the penis -differential diagnosis  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Anterior urethral vave  |  |\n| Preputial stenosis  |  |\n| Urethral stenosis  |  |\n| Primary megalourethra  |  |\n| Prune-Belly syndrome  |  |\n| Umbilical cord loop in the pelvic region  |  |\n\n【18】Definition\n\n【19】The first clinical use of the term “megalourethra” dates from 1955and the first prenatal ultrasound diagnosis from 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【20】enlarges， its wall thins， and the erectile bodies become progressively hypoplastic通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.Some authors describe the primary forms as fusiform， i.e. with absence of all the penile erectile bodies， and the secondary forms as scaphoid， where only the corpus spongiosum is a plastic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. This morphological distinction can be seen after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Congenital megalourethra results from an aplasia of penile erectile tissue causing abnormal dilatation of the anterior urethra due to the lack of supporting tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>. Urinary stasis is therefore the consequence of the swelling of the urethra that lacks support. The swelling has a valve-like effect and prevents urine from flowing out通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. These cases can be considered as primary megalourethras 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8\\]</u>. In other so-called secondary cases， urethral dilation is related to a distal urethral obstruction that may result from a valve phenomenon or urethral or preputial stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6，8\\]</u>. As a result， the urethra\n\n【22】Epidemiology\n\n【23】Urogenital tract anomalies are the third most common non-chromosomal anomalies. It is estimated that 3.8 children out of1，000 births are affected by this type of conditions， which makes up approximately 20% of the anomalies diagnosed antenatally. Megalourethra is a rarity among these anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Embryology\n\n【25】Congenital megalourethra is characterized by the absence of penile mesodermal tissue. The cloacal membrane is composed of two layers， theendoderm andthe ectoderm. The mesodermal mesenchyme migrates towards the cranial pole of the cloacal membrane and forms the genital tubercle between the cloacal membrane and the umbilicus. On either side of the cloacal membrane， the mesoderm forms the urogenital folds. More laterally， the labioscrotal swellings are formed. These different structures are the embryonic precursors of the male and female external genitalia.\n\n【26】In response to androgen production in the male fetus， the mesoderm of the genital tubercle elongates and enlarges to form the cavernous bodies and glans penis. At the same time， the urethra is formed by tubularization of the endoderm， while the skin and prepuce develop from the ectoderm. The genital swellings will fuse to form the scrotum.\n\n【27】In the case of secondary megalourethra， the embryological origin of the anomaly is thought to be a defect in the epithelial canalization of the glandular urethra 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6，14，15\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Antenatal description\n\n【29】On ultrasound， the male fetus exhibits an ovoid dilation of the urethra extending to its distal end. LUTO signs can also be found on antenatal examination： megabladder， ureteral dilation， and possibly hydronephrosis with changes in renal echostructure and oligohydramnios 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8，12，16\\]</u>. In some cases， a posterior urethral valve with the \"keyhole sign\" Figure 6 is visible on ultrasound， reflecting dilation of the posterior urethra， and may be the consequence of a severe stenosis of the anterior urethra 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，12\\]</u>.\n\n【30】On ultrasound， cystic dilation ofthe penis should not be mistaken for a loop of the umbilical cord near the pelvic region of the fetus； the distinction is made by using color Doppler 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，17\\]</u> .\n\n【31】Associations\n\n【32】Megalourethra is a rare sign of the Prune-Belly syndrome that combines bladder hypertrophy， ureteral dilatation and abnormalities， hydronephrosis， bladder activity disorders， aplasia or hypoplasia of the muscles of the anterior abdominal wall， and cryptorchidism. Although the etiology is not clearly established， it seems that the primum movens is urethral atresia and the resulting obstruction of the distal urinary tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\nIn their series of 10 cases， Amsalem et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> described a VACTERL association； four fetuses had clubfoot and two had anal atresia. Some authors have associated megalourethra with anorectal|删除段之间换行|malformations， esophageal atresia， VATER association， trisomy21， or dental， intestinal， and musculoskeletal malformations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Therefore， there might be some malformative associations to look for in case of megalourethra， while other anomalies of the anterior urethra are isolated in most cases \\[51.\n\n【34】Management\n\n【35】Vesico-amniotic shunt consists in placing a catheter between the fetal bladder and the amniotic cavity. This allows the bladder to empty， to artificially eliminate the lower urinary obstruction， and to decrease the pressure in the upper urinary tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>.\n\n【36】It is also possible to perform a fetoscopy with cystoscopy to make the diagnosis and， if necessary， to perform a meatotomy or a valve removal，or to place a urethral stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，12，13，21\\]</u>. While the technique is more complicated， its benefits compared to the shunt and its effectiveness cannot be ascertained due to the small number of cases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，22\\]</u>.\n\n【37】These treatments are based on case series concerning LUTOs in general， some of which have included a few cases of megalourethra.\n\n【38】Neonatal consequences\n\n【39】The consequences of megalourethra are the same as those of LUTOs， namely： Pulmonary hypoplasia due to oligohydramnios， progressive renal failure due to vesico-ureteral reflux， micturition disorders，incontinence， recurrent urinary tract infections， and sexual dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，5，16\\]</u>.\n\n【40】The prognosis is worse in case of bilateral ureterohydronephrosis， renal cysts，and oligo-or even anamnios. This is all the more true if the onset is early during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，12\\]</u>. Some authors have described the primary forms as having a poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Postnatal renal function is difficult to predict. Fetal kidney appearance does not seem to correlate with fetal urine biochemistry， and both ultrasonographic kidneyappearance and renal biochemistry should be considered in assessing fetal renal function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. However， fetal urine biochemistry by vesicocentesis is not unanimously accepted for assessing fetal renal function， and even less for predicting it postnatally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Long-term consequences\n\nStudies tend to show an increase in overall survival in the case of prenatal intervention but they do not provide strong evidence of improvement in neonatal kidney function， let alone in the longer term |13，21，24，25.\n\n【44】Penile dysfunctions result in impotence， extensive dilation of the penis preventing correct vaginal intromission， and during micturition， urethral congestion and penile dilation. Few adult cases have been described in the literature. Surgical management is possible to obtain an acceptable aesthetic and functional result 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26-28\\]</u>. Antenatal removal of the obstacle allows recovery of a normal penile morphology， which would suggest that penile functions are better preserved and that reconstructive surgery is not necessary，but this could not be proven 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\nMegalourethra is a rare condition that can easily be detected in the antenatal period， although the definitive diagnosis is more akin to a diagnosis of exclusion for its primary form. In such cases， it is essential to perform a complete fetal morphological examination|删除段之间换行|in order to search for associated conditions or syndromes and repercussions on the urinary tract. As in all forms of LUTO， the neonatal prognosis depends on the severity of renal insufficiency and pulmonary hypoplasia， two parameters that are difficult to assess antenatally and even more difficult to predict postnatally. Therapeutic options exist to allow emptying of the urinary tree and hopefully preserve or improve postnatal renal and pulmonary function by maintaining sufficient diuresis and amniotic fluid volume.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It affects 6 per 100，000 with the highest prevalence in males， whites， and people with 60 years of age or older， with age increasing both， its prevalence and incidence. Potential risk factors for ALS include family history， heavy manual labored occupations， football， agricultural work， pesticides， chemicals， smoking and electric shocks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The primary symptoms include unilateral but progressive weakness in the distal limbs without remission and relapse. Atypical presentation can include weight loss， cognitive impairment， emotional alteration and fasciculations. Muscle cramps and twitches with positive Babinski sign is also seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The duration between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis of ALS is about a year. And by that time nearly 50% to 70% of motor neurons become nonfunctional通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The Cleveland group， based on experimental design hypothesizes that the onset of disease is due to the vulnerability of motor neuron itself， whereas disease progression is the result of immune responses characterized by neuroinflammation，particularly the activation of microglia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【12】In the early 1990s， riluzole (rilutek)， a putative blocker of glutamate release， was established as the first drug for ALS. Riluzole became the gold standard drug which paved the way for newly formulated drugs in the treatment of amyotrophiclateral sclerosis. There are currently five drugs for the management of ALS， namely Rilutek， Tiglutik， Exservan，Radicava and Nuedexta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The first three being different formulations of generic Riluzole. Furthermore， Neudexta is indicated for the treatment of certain unspecific neurologic symptoms， but not for ALS itself.\n\n【13】FDA has approved a new oral drug named “Relyvrio” for the treatment of ALS in adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Experts had concerns regarding the effectiveness of the drug which were ruled out in updated clinical trials data. Relyvrio is a compound of two drugs， sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol. Sodium phenylbutyrate helps in elimination of ammonia from the body while taurursodiol helps liver in detoxification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The drug formerlyknown as AMX0035 can be taken orally or be administered through a feeding tube 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Relyvrio is taken within 1 h of its preparation either orally or through feeding tube. Initial dosing is one packet per day for starting three weeks (3 weeks) followed by a maintenance dose of one packet twice daily.\n\n【15】The efficacy of Relyvrio was tested in a 24-week multicenter， randomized， double-blind，placebo-controlled，parallel group study. The trial showed that the patients treated with relyvrio had a slower decline in daily functioning with longer overall survival as observed， as compared to controls on placebo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nThe pathophysiological mechanism of action is aimed to reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction associated with protein misfolding and aggregation， the ultimate pathogenesis of ALS. Some potential side effects seen with the administration of relyvrio were diarrhea， abdominal pain， nausea， and upper respiratory tract infection. Taurursodiol， a bile acid， can affect patients with problems associated with enterohepatic circulation of bile acids， thus patients with liver dysfunction or with other known comorbid should consult a specialist before|删除段之间换行|intake. The prescribing information lists additional risks associated with relyvrio's administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It’s not known whether it's contraindicated in pregnantladies or children.\n\n【17】ALS is a debilitating disease with a difficult diagnosis， poor prognosis， shorter survival periods and currently has no cure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. With the advances being made in drug therapies， relyvrio can be a breakthrough in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis， with its enhancing effects on life expectancy，as compared to the old drugs in use for ALS. More studies investigating the efficacy and efficiency of Relyvrio in patients with ALS and other related neurological disorders and comorbidities are required to give a better insight of the long-term outcomes of the usage of drug for which longer and larger trials are required.\n\n【18】删除6:<u>2.上Boillee S， Yamanaka K， Lobsiger CS， Copeland NG， Jenkins NA， Kassiotis G， et al.

This situation represents a real challenge for health practitioners since the differential diagnosis between the two entities is not easy to make 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. We report the original case of idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor associated with Graves' ophthalmopathy in elderly patient.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 62-year-old woman with no significant pathological history was referred to our department for exploration of right insidious ocular pain gradually worsening for two months. The somatic examination was without abnormalities except for a discreet right exophthalmia. Orbital ultrasound revealed upper and lower palpebral oedematous infiltration and homogeneous swelling of the right lacrimal gland. Baseline biology was within normal limits： total blood count， erythrocyte sedimentation rate， C-reactive protein， serum calcium， ionogram， creatinine， transaminases， muscle enzymes， lipid parameters， blood glucose， and serum protein electrophoresis. Thyroid tests did not show abnormalities： total thyroxine (fT4) at 9.2pmol/l， Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) at 1.08uUI/ml， negative anti-thyroglobulin antibody (anti-Tg) at 48 IU/ml (<120)， negative anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (anti-TPO) at 30 IU/ml (<120)， and negative anti-TSH receptor antibodies (anti-rTSH) at 0.3 IU/ml(<1).\n\n【13】Histopathological examination ofthe biopsy of the right lacrimal gland resulted in dacryoadenitis. Subsequent investigations had eliminated an underlying systemic disease (connective tissue disease， vasculitis， granulomatosis， hemopathies， and cancers). The diagnosis of idiopathic inflammatory pseudotumor of the orbit/dacryoadenitis type was retained. The patient was treated with systemic glucosteroids with a favorable outcome.\n\n【14】Two years later， the patient returns to our consultation because of acute and painful bilateral exophthalmia associated with a decrease in visual acuity.\n\nSomatic examination noted asymmetrical， non-reducible， and|删除段之间换行|painful bilateral exophthalmos with bilateral upper lid retraction. These signs were more prominent in the left eye . There was also a homogeneous and painless goiter.\n\n【16】Biology revealed hyperthyroidism： fT4 at 25.4 pmol/l and TSH at 0.01 uIU/ml. Cervical ultrasound demonstrated moderate， homogeneous， micro nodular， and hyper vascularized goiter. The thyroid immunity demonstrated positive anti-rTSH auto antibodies at 2.5 IU/ml. Anti-Tg and anti-TPO antibodies were always negative(15IU/mland 35IU/ml). The diagnosis of Graves disease complicated by thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy was retained. The patient was treated with methimazole (30 mg/day) and prednisone (1 mg/kg/day) with a favorable outcome： Fast disappearance of functional complaints， normalization of thyroid tests at two months， and normal appearance of orbital Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at six months .\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The association of idiopathic orbital inflammatory pseudotumor with a thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy is exceptional and unusual通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. In fact， Yan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> in their large series of 209 cases of orbital inflammatory pseudotumors， found no association with a thyroid eye disease； and the systematic review of the literature made in 2015 by Shen et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> found only 7 cases of this association.\n\n【19】This association was described with different types of idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndromesS：：myositis，SsIclerosing orbital inflammation， IgG4-related lymphoplasmacytic infiltrative disorder， dacryoadenitis， and lymphatic inflammatory pseudotumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8，11-14\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The chronology of these two diseases in the same patient is variable； most often they occur specially in time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，14\\]</u>. More rarely， a concomitant diagnosis of the inflammatory pseudotumor of the orbit and Graves ophthalmopathy has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8，12\\]</u>.

There are effective laser treatments for the prevention and therapy of OM， however， the lack of trained professionals difficult the use of this technique in Brazil's public hospitals， being necessary alternative treatments to circumvent this issue. Non-clinical studies conducted by our group to elucidate the mechanism of action of A. chica extract with further toxicity on genotoxicity and mutagenicity reports provided necessary data to apply for authorization to conduct clinical trial with the herbal gel containing 2.5%Arrabidaea chica Verlot standardized extract. The open-label clinical trial protocol aims to access safety issues of the herbal gel on oral mucosa of healthy research participants. This clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of research in humans at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of University of Campinas (report no. 007891/2015). Results of this trial demonstrated that herbal gel is safe， which culminated in the approval of the phase 2 clinical studyprotocols.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Clinical trials are a way to test new methods of diagnosing， treating， or preventing health conditions. The goal is to determine whether something is both safe and effective. Clinical trials take place in four different phases during which different questions are asked. Each phase provide evidence on safety and efficacy issues related to the intervention under study. Drug developments proceed throughout all four phases over a long period of time. With phase four being a surveillance phase after post marketing to monitor safety issues with broaden use. Phase I focuses on safety issues with participant groups that range from 20 to 100 research participants， generally with healthy individuals aiming to determine which is the highest dose humans can tolerate without serious side effects.

Among diseases that are life-threatening with various side effects arising from treatment are neoplasia. Oral Mucositis (OM) is a frequent event in patients treated with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy， which tends to appear in buccal and labial surfaces， the ventral surface of the tongue， the floor of the mouth， and the soft palate of patients. This side effect interferes in patient’s life quality since oral mucositis is associated with considerable pain and dysphagia which also complicates nutritional intake， increases susceptibility to infections， and leads to cancer treatment interruption， that has outcomes on total treatment increased cost 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The Brazilian government published the RENISUS list that consist of plants that are of interest to further study for the purpose to apply in the public system of health (SUS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Arrabidaea chica(Humb.& Bonpl.) Verlot， was included in this list as result of previous reports indicating healing and antiulcerogenic activity in preclinical studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.

Recently Wiziack Zago et al. reported that at low concentrations， A. chica extract showed promising cytoprotective effects against zoledronic acid induced damage.\n\n【7】These results contributed to the development of the phase I clinical study protocol with the objective of identifying possible adverse events and toxicity signs of the herbal medicine containing A. chica extract applied to healthy participants.\n\n【8】Clinical Experience with Phase 1Studies\n\n【9】In the order to evaluate the safety of an herbal gel containing 2.5%Arrabidaea chica Verlot standardized extract on the oral mucosa of healthy research participants a phase 1 clinical trial protocol submitted to the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) was developed. This clinical trial was approved by the ethics committee of research in humans at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of University of Campinas(report no. 007891/2015).\n\n【10】Twenty research participants were selected after laboratory， clinical， and dental evaluation. Ten men and ten women， who were framed within the concept of healthy individuals. Following Resolution 466 of December 2012 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， participants signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF) before entering the open-label study carried out during 30 days. On May 19h， 2016， after medical， dental， and pharmaceutical anamnesis， 1 pump pack containing the herbal medicine (the study object) was dispensed. The herbal medicine was given to participants every 10 days within 30 calendar days.\n\n【11】The instructions were to use the gel three times a day， morning， afternoon， and night， in 4 different oral mucosa regions (palate， right and left cheek， under the tongue). Before each application， participants were guided to sanitize the oral cavity by brushing and flossing teeth with no further water and food intake for 30 min after product application. The participants remained in their routine activities and maintained their normal general diets.\n\n【12】Each participant had a paper file for registering any discomfort or pertinent observation， during the 30 days of gel application， such as burning， use of concomitant medication or even forgetting to apply the gel. Weekly， the participants were submitted to clinical pharmaceutical， medical， and dental evaluations. At the end of the30 days of gel application， all the participants repeated the laboratory tests which， together with the diary and the clinical annotations of the medical records were analyzed to evaluate the possible adverse events generated by the use of the herbal medicine.\n\nThere are no reports of adverse events found in the literature for the crude extract of Arrabidaea chica， therefore， for patient follow-up， the events described in the package insert of a mucoadhesive herbal gel already commercialized and prescribed for mucositis， such as dry mouth， rash， itching， coughing， redness in the face， among other hypersensitivity reactions that could arise were monitored. The extract's red coloring was also taken into account， since the extract could stain mucosa and teeth. Also any discomfort caused by the|删除段之间换行|texture of the gel associated with the sweet taste due to the natural sugars present in the extract was assessed regarding the presence of nausea and even vomiting at the time of application. For security monitoring purposes， the participants were monitored daily and any and every report thoroughly analyzed.\n\n【14】According to the report of all the at the application sites， the oral mucosa， as well as the nearby teeth， were stained with “bright”red， but after a few hours， this color was no longer visible. During the study，the following adverse events were observed：\n\n【15】\\ A participant， displayed throat inflammation after medical evaluation that was promptly treated with anti-inflammatory drugs， nevertheless this event after a thorough clinical evaluation was proven not to have relationship with the test medication.\n\n【16】\\ Complaint of migraine， from a participant after using the herbal medicine for the first time. As the first application of the gel was assisted by the research team， the medical and dental evaluation was immediate， where the use of an analgesic was advised. The second application was then carried out under the supervision ofthe research investigator and there was no further complaint. The adverse event， after clinical evaluations， therefore did not have relationship with the use of the gel.\n\n【17】\\ Report of unpleasant taste by a participant but without signs of nausea or rejection of the gel.\n\n【18】\\ A participant reported that the gel had better grip on the cheeks and felt a numbness in the region of the tongue. After dental evaluation， this reported event may be related to the use of the test medication.\n\n【19】\\ A participant reported pain in the dental arch after the tenth day of the study. Self-medicated with an analgesic and reported pain improvement. The day after the report， a dental evaluation was performed and this event was not related to the use of the test medication， but to a tension in the dental arch.\n\n【20】These results were submitted to the CEP， through a report for the evaluation of the execution of the study as well as of all medical， dental， and pharmaceutical clinical evaluations carried out and of the cases of the reported adverse events. The report was approved culminating in the development of the Phase 2 study protocol，which， after approval by the same ethics committee， is undergoing for the assessment of safety and efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】The complexity of developing a clinical protocol coupled with low financial investment in the areas of research on natural products discourages translational progress from pre-clinical to clinical phases. Therefore， herein insight to the importance of investing on the discovery of new products for the relief of patients' suffering， seeking life quality is a positive influence for the treatment of diseases of life-threatening neoplasia with the various side effects resulting from treatment.

She fulfilled the following criteria of the American College of Rheumatology for SLE diagnosis： positive anti-dsDNA and ANA，leukopenia and cutaneous maculea. She reported three weeks history of edema of lower extremities that progressedanasarca， dyspnea and cough，nighturination and decrease ofurinaryvolume. Thepatient had no chronic illness， no drug or substance use. At the initial physical examination， blood pressure was 100/80 mmHg， body temperature 36.8°C， and heart rate 92 beats/min and rhythmic. It was observed edema of evelid and 3+ edema of pretibial.

Ultrasonographic evaluation revealed normal kidney size， increased to grade 1 echogenicity. In the following days， urine output fell below 400 cc. Serum creatinine varied from 1.6 mg/dl to 5.7 mg/dl and patient was hipervolemic. Immediately started treatment with|删除段之间换行|hemodialysis and kidney biopsy was performed. We thought she was diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis of SLE. Immediately we treated the patient with intravenous prednisolone 1000 mg three days. After she was treated with 48 mg oral methylprednisolone. As she was followed in our service during 25 days， her renal function was normally and proteinuria within 25 days went down to 1.8 g/day. She had no edema anywhere， and did not need hemodialized. She was treated with methylprednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) and miklofenat mofetil (2 g/day). FSGS was detected in kidney biopsy. Endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions were also seen. Pathology was consistent with FSGS. Renal biopsy did not reveal glom ruler lesions by the immunofluorescense was negative for C1q， IgG， IgM and IgA， but 3positive for C3 . Two months after discharge from hospital laboratory test revealed： serum creatinine： 0.5 mg/dl， iirea： 33 mg/dL， albumin： 3.9 g/dL， urinary microscopy is normal and protein excretion is 200 mg/day.\n\n【7】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【8】Our patient presented at least four American College of Rheumatology criteria for diagnosis of SLE (leukopenia， cutaneous maculae， positive ANA， positive anti-dsDNA) and other clinical findings consistent with this diagnosis (hypocomplementemia and arthralgia). It is generally believed that renal abnormalities are caused by LN in well-documented SLE patients. Thus， renal biopsy in SLE is usually recommended not for diagnostic purposes， but rather to determine the type and extent of renal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， as well as to evaluate the activity and chronicity indices. Interestingly， in rare cases， clinically significant renal diseases not associated with LN have been described in patients with SLE. There are only a few reports that this association is often isolated.\n\nIn SLE patients， a wide variety of renallesions not associated with LN may be seen. Renal biopsy plays an important role in determining glomerular disease associated with SLE. SLE patients clinically presenting with nephrotic syndrome indicating Minimal Change Disease (MCD)， Mesangial Proliferation (MsP) or FSGS， while on electronic microscopy， diffuse podocyte foot process removal in absence of sub-epithelial or sub-endothelial deposition is the only|删除段之间换行|morphological feature and now diagnosed as lupus podocytopathy. There are 17 previous reports of FSGS in SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-10\\]</u>. All reported patients presented with NS， normal or more frequently decreased renal function and hypertension. FSGS was preceded 3 to 18 years by renal abnormalities， which were related mostly to a previous LN. How the non-LN develops in patients with SLE is still poorly understood. The association between SLE and some diseases， such asthin-membrane disease， hypertensive nephrosclerosis，1IgA nephropathy and infection-related GN is probably coincident. On the other hand， the more frequentassociation with FSGS and amyloidosis may be pathogenetically concerned to SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Our patient had the histological diagnosis of FSGS.\n\n【10】Lupus podocytopia is susceptible to glucocorticoid therapy. SLs However， the relapse rate can reach up to 90% in treatment with glucocorticoid alone. Glucocorticoid plus other immunosuppressive agents can significantly reduce the relapse rate. Lupus podocytopathy with FSGS offers higher sensitivity to acute renal damage and less sensitivity to glucocorticoid treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，11，12\\]</u>. We treated for FSGS after the biopsy； the patient experienced a full remission during the course of the disease. When non-LN was diagnosed， it was treated with myclofenate mofetil in addition to corticosteroids for FSGS.\n\n【11】Finaly， non-LN may be seen in SLE patients regardless of clinical or serological disease activity. Renal biopsy is an important tool in the identification of these lesions. These kidney lesions have a broad morphological spectrum； one of the most common is FSGS. The combination of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents in SLE patients with acute renal damage and FSGS has increased the success oftreatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The laboratory shall define the performance requirements for the measurement uncertainty of each measurement procedure and regularly review estimates of measurement uncertainty\"(ISO 15189，$5.5.1.4)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【68】In laboratory medicine，measurement results can be determined for both diagnostic decision making and disease prevention.\n\n【69】All clinical laboratories， in order to ensure the quality of the results and their comparability at different times and places， must demonstrate that they use validated test methods， guarantee the metrological traceability of their measurements and indicate the measurement uncertainty associated with each of the results.\n\n【70】The standard ISO/TS 20914：2019 - “Medical laboratories -Practical guidance for the estimation of measurement uncertainty\"通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> provides the requirements for its assessment.\n\n【71】This uncertainty must be periodically reviewed and maintained at acceptable levels in relation to the analytical objectives. Measurement uncertainty must also be estimated for the most relevant quantitative phases of the examination processes that provide nominal qualitative results.\n\n【72】Knowledge of uncertainty of the examination performed in the medical laboratory is necessary to be aware of the reliability of its results. The fundamental aspects are repetition and level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>：\n\n【73】Whatever the method appliedforthe laboratory examination， the “accuracy of the uncertainty\" is evident from repetitions of the examination on the same material (conditions of repeatability). In support of this comes the Internal Quality Control(CQI) which allows to identify the dispersion of the numerical quantitative results and the frequency of positives for the nominal qualitative results；\n\n【74】The uncertainty also depends on the level of property measured in the material， both for numerical quantitative and nominal qualitative results.\n\n【75】Security management\n\n【76】“The laboratory and associated office facilities shall provide an environment suitable for the tasks to be undertaken， to ensure the following conditions are met. Access to areas affecting the quality of examinations is controlled， safety facilities and devices are provided and their functioning regularly verified.\" (ISO 15189， $5.2.2)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【77】Laboratories are environments work in which there may be dangers to the health and safety of those who work there.\n\n【78】Security， understood as a \"condition free from any danger or risk\"， represents a \"good\" that can be duly prosecuted， but it must be remembered that it is a probabilistic state and never a state of certainty.\n\n【79】When risk factors exist in an environment work (for health and/or safety)， the protective measures that are put in place must aim to eliminate them or， if this is not possible， to minimize them.\n\n【80】Within the ISO 15189 requirements， the responsibility for safety is attributed to the Laboratory Director； in fact， standard underlined that “The laboratory director shall implement a safe laboratory environment in compliance with good practice and applicable requirements”(ISO 15189， S 4.1.1.4，e)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【81】The standard ISO15190：2020- “Medicallaboratories Requirements for safety\" 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> has not created for accreditation， but explicitly states that it can be used for this purpose by governmental， professional or other authorities. It defines how to establish and maintain a safe working environment in a medical laboratory. The standard states that a work area safety manual must be readily available with mandatory reading for all employees and must contain security policy， fire prevention， electrical safety， chemical safety， radiation exposure， biological risks， and hazardous waste disposal.\n\n【82】The safety manual must include detailed instructions for evacuation from the workplace and the protocols to be put in place to deal with any accidents. The safety program (evaluated with Safety program audits) must be verified and reviewed at least once a year and the premises must be inspected (Safety inspection) at least with the same frequency.\n\n【83】Audit management\n\n“The laboratory shall conduct internal audits at planned intervals to determine whether all activities in the quality management system， including pre-examination， examination， and post-examination：|删除段之间换行|a) Conform to the requirement of this International Standard and to requirements established by the laboratory， and|删除段之间换行|b) Are implemented， effective， and maintained.” (ISO 15189， S4.14.5)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【85】ISO 15189 requires that a documented procedure for the management of audits must be in place that an audit program must be defined that includes the treatment of all elements of the management system. Internal audits must be carried out by competent and independent personnel (with respect to the activity being audited) and the standard EN ISO 19011：2018-“Guidelines for auditing management systems\" 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> is expressly mentioned as a guide to follow for the execution.\n\n【86】This standard has aligned with many recently published ISO standards by including a risk-based approach： An audit approach that considers risks and opportunities of the audit activities.\n\n【87】The risk-based approach influences planning， conduct and reporting of audits in order to ensure that the latter are focused on significant issues for the client and to achieve the audit program objectives.\n\n【88】The process approach is central to this standard as auditors should understand that conducting a management system audit means auditing an organization s processes and their interactions in relation to one or more standards of management systems. Results are achieved more effectively and efficiently when activities are understood and managed as interrelated processes that act as an organic system.\n\nThe investigation techniques， therefore， should include interviews guided by the 5 \"key questions\" of aprocess audit structured according to the logical PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) sequence：|删除段之间换行|1\\. What are you trying to achieve? (PLAN： What are the objectives， plans and how are they managed?)；\n\n【90】2\\. How did you work/are you working to get it? (DO： What are the operational activities and the related support elements and how are they carried out?)；\n\n【91】3\\. How do you know if you have achieved what you want?(CHECK： What are the measurements and monitoring and how are they carried out?)；\n\n【92】4\\. How do you know if what you are adopting is the best way to achieve what you want? (ACT： What improvement actions have been planned and carried out?)；\n\n【93】5\\. How can you be sure that what you are trying to achieve is right? (How is the overall consistency of the system guaranteed? Is there continuity between strategic and operational objectives?).\n\n【94】Conclusion\n\n【95】By analyzing the standard ISO 15189 it is clear that there are various requirements that need precise and specific details. For this purpose，there are various standards to support a Medical Laboratory to guide it in the implementation of a management system compliant with ISO 15189； these standards provide more details to demonstrate the compliance of key processes with the requirements ofthe standard and guide thelaboratory towards planning and implementing actions to address the risks and opportunities of the various processes involved. This represents the basis for increasing the effectiveness of the management system， obtaining better results and preventing negative effects that could cause harm to patients，laboratory staffand environment.\n\n【96】The consistency of diagnostic resultsSbetween different laboratories (even from different countries) is facilitated when medical laboratories comply with these standards in the correct， complete， effective and efficient implementation of their ISO 15189system.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Intraoperatively， FJ tube was found to be lying freely in the abdomen， leak was noted from the pancreaticojejunostomy site， anastomosis was reinforced with vicryl and fibrin glue. Witzel feeding jejunostomy was redone. Following re-exploration， she developed high output uncontrolled biliary fistula from subhepatic drain and midline wound. She was tested COVID positive on POD32 and was shifted to a designated COVID centre. She later developed grade B post-pancreatic hemorrhage. She received multiple blood transfusions. CT angiography however could not localize the bleed site.

One such incident is the case of a young female who presented with a large amount of ingestion of a caustic substance at her residence. Hemodynamic stabilization and securing the airway are crucial in the initial hours of corrosive injury to prevent early deaths. Early endoscopic assessment and liberal use of CT scans in cases of discordant findings on endoscopy will help in detecting the extent of the injury and plan further management accordingly. In cases of extensive caustic injuries， large duodenal perforations， traumatic injuries to the pancreas and duodenum， it is imperative to perform a pancreaticoduodenectomy although carries a high rate of morbidity (80%) and mortality (40%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The rate of complications is also high owing to hemodynamic instability， extensive injuries，and unanticipated difficulties at the time of surgery.

The reoperation rate in these patients is high one reason being delayed extension of caustic necrosis to other intra abdominal organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， which could have led to the dislodgement of feeding jejunostomy in this case. The other reasons for reoperations are intra abdominal collections due to anastomotic leaks， pancreatic and biliary fistulas， erosion of other intra abdominal organs， and hemorrhage. Although pancreaticojejunostomy has a high risk ofleakage in the setting of the soft texture of pancreas， small duct size， and the complication rate following pancreaticojejunostomy at the time of primary surgery is lower than with closure of pancreatic duct remnant， although both carry similar morbidity and mortality rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

Anamnestically， she reported 4 miscarriages， 2 stillbirths， and previous cholecystectomy for stones. The EnS had started at the age of 20 years. At 22 years of age， the patient had performed an Electroencephalogram (EEG) following a generalized tonic-clonic seizure， which showed the presence of modest irritative signs with diffuse projection prevailing over the anterior regions； marked tendency to drowsiness was also reported on that occasion. These EEG changes persisted for about 20 days and then disappeared in subsequent control tracings. At the time she was placed on antiepileptic treatment with Carbamazepine (CBZ) 200 mg 3 times/day，continued for 7 years. During drug treatment the EnS disappeared to reappear upon discontinuation of CBZ.\n\n【16】The patient then performed neurologic re-evaluation and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ofthe brain，both of which were negative. A subsequent video-EEG was normal except documenting an episode of enuresis upon reaching stage 1 of non-REM sleep and failure to reach the deeper stages of sleep. Epileptic genesis of the enuresis was therefore ruled out. Various antimuscarinics and Amitriptyline were prescribed sequentially， all ofwhich were ineffective on enuresis.\n\n【17】When the patient came to our observation， she reported stably using nighttime diapers. The4-day bladder diaries documented constant enuresis (350 cc to 550 cc by wipe weighing) and 4 to5 daytime voiding’s with average bladder capacity about 250 cc and average micturition urgency of grade 1.5 (range 0-2) according to the \"Patient’s Perception of Intensity of Urgency Scale\"(PPIUS)， which describes the degree of micturition urgency on a scale from 0 (no urgency) to 4 (urge urinary incontinence)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Post-void residual was not detected. On urodynamic study， reduced cytometric maximal bladder capacity was detected， and the micturition phase occurred with detrusor contraction . Normality of anemia， plasma and urinary osmolarity excluded possible endocrine causes of enuresis such as diabetes insipidus or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone. Thus， a picture of overactive bladder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> associated with sleep disturbance was diagnosed.\n\n【18】All proposed behavioral and pharmacological treatments (reduced evening water intake， desmopressin， night alarm， antimuscarinics such as oxybutynin and solifenacin， mirabegron) were ineffective even in combination. Therefore， the patient resumed low-dose CBZ intake (200 mg/day)， with significant reduction of enuresis episodes (1 wet night every 9-10)， with no changes in bladder diaries and in post-void residual. During treatment anemia， urinary osmolality and serum osmolality remained in the normal range. After 6 months， the patient preferred to discontinue therapy due to side effects such as sensory dulling and drowsiness.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\nPrimary nocturnal enuresis (EnP)， a common condition that affects 5% to 10% of children up to 7 years of age， appears to depend to varying degrees on 3 factors： bladder dysfunction， nocturnal polyuria， and failure to awaken to the sensation of bladder filling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In EnS， on the other hand， it is believed that the underlying causes of the disorder are predominantly overactive bladder-as reported by Madhu et al. in 201r analysis of 12，795 women undergoing comprehensive evaluation including urodynamic study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> -or bladder dysfunction associated with sedative drugs use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> or obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. There is also believed to be a relationship between some types of focal epilepsy and|删除段之间换行|enuresis删除4:<u> 71</u>.\n\n【21】Few studies in the literature， most of them quite dated and with unambiguous conclusions， have investigated the possible involvement of sleep disturbances among the pathogenetic mechanisms of EnP. Through polysomnographic recording of 25 enuretic subjects aged 7 to 17 years， Neveeus et al. showed that enuresis occurred predominantly during non-REM sleep 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， a finding confirmed by other authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition， a systematic review on the possible role of sleep and arousal activation mechanisms in the pathogenesis of enuresis found that enuretics have a higher arousal threshold with deeper sleep 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Al-Waili et al. evaluated the use of CBZ in EnP： In a randomized trial of 26 subjects， he found that CBZ 200 mg was significantly effective compared to placebo in the treatment of EnP (mean number of dry nights/months 18.8±8.8vs.3.9±5.2 with placebo)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In2006， the same author observed in 8 patients that CBZ produced a marked reduction in daytime and nighttime diuresis and an average increase in 24-h urinary osmolality of 43% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， suggesting an antidiuretic effect of CBZ.\n\n【23】Another interesting finding regarding CBZ comes from a couple of case-reports in which its prolonged intake had caused chronic urine retention that resolved with discontinuation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. These cases suggest that CBZ can facilitate urine storage in susceptible people through 2 different mechanisms： The anticholinergic effect with reduction of bladder contractility and the increase of bladder outlet resistance due to hypertone of the internal urethral sphincter.\n\n【24】In the case we described， an epileptic genesis of EnS was ruled out， whereas thanks to Polysomnography， an episode of enuresis was detected during phase 1 of non-REM sleep-that is， the transitional phase from wakefulness to the onset of falling asleep， during which all muscular activity is lost. Therefore， we believe that the causes of EnS in the present case are due to the concomitance of a sleep disorder， with defective awakening mechanisms to the micturition stimulus， and overactive bladder syndrome with good adaptation to bladder symptoms during the waking state. Given that only CBZ has been able to control enuresis， which was refractory to all the treatments included antimuscarinics licensed for overactive bladder， its action on bladder overactivity as well as modulating effect in the central nervous system are conceivable.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】In EnS refractoryto conventional treatments， CBZ may be a viable therapeutic option probably mainly due to its anticholinergic effect on bladder contraction. However， CBZ is not tolerated by all subiects and its use necessitates careful clinical and biohumoral monitoring(CBZ blood dosage， natremia and liver function).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In the clinical picture one could find pronounced muscle contractures of upper arm and especially of leg muscles with sharp limitation of movement's range in large joints， together with “woody”firmness of the limb muscles with painless tumor-like swellings within the muscles of upper arms and thighs. EMG showed abnormal spontaneous electrical activity， very short motor unit potentials and increased incidence of polyphasic potentials. Muscle biopsy showed pronounced increase of the fibrous tissue around muscle fascicles in perimysium exclusively， this was combined with massive inflammatory cell infiltrates， and diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration with small foci inside endomysium. Increased variability in the fiber's size， as well as atrophy， focal degenerative changes and necrosis of some muscle fibres was also evident. Treatment with prednisolone in combination with cyclophosphane caused decrease of both nodule's size and firmness of muscles， accompanied by some increase of joint movement's range.\n\n【2】Keywords： Fibrosing myositis； Localized nodular myositis； Muscle and joints contractures； Inflammation； Polymyositis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Localized nodular myositis is a very rare disorder， and its nosological place remains unclear. Some authors consider it to be a nosological entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-6\\]</u>； others think that it is a clinical and pathological variant of polymyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. However some authors suppose that separating of localized nodular myositis from polymyositis and dermatomyositis syndromes will be possible only after careful clinical and pathological analysis of many more cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. We examined a patient in whom localized nodular myositis was one of the clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Patient F. (n2380) aged 64 was admitted to the clinic in January删除4:<u> 1990</u>. He complained of sharp difficulties in walking and the limitation of movements range in large joints of extremities because of severe muscle stiffness， and presence of the extremely firm painless masses within upper arm and thigh muscles with slight weakness of the arm muscles.\n\n【7】The disease has been developing since November， 1966 when the right ankle joint and the lower leg oedema developed. Severe pain in the region of talocrural joints and in gastrocnemius muscle during walking as well as hyperemia of the right lower leg soon followed. In December， 1988 the oedema widely spread to his right leg totally， and the lower leg and thigh muscles became large， firm and painful. In 3 months the same changes appeared in his left leg. In March， 1989 the patient walked with difficulties because of sharp stiffness of the leg muscles and pain in gastrocnemius muscles. There was no pain in leg joints.\n\n【8】cited.\n\nAt that time the diagnosis of thrombophlebitis of lower limb’s veins was established. However the special treatment was ineffective and the diagnosis of thrombophlebitis was not confirmed. In May， 1989 despite of the decrease ofleg's oedema the muscles of the legs and pelvic girdle remained extremelyhard and stiff. The patient could walk on his toes only and with the help of a stick because|删除段之间换行|of sharp limitation of range of movement in knee and ankle joints. In September， 1989 the volume of muscles of the upper arms enlarged， they became very firm and slightly painful， and limitation of range of movement in left elbow joint developed. Large， firm and slightly tender nodules appeared simultaneously in the upper arm and thigh muscles， and later such developed at the outer surface of right lower leg (this nodes disappeared themselves after some months). There was no muscle weakness and pain in the leg muscles and in joints. However the patient could walk using crutches only，because “his legs were hard and straight like sticks\". In December， 1989 the patient|删除段之间换行|was hospitalized in the surgical department with the diagnosis of the femur sarcoma. We could not perform MRI of nodules. However the signs of neoplasia were excluded by punctured biopsy of the nodules with thorough muscle histology， gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy， X-ray pictures of chest， femur and joints. Blood and ESR were normal. Diagnosis of sarcoma was not confirmed. The granulomatous myositis (may be sarcoid nodular myositis) was suspected by neurologist (V. Kazakov).\n\n【10】Status\n\n【11】General condition was well. Body temperature was normal；pulse rate was 76， and the respiration rate删除4:<u> 16</u>. Blood pressure was 130/80mmHg. Hepar， spleen and peripheral lymphonodules were not enlarged. Slight oedema and hyper pigmentation of the distal parts of lower legs and ankles were present.\n\n【12】Slight periorbital oedema was present also. Slight weakness of the orbital part of orbicular is oculimuscles was revealed. Swallowing and phonation were not disturbed. No atrophy of the tongue. Moderate atrophy of left trapezius， supra-and infraspinatus， deltoid us and triceps brachii muscles， as well as the muscles of the forearms and dorsal interosseous hand muscles bilaterally were evident. The interscapular space is deepened， the inner edge ofleft scapula slightly recede from the thorax. The muscles， especially biceps brachii， muscles ofpelvic girdle， thighs and lower legspalpatory had “woody”consistency. Painless swellings， without clear borders or connection to skin with “woody”firmness were palpated within biceps brachii(10 cm x6 cm on the right and 15 cm x10 cm on the left) and vastus lateralis (6 cm × 4 cm bilaterally) muscles .\n\n【13】One could see severe contractures of biceps brachii muscles， more prominent at left， as well as gluteus maximus， quadriceps， posterior groups of the thighs and lower leg muscles. Both active and passive movements were limited in shoulder and elbow joints and were almost impossible in hip joint， knee and ankle joints. The patient couldn't abduct his arms to vertical position and to extent his forearms fully . He walked with difficulties on the straight legs using crutches only  and he could “sit only with his legs straightened and his trunk being thrown back\" .

Deep tendon reflexes at arms and legs were absent. Fasciculation's and percussion myoedema were also absent. There were no pyramidal signs. The sensibility and the coordination of movements were not disturbed.\n\nRoutine hematology and biochemistry including CPK， LDH， SGOT，SGPTandTSHwerenormal.LE-cells were absent.Rheumatoid factor； serological reactions on brucellosis and toxoplasmosis were negative. X-rays pictures of the chest， bones (cranium， pelvis， and extremities)， large joints and limb muscles were normal. ECG showed consistent left His bundle block. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed diffuse changes of hepatic parenchyma and the signs of right|删除段之间换行|chronic pyelonephritis. Biceps brachii and vastus lateralis muscle's needle EMG showed fibrillation potentials， positive sharp waves， increased insertion activity and pseudomyotonic discharges at rest. The mean duration of 20 motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) in m. biceps brachii was 3 msec-3.5 msec (normal 7.3 msec-8 msec) and mean amplitude was 250 uv -350 uv (normal 500 uv). The mean duration of the 20 MUAPs in the vastus lateral is was 3.5 msec(normal 7.4 msec-10 msec) and mean amplitude was 350 uv-400 uv(normal 900 uv). At maximum voluntary muscle contraction a low-amplitude interference pattern was evident in both muscles. 80% of action potentials were polyphasic and pseudopolyphasic.\n\n【17】Maximum conduction velocities of motor fibers of both ulnar and tibialis posterior nerves from elbow to wrist and from knee to the ankle were normal bilaterally.\n\nBiopsy of m. peroneus longus from the region of a prior swelling， which disappeared itself some months ago， showed increase of connective tissue， inflammation and apparently spared muscle fascicles. Extreme increase of the fibrous tissue particularly in|删除段之间换行|perimysial space which seemed to wrap and compress the muscle fascicle was the most prominent histologic feature . Increase of the interstitial connective tissue was evident inside endomysial space as well， but to alesser extent. Massive inflammatory cell infiltrates were concentrated predominantly in the perimysium fibrous tissue between muscle fascicles as well as near and around perimysial blood vessels . Diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration was present in both perimysial and endomysial spaces with rare foci enclosing some muscle fibers， as well as in the region of damaged muscle fibers. Inflammatory cell infiltrates consisted of lymphocytes， histiocytes， and rarely plasma cells. Cross section of the diameter of the adjacent muscle fibres showed its increased variation with atrophy， segmental necrosis， degeneration， vesicular and internal nuclei， and decrease in longitudinal and transverse striation， increase in the number of sarcolemmal nuclei of some muscle fibers， and a small number of regenerating muscle fibers with prominent dark nucleoli . Productive inflammation with endothelial hyperplasia in perimysial blood vessels was not found.\n\n【19】Right lower leg skin biopsy performed at the site of muscle biopsy， showed the areas of some atrophy and oedema of epidermis together with collagenous fibresoedema with slight lymphocytic cell infiltration near and around blood vessels .\n\n【20】The patient was treated by oral prednisolone in the dose 1 mg/kg/day (80 mg/day) together with intramuscular cyclophosphane in the dose 2.5 mg/kg/day (200 mg/day). The size and firmness of nodules as well as firmness of muscles decreased after 1.5 months of treatment； muscle strength increased and the range of movements in joints increased a little too.\n\n【21】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【22】Manyinvestigations distinguish a special rare variant of\"localized nodular myositis\"as a well-known form of inflammatory myopathies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-6，12-15\\]</u>. Some authors described this form under the name“focal myositis”as a new clinical and pathological entity representing benign pseudotumour of skeletal muscle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The disease manifested with rapidly growing painful swellings resembling muscle tumor or venous thrombophlebitis of lower legs in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Authors considered that “focal myositis\"differed from polymyositis. Although this disease is characterized by myalgia and inflammation in a muscle， the pathological process always remains limited to one zone of a single muscle only， and the signs of systemic disease are not observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14，18-24\\]</u>.Similar cases were describedbyotherauthors later 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，16，25-29\\]</u>. In some works 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，30\\]</u> it was shown that focal myositis differs from polymyositis greatly by immunological and clinical changes despite of similar morphological changes in muscles. The same opinion had some other authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14，16，18，20，21，27，29\\]</u>. However some authors opposed then osological entity of \"localized nodular myositis”among inflammatory myopathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8，31\\]</u>. These authors suggest that the clinical and pathological evidence indicates a close relationship between localized nodular myositis and polymyositis， as the former clinical picture often precedes and evolves into the latter. It is necessary to remark that such forms of polymyositis starting as focal processes were rarely described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8，32，31\\]</u>.\n\nThe clinical picture in our patient differs from that was reported earlier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8，31\\]</u>. In these cases the polymyositis began with the development of painful nodules within limb muscles. Progressive muscle contractures were not found. In the early stage of the disease the restriction of movements was connected with pain full nodules，|删除段之间换行|but in the later stage with severe weakness and atrophy of muscles. Thus in these cases localized nodular myositis was a prelude of polymyositis.\n\n【24】In our patient the disease started with oedema， painfulness，“woody\"firmness and stiffness of lower leg and pelvic girdle muscles with rather fast， almost simultaneous， development of contractures of these muscles. Just pronounced contractures of muscles themselves， but not muscle weakness became the cause of sharp limitation of range of movements in our patient.\n\n【25】The clinical picture in our patient differs from the clinical picture in patients with “Stiff Person Syndrome”(SPS). In SPS patient the muscles of the arms and legs don't have “woody\"consistency during palpation， as well as painless nodules of “woody”firmness within some muscles of arms and legs， and pronounced contractures of muscles， which sharply limit patient's movements. Our patient as well had no fluctuating muscular rigidity with repeated episodes of painful muscle spasms which are characteristic for SPS. In SPS patients at initial stage of the disease as a rule there are no signs resembling thrombophlebitis with lower leg oedema and skin hyperemia that we observed in our patient. Unfortunately， in that period we could not determine anti-GAD antibodies that are characteristic of the SPS.\n\n【26】Bradley et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u> described three patients aged 23， 4 and 6 with extreme perimysial and less endomysial fibrosis that was a result of contractures of muscles which caused the limitation of movements more than muscle weakness. However in these patients the disease began in early childhood and they had no“woodynodules within the muscles， although muscles in Case 1 and Case 3 were extremely firm with “woody\"consistency during palpation.\n\n【27】Earlier Walton and Adams named such cases as \"chronic myositis fibrosa\" and suggested them to represent simply a chronic phase of polymyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. However in our patient the contractures of muscles of “woody\"firmness developed at the beginning of the disease， and proceeded during 4-6 months， so according to Hudgson our case can be attributed to subacute polymyositis， and not chronic one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【28】In our patient the picture of morphological changes in the muscle somehow resembled the changes which were observed by some authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，7，9\\]</u>. However coarse degenerative changes of muscle fibers with their replacement by fibrous connective tissue and fat， as it was reported in the cases of the authors cited were not found in our case. The most prominent feature in our case was the extreme increase of connective tissue with massive lympho-histiocytic infiltrates predominantly in perimysial space， and scattered atrophy and degenerative changes of some muscle fibers. All slides of this muscle biopsy specimen were discussed in 1990 at the Round table consultation service of selected cases (Head Prof. Dr. Schroder J.M.) at the VII International Congress on Neuromuscular Diseases in Munchen， Germany.\n\n【29】Histological diagnosis was polymyositis. Activity of the serum enzymes was normal in our patient. It was possibly connected with the absence of rough damage of muscle fibers as well as by extreme increase of connective tissue and a long standing disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，35\\]</u>. At EMG one could see changes resembling polymyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\nHowever， the clinical picture of the disease in our patient differs greatly from “pure”polymyositis. He had painless muscles of“woody”firmness and intramuscular “woody”swellings resembling sarcoma， which developed after the pronounced muscle contractures|删除段之间换行|The latter caused sharp limitation of movements in large joints of extremities practically through the whole duration of the disease. Extreme perimysial fibrosis without coarse damage of muscle fibres， which usually cause severe muscle contractures， and without visible muscle weakness and atrophy characterized our case.\n\n【31】Thus in our case at the basis of peculiarities of clinical picture， histological muscle changes， EMG results， and some improvement from prednisolone and cyclophosphane treatment we suppose that the localized nodular myositis was one of clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis.\n\n【32】Sarcoid nodular myositis was excluded because at muscle biopsy no typical sarcoid histological changes including necrotic zones and interstitial granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and epithelioid cells were found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36-38\\]</u>. Also chest X-ray picture showed no enlarged lymph nodules. Absence of the calcifications， osteoid and cartilage formations on radiographs of the arm and leg muscles allowed to exclude myositis ossificans progressive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39，40\\]</u>. It is quite possible that localized nodular myositis in some cases is a clinical and pathological and even immunological entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，13，14，19-24，27，29，41，\\]</u>，but in other rare cases it may be the first manifestation of polymyositis or one of the clinical signs of subacute fibrosing polymyositis as we observed in our case删除4:<u> 7，17，18，31，32</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Developing countries including Africa are at risks of getting more infected due to less awareness and ill-equipped health facilities. For such countries， accurate prediction of the COVID-19 cases could help the policy makers in decision making and proper utilization of the available resources. Machine Learning (ML) approaches are excellent tools for making predictions especially for an uncertain and stochastic phenomenon such as COVID-19. Therefore， Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as ML tool was employed to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. In this way， data including daily and cumulative cases as well as daily and cumulative mortality rate were collected from February 2020 till December删除4:<u> 2021</u>. Five different models were developed using varied input combinations. Determination Coefficient (DC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were employed as performance metrics. The results showed all the developed models produced good prediction skill but M4 with DC=0.9996 and RMSE=0.0017 in the validation step led to better performance. The general results of this study emphasize the importance of using ANN for the prediction of COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.\n\n【2】Keywords： COVID-19；Machine learning； Pandemic； Nigeria； Africa\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The total confirmed cases of COVID-19 have reached 396，558，014 as of February 9hh， 2022according to the World Health Organization. The pandemic has become a serious health challenge worldwide. The call for artificial intelligence integration in the fight against the deadly virus was made by the White House in collaboration with tech companies and research institute as well. Personalized preventive measures can significantly help from precise characterization of the population based on classified COVID-19 vulnerability. The initial examination that elderly populace has an elevated risk to coronavirus disease 2019 is challenged by a different study that more and more youthful adults experienced chronic COVID-19 signs， showing an emergency need of abroad risk assessment based on physiological features and personalized genetic.\n\n【5】Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have the capacity to integrate and analyze huge-scale data of coronavirus disease 2019 patients， which can help in understanding the viral spread pattern， develop new efficient therapeutics strategies， further improve testing/diagnostic accuracy and speed and potentially explore the most susceptible persons based on personalized genetic as well as physiological features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Interestingly， within a limited time period since the pandemic started， ML methods have been utilized in taxonomic categorization of coronavirus disease 2019 genomes， survival projection of chronic COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Namasudra et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> employed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict COVID-19 cases. Nabi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> employed ANN and other ML tools for the prediction of COVID-19 diseases outbreak. De Araijo Morais and da Silva Gomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> applied ANN and other prediction model for the forecasting of daily COVID-19 cases in the world.\n\n【6】Despite been amongst the highest recorded number of cases and death in Africa， studies of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria are very limited. Therefore， owing to its robustness in dealing with the uncertain aspect of COVID-19， Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria using several input combinations.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】Study country\n\nNigeria is a tropical zone region located in west Africa with 923，770km’ oftotal area. A distance|删除段之间换行|of 1，050 km separated southern Nigeria from northern Nigeria while1，150 km is the west to east optimum distance. Benin， Cameroon， Niger and Chad are some of the African countries that share border with Nigeria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Figure 1 shows the study country.\n\n【10】The data used in this study were obtained and can be downloaded from https：//github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/.Table 1 shows statistical description of the data.\n\n【11】It can be seen from Table 1 that the COVID-19 cases in Nigeria within the selected period were up to a maximum 6，158 in a single day and cumulatively， the cases were up to 241，513 (as of February 28h，2020 to December 315，2021). A maximum of 93 daily death can also be seen while cumulative death stands at删除4:<u> 3，030</u>.\n\n【12】Data normalization and performance criteria\n\n【13】To ensure all variables have the same treatment and to eliminate their dimensional discrepancy， data Normalization is usually applied for AI-based modeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Therefore， the data were normalized to fall between 0 and 1 as：\n\n【14】Where D，D，D. and D are the normalized data， ith data value， minimum and maximum data values， respectively.\n\n【15】To determine the performance of the developed models， Determination Coefficient (DC) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) were employed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， given by：\n\n【16】Where CC is cumulative case of the ith value， N， cc， and CC are the number of observations， predicted values and mean of the observed values， respectively. The DC ranges between - o to 1 and RMSE between 0 to o with DC towards 1 and RMSE close to 0 imply high efficiency.\n\n【17】Artificial neural network (ANN)\n\nANN provides a determined approach in dealing with non-linear， noisy， and dynamic data， more specifically when the physical|删除段之间换行|fundamental relationships are not completely known. Detail information regarding ANN can be found in study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Results and Discussion\n\n【20】In this study， the potential of ANN in predicting cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria was investigated. For machine learning applications， selection of the most appropriate inputs are significant in determining the most efficient prediction performance， as incorrect inputs may results in error and performance deficiency. Recent studies including Ibrahim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> show that using COVID-19 cases at previous time step may lead to accurate prediction. However， the daily COVID-19 cases as well as the daily and cumulative death could have a significant impact on cumulative cases. Therefore， in this study，5 different models were developed using different input combination to determine the highest performance. Table 2 shows the developed models and their training and validation percentages.\n\n【21】For the ANN model in both stations， FFBP was used for the model training using Levenberg Marquardt (LM) algorithm. Single hidden layer was used and via trial and error， the best number of hidden laver neurons was selected. Table 3 shows the results of the developed models. The structure x-y-z implies number of inputs， hidden layer neurons and output layer， respectively.\n\n【22】As shown in Table 3， different inputs combination led to different performance. These results show that using COVID-19 cumulative cases at previous time and other data could be employed sufficiently for COVID-19 case prediction. In the training phase， it can be seen that M2 (CCCCCCCC )，M4 (New case， new death， CCp CC2) and M5 (New case， new death，CCr.3p CC a) provided the best prediction performance in terms of DC with 0.9999 value. However， with respect to RMSE，M4 (New case， new death， CC CC) produced better skill than all other models with 0.0004 value. Therefore，this demonstrated the rationality of combining daily cases and death with previous cumulative cases to enhance prediction performance.\n\n【23】In the validation phase in Table 3， it can be seen that despite the nonlinear aspect of ANN and its ability to deal with uncertain stochastic phenomena， the performance of ANN decreases in the validation phase. Similar to the training phase， M4 in the validation phase led to best performance with lowest error RMSE=0.0017 and highest goodness of fit DC=0.9996. Comparing the results of this study with that of Ibrahim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> it can be seen that despite having\n\n【24】Table 1： Statistical description of the used data.\n\n| Data  | Period  | Minimum  | Maximum  | St. deviation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| New case  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 0  | 6158  | 460.17  |\n| Cumulative case  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 1  | 241513  | 75734.58  |\n| New death  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 0  | 93  | 6.97  |\n| Cumulative death  | 28-02-2020-31-12-2021  | 0  | 3030  | 914.75  |\n\n【26】Table 2： Models development with their training and validation subsamples.\n\n| Model  | Inputs  | Training subsample  | Validation subsample  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| M1  | CCi-1gCCn-2pCCrapCC似  | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n| M2  | CC-spCC1-5pCCf6FCC471  | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n| M3  | New case， new death， cum. death  | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n| M4  | New case， new death， CCerjCCnt2)  | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n| M5  | New case， new death，CCfneaja CCvc)  | 75%通用删除7(英):<u>(471)</u>  | 25%通用删除7(英):<u>(202)</u>  |\n\n| Table 3： Results of the developed models.  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Model  | Structure  | DC  | RMSE  | DC  | RMSE  |\n| M1  | 4-10-1  | 0.9978  | 0.004  | 0.9637  | 0.0473  |\n| M2  | 4-7-1  | 0.9999  | 0.0014  | 0.9993  | 0.0023  |\n| M3  | 3-8-1  | 0.9998  | 0.0035  | 0.9836  | 0.0109  |\n| M4  | 4-11-1  | 0.9999  | 0.0004  | 0.9996  | 0.0017  |\n| M5  | 4-9-1  | 0.9999  | 0.0011  | 0.9991  | 0.0026  |\n\n【29】same study location (Nigeria)，performance of the ANN model in this study is superior. Many issues could lead to the discrepancy in the results. (i) The duration of the data could play a major role in the performance as this study covered entire period from the day of first cases in Nigeria 通用删除7(英):<u>(28-02-2020)</u> to where decline in number of cases started. This implies that the study covered both the peak and least periods of the pandemic which might results in proper simulation of the uncertainty surrounding the system. (ii) The study by Ibrahim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> employed only the previous time step for their prediction while this study shows that addition of the cases and death input data could enhance prediction of the pandemic. Figure 2 shows the graphical comparison of the developed models.\n\n【30】The radar chart shown in Figure 2 compares the performance of the 5 developed models based on DC and RMSE. From the chart， as goodness of fit measure， the more open and wider the chart is， the better performance based on DC. While narrower chart signifies the most efficient performance with respect to RMSE. It can be seen from Figure 2 that all models led to performance close to 1. Similarly， the models performed excellent with a relatively small error for RMSE. This is an indication that once ANN model is well developed， the performance indicators irrespective of whether graphical or tabular approach is used the results would be accurate. Figure 3 compares the performances ofthe developed models against the observed data.\n\n【31】For violin plots shown in Figure 3， the internal line represents the range of the values while the white central dot signifies mean of the data values. The more similarity and resemblance a model have with the observed data， the more efficient COVID-19 prediction， thus， as seen in Figure 3， all the models have a close resemblance with the observed data， which indicates the accurate performance by all models.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】In this study， Machine Learning (ML) approach was employed to predict cumulative COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. For this purpose， cumulative data at previous time step (up to 7-day period) as well as daily cases， daily death and cumulative death were used as inputs for 5different models based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN).\n\nThe results showed that with unique inputs of the applied models， different results were achieved. The obtained results demonstrated that M4 (New case， new death， CCCC) provided the most efficient performance in terms of DC and RMSE. This emphasizes the need of combining both cases at previous step and other COVID-19data for successful prediction of cumulative cases in Nigeria. The results indicated that provided an efficient input selection approach and sufficient quality data are achieved， a successful prediction of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria could be achieved using ANN. The results|删除段之间换行|of this study could be useful in policy making and in prediction of other COVID related diseases.

It is usuallya medication error or misuse， especially in the pediatric age， which is the case with our patient.\n\n【37】Typical clinical manifestations of CS include facial puffiness， generalized body edema and obesity， hirsutism， hypertension， and skin fragility.\n\n【38】Multiple factors can increase the probability of acquiring the condition， such as corticosteroid potency， frequency of the applications， age， skin quality， and duration of the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，5\\]</u>.\n\n【39】In fact， topical steroids can be divided into three groups varying from strong， medium to weak depending on the clinical activity and ability to suppress the HPA axis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Clobetasol propionate is considered a strong topical medication.\n\n【40】Otherwise， infants are more likely to develop topical steroid-induced CS due to their large cutaneous surface and thin skin.\n\n【41】These factors increase the systematic absorption of the drug and lead to various adverse reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【42】According to the literature， most cases ofiatrogenic CS following topical steroid application were infants treated with clobetasol propionate or betamethasone for diaper dermatitis.

A late diagnosis， unplanned pregnancy course and delivery are related to a 40% to 50% maternal and fetal mortality risk. Conversely， early detection and treatment significantly reduces both to 5% to 15%.

Complete evaluation ruled out pregnancy related HTN. A high suspicion level for an alternative cause for HTN was raised. Appropriate imaging studies revealed a heterogenous mass adjacent to the left adrenal 8 cm x 7cm in diameter， highly suspicious for adrenal tumor. Elevated urine catecholamines confirmed the diagnosis ofPHEO. A multidisciplinaryteam was formed and a joint decision for disease control and delayed surgery until after delivery was taken. Blood pressure control was achieved by a combined alpha and beta-adrenergic blocker approach at levels of 135-140/80-90.\n\n【3】Antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation were administered with concurrent 24 h BP Holter. Her condition remained stable and at 32+0 GA a planned cesarean section delivery using a minimal intraperitoneal handling technique under neuraxial anesthesia.

The medical therapy was continued with lower BP goals and a planned laparoscopic adrenalectomy performed after 2 weeks of postpartum recovery. The mother and child were discharged in good condition.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The maternal and fetal lethal consequences of PHEO during pregnancy may be prevented by a high index of suspicion for the diagnosis and following a multidisciplinary algorithm of management， adapted to the individual patient， mainly based on achievement of BP control and the gestational age.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】35-year-oldprimigravida at 27+1 weeks of Gestation \\[GA\\]，work immigrant from the Philippines， was referred to our center with a diagnosis of severe aggravation of chronic Hypertension \\[HTN\\].\n\n【7】Her medical history was positive for a HTN disease diagnosed four years prior to referral and diagnosed as essential； treated with TRITACE (5 mg/25 mg ramipril and hydrochlorothiazide 5mg) tid.

The midpoint of the discussion was the balance upon the immediate surgical tumor removal in the presence of pregnancy induced cardiovascular changesand a 28 weeks uterus and subsequent delivery or deferral of the adrenal surgery until fetal maturity. After consideration of the data and previous surgical experience and a joint consult with the mother a decision was made for continuous hospitalization aimed towards the utmost conservative approach regarding the pregnancy. The aim was set for a Cesarean Delivery\\[CD\\] at 32 weeks to be followed by the adrenal surgery. A combined antihypertensive therapy was started consisting of Labetalol 400 mg tid， Amlodipine 10 mg tid and Doxazosin 7 mg bid； with a therapeutic goal of BP of 130/80； a dose of corticosteroids for fetal lung maturation under Holter monitoring of BP.

Thereafter， a planned for laparoscopic adrenalectomy under general anesthesia was preformed following a rigorous pharmaceutical preparation； a large highly vascular adrenal mass measured 8 cm in diameter was removed， no signs of macroscopic metastatic disease . The antihypertensive medication was limited to Labetalol 200 mg twice bid. The pathologic assessment ofthe adrenal mass confirmed the diagnosis of PHEO with intact capsule and no evidence of mitotic activity (Ki-67 proliferation index： 1%) or invasion.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Pheochromocytoma \\[PHEO\\] a benign type catecholamine-secreting tumor， originating from chromaffin cells of medullary region of the adrenal gland or sympathetic ganglia， is an extremely rare cause of HTN disease；0.2% to 0.4%， ofall causes of hypertension. During pregnancy a scarce prevalence of 1 in 54，000 pregnancies has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\nThe diagnosis of PHEO is based on a high level of suspicion facing related severe HTN crisis. The immediate medical interventions as aimed to limit the hazards related to extreme HTN while the definite therapy is surgical resection with the laparoscopic approach being|删除段之间换行|GA： Gestational Age； BP： Blood Pressure； CD： Cesarean Delivery；TOP： Termination of Pregnancy； IUFD： Intrauterine Fetal Demise； NST： Non-Stress Test； BPP：Biophysical Profile， EFW： Estimated Fetal Weight|删除段之间换行|preferred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The effect of a concomitant pregnancy presents an additional consideration of the PHEO related hazards in view of the maternal-fetal safety concerns. Previous reports show that the two thirds of PHEO cases during pregnancy were diagnosed antepartum and the rest postpartum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The present case of PHEO during pregnancy is representative of all these challenges. We will focus on the PHEO-pregnancy related considerations and present a management algorithm  aimed to early antepartum diagnosis and therapy； both reported to decrease maternal mortality rates from 50% to less than 5% to 15%15-81\n\n【19】In PHEO， as in other surgical intervention during pregnancy， the second trimester of pregnancy is considered the optimal timing； due to the fetal organogenesis stage and in cases of intra-abdominal approaches， the gravid uterus does not impair the surgical view 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-14\\]</u>. Earlier reports of the PHEO included cases diagnosed after adverse outcome of a delivery or uncontrolled BP， thus with a significant bias towards a recommendation of immediate medical therapy and PHEO removal， irrespective of gestational age or fetal maturity. We hereby raise the concerns of catecholamine excessive secretion when manipulating the tumor， prolonged exposure to general anesthesia agents， prolonged right decubitus position with subsequent profound maternal hypotension and fetal deterioration. We suggest that reviewing the later cases， adrenal surgery may be deferred until after delivery in the late prematurity period.\n\n【20】The present suggested multidisciplinary conservative approach is aimed towards all these concerns. Mainly， it consists of an initial alpha-blocker together with an optional beta-blocker therapy to obtain BP control at any GA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Predelivery medical therapy is based a-blockers at least until up to 14 days before surgery， followed by B-blockers to prevent reflex tachycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Among a adrenergic receptor blockers doxazosin rather phenoxybenzamine； although both category C drugs during pregnancy， the later was reported to be associated with neonatal cardiorespiratory complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. We suggest that the BP therapeutic goals in pregnancy should be higher than in the non-pregnant state， especially if longer period until delivery is expected； hypoperfusion of the uteroplacental unit， intrauterine growth restriction and placental abruption may occur with excessive low BP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Although the non-pregnant BP goal is considered less than130/80 mmHg while seated and greater than 90 mmHg systolic while standing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>， we suggest， a BP goal of 140/90； all the more in cases of PHEO diagnosis in the late 2n and 3r trimester ofpregnancy.\n\n【22】Gestational age， fetal status， patient’s response to medical treatment，malignantcharacteristics ofthetumorandthe respectability of thetumor are the main factor to take into consideration in order to plan the surgical excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\nBefore 24 weeks of pregnancy， the recommendation is that the delivery should be postponed after the surgical therapy， for full maternal benefit； and the mode determined by obstetric considerations. The 24 weeks limit has been derived from the fetal viability limits； however， we may suggest that since these limits are re-defined， 22 weeks of gestation seems a more reasonable bound. After fetal viability， additional considerations such as HTN crisis， placental abruption prior to or during adrenal surgery together with the difficult surgical field approach are to be taken in consideration通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，17，22\\]</u>. Nevertheless， antihypertensive therapy and hemodynamic|删除段之间换行|instability during adrenal surgery may be seriously detrimental to the fetus leading to severe brain hypoperfusion. We consider that the consult in the fetal pre-viability period should include the option of termination of pregnancy. In case surgical intervention is performed and the pregnancy is continued， careful targeted fetal brain imaging into the second part of the pregnancy is warranted.\n\n【24】In cases the PHEO is diagnosed after fetal viability， that the mainstay of the management should be aimed the achievement and maintenance of maternal BP response to medical therapy， under hospitalization in a center with multidisciplinary facilities. This first goal successful achievement is the indicator that allows postponing delivery and refraining from extreme prematurity，i.e.，at least until 32weeks gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Although fetal movements have been postulated an ability to induce adrenal hypertensive crisis； we found no robust proof in the literature； including the present case. Antenatal steroids for fetal lung maturation are to be administered with concurrent 24h BP Holter.\n\n【25】The delivery， either emergency or planned should be attended by a multidisciplinary team. Previous case reports suggested a higher maternal mortality rate after Vaginal Delivery \\[VD\\] in contrast with elective Cesarean Section \\[CS\\] 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>； CS is reported to lower the maternal and fetal mortality rate from 33% to 19% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. This might be the base that approximately 80% of the cases were delivered by CS； either planned or emergent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The excess of maternalfetal hazards in the case ofavaginal delivery， has been explained by the maternal BP stress induced rapid changes， elevation of the intra-abdominal pressure during labor and the labor and the related pain which can result in excessive catecholamine's secretion. We consider that independent of the BP control， in view of a planned premature delivery with an expected low cervical Bishop score， a planned CS is the preferred mode of delivery. Importantly， the pain management is critical in either delivery situation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24-26\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The anesthetic management goal for the CS is preoperative anxiety limitation and BP stability and monitoring； in addition to ASA standard monitoring， a radial arterial line is warranted.\n\n【28】Neuraxial anesthesia should be considered for PHEO Caesarean sections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. This type of anesthesia may prevent the swift rise in BP often observed during intubation and reduce pain-related hypertension via use of intrathecal morphine. However， neuraxial anesthesia (namely spinal anesthesia) often results in sympathectomy， causing an associated decline in BP. In the present case a Combined Spinal Epidural anesthesia (CSE) approach was elected， as it allows the use of reduced doses of intrathecal Bupivacaine and reduced subsequent hemodynamic effects， with additional epidural doses， if needed.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】In cases of concomitant PHEO and pregnancy， timed diagnosis， a multidisciplinary approach  with planned delivery will benefit the mother and the fetus with a favorable outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

She was jumping up and down， when a windstorm has raised the jumping mat causing her fall to the ground.\n\nThe patient complained of right shoulder pain with loss of motion， she was conscious and|删除段之间换行|oriented. A physical examination identified tenderness on her right shoulder， with a slight swelling and limitation of movement. No noticeable neurological or vascular problem， such as tingling sensation or Tinel sign below the shoulder joint， were observed. The radial artery pulsation could be well palpable around the wrist. Anteroposterior radiographs  and TC-scan revealed a Salter-Harris type II proximal humerus injuries .\n\n【27】There were associated conservative fractures of left sacral wing， both ischiopubic branches with diastasis of pubic symphysis and a cervical curve inversion at C4-C5.\n\n【28】After the pre-operative preparations had been completed， the patient was taken to the operating room. Considering the age and the grade of displacement， a decision for percutaneous reduction ad fixation with Kirschner wires was taken. In supine position， fluoroscopy guided， closed and percutaneous reduction under general anesthesia and interscalene block， was not suiccessful due to the angulation of fracture stumps； open surgery was therefore necessary. Minimal trans-deltoid access was performed， reduced the fracture and fixed with three K-wires of 1.8 mm .\n\n【29】In post-operative time was placed a shoulder abduction tutor\n\nThe patient was postoperatively followed-up for 4 weeks in abduction tutor. Fracture union was identified on the radiographs taken at the end of the postoperative 3r week and 5th week. At the 20-day X-rays check were visible osteo-repairs sign， with indication to starting commuter movements of the right shoulder . At the45-days clinical check  were removed the k-wires ， with indication to the gradual weaning from shoulder tutor during daytime. The night wearing was preserved for the following 15days. The patient was commenced on an exercise program in order to increase the range of motion of her shoulder joint. After an exercise program of 2 weeks， the range of motion of the patient’s joint was almost fully restored. In the postoperative 124h week， it was observed that the range of motion of her joint was comparable to her healthy side. Agonistic activity and weight lifting were not recommended for|删除段之间换行|the following 3 months. At the 3-month clinical check the right side shows partial obliteration of the physis with no signs of avascular necrosis ，the ROM of shoulder has been restored，allowing her to resume riding .\n\n【31】At 12 months， the patient showed a complete restoration of the function and full range of motion with neither pain， nor Disabilities of the Arm， Shoulder， and Hand (DASH) score of 1.7/100 .\n\n【32】Discussion\n\n【33】Proximal humerus fractures in children comprise approximately2% of all pediatric fractures， and between 4% to 7% of all epiphyseal fractures删除4:<u> 1，5，8，11</u>.\n\n【34】They are usually caused by sport injuries， motor vehicle accidents， or birth trauma， while the usual mechanism of injury is hyperextension combined with external rotation of the shoulder in high-energy trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【35】The diagnosis of these fractures is typically done recurring to radiography. So overall， indications for a CT scan for proximal humerus fractures in children are limited， due to the risk of ionizing radiation on the developing body. In cases with difficulty obtaining orthogonal radiography or in complex fracture pattern or dislocation， CT may be indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【36】A CT-scan total body was performed in our patient because she had suffered a high-energy trauma involving the cervical spine， humerus， pelvis and her abdomen. In our patient anteroposterior radiographs revealed a proximal humerus fracture involving the physis (S-H type II). CT scan and radiographs showed fractures of left sacral wing， both ischiopubic branches with diastasis of pubic symphysis and a cervical curve inversion at C4-C5.\n\nFractures involving the growth plate are classified with the S-H fracture classification 11|.\n\n【38】In literature isolated physeal separation (Salter-Harris I) is seen in new-born and toddlers， with a second peak of physeal separation seen in the young adolescent thrower. In Children from5 to 11 years， the majority of fractures involving the proximal humerus are metaphyseal，whereas Salter-Harris type II fractures are predominantly seen in children 11 years and up. Salter-Harris type III and IV injuries are rarely seen and are usually associated with high-energy trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，9，11\\]</u>.\n\n【39】About 80% of the longitudinal growth of the humerus occurs at the proximal humeral physis. This high activity level explains the awful remodeling of proximal humerus fractures in the pediatric population. Younger is the patient， higher the remodeling potential\n\n【40】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，8\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Bone healing and spontaneous remodeling of proximal humerus fractures in children are usually good and non-operative treatment is preferred.\n\n【42】Surgical fixation has traditionally been recommended in proximal humerus fractures when closed reduction is unsatisfactory due to interposed long head of biceps tendon， deltoid muscle or capsule， and in cases of nerve or artery injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Percutaneous Kirschner wire pinning is the most usual fixation in children， often combined with closed reduction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【44】In our patient a closed reduction and synthesis with k-wires was attempted， but ineffective making it necessary resort to reduction with small trans deltoid access. The fixation using k-wires for the Salter-Harris type II humerus fracture had satisfactory outcome.\n\n【45】Although the k-wire fixation was successful， routine use in complex fractures cannot be recommended due to the risk of avascular necrosis. In our study as also reported in that of Umesh at al.， immobilization was maintained for a longer duration and the patient was closely monitored for avascular necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In our patient the good outcome may be the combination of intact blood supply and periosteum， intact rotator cuff mechanism， patient’s young age with healthy bone metabolism and achievement of good reduction with restoration of the articular surface and calcar.\n\n【46】Wang et al. reported epiphyseal devascularization in a 10-year-old boy with fracture-dislocation of the shoulder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>， whereas Lee et al. reported avascular necrosis on the humeral head in a 16-year-old boy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In both cases， open reduction was performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【47】Dobbs at al. in their study described an 8-year-old boy presented after falling off his bicycle and sustaining a Neer grade IV proximal humeral epiphyseal fractur and a 14-year-old boy sustained a Neer grade IV proximal humeral epiphyseal fracture while playing football. They were treated in the operating room with a successful closed reduction followed by percutaneous pinning with two K-wires. Instead， a 15-year-old boy sustained a Neer grade III proximal humeral epiphyseal fracture from a fall on the basketball， attempted closed reduction of the fracture in the operating room failed. The patient underwent an open reduction through a deltopectoral approach and k-wires fixation.\n\n【48】Treatment protocol for severely displaced fractures of the proximal humeral epiphysis was designed to minimize residual fracture deformityandsubsequentloss of normal shoulder mechanics. Proximal humeral fractures in children， that require management in the operating room， typically are successfully reduced closed and then percutaneously pinned 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【49】In those rare cases in which an acceptable reduction is not obtained closed， an open reduction and internal fixation as in our patient treated with a mini trans-deltoid approach is performed.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\nProximal humerus fractures in children commonly occur after a traumatic fall and high-energy trauma. Treatment depends on patient age， fracture displacement and remodeling capacity. Nonoperative management is successful in younger patients or less displaced fractures， instead operative management is usually considered in older patients with more displaced fractures. Restoration of the|删除段之间换行|articular surface and the calcar is essential for functional outcome. This successful case of k-wire fixation is low cost， readily， available simple strategy may be useful in selective instances.\n\n【52】Percutaneous k-wire pinning is the most usual fixation in children， combined with closed reduction； open reduction by minimal access is important to restore the correct anatomy， whereas the closed reduction was not possible.

{"seq_id": "a8317d84-1778-4c69-a3e6-210629e29500", "title": null, "text": "【0】Background\n\n【1】Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder. Multiple Myeloma (MM) represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single clone. The co-occurrence of two rare malignancies CML and MM in the same patient is an extremely rare incident. We report a case of a 54 vear old female who was simultaneously detected with MM and CML. At the outset， only chemotherapy for multiple myeloma was started as bone marrow and peripheral smear were not suggestive of CML. Subsequently Dasatinib was started in view of left shift seen in peripheral smear. It was both a diagnostic dilemma due to the rarity of synchronicity of these two malignancies and a therapeutic dilemma of whether to start with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) as both peripheral smear and bone marrow was normal.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 54-year-old female with no comorbidities， a known case of solitary plasmacytoma (with kappa restriction， CD 138 positive)，previouslytreated in July 2020 with definitive radiation therapy to the left pubic ramus. She received a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions from 3.6.2020 to 6.7.2020. She was on three monthly follow up since then. At the time of diagnosis， a baseline PET scan revealednoevidence of disease elsewhere， with bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were normal. Also， cytogenetic analysis by conventional karyotype was normal. In the month of June， 2021， she presented with pain in the left pubic region of three months duration. PET CT was done to evaluate disease status. It revealed a 2.8 cm x 5.6 cm lesion involving left pubic ramus and anterior acetabulum (SUV 26.1) which was 12.1 at baseline before radiation therapy. There was a cortical discontinuity with a small extra Osseous soft tissue. There was also a mention of interval development of additional small metabolically active osteolytic lesions in anterior L1 and L4 vertebra which raised the suspicion of progression to multiple myeloma. Work up for multiple myeloma was done that included bone marrow aspiration and biopsy， Serum myeloma panel \\[Serum Protein Electrophoresis (SPEP)， Serum Immunofixation (SIF) studies， Free Light Chain Assay (FLC)， beta 2 microglobulin\\] and cytogenetics. Bone marrow showed 10% plasma cells with no immature cells in myeloid lineage. SPEP showed presence of M spike in gamma region (band value： 0.52 g/dl). SIF studies showed IgG band with kappaband. Total proteins were in the range of 8.6 (normal range 6.4 g/dL to 8.2 g/dL). Ig Glevel in serum was 17.4g. Ratio of involved and uninvolved free light chains was 150 with involved kappalight chain being删除4:<u> 465</u>. Hence a diagnosis of Multiple myeloma was established. Routine cancer cytogenetic studies at our institute (i.e.，culture ofunstimulated bone marrow aspirate at 24h and 48h of incubation at room temperature) revealed two clones of cells- one with normal karyotype and one with t(9；22) i.e.， 46，XX，t(9；22)(q34；q11.2)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>/46，XX通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\nA complete blood count with peripheral smear was normal with no leukocytosis with left shift or thrombocytosis or any abnormal cells. She was started on a three drug regimen (proteasome inhibitor bortezomib， lenalidomide and Dexamethasone with bisphosphonates) as per our institutional protocol for a standard risk stage III Standard risk multiple myeloma after a thorough discussion about the treatment options including transplant. However， the family refused for transplant. At this point of time， BCR ABL mutation was being considered as a part of normal|删除段之间换行|variant as marrow and peripheral smear were normal. Hence， we decided to serially monitor the peripheral smear of the patient and took a decision to not expose the patient to TKI then. She completed4 cycles of VRD (bortezomib/lenalidomide/dexona) till 20.10.21following which reassessment was done by serum myeloma panel which was suggestive of Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria with an absent M spike， normalization of serum FLC ratio. It was decided to continue with the same chemotherapy regimen. Her peripheral smear was being serially monitored at each visit. At her visit during cycle 5-D22， her PS was suggestive of left shift with 1% blasts， 6%myelocytes， 7% metamyelocytes， 12% band forms. Now we started her on TKI (Dasatinib 100 mg once a day) after reviewing the drug interactions with other drugs being used for multiple myeloma.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】We report a case of synchronous hematological malignancies， multiple myeloma coexistent with CML. Though bone marrow was not suggestive of CML， the characteristic translocation t通用删除7(英):<u>(9，22)</u> was present in the cells. We further did cytogenetic analysis to rule out Philadelphia positivity as a constitutional abnormality by the PHA(Phytohemagglutinin) induced peripheral blood cell culture with 72h incubation at room temperature， which showed all cells as normal karyotype， thereby proving the existence of the t(9；22) translocation in our reference case as clonal. Following the conventional karyotype report，hybridtranscript for BCR/ABL 1 was quantified by IS MMRRT PCRassay. The ratio of BCR-ABL1/ABL 1 transcript as represented in IS scale was detected to be 5.931%.Genomic breakpoint observed was e 13a2 which corresponded to p删除4-1:<u>210</u>. Other cytogenetic abnormalities seen in multiple myeloma like IGH rearrangement， p53 del， del 13q were negative. Unfortunately on conventional cytogenetics or FISH analysis it is not possible to comment on the type of cells that are carrying specific genetic aberrations. Hence a dilemma might arise as whether they were myeloma cells or leukemic cells which were harboring BCR-ABL1 translocation. Plasma cell enrichment by cell sorting of CD-138 expressing cells in bone marrow or peripheral blood by immunomagnetic methods has been widely applied for targeted molecular cytogenetic analysis of multiple myeloma cases删除4-1:<u>1-31</u>.\n\n【7】The Philadelphia chromosome was originally detected by workers in Philadelphia as an abnormally short G-group chromosome in analysis of bone marrow metaphases from CML patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It is the first genetic abnormality to be associated with a human cancer. Now it’s understood through chromosome banding techniques that Philadelphia chromosome was the result of a balanced translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22， denoted t(9；22)(q34.1；q11.21)， where the derivative chromosome 222 is significantly smaller. Chromosomal abnormalities can be germline (constitutional) or acquired. Germline abnormalities could be heritable or non-heritable.t(9；22) is as either non-heritable constitutional or acquired. The Philadelphia chromosome is present in hematopoietic cells from patients with CML but not in non hematopoietic cells， including bone marrow fibroblasts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. BCR-ABL fusion transcripts resulting from translocation t(9；22)， are hallmarks of Philadelphia chromosome positive ph +leukemia patients. This translocation is detected in>90%patients with CML and ~20% patients with Acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. There are three common variants of BCR ABL1， p210 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the major BCR region at either e13 ore14 to produce an el3a2 or e14a2 transcript that is translated into a 210 kD protein \\[7-\n\n【8】101\\. This variant is present in most of the CML patients. It is present in one third of the patients with ph positive B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. p190 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the minor BCR region at el to produce an ela2 transcript into a 190 kD protein. This variant is present in two thirds of those with Ph+ B ALL (80% of childhood and 50% of adult Ph positive B-ALL) and a minority of patients with CML p230 BCR ABL 1： This is created by fusion of ABL 1 at a2 with a breakpoint in the mu BCR region at e19 to produce an e19a2 transcript which is translated into a 230 kD protein. This variant is seen in some patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia.\n\n【9】There are three hypothesis that have been thought of with regard to the presence of BCR ABL rearrangement in our case.\n\n【10】The first one that we considered initially was that this rearrangement is a part of a normal variant， the significance of which could be found out on regular follow-up of this patient. A study by Jew Win Kuan et al. was done in normal population in southern Sarawak by performing quantitative PCR for BCR ABL1with ABL1 as an internal control on total white blood cells. In this they demonstrated that the BCR ABL1 fusion gene is expected to be present in approximately 0.5% to 1% of normal individuals in that area. The positive subject in this study had BCR ABL1 Fusion gene of 0.002320.0032%， which is equivalent to MR4.5. In our patient in discussion， the BCR ABL1 transcript was 5.931%.\n\n【11】Secondly， tumorigenesisafter exposure toeenvironmental carcinogens such as ionizing radiation and chlorinated solvents is a well-known phenomenon. A common insult to the bone marrow can cause irreparable DNA damage potentially leading to neoplasms of myeloid and lymphoid origin. This might partially explain as the patient had been exposed to radiation therapy for plasmacytoma one year back.\n\n【12】Thirdly， treatment of first malignancy with cytotoxic drugs or radiation can potentially lead to secondary malignant transformation. The role of melphalan and cyclophosphamide in developing secondary malignancies is well documented in literature. Various secondary malignancies in lenalidomide-treated patients have also been described. Nevertheless， this hypothesis cannot be extrapolated to our patient because the two diseases were simultaneously detected. In addition， chronic antigenic stimulation due to multiple etiological factors may be involved in the development of simultaneous myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Other factors such as genotypic polymorphism may also be involved.\n\n【13】The other possibility is de novo ph+ multiple myelomas， which is an extremely rare event.\n\n【14】Another possible theory is the presence of a common malignant pluripotent progenitor stem cell which can be transformed to both lymphoid and myeloid lines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Also， it has been proposed that a more sustainable environment for the formation of secondary tumors is created due to the presence of myeloma cells. Studies have showed that multiple myeloma cells have pleiotropic proliferative and antiapoptotic properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>.\n\n【16】At the outset we had hypothesized it to be a normal variant and decided to keep under close observation. However， subsequently we started TKI， in view ofleft shift in peripheral smear. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder. The annual incidence of CML is 1.5 cases per 100，000 individuals.\n\n【17】Multiple Myeloma (MM) represents a malignant proliferation of plasma cells derived from a single clone. The co-occurrence of two rare malignancies CML and MM in the same patient is an extremely rare incident， and simultaneous diagnosis of CML and MM is reported in only five cases in the literature. Multiple Myeloma (MM) has been reported in association with a variety of myeloproliferative disorders， including polycythemia vera， myelofibrosis， essential thrombocythemia and Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia (CNL). However， the association with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia(CML) has been rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.

Anecdotal cases of patients of multiple myeloma who developed CML after treatment or occurrence of multiple myeloma in a known case of CML on follow up are reported in literature.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】After reviewing the literature， it is possible that the coexistence of these two hematological disorders is multifactorial. The occurrence can’t be attributed to one factor alone. No formal guidelines have been established regarding the use of antimyeloma therapy along with TKIs used in the treatment for CML.

Large postoperative defects will be a challenge for surgeons in reconstructing the chest wall after excision. Thoracoabdominal flap is one of the preferred techniques for closing the defect of breast surgery in countries with limited resources such as in Southeast Asia. This technique is relatively easy and has low complication rate.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 42-year-old woman complains of a lump in her right breast that reappeared after breast surgery one year ago. We performed a wide excision of this tumor with a margin of 2 cm and the defect was closed using a Thoracoabdominal flap. Patients have been re-educated about the importance of postoperative radiotherapy.\n\n【3】Keywords： Malignant phyllodes tumor；Thoracoabdominal flap； Recidive\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Phyllodes tumor is a fibroepithelial neoplasm of the mammary gland. This tumor is quite rare in the community. Muller， in 1838 reported that the prevalence ranged from 0.3% to 0.8% of all breast tumors in women. Meanwhile， Parker， in 2001， stated that the prevalence of this tumor is less than1% of all breast neoplasms. The literature states that 10% to 30% of cases of Phyllodes tumors are found to be malignant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Malignant Phyllodes Tumor has potential to be recidive and metastatic. Surgical treatment with a wide excision technique is the best option in treating this tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This procedure has an impact in the form of a large postoperative defect， so this will pose a challenge for surgeons to reconstruct the chest wall. Thoracoabdominal flap can be one of the surgeon's options in the closure of large postoperative defects of the breast. Rao et al. in 2015 reported that the Thoracoabdominal flap has the same ability as skin grafts in closing large defects， but with capability to shortening operating time， have less bleeding， and good healing results. Patients can also undergo radiotherapy after defect closure is done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Presented in this case report is our treatment of Recidive Malignant Phyllodes Tumor with extensive postoperative defects. Thoracoabdominal flap was chosen as a method of closing the defect with consideration of its effectiveness and good results.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【10】A 42-years-old woman came to our clinic with complains of a lump that reappeared in the right chest for 1 month ago. The lump appeared on the surgical scar initially measured 1 cm ×1 cmx1cm and rapidly growing in 1 month to 10 cmx10 cmx8 cm. The lump is painful， ulcerated， and bleeds.\n\n【11】From her history， the patient complained of a right breast lump appearing initially four years ago. The lump was located under the skin with enlarged veins on its surface， slowly growing and there were no ulcers on the surface. The patient underwent a simple right-sided mastectomy 1 year ago at district hospital and the histopathological examination revealed as a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. The patient was advised to undergo postoperative radiotherapy， but she refused to do it because of financial problem. Four months after surgery， a lump reappeared on the right chest. It was stated that the tumor has been recidive. Regional lymph node examination， thoracic radiology and abdominal ultrasonography did not show any metastatic process .\n\nThe patient underwent wide excision with a free margin of 2 cm from the recidive tumor by|删除段之间换行|pectoralis major muscle.\n\nincluding a previous surgical scar to prevent a recurrence. The operation took only 120 min. Surgical removal of the tumor is done by excisioning the pectoralis major muscle at the base of the tumor because of infiltration process of tumor . A rhombus-shaped postoperative defect was laid with an area of 440 cm’ on the right chest. We performed a Thoracoabdominal flap to close this wide defect. The flap consists of two components： the right side， and the left side. The skin on the inferior side of the defect is divided in half and an incision is made downward along the width of the defect， then continues to divide to the right and left. Those two skin flaps were raised superiorly and used to cover the surgical defect. The abdominal flap defect was closed primarily by bringing the right and left sides closer together. We also put two vacuum drains in the operating area to collect fluids and blood after surgery . The patient has been evaluated at the surgical outpatient clinic on the sixth day|删除段之间换行|after operation. There were no complaints of fever， pain， or surgical infection. The flap was assessed as viable and there was no necrotic area on the wound. The results of histopathological examination revealed a Malignant Phyllodes Tumor of the breast and the tumor cells were no longer found in all excision margin. The patient was educated and scheduled to undergo radiotherapy.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】A Phyllodes Tumor is a tumor that is quite rare in the community. These tumors are classified histopathologically into 3 groups： Benign， borderline， and malignant. Anderson Cancer Center in 2012 reported the incidence of Phyllodes Tumor based on histopathology was58% for benign tumors， 12% for borderline tumors， and 30% for malignant tumors. Benign and borderline Phyllodes tumors never recur once the tumor has been completely excised (with tumor-free incision margin). Meanwhile， Malignant Phyllodes Tumors require more aggressive treatment because of the high risk of recurrence and metastasis. The recurrence rate of this tumor was recorded at 14% to21%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4，5\\]</u>. Surgery is the main treatment for Malignant Phyllodes Tumor. Surgeon can decide between wide excision with safety margin1 cm or simple mastectomy in manage this tumor. Those treatments will leave wide surgical defect which become a surgeon's attention after excision.\n\n【16】Broad and radical excision of the breast will leave a large defect so that primary closure usually cannot be performed. Various methods have become the surgeon's choice to reconstruct this wide defect， such as Skin Graft technique， Cutaneous flaps (ex： Thoracoabdominal Flap， Thoracoepigastric Flap， Bilateral Advancement Flap)， and Myocutaneous flaps (ex： Latissimus Dorsi Flap and Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous Flap). The Thoracoabdominal flap (TA flap) was originally introduced by Brown in 1975. However， this flap becameless popular after the Myocutaneous flap has been introduced in 1985通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6，7\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In principle， the TA flap is a rotational-advancement flap of skin and fascia. This flap has two bases of pivot point： The medial base and the lateral base. The medial base blood flow comes from the superior deep epigastric perforating artery， whereas the lateral base blood flow comes from branches of superficial lumbar，subcostal， intercostal and thoracic arteries. The TA flap with a medial base is also known as the Thoracoepigastric Flap (TE Flap). The two flap bases are mirrors of each other， as shown in Figure 4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，7-9\\]</u>.\n\nSrinivasa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> stated that the TA Flap procedure in post-mastectomy defects in case of locally advanced breast cancer will give satisfactory results. The TA flap is considered easy to perform for surgeons who are not familiar with myocutaneous flap procedures. This flap is not only easier but also faster healing than skin graft|删除段之间换行|technique. Patients can immediately undergo radiotherapy for local control after the TA flap wound has healed. This flap is also useful in developing countries with limited resources because surgeon needs no expensive equipment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，7-9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Das and Choudhury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> in 2013 reported that 1 in 20 patients(5%) who underwent TA flap surgery in cases of locally advanced breast cancer experienced complications such as wound dehiscence. These complications can be managed directlywith secondary suturing and wound closure. The study explained that the majority of patients were able to go home from the hospital on 3 to 4 postoperative days and underwent radiotherapy with good results. There was no recurrence in 18 months after surgery. It can be concluded that the TA flap procedure is simple，low-cost， and provides good tolerance for radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Deo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> in 2003 has conducted research comparing TA flaps to Myocutaneous flaps (LD and TRAM flaps) in breast cancer cases. The TA flap requires a shorter operating time， shorter hospital stay， and significantly minimal risk of blood loss compared to the Myocutaneous flap. The morbidity and risk of local recurrence were not significantly different. The study concluded that the TA flap may be the first choice in patients with extensive post-mastectomy defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. Joo Seok's study stated that the TA flap had a faster recovery time than the TE flap. Baroudi et al. wrote that TE flap was hemodynamically weak and fragile because of tissue tension on vascular. The risk of necrosis at the end of the flap is high. If this morbidity occurs， the patient must be re-debrided and followed by a skin graft to close the defect. However， this was disputed by Burattini et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> who conducted a study on the safety and viability of the TE flap. In this study， it was found that the risk of dehiscence was only 7%. Persichetti stated that the TA flap is very useful in post-mastectomy breast defects with an area of less than 600 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，7，10，11\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In our patient， we modified the TA flap by dividing the flap into2 sides at the inferior defect. This flap is a combination of the TA flap on the lateral side and the TE flap on the medial side. We made this modification to provide free skin mobility and to minimize necrotic risk of tissue. Both of the TA Flap base will gain vascular supply maximally with minimal tissue traction.Nowadays， there is no consensus about surgical technique to close post-mastectomy defect. It depends on the experience of the surgeon， patient preferences， facilities， and the size of the defect. However， it is universally recognized that myocutaneous flaps are still better than cutaneous flaps in terms of reducing the risk of necrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\nClosure of the breast excision defect using a Thoracoabdominal flap may be an option for a surgeon who is not familiar with|删除段之间换行|performing myocutaneous flaps in chest wall reconstruction. This technique has ability to minimize duration of operation， cost， has rapid healing time， and simple to do by a general surgeon.

Today it is known that strength training (TF) has benefits such as decreased fasting glycemia， glycated hemoglobin， stimulates translocation of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity， restoring metabolic control. The objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.\n\n【2】Methods： A 26-year-old woman with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus participated in this research， with a trained diagnosis time of 22 (twenty-two)years. The volunteer participated in three non-consecutive days of intervention at the first visit. The evaluation was performed with a test of Maximum Repetition (1RM) in the following exercises： Bench press； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45；Low row with triangle. On the second visit to the laboratory， the TF session was performed at 40% of 1RM. On the third visit， the session was performed at 80%of 1RM， capillary blood glucose was collected before， during and immediately after each strength training session.\n\n【3】Results： The results observed showed that the exercise of less intensity， at 40% of 1 RM， showed a greater drop in capillary glycemia during and immediately after the TF session.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Different intensities will result in different physiological responses. It is important to highlight the need for blood glucose monitoring before， during and after training.\n\n【5】Keywords： Type 1 Diabetes； Blood Glucose； Strength Training\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) is concentrated between 5% and 10% of the total number of people with diabetes. In most cases， DM1 arises as a result ofautoimmune destruction of pancreatic B cells causing complete deficiency in insulin production，being diagnosed more frequently in children， adolescents and young adults， equally affecting men and women， although its pathophysiology is not fully known. It is known that it is a polygenic disease， thus genetic and environmental factors trigger the autoimmune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【8】The treatment of DM1 has historically followed the insulin/food/physical exercise triad. Currently， the triad should switch to insulin/diabetes monitoring/education， including education in nutrition， exercise and guidance for patients and their families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nAmong the treatments， physical exercise offers different methods for controlling DM1， such as aerobic training， which is the most used， since strength training before 2005 was not suitable for DM1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Today it is already known that strength training has benefits such as decreased fasting blood glucose， glycated hemoglobin， visceral fat， and body weight； stimulates GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle， increases insulin sensitivity and， consequently， restores metabolic control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Insulin injected by the DM1 carrier acts on the IRS-1 and IRS-2 receptors， promoting a cascade of intracellular signaling that results in the translocation of GLUT4 and the entry of glucose into the cell， physical exercise enhances the phosphorylation of IRS-2， which results in a greater PI3K activity causing an increase in Akt protein phosphorylation， which promotes an increase in the|删除段之间换行|translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane， consequently greater glucose entry into the cell， decreasing circulating glycemic levels通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> strength training also minimizes cardiac risks， increases muscle strength and is a good strategy to improve health， physical fitness and performance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， justifying its inclusion in the treatment ofDM1.\n\n【10】However， studies relating strength training in isolation and type1 diabetes are still scarce in the literature， in the same way studies that show the efficiency of different intensities under individuals with DM1 are a great gap in which little has been investigated. Comparing different intensities could clarify the benefits of strength training and provide support for practical applications and recommendations regarding the adequate and safe prescription of strength training for glycemic control in DM1， in addition， the little information on strength training related to DM1 demonstrates the need for further studies that address the topic， in order to elucidate the acute and chronic responses of DM1 through this training method 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. In this sense， the objective of this research was to observe the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training at different intensities.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】Participants\n\n【13】This research was characterized as a case study and is linked to the Project Doce Vida - Supervised Physical Exercise Program for Diabetics， held at the Higher School of Physical Education at the University of Pernambuco. Participated in this research a woman aged 26 (twenty-six) years with type 1 Diabetes Mellitus， with a diagnosis time of 22 (twenty-two) years. The participant is trained.\n\n【14】Instrumentation and data collection\n\n【15】The training was carried out at the Biodynamics Laboratory of the Higher School of Physical Education at the University ofPernambuco in the morning.\n\n【16】Capillary glycemia\n\n【17】Capillary blood glucose was collected before， during and immediately after each strength training. Capillary blood glucose was measured before and after each workout， always on the little or ring fingers， discarding the first drop of blood， the second drop being used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The glucometer， reagent strips，lancets and lancets used were from the Freestyle Optium Neo model from Abbott. The infectious material (gloves， lancets， tapes and paper towels) used for collection， was deposited in a specific box of hospital material.\n\n【18】Blood pressure\n\n【19】Blood pressure was measured before and after each strength training session， using the OMRON HEM 7113 digital automatic blood pressure monitor.\n\n【20】Initial evaluation and test of a maximum repeat (1RM)\n\n【21】The volunteer participated in three non-consecutive days of intervention. On the first visit to the Biodynamics Laboratory， the volunteer was familiarized with the training protocol. Soon afterwards， a test of Maximum Repetition (1RM) was performed in the following exercises： Bench press； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45°； Low row with triangle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The equipment was made by New Fit.\n\nBefore starting the 1RM test， the volunteer warmed up， in each exercise， from 10 to 15 repetitions， with an equivalent load of 40%to 60% of the maximum perceived strength 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Then， the load was|删除段之间换行|increased to approximately， 60% to 80% of the maximum perceived force. After this warm-up， there was an interval of 2 min， while the load was increased to perform the 1RM test.\n\n【23】Experimental sessions\n\n【24】On the second visit to the laboratory， the strength training session was performed at 40% of 1RM. On the third day， the session was performed at 80% of 1RM. Each day of intervention aimed to assess the impact of a strength training session on glycemic control. Glycemic responses were analyzed before， during and immediately after each session.\n\n【25】Pre-intervention\n\n【26】Before each intervention， the volunteer remained seated in the laboratory for a period of 10 min， in a quiet room without noise interference and with a temperature between 23·C to 24C通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Intervention\n\n【28】Strength training intensities were established based on the ACSM and ADA classification for individuals with DM1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， with low intensity exercise with 40% 1RM and high intensity with 80% 1RM. The strength training sessions consisted of seven exercises in the same sequence as the 1RM test (Bench Press in the machine； Knee extension on the device； Peck Deck； Front high pulley with cable； Leg 45°；Low row with triangle). For the strength training session at 40% of 1RM，02 sets were performed with 16 repetitions in each exercise， with a recovery interval of 60s between sets and 120s between exercises. For the strength training session at 80% of 1RM， 02 sets were performed with 08 repetitions in each exercise with an interval of 90s between sets and 120s between exercises. The duration of the repetition in each series of the strength training was 3s， being 1s in the concentric phase and 2s in the eccentric phase of the movement.\n\n【29】Statistical analysis\n\n【30】A descriptive analysis of the variables was performed through the variation of the delta at baseline during and immediately after the intervention.\n\n【31】Results\n\n【32】According to the observed results， the exercise of less intensity， at 40% of 1RM， showed a drop between the measurement of the pre-training moment and the measurement of the moment during the training， and continued to fall until the moment immediately after the training， showing a greater blood glucose drop compared to training at 80% of1RM.\n\n【33】The strength training session at 80% of 1RM， showed an increase\n\n【34】Table 1： Variation of the capillary glucase Delta (A) with 40% of 1RM at baseline， during and after intervention of a RT session.\n\n| Glycemia  | Moment  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pre Workout  | 143 mg/dL  |\n| During  | 137 mg/dL  |\n|  | 06 mg/dL  |\n| During  | 137 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 100 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 37 mg/dL  |\n| Pre Workout  | 143 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 100 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 43 mg/dL  |\n\n【36】Table 2： Variation in the capillary glucose Delta (A) with 80% of 1RM at baseline， during and after the intervention of a RT session.\n\n| Glycemia  | Moment  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pre Workout  | 267 mg/dL  |\n| During  | 281 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 14mg/dL  |\n| During  | 281 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 240 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 41 mg/dL  |\n| Pre Workout  | 267 mg/dL  |\n| After  | 240 mg/dL  |\n| A  | 27 mg/dL  |\n\n【38】in capillary glycemia in the measurement during the training session， but， immediately after the training session， there was a decrease in capillary glycemia below the pre-training values. RT data at 40% and80% are shown in Table 1 and删除4:<u> 2</u>.\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】The objective of this research was to evaluate the glycemic responses of a type 1 diabetic who underwent strength training with different intensities. Our findings showed a better acute response in low intensity exercise， at 40% of 1RM.\n\n【41】A study conducted by Silveira et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> investigated the acute effects of different strength training intensities on glycemic fluctuations in individuals with DM1， using the intensities of 40%， 60% and 80%of 1RM， with capillary blood glucose measurements being taken at rest， immediately after exercise ， 10 min after exercise， 20 min and30 min after exercise， resulting in a lower concentration of glucose in all intensities up to 30 min after training， however， without showing a significant difference between the three training intensities during each training period time.\n\n【42】However， the study showed a significant difference between rest and 10 min after， 20 min and 30 min after training at the three intensities investigated， and during these periods of time， the glycemic drop at 40% of 1RM was moderate， unlike the fall between the highest intensities， 60% and 80% of 1RM， which revealed a fall in great magnitudes 30 min after the last exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Campos， Paixao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> conducted a case study with a type 1diabetic in order to evaluate the hypoglycemic effect of resistance training with an emphasis on movement along the eccentric phase in an individual with an insulin infusion pump， the study lasted four weeks where the applicability of the training was three times a week.\n\n【44】Capillary blood glucose data were collected 15 min， 30 min and45 min， during and after training. The study found a significant drop in glycemia during the training sessions， the authors associate the glycemic drop with a greater activity of the GLUT4 protein， physical exercise promotes an increase in energy expenditure and associated with this there is an increase in the AMP： ATP ratio， this mechanism promotes the activation of AMPK， which is associated with translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\nThe activation of the AMPK enzyme may explain the reduction in glucose during the training intensities performed in this study， as it is one of the precursors of activation of GLUT4， in addition， exercise promotes the suspension of the mTORC1/S6K1 protein|删除段之间换行|that is capable of phosphorylating IRS1 into serine and interrupting the insulin signaling cascade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Thus， a greater phosphorylation of AMPK and Akt protein occurs， a mechanism that activates GLUT4through an insulin-independent signaling cascade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，13\\]</u>.\n\n【46】A study carried out with type 2 diabetes conducted by Moreira， compared the acute effect of strength training exercise of different intensities of lower cardiovascular-metabolic stress on glucose control， intensities of 23% 1RM and 40%1RM were used， while end of the study it was concluded that both intensities were effective in reducing glycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes， demonstrating that even at low intensities， the muscle contraction performed by exercise can promote GLUT4 translocation and in the reduction of capillary glycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【47】The increase in capillary glycemia during training to 80% of1RM and a smaller drop immediately after training compared to a session at 40% of 1RM may be related to hormonal and metabolic responses antagonistic to the decline in blood glucose stimulated to high-intensity exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Guelfi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> state that， metabolic and hormonal responses， elevated catecholamine and growth hormone levels， may contribute to avoiding a decline in blood glucose levels at the beginning of recovery， since these hormones stimulate increased hepatic glucose production and inhibits insulin-mediated glucose通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. One study that compared responses to glucose levels in high-intensity interval aerobic training vs. moderate-intensity aerobic training demonstrated a drop in blood glucose in both protocols， but glucose levels in interval training high intensity remained stable during recovery due to the hormonal versus regulatory response， which it did not occur in moderate training， where glucose levels continued to fall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【48】Despite the benefits of physical exercise， one of the biggest concerns when relating physical exercise and DM1 patients is the risk of hypoglycemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. However， unlike continuous mild to moderate exercise， in high-intensity exercise the occurrence of hypoglycemia does not is frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Exercises with anaerobic component (weight lifting/resistance exercises， sprints and high intensity interval training) reduce the risk of hypoglycemia during and after physical exercise in DM1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【49】Processes regulated by independent insulin mechanisms are generally preserved when people with diabetes engage in high-intensity work. These processes include normal increases in glucose production and disposition during and immediately after exercise， as well as a normal rate of decline in glucose production after exercise. Since glucose production is mainly controlled by catecholamine’s， current data suggest that physically fit patients with insulin-dependent diabetes can exercise vigorously and exercise require high-intensity workloads 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> Catecholamines (epinephrine， nor epinephrine， dopamine) exhibit effects excitatory and inhibitory effects of the peripheral nervous system and actions in the Central Nervous System(CNS)， in addition to modulation of endocrine function， such as insulin secretion and glycogenolysis rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>.\n\nThe findings of the present study revealed that in strength training at 40% 1RM， glycemic levels showed a continuous drop in the moments during training and immediately after training which occurred due to muscle contraction that is one of the factors responsible for the greatest GLUT4 activity. However， in the 80%1RM strength training session there was an increase in capillary glycemia above pre-workout levels， which can be justified by the|删除段之间换行|regulatory action of the hormones responsible for the production of liver glucose， even so， the higher intensity strength training was able to promote glycemic drop at the end of the training session to lower levels than with the pre-workout moment. Strength training can also be prescribed because it has a lower risk of hypoglycemia in addition to promoting increased muscle strength and cross section that only the high intensity of strength training can promote 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【51】Conclusion\n\n【52】It is concluded that in this case study， for this participant， both training protocols showed a drop in capillary glycemia values at the end of the training session， however the protocols showed different behaviors during the session， where the strength training at 40% of1RM. The fall happened continuously， while in strength training at80% of 1RM there was an increase in blood glucose during the session and then a fall in capillary blood glucose levels， which demonstrate that different intensities will result in different physiological responses.

Along with Echocardiographic investigation， the role of CT scan in localization of vegetation is highly appreciable. With the advancement in the CT-technology was recently Photon Counting CT system (PCCT) introduced. It is a form of X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) in which X-rays are detected using a Photon-Counting Detector (PCD). These photon-counting detectors have the potential to overcome the limitations of current CT detectors， by providing CT data at very high spatial resolution， less noise， improved contrast-to-noise ratio， low radiation dose and with intrinsic spectral information. They are much more dose efficient than other detectors， have smaller pixels， which can significantly increase the spatial resolution. Here， we can expect qualitative images that visualize very fine tissue structures with low radiation and less use of contrast agent. Photon-counting CT offers several significant advantages over other existing CT imaging techniques， which opens potential to scan cardiovascular patients， overcoming compromises in lung and bone imaging and imaging of other organs and systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>\n\n【9】删除3:<u>Asif MY， Dillinger D， Waldeck S， Zielezinski T， Feyrer R.

Six months later， the patient was admitted again in the same hospital with progressive dyspnea(NYHA III)， general weakness and weight loss. The laboratory report presented with leukocytosis， thrombocytopenia， CRP elevation， raised transaminase and creatinine levels. The blood cultures were negative. The Transthoracic and Transesophageal Echocardiography (TTE， TEE) showed a high-grade tricuspid valve regurgitation and a 3.2 cm x 2 cm long vegetation on the RV lead. In|删除段之间换行|history as well as in physical investigation there were no infective foci found.\n\nFor further assessment and therapy， the patient was referred to our hospital. Here we repeated transesophageal echocardiography， which showed similar findings， a vegetation on theRVleadandahigh-grade tricuspid valve regurgitation. For further evaluation we decided to perform a CT-scan. A full cardiac cycle CT-scan with a photon counting CT scanner (NAEOTOM Alpha， Siemens Healthineers， Forchheim， Germany) was performed， which showed vegetation on the RV-lead and multiple minor vegetations on the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve. So， we decided for sternotomy， surgical intervention on tricuspid valve and open CRT-ICD explanation. The vegetations were removed， the anterior leaflet of tricuspid valve was partly resected and reconstructed using modified De Vega technique. The|删除段之间换行|Patient recovered fast and had a very uneventful stay in our hospital.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】In routine practice， the echocardiographic investigations are gold standards for the diagnosis of endocarditis. Its accuracy depends on factors like size and localization of vegetations， calcifications， concomitant valvular defects and the experienceofechocardiographer通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The photon counting CT have certain advantages over other preexisting CT-scan techniques. The metal artifacts， beam hardening artifacts and noise streaks are better mitigated. High contrast and high-resolution structures are also better visualized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The photon counting CT scan reduces radiation exposure， reconstructs images at a higher resolution， corrects beam hardening artifacts， optimizes the use of contrast agents and creates opportunities for quantitative imaging relative to other CT technology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A full cardiac cycle CT investigation enables the assessment of morphological and functional structures of heart and can also be used to analyze in depth the ventricular function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【20】In our case， the vegetations on the tricuspid valve were in echocardiography not clearly visible， so we decided to perform CT-scan. A full cardiac cycle CT investigation with a photon counting CT scanner was done to explore the vegetations on tricuspid valve.

Rarely a right atrial thrombus can extend into left atrium through a patent foramen ovale.

We report an unusual case of floating thrombus in right atrium extending across a patent foramen ovale in a patient of acute pulmonary embolism， diagnosed on transthoracic echocardiography and computed tomography\n\n【2】Keywords： Pulmonary thromboembolism； Atrial thrombus； Transthoracic echocardiography\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Floating thrombi in right heart can be seen in 7% to 18% cases of pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. As echocardiographic examination is not routinely done in all cases of pulmonary embolism， it can be assumed that the exact incidence is underreported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Prompt diagnosis of these free floating thrombi is of utmost importance as they can embolize at any moment and thus require emergency treatment. Rarely these thrombi can extend into left atrium across a patent foramen ovale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. We report an unusual case of acute pulmonary embolism with presence of a floating thrombus in right atrium with extension into left atrium through a patent foramen ovale.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 54 years old male patient presented in emergency department of our institute with chief complaints of sudden onset shortness ofbreath (NYHA class IV) for lasteight hours. On examination patient had tachycardia (pulse rate of 120 beats per min) and tachypnea (respiratory rate of 28/min) with hypotension (blood pressure： 90/62 mmHg). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with non-specific ST/T changes. Troponin-I and D-Dimer values were raised. Transthoracic echocardiographic examination showed dilated right atrium (RA)， right ventricle(RV) and main pulmonary artery. There was RV systolic dysfunction \\[Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) =16\\] and moderate tricuspid regurgitation (TR gradient =75 mmHg). A large right atrial thrombus was seen  which was oscillating into right ventricle in diastole via tricuspid valve . Another thrombus was seen in left atrium  with presence of a defect in interatrial septum likely suggestive of patent foramen ovale . However continuity of thrombus across patent foramen ovale could not be demonstrated on echocardiographic examination.\n\n【7】Followed by this， patient underwent non ECG gated CT pulmonary angiography， which demonstrated a large partially occlusive thrombus in main pulmonary artery extending into right and left pulmonary arteries . A linear hypodense filling defect was seen in right atrium and ventricle  suggestive of thrombus. In addition filling defect was also noted in left atrium . On coronal reformatted images， continuity of thrombus across right and left atrium was demonstrated through a defect in interatrial septum . Doppler ultrasound for bilateral lower limbs did not show any evidence of deep venous thrombosis.\n\nBased upon echocardiography and CT findings， a diagnosis of floating right atrial thrombus with extension across a patent foramen ovale with acute PTE was made. Patient was started on intravenous anticoagulation (low molecular weight heparin) and referred to higher center for surgical embolectomy， in view of high risk of systemic embolization. However， repeat transthoracic|删除段之间换行|echocardiography in higher center showed marked reduction in size of thrombus. Subsequently the patient was managed with systemic thrombolysis with injection tenecteplase with no evidence of systemic embolization. Patient improved clinically and was discharged after one week stay in hospital.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Acute Pulmonary Thromboembolism (PTE) is a medical emergency with high mortality and morbidity. Combination of various diagnostic tests like plasma D-dimer levels， ventilation/perfusion lung scan， and spiral computed tomography and lower limb venous Doppler can be used to establish a diagnosis of acute PTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition to the above mentioned diagnostic tests， it has been shown that transthoracic echocardiographic examination can help in early risk stratification in acute PTE， thereby influencing the management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Echocardiography gives valuable information about pulmonary arterial hypertension， RA， RV dilation and RV hypokinesia.\n\n【11】Also， echocardiographic examination can demonstrate right heart thrombi in a patient of pulmonary embolism with a reported prevalence of 7% to18% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Floating right heart thrombi are accompanied by severe pulmonary embolism and it has been shown that presence of right heart thrombi is predictive of worse outcome in cases of acute PTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，8\\]</u>. These thrombi are thought to be in transit from peripheral venous system to pulmonary circulation. In extremely rare cases these thrombi can extend into left atrium through a patent foramen ovale. It has been proposed that increased pressure in right atrium due to RV overload can cause right heart thrombi to protrude across a patent foramen ovale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This condition is life threatening due to imminent risk of pulmonary and paradoxical embolism. Although the diagnosis of a free floating thrombus is straight forward on real time echocardiographic examination， occasionally it can be difficult to differentiate from other conditions like Chiari network， persistent eustachian or thebesian valves， atrial septal aneurysms or intracardiac tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\nFloating right heart thrombus is a therapeutic emergency and any delay to treatment could be lethal (with reported mortality upto40%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Treatment options include anticoagulation， thrombolytic|删除段之间换行|therapy and surgical embolectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， but there is no consensus on ideal treatment. Thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy is simple， rapid， non invasive and widely available. However， it may cause a fixed thrombus to dislodge， leading to pulmonary embolism and may also lead to paradoxical systemic embolism in a case of entrapped thrombus in patent foramen ovale (as in our case). Also， thrombolytic therapy is associated with risk of significant bleeding. Surgical embolectomy on the other hand is invasive and associated with inherent delay， complications of general anesthesia and inability to remove thrombus beyond central pulmonary arteries. However a patent foramen ovale can be repaired at the time of surgery thereby reducing the risk of paradoxical embolism.\n\n【13】To conclude， right heart thrombi can be seen in association with acute pulmonary embolism and in extremely rare cases can extend across patent foramen ovale.A diagnosis can be made on transthoracic echocardiography. Treatment options include anticoagulation， thrombolysis and surgery or a combination of above.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

We wish to share with others these potentially rare conditions and offer our experience in treatment.\n\n【2】Keywords： Coronavirus disease 2019； Inactivated vaccine； Membranous nephropathy； Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】To date， globally there are over 240 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) and over 4.9 million related deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In face of this severe pandemic， active immunization becomes a major tool in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

With the increase in the number of vaccinations， nearly all approved vaccine types have been implicated in kidney diseases.

Here， we report 3 patients who received inactivated virus vaccination and went on and developed de novo Membranous Nephropathy (MN) in one patient and ATIN in the other two patients.\n\n【5】Patient 1， a healthy 57-year-old woman， developed bilateral ankle edema the day after the first dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The edema resolved spontaneously within a few days， but reappeared after her second dose. On admission to the hospital， her sitting blood pressure was112/67 mm/Hg and serum creatinine was 37 umol/L， albumin was 28.5 g/L， Immunoglobulin (Ig) G was 6.3 g/L. The urinalysis showed microhematuria 1+ and 1.6 g of proteinuria in 24 h. Both her serum and kidney biopsy were positive for anti-Phospholipase A2 Receptor (PLA2R) antibody. The biopsy showed MN. The renal pathology was illustrated in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. Secondary causes of MN， including specific drugs， infections and malignancy were excluded. After 4 weeks treatment with losartan， the patient's edema resolved although the proteinuria remained the same.\n\n【6】Patient 2 was a 53-year-old woman with a history of glucose intolerance on no treatment. One week after the first vaccination， she developed symptoms of fatigue， chest tightness and palpitation. These symptoms persisted after the second jab. She also developed urine froth and nocturia. On hospital admission，her serum creatinine was 322 umol/L. The urine analysis was negative for blood and there was ±proteinuria. 24-h urine protein showed the presence of microalbumin at 69.9 mg. Total serum IgE was 2486 IU/ml. Two weeks after admission； the patient underwent a kidney biopsy. Her repeat serum creatinine was 357 umol/L.

Five weeks later， her serum creatinine fell to nearly normal.\n\n【12】Patient 3 was a 37-vear-old woman. She was admitted to our hospital following a week history of abdominal distension， acid reflux and bilateral loin pain after receiving inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. On admission， she was found to have a serum creatinine of 195umol/L with hematuria 2+and proteinuria 2+. The same patient was also found to have a mild thyroiditis on biochemical and immun ology assay and an anti-nuclear antibody ANA of 1 in 320. A kidney biopsy showed ATIN  with negative IF staining. She was treated with prednisolone at 1 mg/kg (55 mg in total) which was tapered off gradually. At her follow-up visit 3 months later，her serum creatinine had returned to near normal. The main characteristics and laboratory test results of the 3 patients are shown in Table删除4:<u> 1，2</u>.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】As the worldwide hospitalization rate and mortality rate are reduced through intensive and extensive vaccination On an international scale， the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines have drawn more public attention. Recently， there have been some reports about the development of de novo/relapse/worsening kidney diseases after COVID-19 vaccination. However， this is not the first-time vaccine has been implicated in kidney diseases. Influenza vaccine通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and tetanus-diphtheria-poliomyelitis vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> have been reported to induce Minimal Change Disease (MCD). One study found viral RNA in inactivated influenza vaccines that might have contributed to the development of Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. But the mechanism of these vaccine-associated diseases remains unclear.\n\nInactivated COVID-19 vaccines should be the safest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u> among all different vaccine types. Inactivated vaccines generally destroy the nucleic acid component of the virus rendering the virus non-infectious through physical or chemical methods. Therefore， only complete or partial virus particles with or without adjuvant are present in the vaccine. The immunogenic mechanism of inactivated|删除段之间换行|vaccines depends on the stimulation of T helper type 1 (Th1)-based T-cell responses and production of Receptor-Binding Domain(RBD)-specific binding antibody and neutralization antibodies to provide protection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However， Th1 cells have also been described as the pathogenic subset that might contribute to the development of organ-specific autoimmune diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【16】None of the 3 patients reported here were known to have past history of kidney disease or autoimmune disease. There may be a causal relationship between the vaccine and patient 1’s MN， because of the temporal relationship between the onsets of the PLA2R associated membranous nephropathy. We hypothesize that certain component in the vaccine may trigger a loss of tolerance to the PLA2R antigen on the podocyte， which ultimately leads to de novo MN. Patient 2 and 3 appeared to have positive ANA which would suggest they might carry a predisposition to immune-mediated disease. The immune response caused by inactivated vaccine or adjuvant may induce the development of de novo ATIN in such highly sensitive patients. We speculate that some components of the inactivated COVID-19 vaccine might induce abnormal regulation of the immune system in susceptible individuals， and lead to these new-onset kidney diseases. However， further studies are needed to elucidate the exact mechanisms in these conditions.\n\n【17】After the initial therapies， all 3 patients developed symptomatic relief and a favorable outcome. We believe that the renal sequelas of the inactivated vaccines are limited， and our treatment may be used\n\n| Table 2： Laboratory finding on admission.  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Patient 1  | Patient 2  | Patient 3  | Reterence interval  |\n| Urinalysis  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gravity  | 1.024  | 1.01  | 1.008  | 1.003-1.030  |\n| Sugar (mmol/L)  | NG  | NG  | 28  | <2.8  |\n| Blood (ery/ul)  | 0.3  | 0.3  | 0.3  | <0.3  |\n| Protein(g/L)  | 3.5  | 0.3  | 0.3  | <0.1  |\n| TPU (g/d)  | 1.9  | 0.268  | 0.193  | <0.14  |\n| RBC-Sediment (/ul)  | 70  | 18  | 3  | 0-18  |\n| WBC-Sediment (/ul)  | 24  | 21  | 29  | 0-23  |\n| COND—Sediment (Ms/cm)  | 28  | 8  | 6  | 15.1-27  |\n| Cast- Sediment(/ul)  | 2.08  | 0.91  | 0.62  | 0-2.5  |\n| B-J protein  | NEG  | NEG  | NEG  | NEG  |\n| Blood chemistry tests  |  |  |  |  |\n| HGB(g/L)  | 141  | 96  | 105  | 115-148  |\n| WBC (10^9/L)  | 8.95  | 8.42  | 7.63  | 3.89-9.93  |\n| Eosinophils(%)  | 2.80%  | 3.20%  | 3.50%  | 6-Jan  |\n| Neutrophils(%)  | 60.10%  | 73%  | 65.60%  | 44-72  |\n| TP(g/L)  | 49.9  | 82.5  | 80.6  | 66-87  |\n| Alb (g/L)  | 28.6  | 40.5  | 40.8  | 35-52  |\n| UA (mmol/L)  | 212.4  | 314.1  | 199.1  | 142.8-339.2  |\n| Urea nitrogenfmmol/L)  | 3.6  | 13.6  | 5.4  | 2.76-8.07  |\n| Creatinine(mmol/L)  | 48  | 337  | 215  | 44-80  |\n| TC (mmol/L)  | 8.58  | 3.72  | 3.34  | <5.2  |\n| ALT(IU/L)  | 8.3  | 32  | 2.7  | 0-33  |\n| AST(IU/L)  | 14.6  | 25  | 13.9  | 0-32  |\n| CRP (mg/L)  | 0.35  | 27.3  | 25.58  | <5  |\n| ANA  | 1：100  | 1：320  | 1：320  | <1：100  |\n| Anti-GBM antibody  |  |  | 一  |  |\n| PR3-ANCA (RU/ml)  | 一  |  |  |  |\n| MPO-ANCA (RU/ml)  | 一  | 一  | 一  |  |\n| PLA2R antibody (RU/ml)  | 48.12  | 一  |  | <15  |\n| Total IgE (IU/mL)  | NA  | 2486  | NA  | 0-100  |\n| SARS-CoV-2-IgG (S-CO)  |  | 一  | ±  | 0-1  |\n| Kidney biopsy  | MN  | ATIN  | ATIN  |  |\n\n【19】TPU： Total Protein Urinary； WBC： White Blood Cell； HGB： Hemoglobin； B-J protein： Bence-Jones Protein；ANA： Anti-Nuclear Antibody； TC： Total Cholesterol； ALT Alanine Aminotransferase； AST： Aspartate Aminotransferase； CRP： C-Reactive Protein； TP： Total Protein； Alb： Albumin； GBM： Glomerular Basement Membrane PLA-2R： Anti-Phospholipase A2 Receptor Antibody； UA： Uric Acid； ANCA： Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies； MN： Membranous Nephropathy； ATIN： Acute\n\n【20】Tubulo-Interstitia\n\n【21】as a reference for other physicians that may face similar situation.

The most common adverse effect of Rivaroxaban is related to the increased risk of bleeding. We are reporting the sixth case of spontaneous splenic rupture caused by Rivaroxaban. Written permission to publish this case was obtained from the patient.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 66-year-old gentleman with a background of hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation， treated with Enalapril 20 mg (two times daily)， Bisoprolol 5 mg (once a day) and Rivaroxaban 20mg (once a day)， was admitted to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain， nausea， and vomiting. He was a smoker but denied any alcohol intake.\n\n【4】On examination， he was tachycardic (115 bpm)， hypotensive (BP 70/50 mmHg)，had abdominal distention with tenderness in the epigastrium and left hypochondrium. Fluid resuscitation was commenced with crystalloids，and a Noradrenaline infusion was started via a PICCline (Peripherally Inserted Central Venous Catheter). Initial blood tests revealed Hemoglobin (Hb) of 11 g/dL with a normal platelet count (150.000/pL)， and a coagulopathy \\[Prothrombin Time (PT) 43%， INR 1.93， activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) 50 sec and fibrinogen 1.43 g/dL)\\]. Arterial blood gas sampling confirmed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22， PO， 93 mmHg and PCO， 35 mmHg) and a Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen/pelvis with intravenous contrast was undertaken， revealing a splenic rupture with a moderate hemoperitoneum . The patient re-affirmed there was no trauma prior to the onset of abdominal pain. A repeat full blood count was performed and confirmed a significant decrease in Hb(5.7 g/dL) and hematocrit (17.6%). Two units of Red Blood Cells (RBC) were transfused immediately， and the patient transferred to the operating room for emergency laparotomy and splenectomy.\n\n【5】An arterialline inserted prior to induction revealed severe hypotension (50/20mmHg) requiring administration of small boluses of intravenous Adrenaline (5 ug +5 ug). General anesthesia was initiated with a rapid sequence induction (Etomidate 18 mg， Fentanyl 150 ug， Rocuronium 80 mg). Intubation was uneventful， and anesthesia was maintained with Sevoflurane and Remifentanil. A percutaneous sheath introducer with a 8.5 French was inserted under US guidance into the right internal jugular vein to facilitate rapid administration of blood products. Four units of RBC and three units of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) in addition to 500 mL of colloids and 500 mL of crystalloids were required during surgery aiming to stabilize the patient and reverse the coagulopathy. A total splenectomy was performed， and after safe extubation in the operating room， was transferred to the intensive care unit. His postoperative course was uneventful and successfully discharged home seven days later.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Rivaroxaban has a rapid onset of action with a relatively predictable pharmacokinetic profile and a relatively short plasma half-life making initiation， maintenance， and discontinuation of anticoagulant therapy considerably more comfortable than with traditional oral anticoagulants. It is highly protein-bound (92% to 95%) with renal excretion at 36%， and in contrast to other new anticoagulants as Dabigatran， dialysis is not effective for its removal.\n\n【8】Table 1： Management of bleeding secondary to Rivaroxaban.\n\n【9】Rivaroxaban Moderate bleeding： action Severe bleeding： action\n\n|  | Fluid replacement.

There is， at present， no consensus on the best methodology for assessing Rivaroxaban activity in vivo and hence no guiding dosage. Unlike traditional oral anticoagulants， traditional coagulation tests cannot be used to assess or adjust dosing. At therapeutic concentrations， Rivaroxaban has a relatively weak influence on the PT；however， it is more profound at higher concentrations， with a good correlation between prolongation of the PT and plasma concentration.\n\n【13】Although hemorrhage iiss the significant adverse effect of Rivaroxaban， unfortunately， there is no immediate reversal agent currently available. Although Andexanet alfa has been approved by the FDA， for reversal of anticoagulation in life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding in patients treated with Rivaroxaban， it is not available in many countries. Therefore， other measures should be taken to treat significant hemorrhage .\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Rivaroxaban's datasheet details no reference to spontaneous splenic rupture due to its use； however， this is the sixth case report of spontaneous splenic rupture in a patient， with no history of trauma， treated with Rivaroxaban.\n\nA pharmacologic interaction could be the potential cause of an increase in activity ofRivaroxaban resulting in major hemorrhage.

India is a country of diverse culture and dynamic life-style which shows variations from one geographical location to another. Evidence suggests that 70% to 90% of cancers in India are related to lifestyle and can be easily prevented by adapting healthier life styles. Thus， this review aimed to examine risk factors of lifestyle cancers in different geographical locations in India. Three electronic databases， namely Psych INFO，JSTOR and Medline were systematically screened from December， 2017 to February，2018 for literatures on cancer and lifestyle risk factors. The search was limited to India， adults and papers written in English. 2，301 articles were identified and 10 were reviewed. Smoking and tobacco consumption were strongly related with lung， gastric and oral cancers in South and West India. Additionally， in West India， tea consumption was identified as a contributory factor for esophageal cancer while consumption of cabbage and sprout were found to lower the risk of colorectal cancer. In North India， attributions to esophageal cancer were snuff， smoking， salty tea， hookah， sundried foods and red chilli. A number of risk factors were unique to the different geographical locations in India. Awareness of these risk factors would help in strengthening preventive interventions which would facilitate a decline in cancer incidence in India and other countries where similar risk factors are prevalent. This review proposes to organize tailor-made awareness programs reflecting resonance to socio-cultural practice of people to reduce cancer incidence. Also， facilitation of tobacco and smoking cessation programs and strengthening of policies are strongly recommended to strengthen preventive interventions and reduce cancer incidence.\n\n【2】Keywords： Lifestyle； Cancer； Risk factor； Dietary patterns； India； Tobacco； Smoking\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Cancer is a lifestyle disease which is grouped according to the location of the cancerous stem cells. The World Health Organization defined cancer as “a generic term used for a large group of diseases that are characterized by the growth of abnormal cells beyond their usual boundaries and can invade to adjoining parts of the body) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Cancer is reported to be the second leading cause of death globally which accounted for 8.8 million deaths in 2015 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The burden of diseases is doubled in the developing countries in that both non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases contribute largely to morbidity and mortality， and India seems to fall in this category where the burden of non-communicable diseases and communicable diseases are 63% and 37%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The WHO Cancer Country profile revealed that 19.1% of premature deaths from NCDs 通用删除7(英):<u>(3，022，150)</u> in 2016 resulted from cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In addition， WHO cancer country profile， also revealed an increase in cancer mortalities from 683，800 deaths in 2014 to 784，821 deaths in 2018which implies the increasing trend in cancer mortalities in India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Anand et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> opined that only 5% to 10% of all cancer cases can be attributed to genetic defects， while the remaining 90%to 95% have their roots in the environment and lifestyle which includes cigarette smoking， diet， tobacco consumption， alcohol consumption， sun exposure， environmental pollutants， infections， stress， obesity， and physical inactivity.\n\nIn India alone， about 800，000 new cases of cancer are estimated to occur every year with stark variation across region where the age-adjusted incidence rates in men vary from 44 per 100，000 in rural Maharashtra to 121 per 100，000 in Delhi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The major cancers in men are mostly tobacco-related namely lung， oral cavity， larynx， esophagus， and pharynx. In women， the leading cancers sites include are cervix， breast， and ovary cancer and those related to tobacco namely oral cavity，|删除段之间换行|esophagus， and lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. India has the largest number of oral cancers in the world， due to the widespread habit of chewing tobacco 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Also， India is a nation with wide diversity in food habits and cultural practices， some of which are also found in other countries of the world. The prevalence of lifestyle cancers in India therefore gives a reason to critically examine the risk factors associated with these cancers for the management of lifestyle cancer incidence in India and the world at large.\n\n【6】Methodology\n\n【7】Literature selection criteria\n\n【8】A computerized search for literature was conducted using electronic databases namely Medline through Pubmed， Psych Info and JSTOR. The broad search term used for this review was cancer’which was combined with keywords prevalence’， fepidemiology， burden， qualityoflife， health care services，using AND'as Boolean operator. Each combination was carried out individually to get maximum results. In addition， MeSH term for cancer i.e. ‘neoplasm’was also used for each combination to cover maximum results. All search results were limited to studies with humans and published in English language. To retrieve more recent literature， a timeline of 10years was traced for database search but in case of JSTOR， timeline of only last five years was retrieved owing to huge nature of JSTOR.\n\nSince lifestyle behavior is mainly formed in adult life， thus present review focuses on cancers among adults leaving children out of the scope of selection procedure. Thus， inclusion criteria for identifying the studies for this review included：|删除段之间换行|1\\. Research papers only， review papers or conceptual articles were excluded|删除段之间换行|2\\. Cancer as main disease， cancer as co-morbidity was excluded|删除段之间换行|3\\. Cancer among adults， studies with children were excluded|删除段之间换行|4\\. India as nationality and residency，studies with non-Indians and migrant Indians were excluded.\n\n【10】Data extraction process\n\n【11】Identification of studies for this review involved four stages. At the first stage， a total of 2，301 studies were retrieved from three databases using above keywords， out of which 1，402 were irrelevant to present review since these were pharmacological studies， molecular studies， genetic studies or studies conducted outside India. In addition， 167duplicates were manually removed by the titles resulting in 732studies to be screened by abstract.\n\n【12】At the second stage， 732 papers were screened with abstract reading， out of these 617 studied either children or elderly subjects， focused cancer as comorbidity， conducted with non-Indians or migrated Indians. This resulted in 115 studies after abstract screening to be reviewed for full text availability.\n\n【13】At the third stage， all the selected 115 studies were searched for full text availability but only 82 studies were available in full text to download excluding 33 studies from the scope of this review. Further， another 67 studies were removed because they combined children and adult population， focused on lesions， or were review papers which were not clear from abstract reading. Another 5 duplicate studies that were previously omitted were manually removed at full text reading resulting in 10 studies eligible for this review. The selection procedure of eligible studies is presented in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. Step 1\n\n【14】& 2 was first conducted by DK which was then reviewed by TB&AK Step 3& 4 were conducted by DK and TB together.\n\n【15】Data from selected 10 studies were extracted using a self developed data extraction form  which presented information like year of study， location， age group， duration of study， study setting， objectives， study design， sample size， sampling strategy， analysis procedure and results to facilitate transparency in data analysis. DK extracted data from selected studies. TB and AK then assessed a 30% sample of randomly selected studies to check accuracy and ensure rigor in data extraction process. We differed at few instances in methodology and findings sections of the reviewed studies but consensus was arrived after discussion.\n\n【16】Results\n\nOn the basis of geographical location ofthe research， the selected studies were grouped into three categories：|删除段之间换行|1\\. South India (three studies)\n\n【18】2\\. West India (four studies)\n\n【19】3\\. North India (three studies)\n\n【20】We could not find any study from eastern part of India using our search strategy.\n\n【21】Studies from South India\n\n【22】One study from South India reported the clinical profile and epidemiological trends of lung cancer with an emphasis on smoking practices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The data was collected from a sample of 258 lung cancer patients (200 males， 58 females) from January 2003 to December删除4-1:<u>2007</u>. The age range of the participants in this study was 26 to 77years. The study reported 60.5% participants were ever-smokers while only 39.5% were never smokers. Among the smokers， 71.8%smoked cigarette while 28.2% smoked bidi. A significant correlation(P=0.0028) was found between advanced age at presentation (>60years) and those with a history of smoking.\n\n【23】Jayalekshmi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> reported a cohort study conducted in Kerala on the risk of gastric cancer in relation to tobacco and alcohol consumption. A baseline survey was conducted on every resident of Karunagappally taluk covering 65，553 participants (30 to 84 years) for socio-demographic and other lifestyle-related factors from January 1990 to December，删除4:<u> 1997</u>. The face-to-face interview survey was conducted with the help of trained field investigators for each resident using a 6-page， standardized questionnaire which was constructed with specific questions to elicit factors such as household socioeconomic status， religion， education， income， and occupation along with lifestyle factors such as smoking and drinking habits， and dietary practices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The study reported that Bidi smoking was associated with Gastric Cancer (GC) risk (P=0.042). The Relative Risks (RR) comparing current versus never smokers was 1.6 (95% CI：1.0-2.5). Gastric cancer risk was associated with the number of bidis smoked daily (P=0.012) and duration of bidi smoking (P=0.036). Those who started smoking bidi at younger ages were at an elevated GC risk. The RRs for those that started bidi smoking under the age of 18 and ages 18 to 22 were 2.0 (95% CI： 1.0-3.9) and 1.8(95% CI：1.1-2.9)， respectively， when their risks were compared with lifetime non-smokers of bidis.\n\n【24】Mahapatra et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> also examined the association between oral cancer risks and consumption of tobacco， cigarette and other oral dip products from March 2013 to July 2013 with 402 participants\n\n| Table 1： Summary of reviewed studies.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First AuthorandYear  | Objective(S)  | Design  | Sample and Samplingstrategy  | Analysis procedures  | Main finding s  | ReviewerRemarks  |\n| Krishnamurthy et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>，2012， South India(Chennai  | To analyze the clinical profileand the epidemiologicaltrends in lung cancer patients with an emphasis onthe smoking practices from asingle tertiary care center  | 5-Year Retrospective-prospective study on 258lung cancer patients (200males， 58 females) aged26-77 years in a tertiaryhealth setting in Chennai.  | Retrospective analysis ofprospectively collected dataof consecutive hospitalin-patients with a provendiagnosis of lung cancer at atertiary care oncology centre.  | SPSS software (Version18\\]was used.  | 60.5% were smokers while 39.5% were non-smokers.Smokers were cigarette(71.8%) and bidi (28.2%)smokers.  | Single facilitystudy which maynot represent thegeneral populationSample sizedetermination wasnot reported.  |\n| Krishnamurthy et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>，2012， South India(Chennai  |  |  |  |  | Acenocarcinoma was most prevalent among non-smokers(52.7%)and squamous cellcarcinoma among smokers(80.4%).  | Study includedsurvival rate of thesample.  |\n| Krishnamurthy et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>，2012， South India(Chennai  |  |  |  |  | Signiticant correlation ofsmokers presented atadvanced age (>60 years\\] withsquamous histology comparedto adenocarcinoma histology (P=0.00281.  | Structured abstract  |\n| Ganesh，et al. \\[101，2009， West India(Mumbai)  | Evaluating the associationof some life-style factors，dietary items on risk ofesophageal cancer.  | 3-year hospital-based Casecontrol study on 2，070participants (442cancercases， 1628 controls\\]aged30-75 years in Mumbai.Cancer site is esophagus.Questionnaire andinterview was used for datacollection  | Interview of patients at Out-patient department of thehospital prior to diagnosis，recorc of information intopre-designed questionnaire，segregation of subjects into'cancer cases and 'controls.  | Univariate analysis andUnconditional logisticregression was appliedusing SPSS Version15.0 software  | lobacco+ pan chewers have1(C.3 times excess risk (OR=1.3.  | Unstructuredabstract.  |\n| Ganesh，et al. \\[101，2009， West India(Mumbai)  |  |  |  |  | Smoking bidi increased therisk 1.8 times (OR=1.8\\]andsmokingfr cigarettes increasedthe risk (OR=2)2-fold.

The study reported that the risk of oral cancer is associated with smoking， smokeless， oral dip products， gutkha and other tobacco products. They also reported a preponderance of males (82.8%) over females (17.2%). Majority of the cases consumed gutkha (35.8%)， 14.9% consumed supari， 20.1%chewed tobacco， 17.4% consumed betel quid， 9.7% used snuff， and70% consumed alcohol daily. They further reported the odds of oral cancer in cases that consumed gutka， supari， tobacco， betel quid， bidi and alcohol to be 4.8，6.5，7.3， 3.2， 6.9， 2.1 times higher than those that do not consume these products respectively. Conversely， there was no association between mishiri， betel quid， smoking cigarettes and the risk of oral cancer.\n\n【30】Studies from West India\n\nGanesh et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u> conducted two 3-year long studies (1989 to1992) in Mumbai on esophageal cancer (N=2，070； 442 cases， 1，628controls) and colorectal cancer patients (N=1831； 203 cases， 1，628controls). They studied the risk of demographic， dietary habits and lifestyle factors through interview in an out-patient department. These examined tobacco， alcohol， unhealthy diet and tea drinking as risk factors of esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer in Mumbai. They reported a moderate 1.3 times excess risk for chewers of pan(betel-leaf) with tobacco， 1.8-fold excess risk each for bidi smokers and alcohol drinkers， 2-fold for cigarette smokers， and tea drinking showed a 4-fold excess risk for esophageal cancer. Both studies also reported a dose-response relationship among pan with tobacco chewers and an increased risk with time duration. Similarly， bidi and cigarette smoking showed a positive dose-response relationship where the risks increased to 2.4 and 2.5 folds respectively. Some significant findings emerged regarding the dietary habits and colorectal cancer. Cabbage-eaters had a 50% reduction in risk among both the genders， compared to those who did not eat cabbage. Sprout|删除段之间换行|eaters also had a 30% to 50% reduction in risk. There was an enhanced1.4-fold risk among ‘dry-fish'eaters compared to non-eaters.

A matched case-control sample (N=700； 350 controls， 350 cases) was studied using a self-reported questionnaire tracking information on consumption of tobacco， poly-ingredient oral dip products， alcohol， dietary habits and demographic status. A great risk of oral cancer in tobacco chewers and oral dipping consumers was reported. Three Smoking categories (filtered， non- filtered cigarette and bidi) were prevalent in cases and all the oral dip products {chewing tobacco， mishiri， gutkha， and supari} except betel quid， (P=0.112)， and panparag(P=0.621)， showed significant difference in cases. The study reported an increased risk amongst bidi smokers but no significant effect of betel quid and filtered cigarette on oral cancer risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Balasubramanian et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> reported the risk factors for Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in Mumbai (1997 to 1999) with male subjects only (N=1，773； 390 cases， 1，383 controls) through a pre-designed questionnaire 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The study examined the significance of alcohol， tobacco， dietary items and occupational exposure to non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk. The findings suggested that， among the dietary items， only consumption of mutton showed 7.0-fold significant excess risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Consumption of milk showed a 6-fold excess risk (OR=1.5)； while coffee showed a 50% reduction risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Among occupational factors， exposure to pesticides showed 3-fold excess risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n【34】Studies from North India\n\n【35】In North India， Sehgal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> reported the risk factors of Esophageal Cancer (OC) in Jammu (N=400； 200 cases， 200 controls). Samples were selected from patients who attended the Endoscopy Unit of Government Medical College from October 2007 to July删除4-1:<u>2011</u>. Patients below the age of 80 years and being diagnosed with squamous cell carcinomas of the esophagus were the cases while patients diagnosed with other diseases were the controls. Data on age， gender， educational level， and socio-economic status， family history of OC (first-degree relatives)， clinic pathological symptoms and dietary habits were collected using a short-structured questionnaire. The study examined risk factors and survival rate of OC and revealed that among dietary characteristics， snuff was highest (OR=3.86，95%) followed by salt tea (OR=2.53， 95%)， smoking (OR=1.97，95%)， sundried food (OR=1.77， 95%) and red chilly (OR=1.76，95%). The probability of survival also lowered significantly among those consuming tobacco in the form of snuff and smoking as compared to those who did not take these 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\nAlso， Khan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> conducted a study at a tertiary care|删除段之间换行|institution in Kashmir from January to December， 2008 with a sample of 100 diagnosed patients of esophageal cancer (cases) and100 healthy individuals (controls). A predesigned questionnaire covering personal， occupational， dietary and family history was administered. A preponderance of male cases over females was reported and majority of the cases were farmers (37%) and house-wives (29%) belonging to the low-socioeconomic status. It was further reported that， 91.7% of the cases were hookah smokers(major mode of smoking in Kashmir)， 78.8% smoked more than 20 g of tobacco per day， and 24% consumed five cups of salty tea per day. Sun-dried vegetable called Haakh was consumed by both cases and controls. With respect to fruit consumption， 45% cases consumed monthly， 40% consumed weekly while none consumed fruits daily. Consumption of meat on a monthly， weekly and daily basis was69%/15%/14% and 44%/42%/14% in controls and cases respectively. None of the groups chewed tobacco or consumed alcohol通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\nThe third study is a matched hospital-based case control study(February 2008 to October 2009) conducted on the role of lifestyle and dietary factors in Gallbladder Cancer (GBC) in the Northern part|删除段之间换行|of India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences， New Delhi with a sample size of 244 individuals from Delhi， Uttar Pradesh， Bihar， Uttarkhand， Rajasthan， Punjab， Orissa and Jharkhand. Cases 通用删除7(英):<u>(122)</u> were newly registered confirmed primary GBC patients while controls 通用删除7(英):<u>(122)</u> were healthy relatives of patients. Data were collected using a semi-structured interview schedule. The study revealed that illiteracy， low socioeconomic status， high parity (more than three)； early pregnancy and use of non-liquefied petroleum gas are associated with the risk of gall bladder cancer. They further reported that there was no significant relationship between alcohol consumption， tobacco consumption， education and age at menarche. Vitamin C intake was also reported to have a protective effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Geographical distribution of risk factors has been presented on India map in supplementary file .\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】This systematic review appraised the risk factors for cancer in India. The studies were location-specific with none covering India as a whole. In addition to the commonly known risk factors like smoking， alcohol and tobacco consumption， dietary patterns and life style factors were also identified to pose risk to certain cancers. However， a variation was seen depending upon geographicallocation and different cancer sites.\n\n【40】Smoking\n\nSmoking has been identified as the predominant cause of lung cancer， esophageal， oral and gastric cancer across the world having increased risk with longer duration andhigh quantity of consumption通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Earlier studies have reported a higher risk with bidi smoking in|删除段之间换行|comparison with cigarette 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19-21\\]</u>. High prevalence of lung cancer in Chennai was attributed to smoking (bidi and cigarette) especially among males， and the significant correlation found between advanced age at presentation (>60 years) and those with a history of smoking suggests high risk of cancer among advanced age smokers in comparison to young age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Hookah smoking was quite popular in Kashmir region particularly among farmers. Smoking was also an established risk factor for esophageal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22-25\\]</u>. In Pune， bidi smoking was identified as a significant risk to oral cancer while betel quid and filtered cigarette were not. Bidi smoking was observed to be more prevalent than cigarette； this could be attributed to the cheap cost thereby implicating its affordability by the low socioeconomic status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【42】In Kerala， higher frequency and increased duration of bidi smoking heightened the risk of cancer and significant differences were observed for gastric cancer incidence among the low socioeconomic class. These differences could be associated to their dietary patterns， although it was not reported in the reviewed study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>\n\n【43】Cigarette smoking and bidi smoking were reported to be associated with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) in Mumbai while alcohol consumption was not， although riskwas enhanced in drinkers by 50% compared to non-drinkers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Passive smokers\n\nPrevious studies have established the association between smoking and lung cancer； nevertheless， there has been a rising trend in the occurrence of lung cancer in non-smokers as well especially among females. This could be attributed to second-hand smoking，|删除段之间换行|whereby they were exposed to passive smoking from their spouses while they worked closely on the farm and other indoor air pollutants通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，26，27\\]</u>. This has also been reported as a contributory factor predisposing women to the risk of esophageal cancer in addition to the use of cow dung， wood and coal for cooking in Kashmir 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，28\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Tobacco consumption\n\n【47】Consumption of tobacco has been reported in various forms， such as， cigarette， hukka， bidi and snuff in the Jammu region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition to previously established association of cigarette， hukka and bidi with esophageal cancer， snuff intake has also been correlated with esophageal cancer because of the presence of tobacco carcinogens in moist snuff \\[291.\n\n【48】Over half of all tobacco consumed in India is smoked as bidi(Indian specific non-filtered cigarette) and about one-fourth of tobacco consumption is in smokeless form， such as chewing tobacco and mishiri 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. A great risk for oral cancer was found in the habit of tobacco chewing， with or without lime， which is kept in the mouth for different durations depending on personal habits. In an investigation that compared smokers with smokeless tobacco and oral dipping products users， both were at increased risk of oral cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This could be due to the direct contact of these products with the oral epithelium of the users.\n\n【49】India has the largest number oforal cancer diagnosis in the world， due to the widespread habit of chewing tobacco 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Oral cancer is strongly attributed to consumption of gutkha， tobacco chewing， consumption of supari and consumption of mishiri. Areca nut， the seed of the fruit of the oriental palm Areca catechu， is commonly used in India to prepare paan or betel quid， pan masala and gutkha. Chewing of pure areca nut has been associated with the risk of oral cancer because of its ability to promote carcinogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Gutkha contains areca nut， slaked lime， catechu， condiments， and powered tobacco. Gutkha can be highly addictive when compared to chewing ordinary tobacco as it has been previously shown to be a gateway to smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【50】When compared with non- consumers， Gutkha consumers were5.1 times more at risk of oral cancer， supari consumers were 11.4times more at risk，tobacco chewers were 6.0 times more at risk， betel quid consumers were 6.4times more at risk and bidi smokers were 2.3times more at risk of oral cancer while Betel quid had no significant effect in causing oral cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，14\\]</u>.\n\n【51】This could infer a protective effect of betel leaf (the main ingredient of betel quid) to the oral mucosa against the harmful alkaloids in areca nut. Betel leaf is known to be rich in beta-carotene which has the capacity to quench free radical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【52】In contrast， another study opined that chewing tobacco with paan (betel leaf) is more harmful in causing esophageal cancer than chewing tobacco only. It was speculated that while chewing tobacco with betel leaf， the juice comes in contact with the esophagus mucosa as opposed to tobacco juice alone which may be spat out without a direct contact with the esophagus mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【53】Alcohol consumption\n\nAlthough oral cancer risk was not reported to be associated with cigarette smoking and mishiri consumption but alcohol was reported to be associated with a high risk of oral cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In Kerala， Alcohol consumed was limited to arrack because it was the commonly consumed among the study population. Majority of the cases were|删除段之间换行|educated only until primary level and this could have an influence on their heightened alcohol consumption. Future researches are therefore recommended to establish the association of gastric cancer with other alcoholic drinks alcohol drinking was not reported in Kashmir； this could be due to the prevalence of Muslims in the region通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.\n\n【55】Dietary pattern\n\nTea is a common beverage in India. Salted tea has been reported as a dietary factor which is strongly associated with esophageal cancer通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. The tea is prepared by brewing green tea leaves with sodium chloride to obtain a reddish brown extract after which water， salt and milk are added to it. Consumption of bicarbonate-containing hot salted tea， commonly consumed by Kashmiri people， has been identified as dietary high-risk factor associated with the development of esophageal carcinogenesis. This type of tea is commonly consumed at a high temperature due to the harsh weather that is prevalent in the region. The hyperthermic effect of this tea could be injurious to the esophageal mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. This correlates with an earlier study that reported a relationship between tea drinking and stomach cancer in Kashmir 33|.\n\n【57】Also， the risk of esophageal cancer due to tea drinking was reported in Mumbai as a result of the high temperature of the tea consumed， which could be injurious to the esophageal lining， although the actual temperature that causes injury is not known通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In contrast， another investigation reported tea drinking to show less risk and coffee drinking showed a 50% reduction in risk when compared to non-drinkers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Coffee has been reported to protect from cancer through the activity of its anti-carcinogenic constituents通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.\n\n【58】In Kashmir region， the diet commonly consumed are cooked rice， green-leafy vegetable called haakh and salted tea. These have limited source of protective factor from esophageal cancer， as compared to the consumption of different varieties of fruits and vegetables， which are rich in the presence of vitamins and carotene that induces anti-oxidant effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. Increased intake of vitamin C was reported to be a protective factor against Gall Bladder Cancer， this is supported by an earlier hypothesis posing vitamin C to be an antioxidant which prevents the formation of carcinogen from precursor compounds， although there is no strong evidence for this 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Also， dietary factors revealed red meat consumption to be a high risk factor for the incidence of NHL； this has also been confirmed by earlier studies通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. However， high consumption of vegetables reduced the risk of NHL but they did not emerge as a protective factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Fresh fish on the other hand was reported to be a protective factor， this finding is similar to a study reported on risks of esophageal cancers in Mumbai通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，39\\]</u>. Animal studies have shown that fat from fish contains 20% to25% saturated fatty acids， and fish and fish oil are a rich source of n-3fatty acids and the fat-soluble vitamins A and D， and these n-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.\n\nMeat consumption was found to be a risk factor among the women in the population which could be as a result of their small sample size when compared to the males (females =59， males =144). Further research should be conducted on a larger population in order to establish the association between meat consumption and colorectal cancer in females. Among the vegetarian diets， only cabbage and sprout consumption were reported to be protective factors while dark green leafy vegetables， root vegetables and other vegetables were not shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. The anti-carcinogenic|删除段之间换行|actions of cruciferous vegetables are commonly attributed to them because theycontain glucosinolates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Sprouts contain antioxidants which may be the reason for its protective factor.\n\n【60】Food preservation\n\n【61】Owing to unavailability of vegetables， nomadic lifestyle and harsh weather， sun-drying is a common strategy used to preserve food in Jammu and Kashmir. This method facilitates the growth of mould， fungi and the presence of trace levels of several volatile and non-volatile N-nitroso compounds which have been strongly implicated with esophageal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31，42，43\\]</u>.\n\n【62】Furthermore， the risk of colorectal cancer in Mumbai was associated with consumption of dry fish. This is speculated to be due to the fact that the dry fish is salted， dried and preserved for later use thereby exposing it to harmful microorganisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【63】Occupational exposure and socioeconomic factors\n\n【64】Occupational exposure was reported as a contributory factor to the risk of esophageal cancer in Kashmir where farmers are likely exposed to hazardous chemicals and biological farming that are suspected carcinogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Although， the relationship between farming and risk of esophageal cancer was reported， other occupations were not included， therefore studies that include other occupations are strongly recommended. Also， poor socio-economic status posed to be a major risk factor predisposing the population to esophageal cancer in Kashmir. The absence of dietary nutrients， specifically vitamins A， E，Candtrace elements like zinc and selenium in meals， as observed in poor people increases the chances of cancer删除4-1:<u>44，45</u>.\n\n【65】In North India， the risk factors associated with Gall Bladder Cancer (GBC) were low education， three or more parity (childbirth)， early pregnancy and exposure to non-liquefied petroleum gas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Early pregnancy and multiple pregnancies will elevate the levels of progesterone and estrogen which may change the lithogenicity of bile and increase the risk of GBC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Non-liquefied petroleum gas does not burn completely therefore producing carbon monoxide， poly-organic and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons and other gases that could be carcinogenic thereby causing harm to women who use them to cook 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The role of traditional non-liquefied petroleum gas fuel in the incidence of GBC has not been well established， therefore future research is recommended in this area.\n\n【66】India being a country with a wide variation in food habits and cultural practices infers the possibility of similar lifestyle risk factors in other nations of the world. Consumption of hot tea and smoking are common habits in cold regions where people want to stay warm in the cold seasons. Also， there is a high rate of alcohol and tobacco consumption in many developed and developing countries inferring a high risk ofcancer incidence. In addition， meat is a highly consumed non-vegetarian diet in various countries in the world while vegetables are still less consumed in many countries causing poor nutrient intake in the population. These lifestyle risk factors， though are revealed from studies in India have the potential to draw inferences to other countries which have similar life-style.\n\n【67】Major gaps and recommendations\n\nHospital based surveys might not present the actual prevalence of cancer in the regions， therefore large population-based research is required to reveal the lifestyle risk factors of various cancers in the country for policy based interventions|删除段之间换行|Also， occupational exposure history especially exposure to chemicals， poisonous gases， and other occupational hazards needs to be studied with large samples in order to examine the suggesting relationship with cancer. In addition， physical activity which is also a risk factor for lifestyle cancers was not included in any of the reviewed studies.\n\n【69】We therefore recommend future research focusing on physical activity and its association with risk of cancers. In addition， we recommend that future research should examine the evidence of these contributory factors in the risk of cancers in India. Also， we recommend the need for quality research in other parts of India， in order to provide a wider perspective to the lifestyle factors that is contributing to the rising burden of lifestyle cancers in India.\n\n【70】Conclusion\n\n【71】In conclusion， this systematic review reveals that lifestyle cancers have a high incidence in India and this could be associated with the prevalence of risk factors like tobacco consumption， alcohol consumption， and dietary patterns of which tobacco consumption， a common habit in India is foremost. Lung cancer， gastric cancer， oral cancer， colorectal cancer， esophageal cancer， Gall bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin'slymphoma were identified as main cancers attributing to life style factors. Though life style factors like smoking， tobacco consumption， and other oral dip products were common factors in north， south and west India， few risk factors like consumption of salty tea， hookah，sundried foods and red chilly were unique to North India. Cabbage sprouts and Vitamin C rich foods were identified to have protective properties. Consumption of high temperature tea poses a risk of esophageal cancer while coffee has protective tendencies. Also， the consumption of various fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamins and carotene have anti-oxidant effects which reduce the risk of lifestyle cancers. Among non-vegetarian diets， fresh fish is a protective factor while the risk associated with meat consumption is not yet established. However， the exposure of dry fish to harmful micro-organisms during preservation makes it a threat to the body. Amongst females， cooking methods such as the use of non-liquefied petroleum gas， cow dung， coal and wood and also exposure to passive smoking， high parity， and early pregnancy also emerged as risk factors for life style cancers. Contributory factors like occupational exposure， low education， and low socio-economic status have also been identified with these cancers. There is variation in the incidence of risk factors in different regions due to the diversity of lifestyle patterns in India， a reflection of what exists in the globe. This review therefore implies the need for better and more effective awareness programs which focuses not only on widely known risk factors but also those that are yet to be established. Also，establishment of tobacco and smoking cessation programs at various levels and enactment of policies to strengthen preventive measures are strongly recommended to achieve a decline in the burden of lifestyle cancers.\n\n【72】Limitations of the Study\n\n【73】Due to time constraint， the reviewer could not explore other databases like CINAHL which could have added to the available studies in the reviewed area.

In contrast， other authors had reported normal and even increased seminal plasma zinc levels in infertile males， but such studies are very low in magnitude. The probable explanation could be that zinc in semen is responsible for motility， therefore， it may not effect in both oligozoospermic and azoospermic groups通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. We also found decrease level of semen zinc in azoospermic， oligozoospermic， asthenozoospermic and oligozoospermic groups.\n\n【16】High zinc content had also been reported in seminal plasma and has been associated with a high degree of sperm cell motility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， it has also been reported that extra cellular zinc performances as an inhibitor of human sperm motility and acrosome reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.

The most prevalent tumors occurring in pregnant females are malignant melanoma(2.8/1000)， followed by carcinoma of the cervix (1/2200) and breast (1/3000). A review of the literature didn't find any convincing evidence that pregnancy has a deleterious impact on the incidence of clinical profile of malignancy as compared to non-pregnant women of reproductive age， except in the case of malignant melanoma.\n\n【2】Urological malignancy in pregnancy is rare and poses a diagnostic and treatment challenge. Here， we report a case of non-muscle invasive bladder carcinoma in the pregnant female， successfully managed by TURBT (Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor)，resulting in good maternal and fetal outcomes.\n\n【3】Keywords： TURBT； Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer； Pregnancy\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Urological malignancies are very uncommon in pregnancy， with an overall incidence ofaround1/1000 pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Though rare， they can impose particular problems in diagnosis and management during pregnancy as fetal wellbeing has to be kept in mind too.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 25-year-old pregnant woman in the 36th week of gestation was presented to the hospital owing to painless gross intermittent hematuria with clots for the last four months. She denied any history suggestive ofurinary tract infections， renal calculus， or other genitourinary complaints. Herprenatal course had been otherwise uneventful， and she had no history of such urological complaints. She was a nonsmoker， nonalcoholic， and had no history of occupational or chemical exposure. On examination， the patient was pallor， normotensive， afebrile， and had stable vitals and voiding of wine-colored urine with blood clots. The fetus was active and the fetal heart sounds were strong. There was no evidence of vaginal bleeding. Her complete blood count was within normal limits except for normocytic normochromic anemia (Hemoglobin 9.2 gm/dl). Blood urea nitrogen，serum creatinine， viral markers， and coagulation survey were non-contributory. Her urine analysis showed numerous red blood cells with no casts or crystals and her urine culture was negative. Ultrasound examination revealed mild pregnancy-related hydronephrosis without any calculus and single space-occupying， papillarylesion of size approximately 2 cm x2 cm with high vascularity was noted at the right anterior wall of the bladder， suggestive of bladder tumor. The kidneys were normal in appearance. A single live fetus without any uterine abnormalities was noted.\n\n【8】She was being followed conservatively but in meantime， she started to have severe gross hematuria with clots retention leading to a fall in hemoglobin (6.2 gm/dl). She was managed by cystoscopy and clots evacuation followed by two units of blood transfusion. On cystoscopy， a growth of 2 cm x2 cm in size was noted at the anterior bladder wall that was bleeding profusely.\n\n【9】A decision was taken to fulgurate and bipolar Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumor(TURBT) in the same sitting under spinal anesthesia. The procedure was uneventful. On 2nd postoperative day， severe fetal distress was noted， the cause of which was unknown. A decision of Lower Section Cesarean Section (LSCS) was taken by a treating obstetrician and was performed.\n\n【10】The postoperative periods were uneventful， with mother and baby both being healthy and recovering. The patient and the baby were discharged on postoperative day删除4:<u> 8</u>.\n\n【11】The TURBT tissue specimen sent for histopathological evaluation revealed transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder of TaG 1 grade. Follow-up cystoscopy on 3r-month follow-up was unremarkable.己\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】In men， bladder carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies，but its occurrence in women is quiet less， with a male to female ratio of 3-4：1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It usually presents in the 6h and 74 decades of life. In young pregnant women， chances of the bladder carcinoma are very low. Pregnancy and malignancy are among the biological conditions in which antigen tissue is tolerated by a competent immune system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The majority of these cases usually present in the second or third trimester with painless hematuria. Hematuria presenting during pregnancy always warrants prompt evaluation， keeping bladder cancer as a differential diagnosis in mind. Diagnosis of bladder carcinoma during pregnancy can pose a dilemma， as symptoms are often misleading， i.e. frequency and nocturia are usually mistaken as they can arise throughout pregnancy in healthy females too， thus delaying the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is further complicated as for the patient， identification of the source of bleeding is often difficult and is frequently mistaken for obstetric hemorrhage or more common benign lesions such as cystitis. Although cystitis is the commonest cause of hematuria during pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， complete work-up is needed if a response to treatment is not satisfactory but firstly， painless vaginal bleeding due to placenta previa must be excluded since this needs prompt obstetrical intervention. Although bladder carcinoma is quite rare in pregnant women， gross hematuria should be managed with a high index of suspicion to rule out the possibility and timely management of bladder malignancy. Flexible cystoscopy is considered safe and the most useful test in the evaluation ofhematuria pregnancy. Transurethral IResection of the Bladder Tumor(TURBT) under regional or general anesthesia is considered safe to perform irrespective of the gestational period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. If the malignant potential of the tumor is high， then termination of pregnancy is considered during the early gestational period for maternal survival， followed by management of malignancy. There are only 27 cases reported of bladder mass with pregnancy out of which eight cases were managed with TURBT during the intrapartum period followed by an uneventful continuation of pregnancy till term or near term， thus ensuing fetal well-being simultaneously通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-9\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In this case， as the patient was having profuse bleeding from bladder growth， so we decided to go for fulguration and TURBT.\n\n【16】Unfortunately， the fetal distress of unknown cause resulted in emergencyLSCS. The current casehighlights the successfulprocedural outcome of TURBT for the mother but the risk remains for the fetus although TURBT is considered safe generally. In our case， though we couldn't ascertain the exact cause of fetal distress， still the procedure can be considered as one of the culprits. The authors want to shed light on the TURBT in pregnancy as a not-so-safe procedure but it remains a choice to perform in a patient with persistent hematuria where conservative treatment fails to continue pregnancy till term. Close and proper monitoring of both the maternaland fetal conditions remains crucial during the postoperative follow-up period.\n\n【17】Author's Contribution\n\n【18】Corresponding and first author： Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work and the acquisition； Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content.\n\n【19】Co-authors： Analysis， or interpretation of data for the work； Agreement related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved； Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A patient was treated with the simultaneous sinus elevation and dental implant placement for rehabilitation of the maxillary molar， which is adjacent to a natural tooth with intact root canal filling. Four months later，maxillary sinusitis was diagnosed reflected by nasal obstruction and foul-smelling discharge. The mobile implant was removed and replaced by a short implant without sinus elevation surgery. However， repeated symptoms of sinusitis was observed， which immediately healed after the extraction of natural tooth. Then the patient received implant insertion in the region of missing tooth， and no further complications were observed.\n\n【3】Conclusion： We proposed that sinus elevation stimulate the colonization of bacteria from the adjacent endodontically treated tooth， which lead to sinusitis and extraction of both implant and natural tooth.\n\n【4】Keywords： Peri-implantitis； Sinus floor elevation； Tooth extraction\n\n【5】Abbreviations\n\n【6】CBCT： Cone Beam Computer Tomography； RBH： Residual Bone Height\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Ever since it was first described by Tatum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>，and modified later by others， maxillary sinus floor elevation with grafting material has been proven tobea safe and highlypredictabletechnique.Despite its high survival rate achieved with this augmentation technique， complications do occur， such as membrane perforation， postoperative sinusitis， cyst formation， wound dehiscence， sequestration， and loss of bone graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As a result of contamination of the maxillary sinus with oral flora 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， infectious complication during maxillary sinus-floor elevation procedure was observed in 9 out of200 patients (4.5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Other studies also demonstrated similar rate of infectious complication， which range from 3.5% to 4.3%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. Sinusitis is considered as a major complication because there is risk that the infection could spread throughout the graft and the sinus cavity or the adjacent anatomical structures删除4-1:<u>71</u>.\n\n【9】Dental implant placements and dental extractions could be the iatrogenic causes for the occurrence of sinusitis. As the most common complication that occurs during sinus floor elevation procedures， perforations of the maxillary sinus membrane may results in direct communication between graft materials and sinus cavity， which can lead to infection and iatrogenic sinusitis. In addition，protruding and migration of dental implant into the maxillary sinus， blockage of air flow due to diminished intra sinus volume， ostium obstruction caused by postoperative swelling of the maxillary mucosa， and even the surgical procedures themselves have been reported to be the possible causes of sinusitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\nOdontogenic source is the other cause for cases of maxillary sinusitis， which can happen in people with maxillary teeth caries and maxillary dental trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. This case report presents an implant failure，persistent sinusitis and extraction of natural tooth that are mainly triggered by|删除段之间换行|sinus elevation and the intact root canal filling of natural tooth itself.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 44-vear old woman visited the clinic for reconstruction of the upper left first molar. Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) examination indicated that the Residual Bone Height (RBH) at the missing tooth region was about 5.13 mm， and no abnormalities of the sinus cavity was observed . The roots of upper left second premolar protrude into sinus cavity. Patients reported that the premolar received endodontic treatment that then received a post-core and porcelain-fused-to-metal crown several years ago.\n\n【13】The minimally-invasive transcrestal sinus augmentation was performed using xenogenic graft (Bio-Oss， Geistlich Pharma)； the vertical distance from sinus membrane to the alveolar crest was about12 mm after the sinus elevation. Simultaneously， the implant (Osstem Implant Co.， Busan， Korea， with 5 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length) was inserted with a good primary stability. However， four months later， the patient complained pain in the implant region， and nasal symptoms including nasal obstruction and discharge. Implant mobility was evident by intraoral observations. Thickening of sinus mucosa and large periapical radio lucency involving both the apical regions of the second premolar and dental implant were observed on CBCT images . Maxillary sinusitis was diagnosed by otorhinolaryngologist. We removed the mobile implant ， performed lavages with sterile saline， and prescribed antibiotics. The symptom of nasal obstruction and discharge relieved along with the healing， with favorable evolution.\n\n【14】Six months later， only occasional nasal obstruction was reported by the patient， and no significant abnormalities were observed in the sinus based on CBCT examination. Progress appears to be satisfactory， so re-implantation treatment phase was initiated. We inserted a new implant with 5 mm in diameter and 8.5 mm in length(9 mm height of RBH at implant region was observed by CBCT measurement) without the surgery of sinus elevation . Then the patient was prescribed antibiotics for 3 days.\n\n【15】There was no pain or symptom of inflammation around the implant region during the healing process. Implant osseointegration was observed through radiographic examination three months postoperatively， and then the implant was restored by a full porcelain crown. Surprisingly， the patient returned complaining aggravated nasal obstruction and foul-smelling nasal discharge in one month. Objectively， thickened maxillary membrane and periapical radio lucency around the second premolar were observed on CBCT images. The patient received antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid for 1 week， but the symptom of sinusitis didn't show any improvement. We proposed that the sinusitis might be caused by the apical infection from the second premolar， which was then extracted. As it to be expected，the pain and nasal discharge subsided immediately after the tooth extraction.\n\nThe patient was clinically evaluated 1 month and 3 months after tooth extraction， absence of nasal obstruction and discharge was recorded. The post-surgery CBCT at 6 months showed complete resolution of maxillary sinusitis and 1mm thickness of sinus membrane. Then the implant (Bicon， America， 5 mm in diameter， and 8 mm in length) was inserted into the second premolar region. No further complications were observed， and the implant was exposed and restored as planned in 4 months . The patient received a follow-up examination every 3 months， and the|删除段之间换行|implant-supported fixed prosthesis has been functioning well for 18months.\n\n【17】Discussion and Conclusion\n\nSimultaneous sinus elevation and dental implant placement for rehabilitation of the maxillary molar was performed in this|删除段之间换行|case. However， maxillary sinusitis was observed and extraction of both implant and natural tooth was performed several months postoperatively. Although the incidence of sinusitis after sinus elevation is low， infection can have deleterious effects on graft and implant survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，12\\]</u>. Among the different forms of sinusitis， the odontogenic form is very common， because the roots of premolars|删除段之间换行|and molars are close to the sinus cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In this case， the root tips of the natural teeth (the second premolar) with root canal filling protrude into the sinus cavity. It has been reported that approximately50% of endodontically treated teeth exhibited histologic signs of inflammation without any clinical symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. And the residual bacteria in the asymptomatic endodontic treated tooth have the ability to colonize areas of significant tissue damage， which could be the situation adjacent to a newly placed implant通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-19\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In this case， to achieve the transcrestal sinus elevation， the membrane had to be elevated from the sinus floor mesially and distally over the root tips of the adjacent teeth to become tension-free and thus to avoid any perforation of the membrane. So we proposed that the new environment created by sinus elevation may stimulate the colonization of bacteria from the adjacent asymptomatic endodontic treated tooth， result in the odontogenic infections penetrated into the maxillary sinus. Different from acute sinusitis， chronic sinusitis has always a bacterial etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Amoxicill in with clavulanic acid was prescribed to resolve the symptoms， because it has been reported that this treatment reduces the bacterial load and the related mucosal inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. But the sinusitis symptoms didn’t get any improvement by the drug therapy with antibiotics. According to previous reports， it is very important to completely remove the cause of odontogenic sinusitis for a suiccessful outcome通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. As we expected， the patient reported an obvious improvement in nasal obstruction and a decrease in nasal discharge immediately after the extraction of the natural tooth. This further confirms that this natural tooth might be the odontogenic cause for sinusitis and implant failure.\n\n【20】In conclusion， even an asymptomatic endodontically treated tooth may be harboring chronic infection， which can spread to the apical region of implant through sinus. The elevation of sinus membrane involving both of the implant region and adjacent natural tooth received root canal treatment should be avoided if the roots of the tooth protrude into the sinus cavity. Otherwise， a short implant with minimal sinus elevation with a safe distance to the apical region ofendodontic treated root could be an alternative option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The spectrum of vaccination-related kidney injuries was widely distributed， including glomerulonephritis， interstitial nephritis， and vasculitis and may present as acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Herein， we report a case of acute kidney injury after 3 doses of mRNA-1273 vaccine (Moderna).\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 58-year-old male visited our emergency room in March 2022， because of an abrupt onset of dizziness and general malaise. Physical examination revealed that he was afebrile with no cardiopulmonary distress， a blood pressure of 128/84 mmHg， heart rate； 74/min， normal heart sound and breathing sound， and normal abdominal examination. Neurological examinations were also unremarkable. Unexpectedly， a serum creatinine of 3.1 mg/dl (eGFR： 22.1 ml/min) was found. The other laboratory studies were unremarkable， including a normal urinalysis. The kidney sonography revealed normal size of both kidneys with normal echogenesity. His past history included hypertension and dyslipidemia； both were under satisfactory control at our cardiovascular clinic for more than 5 years. Notably， he received 3 doses of Covid-19m RNA-1273 vaccine(Moderna) in August 2021， November 2021 and February 2022， respectively. On December 74，2021， he received a routine check-up for a Pre-Scheduled Panendoscopy (PES)， which showed a normal serum creatinine of 1.1 mg/dl (eGFR： 73.08 ml/min)， but there was microscopic hematuria(urinalysis： RBC： 50-99/HPF， WBC： 0-2/HPF). He recalled that there was an episode of painless gross hematuria a few days ago， nearly one month after the second shot of vaccination. It subsided spontaneously. The PES disclosed gastric ulcers and a proton pump inhibitor (lansoprozole) were prescribed. Because there was no grosser hematuria， he did not pay attention to his kidney condition and was not followed up at our Nephrology Clinic until this visit to the emergency room. Under the impression of acute kidney injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> with unknown etiology， he was admitted for a kidney biopsy. After admission， a series of immune studies were performed ， which showed an ANA titer of 1：160， normal Complement 3 (C3) and C4， negative for anti-ds-DNA， anti-glomerular basement antibody and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. The complete blood count was essentially normal except for a mild anemia (hemoglobin： 10.5)， and the liver function were also normal. A urinalysis again showed negative finding with no hematuria. The Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio(UPCR) was 93.6 mg/g Creatinine (Cr).\n\n【4】Pathologic finding\n\n【5】A kidney biopsy was done on the next day of admission. The sample was sent for Light Microscopy (LM)， Immunofluorescence study (IF) and Electron Microscopy (EM) examinations. There were 9 glomeruli in the specimen. Under LM ， the glomeruli appeared to be grossly normal with normal cellularity and capillary walls， except for mild focal thickening of Bowman capsule and enlarged Bowman’s space. The proximal tubules showed hyaline to foamy change with some tubules showing flattening of the lining epithelium and luminal dilatation. There were some calcifications in the tubular lumina and foci of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis. The IF study was negative for all staining， including IgG， IgA， IgM， C3， kappa and lambda.

The patient's serum creatinine rose from 1.1 mg/dl to 3.1 mg/dl in 3 months but the kidney sonogram looked normal， implying a disproportionately higher rate of renal function deterioration. Althougha normal renal sonography might be found in some patients with chronic kidney diseases， like diabetic nephropathy， it is our usual experience that the renal sonogram should revealed either a decrease in kidney size or an increase in echogenesity bilaterally if the patient’s kidney disease was attributed to be “chronic\" because an eGFR of 22.1 mg/min meant a significant loss of renal function and it will take a substantial time to develop. Rapidly Progressive Glomerulonephritis (RPGN) could manifest with a rapid deterioration of renal function and a normal appearance of renal sonogram. However， RPGN usually|删除段之间换行|presented with microhematuria and proteinuria， which was unlikely， subsided without aggressive treatment. Our patient had a completely normal urinalysis at the time of biopsy， making the diagnosis of RPGN unlikely. Likewise， thrombotic microangiopathy， which has also been reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， can be ruled out based on the same reason. The kidney biopsy disclosed focal flattening of the lining epithelium and luminal dilatation， implying acute tubular injury. There was no glomerulosclerosis and no significant interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy， making the diagnosis of a “chronic\" kidney injury very unlikely. Because there was a gap of 3 months between the onset of gross hematuria and the kidney biopsy， we speculated that an intensive glomerular or tubular injury could have occurred during the 3 months although the patient was asymptomatic. The current biopsy findings thus may only represent residual changes of the injury. Alternatively， a sampling error of the biopsy encompassing the relatively “normal\" portion of the tissue might explain the dissociation of clinical and pathologic findings. Previous reports about COVID-19 vaccination associated kidney injuries included various kinds of glomerulonephritis， including IgA nephropathy， minimal change disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>， RPGN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and others通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，12，13\\]</u>. Our case had normal appearance of glomeruli， thus the diagnosis of proliferative glomerulonephritis is unlikely at the time of biopsy. However， our patient experienced an episode of painless gross hematuria one month after his second dose of vaccination. Surgical hematuria such as urothelial tumor and urolithiasis were carefully ruled out. Electron microscopy examination also revealed partial loss of podocytes foot process. Thus， we cannot exclude a transient glomerulonephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> had occurred during the disease process. Minimal change disease could manifest with acute kidney injury通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However， the hallmark of minimal change disease is nephrotic-ranged proteinuria and general anasarca， which were not present in our patient. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) also had been reported in association with COVID-19 vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. We cannot exclude the possibility that AIN had occurred in our patient during the 3 months， because of the presence of foci of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis seen in LM. Our patient also took a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) (lansoprozole) following the finding of gastric ulcer in PES examination. Acute interstitial nephritis and chronic kidney disease have been reported in patients taking PPI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. However， the cases reported were extremely rare. Given the huge population taking this drug， the evidence linking PPI use and kidney injury is|删除段之间换行|still controversial.

Its clinical and radiological manifestations are not entirely clear due to the rarity of the disease； and hence diagnosis of this condition can be delayed due lack of knowledge associated with the disease. We present a case of a 63-year-old man who presented with a few weeks of cognitive deficits with dysphasia and marked impairments in short term memory. His MRI brain showed subtle FLAIR and T1contrast abnormalities near the lateral ventricles abutting the temporal lobe at the choroid plexus. On brain biopsy he was noted to have perivascular atypical B lymphocytes consistent with PCNSL. High-dose methotrexate， teniposide， BCNU， prednisolone and Rituximab， followed by 5 months of consolidative chemotherapy with cytarabine resulted in clinical and radiological improvement. He subsequently relapsed twice and salvage chemotherapy with consolidative radiotherapy was delivered. Unfortunately， 6 months later his condition worsened and he was referred to palliative care， and then deceased. PCNSL of the choroid plexus is very rare and cases of relapsed disease generally have poor outcome despite a variety of chemo and radiotherapy options. Targeted therapies with optimal penetration of the blood brain barrier are warranted.\n\n【2】Keywords： Primary CNS lymphoma； Choroid plexus； Brain malignancy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Approximately 4% of all intracranial tumors are primary CNS lymphomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， of which intraventricular neoplasms are rare representing 1% to 10% of primary CNS malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There is an increased incidence of primary CNS lymphoma in individuals with acquired or inherent immunodeficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Involvement of the choroid plexus by lymphoma is rare with only less than10 individual case reports in the literature. The aim of this report is to present a case of a 63-year-old man who presented with cognitive deficits and after a myriad of investigations on brain biopsy was found to have primary CNS lymphoma of the choroid plexus. The case highlights the challenges in diagnosis， the rarity of such cancer affecting the choroid plexus and the response to treatment where treatment efficacy might be reduced due to location of the lesion.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 63-year-old man was brought into the ED by his partner， dueto a1-weekhistoryof\"confusion\"， short-term memory loss and inability to recall directions. There was no history of recent headaches， photophobia， neck stiffness， or seizures. He did not have fevers or night sweats but according to his partner， had lost 3 kg in weight in the past 3 months. His past medical history included a lumbar spinelaminectomy 10 years ago and he was a current smoker (30 pack-year history) but had recently quit. He worked as a farmer and had horses， cattle， dogs， and sheep in the farm. He sailed regularly and his most recent travel was to Japan 3 months prior to his presentation.\n\n【7】On examination he was afebrile with a blood pressure of 122/74 mmHg. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy no hepatosplenomegaly. Visual acuity was normal with pinhole correction.\n\n【8】Cranial nerve， gait and neurological limb examination， and fundoscopy were normal.\n\n【9】There were no abnormalities on examination of higher centers， frontal， parietal or occipital lobe functions， however marked deficits in recall with retrograde amnesia extending for at least one week with inability to form new memories. He scored 17/30(0/3 recall) on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and NUCOG of 71/100 with deficits in short-term memory. Formal neuropsychological testing confirmed specific deficits in recall of recent events.\n\n【10】Full blood examination， renal and liver function， inflammatory markers， Vitamin B12， folate，TSH，ANA，dsDNA，rheumatoid factor， pANCA and cANCA were all normal. Anti-GAD， anti-NMDAR and VGKC antibodies were negative. HIV serology was negative. Immunoglobulin levels were normal. Serum protein electrophoresis detected a paraprotein band of IgMlambda 4g/L.CT chest/abdomen/pelvis revealed no evidence of malignancy with no enlarged lymph nodes seen.\n\n【11】Lumbar puncture showed an opening pressure of 4 cm， H，O with 48 ×10/L polymorphs， 177 × 10/L lymphocytes and 0 x10/L red blood cells. Glucose was 1.5 mmol/L and protein was 3.93g/L. Cytology showed chronic inflammation with no evidence of malignancy. There was no clonal B- or T-cell populations identified by flow cytometry. Cryptococcal antigen， Herpes virus multiplex PCR and syphilis screen were negative. Electrophoresis was normal. NMDA receptor and neuronal antibodies were not detected in CSF.\n\n【12】MRI brain with gadolinium revealed thickening of the choroid plexus at the level of the atria of the lateral ventricle (extending to the temporal horns)， more pronounced on the right side associated with marked enhancement ofthe choroid plexus . There was no pathological contrast enhancement within the brain parenchyma outside the ventricular system， and the brain parenchyma was of normal volume with no volume loss of the hippocampal formation. The differential diagnosis from the MRI findings included malignancy， sarcoid or infection. A diagnostic biopsy of the choroid plexus lesion confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma consistent with PCNSL on histology and immunohistochemistry  showing presence perivascular atypical CD20 positive B cells， which were MUM1positive and a Ki-67 index of approximately 80%. A bone marrow biopsy for staging showed no evidence of lymphoma involvement.On slit lamp examination，there was no ocular lymphoma involvement.\n\n【13】He was subsequently referred to Hematology and commenced treatment withmulti-agentchemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate， teniposide， BCNU， prednisolone and Rituximab(monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody). He received 2 cycles， following which a MRI scan showed near complete resolution of his CNS lymphoma.Hlee then receivedconsolidation with high-dose cytarabine. Five months later， he presented with deterioration in gait and MRI brain scan showed recurrence of periventricular/choroidal enhancement. He received 8 cycles ofsalvage chemotherapy withhigh dose methotrexate and rituximab with the addition of temozolomide on odd-numbered cycles. Restaging MRI showed resolution of the CNS lymphoma consistent with improvement in clinical symptoms. He preceded with 30 Gy of consolidative whole brain radiotherapy delivered in 20 fractions. Unfortunately， six months later， patient exhibited worsening cognition and short-term memory loss and MRI scan confirmed relapsed disease in the ependymal surface of all ventricles， most pronounced in the lateral ventricles of both hemispheres. There was increased T2 signal extending into the white matter and this pattern of disease was in similar distribution to his original scan in June 2014 . Due to his poor prognosis， palliative treatment was discussed with him and his partner and he died within a month of his second relapse.\n\n【14】Discussion and Conclusions\n\n【15】PCNSL is an uncommon variant of extra nodal Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that involves the brain， leptomeninges， eyes， or spinal cord without evidence of systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The CNS normally lacks lymphoid aggregates and it remains speculative whether malignant transformation develops locally within normally trafficking CNS lymphocytes， or from within a sub-population of lymphocytes with specific tropism for the CNS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Such tropism may be facilitated through the expression of specific cell-surface adhesion molecules， such as CD44 and CD18，and various chemokine receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Spreading of malignant lymphoid cells within the CNS is believed to involve a complex interaction of selection and cadherin molecules， such as adhesion molecule CD44 and transmembrane protein receptor Fas (CD95) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Intraventricular neoplasms consist of two categories： those that originate from the ventricular wall， and those that originate from structures within the ventricular system such as choroid plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The choroid plexus is a leaf-like structure with a granular surface attached to the ependyma by a thin stalk in the lateral， third and fourth ventricles. It produces CSF and is crucial in maintenance of ionic balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Tumors arising from the choroid plexus are extremely rare， and include choroid plexus papilloma， choroid plexus carcinoma and non-neoplastic lesions. Of these，lymphoma is an extremely rare form of choroid plexus tumor. A PubMed search revealed only less than 8 cases of primary CNS lymphoma of choroid plexus， highlighting the rarity of the disease.\n\n【17】The risk factors for PCNSL include： iatrogenic immunosuppression， congenital immunodeficiency including ataxia-telangiectasia， Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and severe combined variable immunodeficiencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. PCNSL can also arise from EBV-mediated clonal expansion and malignant transformation of B-lymphocytes， a process that is likely regulated by immune mechanisms 5\\].\n\n【18】High-dose methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy is currently the first-line of treatment. As monotherapy， high-dose methotrexate achievesa 35%to74%response rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>andcombination chemotherapy regimens have increased response rates to 77% to 85%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. However， 35% to 65% of patients still relapse and radiation therapy is utilized as salvage treatment for relapsed or refractory disease with neurocognitive long-term toxicity a major concern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In a recent study Yang and colleagues reported the outcomes of 11cases of intraventricular primary CNS lymphoma showing that the majority (70%) relapsed and in the majority of cases salvage therapy(high does methotrexate and radiotherapy were required) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The overall prognosis for relapsed PCNSL is poor with salvage radiation treatment increasing median overall survival by approximately 11months in radiotherapy-naive patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Another multi centre study used induction therapy with rituximab， high dose methotrexate and temozolomide followed byhigh dose consolidation with etoposide in addition to cytarabine (without whole brain radiotherapy). A complete response to rituximab， methotrexate and temozolomide of66% and progression free survival at 2 years of 57% were seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Other studies have reported high dose chemotherapy-autologous stem cell transplantation as a first line treatment for primary CNS lymphoma； and in a phase 2 trial of 30 patients， 5 year probability of relapse-related death was 21% for all patients (n=30) and 8.7% for patients treated with high dose chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The case that we presented died from relapsed disease where salvage chemotherapy was ultimately ineffective in controlling the underlying illness. Age and premorbid function are thought to be independent risk factors for future prognosis in PCNSL通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. A complete response on neuroimaging after two courses of chemotherapy is also reported to be predictive of progression-free survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The case presented did not have complete resolution of radiological changes after the course of chemotherapy. One reason could have been that the location of the neoplasia being within the choroid plexus was presumably hard to access for the therapeutic agents. Future studies are required to decipher PCNSL location and its association with future outcome.\n\n【20】PCNSL of the choroid plexus is a very rare tumor. We present a case of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the choroid plexus with extension into the temporal horns ofthe lateral ventricle. Radiological and clinical improvement were achieved with high-dose methotrexate combination treatment with Rituximab but the patient experienced 2relapses within 5 to 6 months of completion oftreatment， heralding a poor prognosis. This is consistent with the literature where recurrent or relapsed PCNL has been reported to have poor outcome despite the many varieties of therapies that have been trialed. Targeted therapies that could penetrate the blood brain barrier are required to deal with this highly invasive brain cancer. Recent efforts on the use of agents such as ibrutinib， lenalidomide and immune checkpoint inhibitors for treatment of PCNL is underway.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Disseminated coccidiomycosis affects approximately1% of patients. Most common extrapulmonary sites are skin， bones， central nervous system， and soft tissue. Even more rare is the presentation of symptomatic genital tract infections and prostatitis. We present a rare case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a 60-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes and Polycythemia Vera (PV) who presented with dysuria and suprapubic tenderness found to have a prostate abscess， splenic lesions and cavitary pneumonia.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 60-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c 12.5%) and myocardial ischemia， presented with a three-week history of suprapubic abdominal pain， dysuria， unintentional 25-lb weight loss， and left lower leg numbness and weakness. He is a truck driver in Southern California delivering goods to construction sites. Computed Tomography(CT) scan of the chest， abdomen and pelvis revealed prostatic abscess， splenic abscess， cavitary right upper lobe opacities. Cultures of his prostatic and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid grew Coccidioides immitis， and serum Coccidioides serology by immunodiffusion were positive for IgM and IgG， confirming disseminated coccidioidomycosis.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Disseminated Coccidioidomycosis should be on the differentials on patients who presents with dysuria in endemic area.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Coccidioidomycosis， a dimorphic fungal infection that presents classically as a pulmonary illness， is caused by either Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii， and is endemic to areas particularly in the southwestern United States. The organism’s spores are typically transmitted via inhalation and have shown an increase in the annual rate of infection， from a rate of 5.3 per100，000 in 1998 to a rate of 42.6 per 100，000 in 2011， in endemic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Approximately 1%of patients who are infected， develop disseminated coccidioidomycosis， with the most common extrapulmonary sites being skin， bones， central nervous system， and soft tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Even more rare is the presentation of symptomatic genital tract infections and prostatitis as a manifestation of disseminated coccidioidomycosis. In fact， there have only been 18 confirmed cases and 6 suspected cases， but only one known recorded case of prostate abscess due to disseminated coccidioidomycosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. We present a rare case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a 60-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes and Polycythemia Vera (PV) who presented with dysuria and suprapubic tenderness found to have a prostate abscess， splenic lesions and cavitary pneumonia.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 60-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin Alc12.5%) and myocardial ischemia， presented with a three-week history of suprapubic abdominal pain， dysuria， unintentional 25-lb weight loss， and left lower leg numbness and weakness. He is a truck driver in Southern California delivering goods to construction sites. On admission， he was tachycardic with heart rate of 108 beats per minute and physical exam was notable for suprapubic tenderness. Laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis of 16.44 bil/L (normal range 4.80bil/L to 11.80 bil/L)， urinalysis positive for pyuria with moderate bacteriuria and glucose >500 mg/dL， and final cultures grew only mixed flora. Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast showed a complex multiloculated 7.9 cm×8.1 cm× 10.4\n\ncm prostatic abscess  with regional colitis and cystitis and heterogeneous peripheral ill-defined splenic lesions concerning for splenic abscess . CT of the chest was also obtained given the patient's history of weight loss and concern for malignancy， and this revealed cavitary right upper lobe opacities on a background of extensive micronodularity， most pronounced in the right upper lobe(miliary pattern) . The patient underwent radiologic-guided drainage ofthe prostate and splenicabscesses. Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) was also performed， which showed fungal spherules consistent with Coccidioides organisms . Cultures of his prostatic and BAL fluid grew Coccidioides immitis， and serum Coccidioides serology by immunodiffusion were positive for IgM and IgG， confirming disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Antibody titers by complement fixation were negative. The patient was treated with voriconazole (4 mg/kg q12h for 9 days)， micafungin (100 mg daily for 5 days)， and amphotericin B (5 mg/kg for 9 days) in the acute setting and transitioned to oral fluconazole at 800 mg daily once the organism was known and infection was better controlled. Our patient|删除段之间换行|reported symptomatic improvement following drainage of both the prostatic and splenic abscess along with several days of antifungal therapy. He was subsequently discharged with plans to continue fluconazole daily， for at least one year as suppressive therapy.\n\n【9】In addition， during the admission， our patient had persistent polycythemia with hemoglobin ranging from 17.0 g/dL to 20.2 g/dL(normal range 10.5 g/dL to 15 g/dL) and hematocrit 48.7% to 63.8%(normal range 32% to 46%). On review ofhis medical records， a JAK exon 12 mutation had been identified one year prior， but he was lost to follow up and was yet to initiate any medical therapy. At a one-month outpatient hematology follow-up visit， the patient was started on hydroxyurea and aspirin based on a newly established diagnosis of PV.\n\nIn regards to the response to therapy by his disseminated coccidioidomycosis infection， he underwent repeat imaging at a nine-month follow up visit， which revealed complete resolution of the prostatic abscess  and significant reduction in size|删除段之间换行|of the pulmonary lesions . Considering the clinical and radiographic improvement， his fluconazole dose was reduced to 400mg daily. In addition， around the same time his hemoglobin was noted to be 13.8 g/dL and hematocrit 39.1%.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】This case represents a rare clinical entity of disseminated Coccidioides involving the genitourinary tract. Fewer than forty cases of Coccidioides involving the genitourinary tract have been identified in men， of which less than twenty involved the prostate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A retrospective review of 3，676 prostate pathology reports (from biopsy and surgery)， from two hospitals in areas endemic to C. immitis， found four cases of previously unrecognized Coccidioidal infection of the prostate， suggesting that the condition， though rare， may be underdiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Due to its non-specific presentation， the diagnostic workup of genitourinary Coccidioides infection is challenging. Coccidioidal prostatitis may present with symptoms similar to that of acute bacterial prostatitis， with urinary obstruction and prostatic ten derness on exam 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Urine cultures may be helpful in diagnosing prostatic involvement especially when done after performing a prostate massage to express prostatic fluid， and the yield is improved when using a fungal culture growth medium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，9\\]</u>. However， fungal cultures of urine specimens are not routinely performed if fungal prostatitis is not suspected. In cases where clinical improvement is not seen within 48 h of medical therapy， further investigation with trans-rectal ultrasound or CT scan may be warranted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>.\n\n【14】While guidelines are lacking regarding prostatic abscess from coccidiomycosis， Abdelmoteleb et al. suggest that in cases where prostatic abscesses are larger than 1 cm or do not quickly resolve with antimicrobial therapy， drainage of the infected site should be considered， in order to prevent formation of fistulas to surrounding structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. These samples shouldbe sent for fungal， mycobacterial， and bacterial cultures， and may assist in confirming the overarching diagnosis ofdisseminated coccidioidomycosis，particularlyinendemic areas. Guidelines by the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) for management of disseminated Coccidioidomycosis recommend treatment with amphotericin B until clinical stabilization followed by itraconazole or fluconazole， with adjunct surgical intervention in select cases-those with large abscesses， bony sequestration， instability of spine， or nerve impingement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Whileprimarypulmonary coccidioidomycosismay be asymptomaticin as many as 60% ofpatients， concern for disseminated coccidioidomycosis should be high inpatients with certain epidemiologic factors and/or risk factors (e.g.， immunocompromised state) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Interestingly， both， disseminated coccidioidomycosis(~1% of coccidioidomycosis cases) and prostatic abscess (0.5% of urologic cases) are exceedingly rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，12\\]</u>. Those with HIV/AIDS off of antiretroviral therapy are especially at risk for prostatic abscesses and disseminated coccidioidomycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，14\\]</u>. One study also showed patients with poorly controlled diabetes (average blood glucose>200 mg/dL) were more likely to develop disseminated Coccidioides infections with reduced response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\nMoreover， a case series performed by Blair et al. showed that patients with hematologic malignancies including leukemia (27%)， lymphoma (27%)， multiple myeloma (13%)， myelodysplastic (4%)， or myeloproliferative disorders， which included agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and PV (9%) were at higher risk of dissemination. Fatality|删除段之间换行|from coccidiomycosis， while being disposed to such co-morbidities， was also noted to be much higher (50% when disseminated and 27%when pulmonary alone). However， it is possible that malignancy-associated morbidity and mortality from coccidiomycosis could have been exacerbated by chemotherapy or corticosteroids with associated immunosuppression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. While untreated PV may progress to immunocompromising conditions such as myelofibrosis and acute leukemia， PV does not necessitate fungal prophylaxis according the NCCN guidelines， as there has not been a direct relationship with increased rates of fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【17】It is suggested that cellular immunity plays a significant role in fighting acute coccidioidal infections and therefore， patients with dampened cellular immunity are more susceptible to coccidioidal infection， particularly with risk for dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，18\\]</u>. A retrospective review by Santelli et al.， concluded that individuals with diabetes were more likely to have cavitary lung disease and of those with diabetes， individuals with uncontrolled serum glucose concentrations were likely to have disseminated infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Diabetes has been shown to significantly weaken cellular immunity(delayed type sensitivity) reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Prior publications have also reported increased occurrence of relapsed infection and increased difficulty in controlling disseminated coccidioidomycosis infection， in those with uncontrolled diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>. While it is difficult to provide a direct correlation between uncontrolled diabetes and severity of coccidioidomycosis infection， tighter serum glucose control and frequent monitoring has been recommended to perhaps prevent complications of disseminated cocci. As for the underlying history of Polycythemia Vera， some studies have shown some correlation between myeloproliferative diseases and occurrence of Coccidioides infection perhaps compoundedby chemotherapy， which was not yet used in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Rates of coccidiomycosis disseminating to prostate and spleen with abscess formation is extremely rare. Our patient with poorly controlled diabetes may have suffered from resultant cellular immune dysfunction， increasing propensity to disseminated coccidiomycosis. In patients with poorly controlled diabetes in an endemic area， patients (namely men) who present with signs of urinary tract infection should be evaluated for possible fungal prostatitis and prostatic abscess. Our patient responded well to source control with drainage of the prostate. He was treated with broad spectrum anti-fungal in the acute setting and transitioned to long-term fluconazole， with remission of infection at 9-month follow-up. In order to prevent relapse， however， aggressive management of diabetes may be imperative in prevention of relapse. Finally， while PV may not have contributed to the initial infection， chemotherapy that may be used for treatment could increase risk of morbidity from disseminated coccidiomycosis， highlighting the importance of sufficient therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Today uterine cancer is the 2nd most common female genital cancer after breast cancer. Through the vears the incidence between cervical cancer and endometrial cancer changed from 9：1 to 2：1 in favor of the cervical cancer to 1：3in favor of uterine cancer.

The presented case-reports illustrate both entities and the difficulties faced in its differential diagnosis， as well as the utility of US on their detection and management. On the first case， patient presented the typical clinical features and risk factors of AVM. The US findings included the classical highly-specific signs： Multiple hypoechoic myometrial spaces with multidirectional turbulent high velocity flow seen on color Doppler US， and prominent parametrial vessels. On the second case， the clinical presentation and the background of curettages prior to the current pregnancy led the medical team to initially suspect AVM， even when the patient did present the three sonographic signs with higher PPV for RPOC diagnosis： A well-defined endometrial mass， a thickened endometrium， and endometrial vascularization. Key point on US differential diagnosis between the two entities is the presence of endometrial vascularization vs. exclusively myometrial vascularization.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Early or late PPH are common complications in the obstetric wards worldwide. The differential diagnosis for early PPH -which happens within the first 24 h after delivery- includes uterine atony， lacerations， coagulopathies and RPOC； while for late or secondary PPH -which happens between 1day and 12 weeks after delivery-RPOC， endometritis， subinvolution of the placental implantation site， coagulopathies and AVM should be taken into consideration \\[1，21.\n\n【5】RPOC are intrauterine tissues developed after conception which persist after birth， miscarriage or pregnancytermination. The anatomopathological diagnosis is based on the presence of chorionic villi. Incidence of RPOC is remarkable (about 17% during the 1% term， 40% during the 2n term and 3% during 3 term deliveries， with an estimated incidence of 3% to 5% for on-term vaginal births) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The most prevalent risk factors are previous retained placenta， maternal age， previous dilation and curettage， caesarean section or uterine surgery， labor induction， pre-term birth， uterine malformation andplacental features such as velamentous cord insertion or placentalimplantation site通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Complications include PPH，endometritis， and in fertility related to the formation ofintrauterine adherences and scar tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5\\]</u>. There is a lack of a formal consensus on diagnostic sonographic or imaging criteria regarding RPOC， although US has a key role on its detection and management when there is a clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from expectant management to medical-induced expulsion or surgical resection of RPOC (via curettage or hysteroscopy) depending on the presence and intensity of hemorrhage， the presence of concomitant infections and the sonographic characteristics of the placental remnants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\nAcquired AVM is an infrequent cause of severe vaginal bleeding， in which uterine tissue damage -mainly caused by uterine instrumentation， or less likely in context of trophoblastic|删除段之间换行|disease， diethylstilbestrol exposure， neoplasms or infections- cause an abnormal arterio-venous communication without a capillary bed in between 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Patients present with intermittent or severe vaginal bleeding， sometimes debuting days after birth or uterine instrumentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The gold standard for AVM diagnosis is angiography， showing early venous filling， with color Doppler US also being a reliable and available diagnostic tool. Active treatment for AVM is Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，7-9\\]</u>. Early differential diagnosis between RPOC and AVM may be challenging but it is key since the primary treatment for RPOC presenting with active severe bleeding (surgical resection of the remnants) may fatally worsen the hemorrhage in case of AVM.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】On April 2020，a 37-year-old nullipara was admitted with Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes (PPROM) and clinical chorioamnionitis at 17+5w. Antibiotic coverage was initiated.\n\n【9】During the expulsion of the fetus， she presented massive acute vaginal bleeding (1.4 L in 2 min). Patient underwent an emergent echo-guided suction curettage to evacuate the placenta and a Bakri Balloon was placed. Intra-surgery， she required transfusion with6 blood units and administration of vasoactive drugs to preserve hemodynamic stability. Patient was discharged asymptomatic 3days after the surgery. She was readmitted 5 days later presenting endometritis： endocervical culture was positive for E. coli BLEA. Treatment with Imipenem was started. Us showed a thickened endometrium of 69 mm with a solid mass of 28 mm x 27 mm with moderate vascularization on Doppler-US (color score 3)， compatible with RPOC .\n\n【10】A second echo-guided curettage was performed. Due to severe intra-surgical bleeding， patient required another Bakry Balloon placement and transfusion with 2 more blood units. After removing theeBakry Balloon， patient persisted asymptomatic andWas discharged. Two weeks later she was readmitted in hypovolemic shock， needing 2 more blood units and vasoactive drugs. US showed a thickened avascular endometrium of 34 mm and a heterogeneous and intensely vascularized myometrium，with important dilatation of the arcuate and radial arteries， and a nodular image of 28 mm ×13mm in its posterior wall， color score 4 with turbulent multidirectional high-velocity flow， suggestive of AVM .\n\n【11】Arteriography was performed， objectivizing hypertrophic uterine arteries with 4 points of arterio-venous fistula. Patient needed 2\n\n【12】consecutive embolization’s on the left and on the right uterine arteries within 20 days， both with conical-shape pushable coils， to successfully solve the AVMs. Bleeding receded and patient is currently asymptomatic.\n\n【13】On the second1 case， on December 2021， a 35-year-old nulliparous woman with an antecedent of two curettages in context of a therapeutic abortion due to fetal acrania and a posterior transfer of a cryopreserved embryo， presented early and late postpartum hemorrhage after a breech delivery instrumented with forceps at37+5w， with hemodynamic instability.\n\nFirst transvaginal US performed in the emergency ward 16 h after delivery showed a thickened avascular endometrium of 40 mm， congruent with clots. An emergency transabdominal echo-guided suction curettage was performed 48 h afterbirth. During theprocedure，|删除段之间换行|myometrial zone was seen， with pulsatile vascularization and dubious continuity with the endometrial cavity， initially suspected to be an AVM.\n\n【15】a highly vascularized myometrial zone was sonographically detected on the upper third of the uterus， with pulsatile vascularization and dubious continuity with the endometrial cavity， initially suspected to be an AVM .\n\n【16】Due to this diagnosis suspicion and with the patient in progressive anemization (Hb 53 g/L)，angio-TCand UAE with resorbable material were performed. Vaginal bleeding receded. During the admission she was transfused with 8 blood units. A weeklater， a sonohysterography was performed， observing a 26 mm heterogeneous endometrial cavity with a solid heterogeneous formation of 53 mm x 22 mmx 41mm which appeared to depend on the left posterior-lateral uterine wall， with moderate vascularization on Doppler-US (color score 3)， suggestive of RPOC .\n\nA consecutive attempt to evacuate the RPOC was made with a second echo-guided curettage， which resulted unsuccessful due to the intense vascularization of the remnants and the danger of massive bleeding， as well as the fact that they were intensely adhered to the|删除段之间换行|myometrium. As the patient was asymptomatic at the time， she was discharged with a sonographic control scheduled 3 weeks later.\n\n【18】However， a week later， she restarted profuse vaginal bleeding with secondary anemization， once the UAE was no longer effective due to reabsorption of the embolizing material. She needed transfusion with2 more blood units.\n\n【19】A multidisciplinary committee decided to practice a second UAE -this time with non-resorbable material- followed by a surgical hysteroscopy， in which RPOC intimately attached tothe myometrium were completely resected with bipolar loop . The patient is now asymptomatic.\n\n【20】Results and Discussion\n\n【21】On the first case， patient presented the typical clinical features and risk factors of AVM： Massive vaginal bleeding after two consecutive curettages for RPOC. The US findings included the classical highly-specific signs： multiple hypoechoic myometrial spaces with systolic and diastolic multidirectional turbulent high-velocity flow seen on color Doppler， and prominent parametrial vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，7-9\\]</u>.\n\n【22】On the second case， the US image during the first attempt of echo-guided curettage -which showed a highly vascularized myometrial zone with pulsatile vascularization in continuity with the endometrial cavity- as well as the clinical presentation and the background of curettages prior to the current pregnancy， led the medical team to initially suspect AVM. Nevertheless， the patient did present the three sonographic signs with higher PPV for a RPOC diagnosis： A well- defined endometrial mass， a thickened endometrium， and endometrial vascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，10\\]</u>. In RPOC， endometrial vascularized component is seen， while in AVM the abnormal vascularization is located exclusively in the myometrium.

In the case of RPOC， US is not as specific， but it is key on the differential diagnosis， orientating whether the abnormal vascularization is located in the myometrium or in the endometrium.

Bilateral mammography showed increased density under the left nipple without calcification and dominant mass. Ultrasound of breast evidenced few abnormally dilated ducts in the retro areolar region of left then right nipple. Therefore， the patient was diagnosed with duct ectasia. It is concluded that hyperprolactinemia can also lead to mammary duct ectasia even in women even at a pre-menopausal age.\n\n【2】Keywords： Mammary duct ectasia； Hyperprolactinemia； Nipple discharge\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mammary duct ectasia is an inflammatory disorder in breast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The pathology behind this includes expansion of the main ducts related to intraluminal blocks of histocytes and periductal inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The rate of occurrence of mammary duct ectasia can vary from 1.1% to 75.0%， according to the investigative methods utilized， which can be clinical，histopathological， or based on necropsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Mammary duct ectasia mainly influences those females who are undertaking menopause or about to start menopause but can also take place in younger females， males， and infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Smoking is a dangerous feature for duct ectasia.

On compression of her breast， nipple discharge of milk more on the left side was also observed. The nipple discharge was often drenching through shirts within a few minutes of throwing on them. The menarche of the patient took place at an average age， but with irregular menstrual periods. The patient married at the age of 21-year. The patient had two children. Among those children， the elder child had correctly breastfed， but the younger child had not been appropriately breastfed. The younger child breastfeeding was stopped due to increased prolactin level and bloody nipple discharge. The patient had never been smoked and did not have a family history of cancer.\n\nOn examination endocrinology report for prolactin levels was first done. Report showed prolactin level was 79.5 ng/ml (reference range： 5.18-26.53 ng/ml for female). Mammography was performed and evidenced by increased density under the left nipple. However， no dominant mass or suspicious calcification was seen. There was no architectural distortion of the parenchyma，while， lymph nodes were noted in both axillae . Ultrasound of breast exhibited few dilated ducts|删除段之间换行|about 8 mm.\n\n【10】in the retromolar region ofboth breasts， however abnormally dilated under the left nipple，largest measuring about 8 mm . Based on clinical signs and symptoms and clinical tests fin dings， the patient was diagnosed to have duct ectasia.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Mammary duct ectasia is a seditious (causing inflammation) syndrome in the breast which is linked with inflammation and periductal fibrosis of differing extent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This illness is also recognized as comedomastitis， plasma cell mastitis， and cholesterol granuloma. Duct dilatation is generally not indicated in the early stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\nWhen it is indicative， mainly general medical appearance is mammary discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In most of the incidences， no clear abnormalities are present， but in afterward phases， tender sub-areolar masses along with skin renunciation happen， which can be detected as infiltrative carcinoma， which is wrong. The identification of Mammary Duct Ectasia is generally medical. The irregular thickening of the sub-areolar breast tissue and micro-calcifications is mostly identified via mammography. These thickenings can be imitated as carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The diameter of ducts greater than 5mm can be identified and assessed with the help of ultrasonography通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Ductography is frequently performed for recognizing ductal dilatation with the multifocal luminal barrier in a dropped way， but|删除段之间换行|it is bound as an investigative way for Mammary Duct Ectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Histopathologically， the peri-ductal inflammation is analyzed. The lymphocytes， plasma cells， or foamy histiocytes are present more often. The early stage of Mammary Duct Ectasia is illustrated through the existence of expansion of terminals of duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Afterward， the inflammation is substituted with fibrosis. Duct ectasia rarely gets better devoid of cure or by means of the utilization of temperate antibiotics and compresses. If the warnings ofectasia do not go biopsy is frequently needed， and the anomalous duct would be eliminated via surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Constant or repeated disorders are handled with centered surgical removal of the abnormal ducts below the nipple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. A right way of surgery for duct ectasia is image guided surgery by ductal endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. There are two theories with respect to the pathology of Mammary Duct Ectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【15】First， the main pathological route is believed to be unclear with degeneration of the ducts and glands， pursued via ducts expansion， directing to the apathy of secretion， duct burst， and inflammation. The second contributing incident is offered to exist as an inflammatory progression； periductal inflammation being the primary anomaly， pursued by duct sclerosis， obliteration， and duct ectasia. Alternatively， the etiology of duct ectasia is still unidentified. Other influencing factors consist of squamous metaplasia of the terminal duct epithelium， phenothiazine treatment，cigarette smoking， bacteriall!growth， and hyperprolactinemia.L Tobacco smoking is also a hazardous cause for ductal ectasia. While another study revealed that bacterial infection also leads to duct ectasia \\[19-211. However， this evidence is not enough as a cause of this disorder. An earlier study illustrated a relationship involving unusual prolactin discharge and Mammary Duct Ectasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Shousha et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> also analyzed that there is a linkage between specific hypothalamic/pituitary ailments， likely correlated with prolactin secretion and progress of mammary duct ectasia in postmenopausal patients. It is suggested that hyperprolactinemia may also lead to mammary duct ectasia. However， further studies are needed to elucidate the process， so that such kind of disorders can be prevented.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】It is concluded that there is a strong relationship between hyperprolactinemia and mammary duct ectasia in a pre-menopausal age also.

{"seq_id": "269761a5-b5dd-4a66-8543-623b89104c19", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】Pregnancy causes many changes in a woman's body. Some of them are transient in nature， while others remain for the rest of the patient’slife. Dramatic changes do not bypass the Thyroid Gland(TG). Against the background of pregnancy， both hypo- and hyperthyroidism can develop， which should be diagnosed and treated in time. Sometimes changes in thyroid function are so unexpected that they become an unpleasant surprise for a young mother and her doctor.\n\n【2】Clinical Case\n\n【3】A 26-year-old patient with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) was admitted to the endocrinology department. T1DM was diagnosed in 2005 at the age of 10 years. At the onset of the disease， basal-bolus insulin therapy was started.\n\n【4】In October 2018， she became pregnant (at the time of pregnancy， high glycemia levels were noted with high variability from 2 mmol/l to 21 mmol/l)， however， due to an embryony diagnosed at 9 to 10 weeks of pregnancy， vacuum aspiration of the uterine cavity was performed. Due to poor control of diabetes， an insulin pump was installed.\n\n【5】For the second pregnancy careful assessment was performed， including regular TSH control. A repeated increase in TSH up to 3.1 uIU/ml to 3.3 uIU/ml (0.4-4.0) was noticed.\n\n【6】There was a decrease in thyroid tissue echogenicity and diffuse heterogeneity according to the ultrasound data. FT4 (18.46 pmol/l(8.2-24.7)) and fT3 (5.18 pmol/ (2.76-6.45)) were within the normal range with elevated Antibodies to Thyroid Peroxidase (TPOAb) 104.6 IU/ml (<60)， Antibodies to TSH receptors (TSHrAb) were not detected. Taking into account the presence of T1DM and increased TPOAb in combination with slightly elevated TSH during pregnancy planning，levothyroxine 50 mcg/day was prescribed.\n\n【7】Just before pregnancy TSH decreased to 1.3 pIU/ml. During pregnancy， there was a decrease in TSH to a minimum of <0.004 uIU/ml，levothyroxine treatment was cancelled and at the time of childbirth in July 2021 TSH level was 2.139 uIU/ml.\n\n【8】Two months after delivery there was a decrease in T'SH to 0.028pIU/ml. After another 3 months， the patient noticed a significant glycemic variability during the day and was admitted to hospital with high glycaemia.\n\n【9】A decrease in TSH to 0.008 uIU/ml was determined with increase in fT4 up to 31.7 pmol/l(8.2-24.7) and fT3 up to 12.8 pmol/l (2.76-6.45)， TSHrAb were determined (5.12 IUA (<1)). In a hospital tachycardia with heart rate up to 100 beats/min to 120 beats/min was revealed. According to ultrasound of the thyroid gland， the total volume was 6.7 cm， with diffuse changes in the tissue. So， she was diagnosed with Graves' disease.\n\n【10】Thus， the diagnosis “Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3\"as a combination of T1DM and Graves disease was established. As the lactation at the time oftreatment was stopped，antithyroid therapy with thiamazole 10 mg 2 times a day was initiated. Bisoprolol 7.5 mg was prescribed as pulse-lowering therapy.\n\n【11】Approximately 1 month after starting the drug， the patient noted an allergic reaction in the form of erythema on the back ofthe hands. Thiamazole was replaced by propylthiouracil at a dose of50 mg 3 times a day. Against this background， there was a rapid trend towards normalization of the skin condition .\n\n【12】Despite the irregular intake of the drug， a dynamic study after 1and 3 months after the start of therapy showed normal fT4 and fT3and elevation ofTSH， and therefore the dosage ofpropylthiouracil was reduced to 50 mg 2 times a day. Further， the patient also took the drug irregularly. There were some fluctuations in TSH level， however， over the next 7 months， both TSH and thyroid hormones were within the reference values， TSHrAb returned to normal range. As she stopped treatment and had target TSH after 4 months of discontinuation，we didn't resume anti-thyroid treatment and continue monitoring TSH.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Despite significant differences in the pathogenesis and clinical presentation between Autoimmune Thyroiditis (AIT) and Grave's Disease (GD) a conversion of one autoimmune disease to another is described in the literature. Observations of the transition of GD to AIT are more common， and much less frequently we can see the development of GD in a patient with AIT. According to one theory， this is due to the absence of a critical mass of thyroid tissue capable to respond to TSHrAb in people with a long history of AIT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In any case， hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis can occur consecutively in the same patient 2\\].\n\n【15】According to literature， it becomes obvious that the problem is quite rare in relation to the generalprevalence of autoimmune thyroid disorders， and therefore it is valuable to describe each clinical case.\n\n【16】The reasons for the switch in thyroid function are not completely clear at the moment， however， it is clear that there are several factors that， both individuallyor in combination， can influence the transition from hypo- to hyperthyroidism and vice versa. First of all， this may be due to switching between stimulating (TSAb) and blocking(TBAb) TSHrAb. It was traditionally believed that patients with thyrotoxicosis have only TSAb， and patients with hypothyroidism have only TBAb. However， both types of antibodies can circulate in the same patient. Thyroid function may fluctuate depending on predominating antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nExact factors leading to the switch from the production of one type of TSHrAb to others aren’t known for certain. There are observations that changes in the type of antibodies sometimes occur under the influence of levothyroxine or antithyroid drugs. During|删除段之间换行|treatment period the concentration and mode of action of antibodies can change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Another possible explanation for the transition from hypo- to hyperthyroidism is that the thyroid tissue， which has undergone very serious autoimmune damage that has led to hypofunction of the gland， eventually recovers sufficiently to respond to subsequent exposure to stimulating antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In addition， there are theories that the thyroid function can switch under the influence of various external factors， such as viral infection， pregnancy can also trigger the changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In case of our patient， there are several options for the causes of GD manifestation after childbirth. According to one theory， pregnancy was the stimulus for the conversion of hypothyroidism into thyrotoxicosis. During pregnancy， thyroid autoantibody levels usually decrease due to immunosuppression and/or hemodilution and are the lowest shortly before delivery， especially stimulatory T'SHrAb levels. However， in the postpartum period， the levels of anti-thyroid antibodies are restored， and then can even increase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\nAccording to the second theory， the conversion occurred under the influence of levothyroxine treatment. It is believed that can happen either due to the restoration of thyroid tissue and the better response to circulating TSAb， or due to a decrease in the number of TBAb during levothyroxine treatment and a comparative increase in TSAb通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. In our patient， mostlikely， the trigger for the development of Graves’ disease could be both the pregnancy itself and the use of levothyroxine. Unfortunately， there is no data on TSHrAb level before pregnancy， so it will not be possible to establish a precise cause retrospectively|删除段之间换行|As such clinical observations occur sometimes in patients， they are really important for doctors， since in clinical practice a decrease in TSH in a patient treated with levothyroxine， in most cases will be regarded as an overdose of it， which may lead to dose reduction and loss of time， while detection of GD can significantly change the treatmentand favorably affect the prognosis ofthe disease，preventing the development of complications.\n\n【21】Whatever the genesis of the development of GD in our patient， the value of this clinical case is that a patient with T1DM got a second autoimmune disease after pregnancy-GD. Thus， we can diagnose the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type删除4:<u> 3</u>. This clinical case makes us remember the increased risk of developing a second autoimmune disease in patients with T1DM， which may manifest many years after the onset of diabetes， while pregnancy may trigger its manifestation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Aging in the population certainly affects various aspects of life， such as social， economic， and health. Aging also causes the function of the body’s organs to decrease due to natural factors or due to disease. When a person reaches old age， and the children have formed their own family， the responsibility to them is relinquished. She/he returned to being as accessible and independent as she/he had been in the early days ofher/his marriage. The obligation to care for， finance，educate and supervise children is no longer carried out. But by the time freedom was obtained， she/he was already in a state of physical， biological， and psychological decline， and had lost her/his children from home.\n\nToday's society has entered the era of modernization which naturally changes people's mindsets and attitudes. As a result of this change in mindset， many individuals have grown up with an individualistic perspective. Of course， this has a negative impact because it causes humans to feel content with themselves and do not need other people in their lives， even though humans were created as social beings who must actually interact with one another. But in this era， many people tend to compete to achieve their personal goals. When the younger generation brings perspectives， subconsciously they will focus more on themselves than their families. So that many older generations are getting less and less attention from their children and grandchildren. Families who|删除段之间换行|are unable to care for them end up placing their seniors in a nursing home. Of course， this makes seniors feel left out when they have to be placed in a place with makeshift buildings and facilities. Sometimes， makeshift buildings and facilities make seniors feel uncomfortable and uncomfortable. However， often because there is no choice， the elderly feels compelled and unhappy， which can then cause health problems.\n\n【3】Based on statistical data for 2021， Taiwan has at least 3.8 million people aged over 65 years， and this number continues to increase every year. Some people perceive the existence of the elderly negatively and incorrectly. They consider the elderly as a burden to the family and the surrounding community. This may be caused by several cases that discuss cases of elderly people whose lives are very dependent on other people. Because of the dependency and helplessness of the elderly， it is concluded as a burden and a reason for certain families to send them to a nursing home， even being abandoned.\n\n【4】Chi Lau Lin Aged Care Co. Ltd.， instead of calling itself a nursing home， Chi Lau Lin prefers to be called aged care located in central Taiwan. In contrast to the nursing home， Chi Lau Lin is a facility for parents whose families are still able to care for the elderly at home. Chi Lu Lin provides classes， activities， events， and delicious food for the elderly to enrich their knowledge and not stop learning.\n\n【5】In addition， Chi Lau Lin also prioritizes safety and environmental design in their facilities. That way， families can entrust their parents to Chi Lau Lin when they are at work or not at home. Of course， on certain sides， there are unavoidable places that might threaten the safety of the elderly. That place is the emergency staircase on one side of Chi Lau Lin. This will be discussed further in the next section.\n\n【6】Literature Review Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (QIPS)\n\n【7】The theory of improving quality and patient safety， in general， is to encourage the implementation of service activities to patients that meet service standards， and safety and provide satisfaction to patients. In particular， to ensure that services are provided in accordance with medical and nursing service standards， as well as that services are provided in accordance with standard service standards， and patient safety and are carried out in an integrated manner according to patient needs. As well as seeking to improve service quality， patient safety and performance through increasing the ability to provide health services to develop a better monitoring system in service quality indicators.\n\n【8】Patient safety is an important element to improve the quality of health services， especially in hospitals as a form of implementation and reflection of the results of the competence of health workers， the availability of service facilities and infrastructure as well as management and administration systems in the service cycle for patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. To ensure patient safety，healthcare organizations must be able to build systems that make the patient care process safer， both for patients， health workers， and the surrounding community(family， visitors)， as well as hospital management. The patient safety system is intended to reduce risk， prevent the occurrence of injuries due to the patient care process， and prevent the recurrence of patient safety incidents by creating a patient safety culture.\n\nPatient safety should be a culture in health services in health facilities. However， several cases still show that patient safety has not become a culture in their work environment. This can be seen in cases of malpractice， discrimination or other cases. Every health|删除段之间换行|profession should have a code of ethics which must be an aspect of implementing patient safety culture in their work environment. By adopting a good patient safety culture， you can minimize incidents related to patient safety. Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) research 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u> states that of the 421 million patients treated annually worldwide， 43 million people are harmed annually due to treatment with side effects \\[21.\n\n【10】Currently， the issue of patient safety is one of the main issies in health services. Patient safety has become something far more important than just service efficiency. Various risks due to medical action can occur as part of service to patients. It turns out that the quality of service alone is not enough.\n\n【11】Health care facilities should always maintain the security of the service process for patients so that medical errors do not occur which affect the quality and service of these health care facilities. Patient safety is an effort to ensure that actions and activities in health care facilities carried out by health workers for patients are safe and do not cause adverse effects or impacts on patients that have been regulated in regulations. Patient safety is an important point in every medical action， both minor and serious medical actions. Based on research by Maghfiroh & Rochmah 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， patient safety has a major influence on the image， social responsibility， morals， and performance of health workers so patient safety is related to quality issues and the image of a health service， including nursing home or even aged care facility\n\nThe aspects of implementing successful patient safety are as follows：|删除段之间换行|a. External environment\n\n【13】Hughes stated that the external environment is something that is needed for agencies to have a high commitment to implementing the quality of patient safety. Strengths that are biased and can make changes to the orientation ofthe agency， one ofwhich is the motivation that comes from the external environment. External pressure in health agencies can come from the provisions in implementing the quality of patient safety， and competition in providing services， then ones awareness and lawsuits will increase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】b.Leadership\n\nHughes gives the opinion that a nurse who can play a role in changing leadership to implement patient safety will have an effect on changing the organizational structure which is expected to be more effective in implementing safety. Leaders are required to be able to understand that external pressure is an opportunity to make changes for the better. In institutional leadership without strong encouragement， patient safety will only become a motto 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Leaders can bring success or failure of quality management in the health care facilities they lead. Leadership must be one of the abilities that must be possessed by leaders to lead their organizations to continue to progress better and have positive improvements. It is important for leaders to develop their skills and demonstrate their commitment to quality and build the organization with their board， as well as set a clear direction for the organization. Leaders must also change their organization's value systems and ultimately organizational culture， policies， and structures to meet the needs of their employees and customers5|.\n\n【16】c. Organizational culture\n\nPatient safety culture is the foundation of patient safety. Keywords|删除段之间换行|in improving quality and patient safety provide a change in patient culture from a blame culture to a safety culture. One of the strategies to develop a safety culture is to involve employees in planning and developing a safety culture.\n\n【18】d. Management practice\n\n【19】Lower， middle， and upper-level managers have the responsibility to implement policies and procedures that have been made and agreed upon together. Managers support for the implementation of patient safety is a good thing and supports the success of the quality assurance program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Person-Environment-Occupation (PEO) model\n\n【21】删除3:<u>The Person， Environment， Occupation Model， is also known as PEO Model. The PEO Model was created by Mary Law et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> in删除4-1:<u>1996</u>. It is a transactional Model since it depicts the interrelationship between the Person， The Environment， and The Occupation. The PEO Model has 3 key concepts， Person， Environment， and Occupation. Their interaction results in Occupational Performance. The person is unique and has specific skills， experience， knowledge， interest， and roles. The person who is continuously developing is intrinsically motivated. The environment can be socioeconomic， cultural， institutional， social， and physical. Occupations are divided into three main categories： Self-care， productivity， and leisure. We participate in daily occupations for self-maintenance， expression， and life satisfaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. As Occupational Therapists we a the characteristics， duration， structure， and complexity of each occupation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. According to the PEO Model， function results from a good fit between the three key concepts. Law et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> suggested that PEO should be interdependent upon one another， and created optimal performances for the individual in whichever contact they are performing their occupation.</u>\n\n【22】The PEO Model was developed to provide a framework for delivering services that focuses on a client-centered approach. Previous research notedthatthePEO model can beused to understand and develop person-centered interventions for people with dementia通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. PEO factors reflect participation ability among residents and dementia. When the environment and occupation are adjusted to the skills of the person，participation is assumed to be successful.\n\n【23】In a previous study， Green and Cooper 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> indicated that thelevel function of residents was greatly influenced by the number and type of activities offered. Green and Cooper 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> succeeded in recognizing how PEO interactions play an essential role in the engagement of meaningful activities. The PEO Model can accommodate the limitations of residents， and staff， and be more flexible and creative when designing individual activities.\n\n【24】Method\n\n【25】This study uses the theory of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety (QIPS) education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> which has a vital role in developing healthcare professionals with the knowledge， abilities， and attitudes to improve healthcare systems. In addition， by using the PEO Model， this study aims to explore and observe the situation in Chi Lau Lin using the three elements of people， environment， and occupation models to promote a better healthcare system that can be applied in its management system.\n\n【26】Case Study： Chi Lau Lin\n\n【27】the third age group and the implementation of local aging， hoping that all people can have a dynamic， independent， and dignified old age.\n\nWith one-stop overall service (the concept of three stages and five levels of publichealth)， Chi Lau Lin plans five major career directions， including colleges， associations， clubs， long-term care services， and|删除段之间换行|restaurants， also links all stages of services to provide services for the third age group. People of all ethnic groups (or planning to prepare for the third age group)， whether they are healthy， sub-healthy， demented， or disabled， can regain their enthusiasm for life and save their lives. Implement the vision of developing a corporate model of people-oriented， love-based， and practice a happy life and holistic care. Below are features that promoting by Chi Lau Lin：\n\n【29】Diverse courses\n\n【30】Because knowledge is constantly updated and infinitely changing， if we don't have a new understanding of ourselves and the space to surpass our own limitations， it will be difficult for us to have the ability and ability to regenerate learning. The most important thing in self-transcendence is to establish a good habit of lifelong learning.\n\nThe intervention of multiple courses can effectively encourage the elderly to participate in society and provide learning motivation. It is also helpful for the development of the elderly with dementia， and it|删除段之间换行|can also reduce the care pressure of the main caregiver.\n\n【32】One-stop integrated care\n\n【33】Through one-stop integratedcare services andsystematic resource links in the elderly industry， the difficulties and burdens faced by cases and their families can be solved.\n\n【34】Faculty lineup\n\n【35】Teachers in professional fields can provide continuous and effective guidance and services in dementia care， which can not only enhance the sense of achievement of seniors participating in the courses but also stabilize the emotions of the patients.\n\n【36】Chi Lau Lin creates a \"dementia\" home care service model and uses the professional training of program training in care practice， according to the care needs of individual cases and their individuality， the characteristic content of dementia care is summarized one by one from the visit process， including physical assessment， needs assessment.

Due to high toxicity，stability and diverse structures， aflatoxins in food chain is an increasing global food safety concern. This study sought to isolate and identify aflatoxigenic fungi， as well as detect the presence of Aflatoxin in food and feed samples. Grains and kernels from various agricultural produces were collected from regions in and around Mysore. Fungal cultures obtained from the samples were subjected to morphological， microscopical examinations； followed by chemical and chromatographic studies. The HPLC analysis indicated 129/220 fungal isolates produced aflatoxins and showed a population distribution of 43% of A. flavus， 29% of A. parasiticus，7% of A. furnigatus， 7% of A. oryzae，5% of A. ochraceus， 4% of A. versicolor and 3% of A. tamarii and 2% of A. niger.\n\n【2】Keywords： Aflatoxins； ITS sequencing； HPLC； TLC； Aspergillus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Globalization of the food industry has led to the vast spread of food commodities and also illnesses related it， which are mostly caused by fungi with Aspergillus flavus being an important postharvest fungus in grain stores. Along with their secondary metabolites termed as “Mycotoxins， fungal infestation has raised concern on public health due to their toxic properties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Among them， Aflatoxin (AF) contamination in food has gained importance worldwide due to their hazardous impact on both human and animal populations as carcinogens， mutagens and teratogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Aflatoxins are a group of difuranocoumarin derivatives produced through the polyketide pathway by filamentous fungi of the genus Aspergillus. Mycotoxins produced by members of Aspergillus are commonly known as \"Aflatoxins\". The main producers include species of A. flavus， A. furnigates， A. parasiticus and A. nomius that are predominant in tropical and subtropical regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There are about 20 different types of AFs identified as byproducts of Aspergillus contamination in food commodities such as cereals， nuts， fruits， oilseeds， and dried fruits both in field and storage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The most predominant AFs in food，agriculture， and dairy products that are designated as Aflatoxin B1， B2， G1， G2， M1， and M2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Among these， Aflatoxins B1 (AFB1) is classified as a group 1A carcinogen by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) due to its substantial liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma apart from plentiful of deleterious health conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Activities during crop cultivation (preharvest， harvest and postharvest)， and other factors such as temperature， humidity and pest damage affect the level of infection of grains by mycotoxigenic fungi. Aflatoxin contaminated food and feed incur huge losses to farming communities as the harvest is made unwholesome for consumption. Aflatoxin contamination of 88% with concentration of5 ug/kg and 14 g/kg (AFB1)， 58 g/kg (AFG1) was reported in stored maize in Benin respectively通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Agbetiameh et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， reported that 35% of 509 (326 maize and 183 groundnut) samples had detectable aflatoxin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A study conducted in Doha， Qatar revealed aflatoxin contamination in spices and nut samples as 371.6 ng/g and 534.15 ng/g， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Al-Jaal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> highlighted the limitations on studies of aflatoxin contamination of food and feed globally and in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC). In recent years， numerous studies have revealed high levels of aflatoxins and fungal contamination in rice in many countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However， mycotoxin-producing fungi are less commonly reported for rice than for many other cereal crops 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\nIn order to protect the consumers from the aflatoxin effects， many countries have set stringent|删除段之间换行|regulations in monitoring and surveillance of aflatoxin levels in for human food as well as animal feed. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) limit AF concentration to 15 ppb to30 ppb (parts per billion). According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 通用删除7(英):<u>(2002)</u>， the concentration of AFs in the range of 4 ppb to 30 ppb is allowed in human food， depending on the importing countries. In the United States， the maximum limit of aflatoxin in the human food - except for milk is 20 ppb， while in the European Union it is 2 ppb to 4 ppb通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【7】According to Sowley 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， the prevalence of mycotoxins， especially aflatoxins and its associated health problems is a silent threat in developing countries where most of the people are oblivious of the dangers associated with the consumption of contaminated produce. Therefore， monitoring and management of mycotoxins in food and feed is an important prerequisite in food industry. The objective of the study was to isolate and identify aflatoxigenic fungi and detect aflatoxin in various food samples from farms， stores and markets in and around Mysore， Karnataka，India.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】Chemicals and reagents\n\nMycotoxins (Aflatoxin B1(AFB1)， Aflatoxin B2 (AFB2)，Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1)， Aflatoxin G2 (AFG2)， Ochratoxin A (OTA)， Fumonisin B1 (FB1)， Patulin， Citrinin， Zearalonone (ZEA)， Deoxynivalenol(DON) and T-2 toxin)， Potassium Chloride (KCl)， Sodium Chloride(NaCl)， hemin， TMB (3，3'，5，5'-Tetramethylbenzidine) substrate reagent set， Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA)， Potato Dextrose Broth(PDB)， Coconut Cream Agar (CCA)， chloroform， acetone， methanol acetonitrile and glacial acetic acid required for present study were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis， USA) unless mentioned|删除段之间换行|otherwise. All the solutions were prepared with ultra-high purity water. All other solvents and reagents used in the experiments were of analytical grade. Ultrapure water (Mill-Q， Millipore， India) was used throughout this study. Standards of mycotoxins were prepared according to manufactures protocol and diluted from stock solutions to working concentration (1 mg/mL) in absolute methanol (HPLC grade).\n\n【11】Collection of samples suspected for fungal contamination\n\n【12】As it isknown， foodandfeedareconsidered as the major reservoirs of aflatoxin producers； grains and kernels from various agricultural produces namely， wheat， paddy， maize， groundnut， sorghum， and spices viz.，chili， and pepper were collected from regions in and around Mysore， India. All the samples were weighed to a sample size of 250gm， respectively and stored at 4℃ for the isolation， identification and molecular detection of Aspergillus species and further analysis of the extracted aflatoxins. The schematic representation adapted in the present work for isolation of aflatoxigenic fungi is depicted in the Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【13】Physical examination\n\n【14】Isolation of aflatoxin producers from the fungal isolates： The isolation of fungal strains from the collected samples was performed according to Abbas et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Initially， the grains and kernels were surface sterilized by rinsing 3 to 4 times with distilled water followed by thorough washing in 1% Sodium hypochlorite + 0.1% Tween 20for 10 min to 15 min by rapid shaking. This was followed by final washing of 3 to 5 times in sterile distilled water for 5 min each. Disinfected samples were allowed to air dry on blotting paper.Grains and kernels of 4 to 6 numbers were added to 1% Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) and incubated at 25°C for 48 h to 72 h. After incubation，\n\n【15】Table 1： List of standard fungal cultures utilized in the present work\n\n| S.No  | Name of the fungal strain  | Source  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Aspergillus fiavus  | NCIM 152  |\n| 2  | Aspergillus parasiticus  | MTCC 2797  |\n| 3  | DFR11  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n| 4  | DFR12  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n| 5  | DFR13  | DFRL， Mysore， India  |\n\n【17】the grains suspected of fungal growth were transferred onto petri-dishes containing 1% Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C for 2 to 4 days. The resultant fungal colonies on PDA petri plates were further observed and purified. Obtained fungal isolates were subjected to screening and identification by morphology， microscopy， molecular and chromatographic methods as discussed in the following sections.\n\n【18】The single spore cultures of Aspergillus isolates were subcultured on PDA slants， overlayed with 5% glycerol and maintained in 4C. The reference strains and Aspergillus isolates available from the in-house repository were also utilized as positive controls in the present study and are listed in the Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【19】Microscopical analysis of Aspergillus species： Obtained fungal colonies were examined for their phenotypic morphologies as per Diba et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The fungal isolates with characteristic morphologies similar to Aspergillus species were selected and further studied by microscopy using lactophenol cotton blue stain. The slides were then viewed under the light microscope (NIS-Elements imaging software， Nikon， India) and examined for characteristic features of Aspergillus species.\n\n【20】Chemical analysis\n\n【21】Ammonium vapor test： Ammonium vapor test was performed on 3-day old fungal cultures as per Fani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The cultures grown on Coconut Cream Agar medium (CCA) according to Degola et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， containing fungal colonies were placed upside down， and a drop(approximately200ul)of 25% ammonia solution (v/v) wasaddedonto the lid of each fungal petri-dish and color development was carefully observed. Pink color pigmentation upon contact with ammonium vapors served as an indication for the aflatoxin production and these isolates were selected for further analysis.\n\n【22】Ultraviolet (UV) light test： For Ultraviolet (UV) light test， the fungal colonies were grown on CCA plates at 28°C for 5 to 7 days and tested for characteristic blue fluorescence on the reverse side of each petri-dish under long-wavelength (365 nm) UV light.\n\n【23】Molecular analysis\n\nFungal DNA extraction： Genomic DNA extraction from fungal samples was carried out using phenol： Chloroform： Isoamyl alcohol method. A loopful of mycelium or spore suspension from purified fungal isolates was inoculated into 50 ml of sterile Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) (Himedia， Mumbai， India). The inoculated PDB flasks were incubated at room temperature for 48 h to 72 h with mild agitation of 100 rpm. The mycelium growth was harvested from the inoculated flasks by filtration through Whatman filter paper No. 3and snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen. The frozen mycelium was pulverized and ground to powdered form using a sterile mortar， pestle and stored at -20°C until further use. A small amount of mycelial powder was collected into a sterile 1.5 ml eppendorftube and crushed with micropestle and 500 ul of lysis buffer (pH 8) (100 mM Tris-HCl，|删除段之间换行|50 mM EDTA， 150 mM NaCl and 10% SDS) was added and kept in a water bath for 5 min at 60°C. After boil lysis， the suspension was allowed to cool and 10 ul of 100 ug/ml proteinase K was added and incubated at 56°C for 1 h. After protein lysis， equal volumes of phenol (approximately 500 pl) was added and centrifuged at 12000rpm for 5 min at 4C conditions. The supernatant was collected in a fresh eppendorf tube and 200 ul of chloroform： Isoamyl alcohol(24：1， v/v)， 200 pl of phenol was added and mixed thoroughly by inverting the tubes. Tubes were then centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 5min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected in a fresh tube and phenol， chloroform； isoamyl alcohol step was repeated 3 times. Collected supernatants were pooled together and equal volumes of chloroform were added and subjected to centrifugation at 12，000 rpm for 5 min at4C. Supernatants thus collected were treated with 500 ul of ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol and incubated at -80°C for 30 min. After DNA precipitation the tubes were subjected to centrifugation at 12，000 rpm for 10 min at 4C. The DNA pellets were washed two times with 70%ethanol (v/v) and dried in a vacuum chamber. Resultant DNA was resuspended in 50 ul of Tris-EDTA and stored at -20°C until further iise|删除段之间换行|Screening of aflatoxin positive fungal isolates by gene-specific PCR： Gene-specific PCR targeting two genes of the metabolic pathway encoding toxin chemotypes viz.，nor-1 and aflR for aflatoxin production in fungal isolates were conducted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.

The samples size of 50 gm for solid samples (food) and 100 ml for samples in liquid state was used in the extraction procedure. Non fatty test samples such as wheat， maize， and sorghum were mixed with 100 ml of methanol： water(55：45， v/v) and for samples with fatty matrices and spices， like groundnuts， chili， pepper， and turmeric， 2 gm of NaCl and 50 ml of hexane were additionally added to the above mentioned solvent system. The samples were then blended in a blending jar at high speed for 5 min to 10 min and filtered through Whatman No.4 filter paper. The filtrate was mixed with equal volumes of chloroform and shaken vigorously for 1 min to 2 min and left undisturbed for separation. The lower phase was collected and evaporated to near dryness under a gentle stream of liquid nitrogen. The sample was then redissolved in 10 ml of methanol： Water (80：20， v/v). Further clean-up of the extracted toxin was preceded with specific immunoaffinity columns(LCTech， Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Elutions were collected in 2 ml methanol and stored at- 20°C until further use. Standard aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)， B2 (AFB2)， G1 (AFG1)， G2 (AFG2)， Citrinin (CIT)， Deoxynivalenol (DON)， Fumonisin B1 (FB1)， Ochratoxin A (OTA)， Patulin (PAT)， T2 toxin (T2) and Zearalenone (ZEA) (Sigma-Aldrich， USA) were prepared according to the supplier’s instructions.\n\n【32】Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)： Toxin extracts and aflatoxin standards (AFB1， B2， G1， and G2) of 10 ul each were spotted on thin-layer chromatography Silica gel 60 F254 plates (Merck， Darmstadt，\n\n【33】Germany) in dark conditions. The plates were developed in the mobile phase consisting of chloroform： acetone solution (85：15， v/v) for 60min and air-dried for 3 min to 5 min in dark conditions. The plates were then visualized under long wavelength Ultraviolet (UV) light(365 nm) for the presence of fluorescent spots viz.， blue color (AFB1and AFB2) and green color (AFG1 and AFG2). The Retardation Factor (Rf) values were calculated and compared to the Rf values of the aflatoxin standards. The solvent phase (chloroform： Acetone)and extracts from non-toxigenic isolates were used as the negative control in the experiment.\n\n【34】High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)：Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the aflatoxin extracted from fungal isolates and suspected food samples was carried out using HPLC analysis as per Priyanka et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， with minor modifications Toxin extracts and aflatoxin standards of 10 ul each were injected onto the RP-C18 column (Jasco， UK) with dimensions of 3 umx250mmx 46 mm. The analysis was performed on a JASCO HPLC system(JASCO， UK) with a fluorescence detector at wavelength settings of emission at 365 nm and excitation at 455 nm with a flow rate of 0.8ml/min and mobile phase consisting of water： Acetonitrile： Glacial acetic acid (52：47：1，v/v/v). For other mycotoxins (OTA，DON， and ZEA) emission wavelengths were set at 365，336 and 262 nm at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) was analyzed using a UV detector with an excitation wavelength of 455 nm and a flow rate of0.8 ml/min. The solvent system consisted of methanol： Acetonitrile：Acetic acid (50：40：10 v/v)， methanol： Water (70：30 v/v)， methanol：Water (80：20 v/v)， acetonitrile： Water (40：60) for OTA， FB1，DON， and ZEA respectively.\n\n【35】Result and Discussion Isolation of Aspergillus species from diverse sources\n\n【36】A total of 220 fungal cultures were isolated from the collected food and agricultural samples suspected for fungal infestation. These isolates were screened for the presence of aflatoxin producers by phenotypic characters， chromatography and molecular methods. The Figure 2 depicts the morphological and biochemical tests performed on the fungal isolates in the present study. As a preliminary step in screening， macro and micro-morphological features were observed and 196 isolates were screened with characteristics morphologies of Aspergillus strains. The presumptive Aspergillus isolates were then screened for aflatoxin production by ammonium vapors test and UV light test . A total of 188 isolates developed pink color pigmentation upon contact with ammonium vapors and characteristic blue fluorescence under long wavelength (365 nm) of UV light. For further confirmation and identification； tests such as molecular methods (gene-specific PCR， ITS sequencing) and chromatography(TLC and HPLC) were performed for the fungal isolates.\n\n【37】Identification of aflatoxigenic Aspergillus species\n\n【38】The suspected fungal isolates were subjected to genomic DNA\n\n【39】Table 3： List of aflatoxin producing isolates obtained in the present study.\n\n【40】amplicon size against 100 bps DNA ladder.\n\n| Species name  | ITS  | TLC  | HPLC  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| A. iavus  | 80  |  |  |\n| A. fumigatus  | 13  | 1  | 一  |\n| A. niger  | 4  | 1  | 一  |\n| A. oryzae  | 4  | 门  |  |\n| A. ochraceus  | 10  | 门  | 一  |\n| A. parasiticus  | 55  | 52  | 52  |\n| A. tamarn  | 6  | 门  |  |\n| A. versicolor  | 5  | 0  | 一  |\n| Total  | 177  | 131  | 129  |\n\n【42】extraction by phenol， chloroform， isoamyl alcohol method.

Gene-specific PCR amplification of nor-1 and aftR-1 was carried out with the respective primers mentioned in the Table删除4:<u> 2</u>. Amplicons of 367 bps and 400bps were considered positive for the presence of nor-1  and aflR-1  genes respectively. A total of 178 isolates from 188were found positive for the presence of one or both the genes (nor-1，170 isolates； aflR， 168 isolates).\n\nFungal isolates positive for aflatoxin encoding genes were|删除段之间换行|subjected to sequencing for the identification of Aspergillus species. Sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was performed by amplification of the region by IT'S1 and ITS4 primers  with standardized PCR program.

The toxin extracts from the isolates were spotted on silica gel plates and tested by TLC method. When visualized under UV light， the spots on the silica gel plates emitted blue and green fluorescence indicating the presence of Aflatoxin B1， B2， and Aflatoxin G1， G2 respectively . The Rf values of the test toxins were compared to that of the standard aflatoxin values and observations were drawn.

Isolates were further screened by biochemical， molecular methods and identified by ITS sequencing. HPLC analysis revealed129 isolates for aflatoxin production (77 of A. flavus and 52 of A. prasiticus). From our observation， it is recommended to carryout routine analysis of grains， food and feed in order to limit aflatoxin contamination in food chain. Management strategies should therefore be oriented to avoid fungal colonization during the crops and storage areas to avoid production of mycotoxins.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It presents in two distinct forms， Ulcerative Colitis (UC)and Crohn's Disease (CD). This case study focuses on a 28-year-old female patient who experienced symptoms such as diarrhea， abdominal pain， and rectal bleeding during her pregnancy. Subsequently， she was diagnosed with UC along with Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA). It is crucial to closely monitor patients with UC for potential complications like AIHA. Further research is necessary to enhance our understanding of this rare complication and develop more effective treatments for affected patients.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)， is a chronic， incurable， relapsing disease of unknown etiology. IBD has two distinct forms； Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn’s Disease (CD). In 2017it was estimated that around 1.5 million people in the United States and 2.5 in Europe suffer from IBD. This chronic disease causes substantial costs for health care and substantial impact on different aspects of patient's life， including career aspirations， installing social stigma and impairing quality oflife. Reports showed a lot of variation in incidence and prevalence of the disease between different geographic areas and different ethnic groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Some call for a systemic approach when dealing with this disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， as manifestation of this disease may be found in any organ system out of the GI tract， with a huge burden on the patient's quality of life. The disease manifestation commonly affects the joints， the skin， the hepatobiliary tract， less commonly the vascular system.\n\n【5】These manifestations are thought to be due to the same immunological process but outside the gastrointestinal system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although some of them may run parallel to the intestinal disease activity and some may not 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Anemia is common among patients with both types of IBD， with reports showing prevalence ranging from 6% to 74%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-11\\]</u>.\n\n【7】There several causes of anemia in patient with IBS， with iron deficiency anemia as the most frequent， other causes include folate and vitamin B12 deficiency which appears significantly more prevalent in patient with IBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Another less frequent cause of anemia is the autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n\n【8】Several reports investigated the prevalence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in patient with ulcerative colitis， with some report's prevalence of 0.6% to 1.7% which is higher than what is reported in Crohn's disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，13\\]</u>.\n\n【9】IBD may cause several complications， such as VTE， with a recent meta-analysis shows it carries2-fold the risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) than general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， with several possible contributing factors such as the effect of local and systemic inflammation with the resulting IL-6 medicatedprocoagulant state， dehydration and corticosteroid use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. Another contributing factor to the increased risk of VTE in patients with IBD is AIHA， which was investigated in a recent study and showed a 3-fold increase in the risk of VTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\ncited. In this case report we report a female patient with acute severe ulcerative colitis， Coombs|删除段之间换行|positive hemolytic anemia and splenic infarction.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 23-year-old female patient presented to the emergency room on February 15h， 2023 with abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. She had a normal vaginal delivery three weeks prior and had been complaining of abdominal pain，perianal pain， fever， and non-bloody diarrhea two weeks prior which progressed to become bloody. She was admitted into a regional hospital and treated with metronidazole； however， her condition did not improve and her hemoglobin dropped，leading to referral as a suspected case of ulcerative colitis.\n\n【13】Upon presentation her vital signs were as follows： BP 100/62mmHg， temperature 36.9°C， heart rate 85 bpm， respiratory rate 18breaths per min， and oxygen saturation 95% on room air.\n\n【14】Laboratory tests revealed Leukocytosis (18.9×10/L) which were mainly neutrophils (neutrophils 78%)， low Hemoglobin level (5 mg/dL)， with a mean cell volume at the upper limit of normal (MCV95 fL)， thrombocytosis (769×10/L)， low albumin level (1.8 g/dL)， increased Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH 512 U/L)， low haptoglobin(10 mg/dL)， high reticulocyte count (12%)， ferritin was increased(11173 ng/mL)， with increased inflammatory markers (CRP 25mg/L， ESR 88 mm/h). Stool analysis revealed the presence of many red blood cells and white blood cells as well as Entamoeba spp. cysts and trophozoites； with significantly elevated fecal calprotectin (>1000ug/mg). Stool was tested positive for Glutamate Dehydrogenase(GDH)， and further testing revealed positive Clostridium dificile toxin A&B. Further laboratory workup revealed positive direct and indirect antiglobulin tests (Coombs)， positive Antinucear (ANA) autoantibodies in high titers (1/160， negative anti-double stranded DNA antibodies， normal levels of C3 and C4 complements.\n\n【15】Other tests including Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)， Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)， Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alanine Transaminase (ALT) total serum bilirubin and direct serum bilirubin， International Normalized Ratio (INR)， Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)， Creatinine， Serum sodium， serum potassium， correct serum calcium， were all within the normal limit.\n\n【16】A peripheral blood smear showed nucleated red blood cells， with no schistocytes. The patient was seen by the hematology team and was diagnosed with Coombs Positive Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia(AIHA) .\n\n【17】CT-scan of the abdomen was done and revealed diffuse colonic wall thickening with surrounding fat stranding.Ahepatosplenomegaly was also noted with two wedges shaped hypodensities seen in the spleen suggestive of infarction .\n\n【18】Upon admission flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed， which revealed hyperemic congested mucosa which bleeds with water irrigation， with diffuse small ulcerations. Biopsies were taken .\n\n【19】The patient was given methylprednisolone 100 mg/day for AIHA and suspected acute severe colitis. Antibiotics therapy were initiated for amebiasis (Metronidazole 500 mg three times daily) and Clostridium difficile infection (Vancomycin 125 mg orally four times daily). Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin (LMWH) was given for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis (enoxaparin 40mg subcutaneously once daily). And Intravenous (IV) fluid (normal saline 0.9%) was given at a rate of 70 cc/h.\n\nPretransfusion compatibility testing showed incompatible blood， for which the patient was given the least incompatible two units of packed RBCs. During hospitalization the patient was doing well， with|删除段之间换行|regular surgical follow up and three to five bowel motions per day， her vital signs were all normal，her CRP was going down and her hemoglobin level was stable， until the fifth day of admission， when the patient bowel motion increased up to 8 times， her CRP level increased to 50 mg/dl and her hemoglobin level dropped to 6.5 mg/dl (for which she was given two units of blood). At that time patient was still on methylprednisolone 100 mg/day， vancomycin and metronidazole. In the sixth day ofadmission the pathology report came out， showing cryptitis， crypt abscess and crypt architecture distortion， which was highly suggestive of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) .\n\n【21】Due to her deteriorating condition infliximab was given at a dose of 300 mg. in the next day the CMV stain came positive for CMV， so the patient was given ganciclovir.\n\n【22】On the 3m day the infliximab patient was improving， her fever did not recur， her CRP dropped down， her bowel motion decreased to about 3 times a day with intermittent streaks of blood. Intravenous methylprednisolone was shifted to oral prednisolone 40 mg once daily and the patient was discharged home.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a chronic Inflammatory Bowel Disease(IBD) that affects the colon and rectum. It is characterized by inflammation， ulceration， and bleeding of the intestinal lining 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) is a rare complication of UC that occurs when the immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells. This case study discusses a patient who was diagnosed with UC complicated b AIHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The first case of UC with AIHA was reported in 1955 by Lorber et al. who reported four cases of female patients with ulcerative colitis and AIHA. The four cases were diagnosed during flare up of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The exact mechanism behind the development of AIHA in patients with UC is not fully understood. However， it was believed that the development of AIHA in these patients may be attributed to autoimmunity and the cross-reactivity between antibodies produced against substances absorbed by the diseased colon and antigens present on the surface of red blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The patient in this case study was a 28-year-old female who developed symptoms of UC during her pregnancy. She experienced diarrhea， abdominal pain， and rectal bleeding， which are common symptoms ofUC. After delivering her baby，her symptoms worsened， and she was diagnosed with AIHA. In a study on 8patients with AIHA with UC done by Gumaste et al. autoimmune hemolytic anemia was diagnosed after a mean of 10 years after the diagnosis of colitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> although in our case AIHA was diagnosed at the time of the ulcerative colitis diagnosis.\n\n【27】There is no significant sex-based difference in the incidence of AIHA with UC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The prevalence of AIHA in IBD is higher than non-IBD without difference between UC and Crohn's group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. There is evidence to suggest that AIHA may be related to flare-ups of IBD， as some patients experience remission of AIHA after treatment for IBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In Lorber et al. study all patients were having relapses at the time of diagnosis therefore AIHA considered as an extraintestinal manifestation of IBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【28】It is widely accepted that corticosteroids aretheprimarytreatment for warm antibody type AIHA， despite the lack of concrete evidence. Corticosteroids are expected to vield a response in 70% to 85% of patients， but only one-third of cases remain in long-term remission after discontinuing the drug. Half of the remaining patients require maintenance doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Infliximab is a type of monoclonal antibody that targets TNF-a， a protein involved in inflammation. It is made up of a combination of mouse and human proteins， with the mouse portion binding to TNF-a and the human portion providing stability. Infliximab can bind to both soluble and membrane-bound forms of TNF-a with high affinity， effectively blocking its activity. It has a long half-life in the bloodstream and is typically administered intravenously at doses of 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【30】In case of IBD flare， AIHA is thought to be a reactive type of Extraintestinal Manifestations (EMS). This particular group of EMS typically occurs concurrently with a flare-up ofUC and can usually be treated by effectively managing the bowel disease. Infliximab has been found to be an effective therapeutic option for steroid-refractory UC， resulting in complete remission. Therefore， successful management of the bowel disease， as evidenced by mucosal healing， was the primary factor in resolving the clinical symptoms of AIHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Our patient was given intravenous corticosteroid for several days but showed no response， so we used infliximab as rescue therapy after which significant improvement was noted.\n\n【31】Otherlines would have been considered in thetreatment of AIHA ifthe IBD treatment did not resolve the AHIA， like Rituximab， which is considered the second line in isolated AIHA \\[26 . Such treatment was deferred as literature showed no benefit of such treatment on IBD flare删除4-1:<u>27</u>.\n\n【32】Although several reports mentioned the association of IBD(especially ulcerative colitis) and the AIHA， Further research is needed to better understand their relationship and to develop more effective treatments for this rare complication. Additionally， studies exploring potential biomarkers for predicting the development of AIHA in patients with UC could help identify high-risk patients early on and improve outcomes.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】This case study highlights the importance of monitoring patients with UC for potential complications such as AIHA. Further research is needed to better understand this rare complication and develop more effective treatments for affected patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Three hospital sites were chosen， of which only one currently screens women for psychosocial risk factors. Thematic analysis was applied to interview transcripts. Three researchers then discussed reoccurring themes and a consensus in themes and subthemes was reached.\n\n【4】Results： Only one hospital was screening women and had midwives trained in psychosocial assessment including depression screening.

Benefits were recognized： early identification of difficulties， standardization and patient-focused care. Concerns were，however， also evident： suicide ideation， intrusiveness of questions， whether women responded honestly， not wanting to screen all women.\n\n【5】Conclusion： There was an identified concern by midwives that obstetricians did not take seriously any concerns highlighted by the midwife about women’s psychosocial problems. There was a sense of a lack of ownership'of the women， therefore a feeling of helplessness in addressing their needs.

As the researchers conducted the interviews， they kept field notes that were used to contextualize the data and contributed to the commencement of data analysis.\n\n【11】Results\n\n【12】Group 1： Booking-in midwives\n\n【13】The midwife includes the psychosocial assessment as part of her usual antenatal clinical interview. Her role is to assess all women at booking-in for psychosocial risk factors and offer referral as needed. The booking-in visit is conducted in a private room with the woman， her partner and midwife present. The partner could be asked by the midwife to leave the room to ensure privacy.\n\n【14】Only those midwives who had attended the Perinatal Mental Health Assessment (Introductory Training) could participate in the study， enroll women to the study， gain their consent and conduct the screening using the Clinical Care Guideline package. During the booking-in visit， women who had consented to be part of the study were asked a series of psychological questions and also given an Edinburgh Perinatal Depression Scale to complete 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【15】It is generally accepted that， in an English-speaking population， an EPDS score of 10-12 suggests the respondent may meet criteria for minor depression； a score 13-18 suggests she would probably meet criteria for depressive illness： 19-30 indicates a higher degree of distress and complexity， possibly including depressive illness， but also including other factors， such as a positive score on question 10(self-harm). Women are offered follow-up according to established referral pathways.\n\n【16】Group 2： Obstetricians and other health professionals\n\n【17】Health professionals (obstetricians， midwives， general practitioners， social workers， psychologists， early childhood nurses) involved in delivering care to study participants as above were asked to contribute their views on the effectiveness/suitability of the clinical care guideline package following implementation， using semi-structured interviews.\n\n【18】Midwives and obstetricians were then interviewed in focus groups or individually to ascertain the appropriateness of the psychosocial screening questions， as well as any concerns， suggestions and other issiles.\n\n【19】Group 3： Private hospital midwives\n\n【20】Interviews were commenced with midwives working at other private hospitals (in addition to the primary study site) to ascertain their views on the effectiveness/suitability of antenatal psychosocial questioning. Early detection and appropriate referral are the main aims of data collection， with a view to establishing Commercial-in-Confidenceevidence for implementing routine， universalscreening in this setting. Midwives at each facility (as well as those at the study site) were invited to share their experiences of the antenatal psychosocial and depression screening of women through voluntary participation in semi-structured qualitative interviews .\n\n【21】Them es\n\n【22】Benefits of psychosocial screening\n\n【23】We need to know： A dominant theme among all midwives consenting to interview was related to the benefits of screening women for psychosocial issues. The midwives indicated that this type of information was not only helpful but necessary for them to give the best possible care to women.\n\nMidwives spoke of the “need to know” to be able to provide a comprehensive service and holistic care to women. They felt the experience of questioning women offered the opportunity to ask|删除段之间换行|questions， to debrief and provide tailored care.\n\n【25】For example， midwives spoke of answers to the psychosocial questions giving them a “heads up”(M1) or\"flags going up\"(M2) or“opening things up”for further discussion.\n\n【26】Midwives comments； “We get the heads up that there are issues”“It is invaluable”. We can put supports in place for women， it opens things up\". It allows us to look for issues and explore them with the women\"(midwife 1).\n\n【27】Yes， apart from looking after the body， we are looking after the spirit and mind as well. These women are not stupid： mostly career women (midwife 2). Yes，\"If you don’t ask， you won’t know\"(midwife3).\n\n【28】Consistency： Another major sub-theme within the benefits of screening concerned the consistency of approach in asking the questions. For example， “We can display empathy for the women if we are aware of their issues\". The benefit of a consistent approach rather than self-selecting who to interview was evident， “Women are consistently asked the questions， all on the same page. It gives them the opportunity to disclose\"(midwife 5).\n\n【29】“It is less threatening if it is standardized\n\n【30】“It helps us tailor the care to meet their needs”\n\n【31】Risks of not screening： Midwives were asked directly about the benefits and risks of not screening. Midwives indicated that the benefits outweighed the risks. For example： Yes， “There are no risks， only benefits， if we don’t ask and they have a history of self harmits our duty\". (Midwife 1) and， “No benefits in NOT asking them. If we don’t we miss someone at risk\" (midwife 3). Although there was an expressed sensitivity around asking the screening questions，“However， they may be uncomfortable being asked these questions\".“If we don’t ask， we won’t know， for example-DV. We can plead ignorance if we don’t ask， as we are not aware\" (midwife 4) “I’m in two minds， as some women want to disclose and others dont. I think that they should given a choice/elect to answer the questions\".“The risk of not asking them is that they will get no help， may have prolonged PND or suicide\"(midwife 5).\n\n【32】Barriers to screening\n\n【33】No training/experience in how to screen： Midwives identified a lack of training and experience in how to screen women. Only one of the three sites had received any training in psychosocial screening. For example， “Staff feeling uncomfortable and being inexperienced. There is no antenatal clinic. No staff with mental health training. An antenatal clinic would allow rapport building. Also， the husbands are present”(Midwife 3). Some midwives noted that they needed to screen regardless of their lack of training and therefore relied on experience or a “gut feeling. “We have to rely on our experience to detect issues”.“But some of the midwives don't have the experience to do this”.\n\n【34】“I think that the postnatal midwives needtraining， they administer an EPDS but often don't know how to score it or what is considered high risk and when to refer\".\n\n【35】The husband： Some midwives highlighted the issue of the husband being present. Some husbands stayed in the room to interpret for the woman or were not asked to leave by the midwife.“The problem is that often the husbands come and we don't ask them to leave， that’s the way we have always done it； the booking in. “We\n\n| Table 1： Themes.  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Theme  | Subtheme  | Quotes  |\n| Benefits of psychosocial screening  | We need to know  | \"We would know where they are at， so that we can help them\".

There was a concern expressed by midwives that they often could not speak to the women on their own as the husbands refused to leave when the woman was being interviewed.\n\n【38】The obstetrician：Attimes，the obstetrician was viewed as abarrier by the midwives in their attitudes. For example， “The obstetricians， they are often defensive\"， “the obstetricians， they have a sense of ownership of the women\". There was also a concern that when the midwife did in fact high light a woman’s psychosocial issues to the obstetrician that it was not taken seriously.“Sometimes they fob vou off when you identify an issue and alert them- the obstetricians\"，“We are often left in the dark about a woman’s problems\"， “We rely on the obstetricians to document but they often write nothing.\n\n【39】Other themes\n\n【40】They lie/fear： There was a reported concern by midwives that women were not honest with the results of questioning. For example， However， some women lie， they will talk if they want help，“The women can lie and not admit that they have problems”(midwife1). Woman may also fear any potential consequences of disclosing issues，“Some women don’t want to know about community services as there is a fear attached，i.e.，DOCS (FACS)”，“They hide their issues， some come here to hide from DOCS， they come under a false name and don’t want to go to the public system because of DOCS”. This is referring to FACS-Family and community services who have to capacity to remove the baby from the mother).\n\n【41】They don’t want to disclose- the women， they are high powered38 to 40 year old women that often run big businesses/are high flyers and are used to being in control\".\n\nMidwife barriers： Some midwives expressed concern about the psychosocial questions. “Some questions are a bit odd： that is|删除段之间换行|awkward'(Midwife 2). There was also concern about discomfort in asking the questions or receiving uncomfortable answers， difficult responses include： mother passed away； patient estranged from family； half a dozen said abused as a child； someone with trauma in first delivery so has come to private hospital this time； infertility； lack of support. Interestingly some midwives indicated that they could either determine which women warranted asking the psychosocial questions， or that women should indicate that they wanted to be screened. “I don’t think that we should screen all women， the odd one may say that they wanted to be asked the questions”.\n\n【43】A social worker expressed concerns with the booking-in process at a hospital.“Certain midwives are more receptive to assisting women than others. Most women here dont seem to disclose at booking in. I get the majority of referrals postnatally when they stay for 3-4 days and a more attuned midwife picks up that there might be a problem. Things need to change here”(SW). The answer-“Change the booking in midwife and educate the midwives.\n\n【44】Lack of awareness： Another sub-theme indicated a concern that women were neither attuned to the psychosocial questions nor understood their relevance， “They are often unaware of the connection between their past history and their present status/effect\".\n\n【45】Language can be a barrier， e.g.， some Asian women： a few women are very business-like (midwife 2).\n\n【46】Lack of time： Time was seen as an additional pressure in psychosocial screening. “It takes a long time to screen the women”(midwife 1). “They book in online” “The pressure on staff， time”(midwife 5).\n\n【47】Enough supports\n\nA subtheme emerged around a lack of resources and supports for women once positively screened. “We don’t have a social worker； we don’t have enough supports for the women\". When asked|删除段之间换行|whether there was enough support for women one midwife replied，“Sometimes you need to call the obstetrician several times before something is done to help the women， but you just need to keep onto them， the obstetricians.\n\n【49】General comments\n\n【50】“The psychiatrist may retire soon and I don’t know if she will be replaced”(midwife 4).\n\n【51】We only have 1 useless psychiatrist and 1 social worker； they help a bit at least(midwife 3).\n\n【52】\"We need better follow-up”\n\n【53】“We can’t refer； we just let the obstetrician know”\n\n【54】“We do follow-up with the child and family health nurse and flag women if we are concerned”\n\n【55】Further suggestions about the psychosocial screening process/procedure?\n\n【56】As mentioned by the NUM， it would be good to talk to the women more postnatally， including debriefing (midwife 2).\n\n【57】“Ongoing support/training so that staff can repeat the EPDS\". We need an update(midwife 3).\n\n【58】“More access to public health services would be helpful”(midwife4).\n\n【59】“Sometimes the fathers look depressed； I suppose we could also give them an EPDS?”\n\n【60】“I think that we could re-administer the EPDS during antenatal classes at 32/40 approx， as often concerns come up in the classes. These concerns may not have been there at 12-20 weeks when we book them in”.\n\n【61】“Our midwives are older here and attuned to women's needs due to their life experience， they have been there， done that， had their families”However， the postnatal midwives would not know how to score； use or flag an EPDS score so need training”.\n\n【62】“If we are concerned postnatally we often ask the husband what the woman is normally like”\n\n【63】“We need a social worker， just for this unit\n\n【64】“We need a community link for the women”\n\n【65】“We need to be clear of the referral pathways to help a woman， instead of feeling lost\".\n\n“The antenatal classes may be an opportunity to educate the women about psychosocial issues， however， we have such a poor|删除段之间换行|attendance at these classes， as women view them as only for a woman wanting/booking in for a natural birth， not a C/S. Midwives in the obstetricians’ rooms could screen/support the women also. The women need to book in earlier and if they are identified as at risk we could see them again\"(Midwife 3).\n\n【67】Discussion\n\n【68】At the time of the study， only one other private hospital in Sydney was screening women and their midwives were trained in psychosocial assessment. There were mixed views on psychosocial screening and barriers to screening were identified. Benefits were also identified：early identification of problems， standardization and patient-focused care. However， midwives also expressed concerns： suicide ideation， intrusiveness of questions， “some women lie\"， not wanting to screen all women， lack of support systems， cultural barriers， and inaccurate answers， power barriers with obstetricians， husband interference， fear and powerlessness. Relevant suggestions were made： appropriate and adequate education， training and support of midwives； flagging high risk women； more in-house resources and external resources community links， and employing a central midwife with interest and expertise in psychosocial assessment and screening. Midwives had various views on the program. Some felt that it was within their work role， others did not. Some were fearful of what could be revealed by the woman and how to deal with it. There was an identified concern that obstetricians did not take seriously any concerns highlighted by the midwife about a woman's psychosocial difficulties. There was a sense of a lack of ownership’of the women， therefore a feeling of helplessness in addressing their needs. Some midwives indicated an interest in a woman's perinatal mental health/psychosocial risk factors；however others expressed a concern that this was not part of their role. This highlights the need to educate and support midwives working in the private sector on their important role in enhancing the perinatal mental health of women in their care. Their role includes potential for prevention， early intervention and health promotion to benefit not only the woman but her child， partner and family.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In addition， there was a rule that LD should be defined after 15mins'repetition， thus， it was clarified that LD is ominous not due to its late appearance after uterine contraction， but due to its frequent repetition， which was the same in the other FHR decelerations， thus， novel Hypoxia Index (HI) was the sum of all FHR deceleration durations (min). That showed the total duration of hypoxia as the heart rate was closely parallel to the PaO， lower than 50 mmHg in rabbit divided by the lowest FHR， which showed the hypoxic intensity， in fetal monitoring， and multiplied by 100 to make the index integer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The first target of the Hypoxia Index (HI) was the prevention of infantile cerebral palsy， where the HI was studied retrospectively in 22 infants who diagnosed by pediatric doctors， and intrapartum FHR record was preserved in obstetrics， of which HI was calculated.\n\n【18】Results： There was significant difference of cerebral palsy case numbers between 6 cases， whose HI was 25 or more， and 16 no cerebral palsy cases， whose HI was 24 or less 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Discussion 1： The HI of all 6 cases of cerebral palsy was 25 or more， while the HI of all 16 cases of no cerebral palsy was 24 or less. Thus， infantile cerebral palsy caused by intrapartum damage is prevented when HI is 24 or less in fetal monitoring. The HI is adopted all FHR decelerations including early， late and variable decelerations， as no lag time is included in the HI calculation， as well as sudden continuous fetal bradycardia. HI was evaluated in intrapartum FHR records of6 cases of cerebral palsy and 16 infants of no cerebral palsy， who were diagnosed by Pediatricians.\n\n【20】Discussion 2： Cerebral palsy will be prevented， if the HI is 24 or less in intrapartum fetal monitoring. The 25 or more HI cases can receive very earlytherapy for the treatment of cerebral palsy in neonatal stage， which will improve the therapeutic results of cerebral palsy. As late deceleration disappeared by maternal lateral posture， lateral posture is recommended in all of decelerations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The pattern classification method will be replaced by the objective numeric indices， where neonatal Apgar score and umbilical cord blood pH will be predicted by FHR score and also from the HI using regression equations， and reported attendant doctor in computerized FHR diagnosis. As the fetal blood pH is predicted also by the deceleration area by Cahill et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， fetal evaluation will be revolutionary changed to digital analysis.\n\n【21】Conclusion： All FHR decelerations are evaluated with HI. Cerebral palsy is prevented， if the HI is 24 or less in the birth. Early cerebral palsy treatment can be started in neonatal stage. Lateral posture is recommended in all decelerations.\n\n【22】Table 1： Hypoxia Index (HI) was 25 or more in all of 6 cerebral palsy cases， while HI was 24 or less in all of 16 no cerebral palsy cases.\n\n| Hypoxia Index  | Cerebral palsy cases  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hypoxia Index  | Yes  | No  |\n| 25 or more  | 6  | 0  |\n| 24 orless  | 0  | 16  |\n\n【24】Cerebral palsy cases'y2test： P=0.0008<0.05， significant difference", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Due to the latest evidences， endometrial cancer molecular characterization results crucial for proper risk stratification.\n\n【2】A young woman with G1 endometrioid endometrial cancer diagnosed by hysteroscopy was treated conservatively. After cancer persistence， she underwent radical surgery for advanced disease. Post-hoc immunohistochemical analysis was performed comparing the first-diagnosis biopsy (mismatch repair deficiency) to surgical specimen (mismatch repair proficiency). Interestingly， not only the cancer changed biochemically， but it also shifted from a confined tumor to an advanced disease with bulky lymph nodes and negative endometrial infiltration. Eventually， the patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.\n\n【3】A wiser evaluation of the mismatch repair deficiency should have guided to the proper therapeutic algorithm， also suggesting genetic tests. This case report represents an encouragement to further investigations on molecular assessment as a predictor for endometrial cancer risk stratification in conservative management.\n\n【4】Keywords： Cancer； Endometrium； Fertility； Genital Neoplasms； Immunohistochemistry\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Endometrial Cancer (EC) is the fourth most diffuse malignancy in developed countries， also representing the most common gynecological cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In about 80% of cases， EC is diagnosed when the disease is still confined to the uterus. Though total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is considered the standard treatment， a conservative management， consisting in oral or intra-uterine progesterone with or without hysteroscopic endometrial resection and follow-up biopsies every 3 to 6 months， is recommended in women desiring off spring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Although considered a safe approach， a subgroup of patients shows no cancer regression， recurrence or progression to more advanced stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. For this reason， the study of new molecular markers able to predict response to conservative treatment is extremely important. Only a few small-population studies investigated the role of Mismatch Repair status (MMR) as a promising predictor marker for conservative treatment outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. In this case report， we aim to bring to attention the peculiar clinical history of a young woman diagnosed with Mismatch Repair deficiency (MMR-d) EC on hysteroscopic biopsy， treated conservatively， with a atypical disease persistence： Complete local response with spreading of cancer to pelvic and aortic Lymph Nodes (LNs)， with concurrent molecular switch into MMR-proficient immunophenotype.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Medical history\n\n【9】A 37-year-old woman in good clinical conditions is referred to our attention. In her history no comorbidities or previous surgeries were reported. Family history was significant for colon cancer. The patient was nulliparous， with strong desire for offspring. In March 2017 she was diagnosed with endometrial polyposis through ultrasound， for which she underwent operative hysteroscopy in April 2017 in another hospital， with positivity for complex atypical Endometrial Hyperplasia (EAH). Histological samples from polypectomy were revised from our pathologists\n\n【10】Table 1： Results from IHC analysis： Comparison between endometrial biopsy 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u> and surgical specimen 通用删除7(英):<u>(2021)</u>.\n\n【11】Endometrial biopsy (September 2017) Surgery (February 2021)\n\n|  | Endometrial biopsy (September 2017)  |  | Surgery (February 2021)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Diagnosis  | EAH (resected polyp)  | G1 eEC (endometrial sampling)  | eEC cells in metastatic LNs  |\n| MMR status  | MSH2-，MSH6+， MLH1+， PMS2+(MMR deficiency)  | MSH2-， MSH6-， MLH1+， PMS2+(MMR deficiency)  | MSH2+， MSH6+，MLH1+， PMS2+(MMRproficiency)  |\n| ER  | 1+，60%  | 1+，10%  | 1+；5%  |\n| PR  | 3+，85%  | 3+，40%  | 1+；1%  |\n| P53  | missing data  | missing data  | wild type  |\n\nEAH： Endometrial Atypical Hyperplasia； G1 Well-Differentiated；eEC： endometrioid Endometrial Cancer；LNs： Lymph Nodes|删除段之间换行|with expertise in gynecology oncology， with diagnosis of EAH， with focal transformation into G1 (well differentiated) endometrioid EC(eEC). On MRI a 6 mm x 15 mm polypoid-like formation without evidence of myometrial infiltration was identified. The patient underwent polypectomy and endometrial biopsy in our hospital in September删除4:<u> 2017</u>. The polyp was positive for EAH and the endometrial biopsy was diagnostic for G1 eEC. The patient was prescribed Medroxyprogesterone acetate and a three-monthly follow-up plan with pelvic transvaginal ultrasound and scheduled hysteroscopies was programmed. In September 2018 endometrial biopsy resulted in EAH. This finding was confirmed in the following endometrial sampling in January删除4:<u> 2019</u>. The patient was advised to continue Medroxyprogesterone acetate and an intrauterine progesterone-medicated device (IUD) were positioned. In May 2020， the follow-up biopsy was diagnostic for G1 eEC. At ultrasound， an 11 mm x9 mm x 11 mm hyperechogenic endometrial tissue at the uterine fundus and a minimal irregularity of the endometrial-myometrial margin at the anterior uterine wall were identified. Nevertheless， an additional endometrial biopsy in September 2020 was negative. The following histological examination in December 2020 confirmed a G1 eEC.\n\n【14】Transvaginal ultrasound (December 2020)\n\nEndometrium was 5 mm thick and the medicated-IUD properly positioned. Ovaries appeared normal and no endopelvic effusions or dilatation of the renal pelvis were visible. At the aortic bifurcation，on the right， a hypoechogenic， inhomogeneous， a vascular formation of|删除段之间换行|12 mm x7 mm with regular margins was identified. Other formations with the same ultrasonographic features were visible at the left external iliac vessels (16 mmx13mm)and at the left external iliac vessels (16mmx10 mm and 9 mmx10 mm). The abovementioned lesions were to be referred in the first hypothesis to lymphadenopathies.\n\n【16】Chest-abdomen-pelvis TC scan with intravenous contrast(January 2021)\n\n【17】A 1.5 cm solid nodule suspected for lymphadenopathy was detected at the right iliac bifurcation. Along the internal iliac vessels， solid and uneven bilateral formations of 2.5 cm， suspected for pathological LNs， were identified. Non-confluent LNs of up to 1 cm was observed in the inguinal-femoral region bilaterally.\n\n【18】Oncofertility counseling\n\n【19】The patient was counseled on the clinical indication of a radical surgery. Once informed， the patient voluntarily chose to keep both ovaries.\n\n【20】Surgery (February 2021)\n\nThe patient underwent laparoscopic Querleu-Morrow class a radical hysterectomy， bilateral salpingectomy， ovarian suspension， systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy and removal of intercavoaortic lymphadenomegaly. Before hysterectomy， a cervical injection of indocyanine green 1 cc per side was performed， for which no fluorescent sentinel LN was identified. Lymphadenomegalies of 3cm were identified in the external iliac and obturator region on the|删除段之间换行|right， and internal iliac area on the left. Hence， a bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. On examination of the para-aorto-caval region， a lymphadenomegaly of 2 cm was found at the interaortocaval level and removed. Ovaries were fixed to the psoas muscle fascia bilaterally. Surgery time was 158 min with minimal blood loss and no intraoperative complications. The postoperative stay was regular， with no complications， and the patient was discharged after three days.\n\n【22】Histological examination\n\n【23】Macroscopic， microscopic and Immunohistochemical Analysis(IHC) were performed.\n\n【24】Macroscopic and microscopic examination： The uterus was removedwithbothtubes. At theendometrialfundus， araised，necrotic hemorrhagic area of 1.5 cm was observed. Thrombized vascular structures and associated chronic inflammation with multinucleated foreign-body giant cells were recognized in its context. No residual tumor or endovascular neoplastic emboli were detected. The adjacent endometrium appeared atrophic with associated stromal pseudo-decidualization. The cervix was affected by chronic cervicitis with foci of superficial squamous and glandular metaplasia， with no evidence of neoplastic infiltration. Salpinges were negative. Out of 7 pelvic LNs removed， 2 were positive for EC metastases (1/5 at the right and 1/2 at the left). The bulky LN removed at the paraaortic region was positive for EC secondary disease.\n\n【25】Immunohistochemistry： We compareddIHC of thefirst endometrial biopsy performed in our center (September 2017) with IHC performed on the surgical specimen (February 2021).\n\n【26】Results from the comparison are shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. IHC staining pattern for the first biopsy (September 2017) are shown in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【27】Inguinal LNs examination\n\n【28】Due to the clinical and radiological suspicion on bilateral inguinal LNs， the patient underwent ultrasonographic-guided biopsy of one left inguinal LN localized at the 1st level of Daseler， which was the node with the most worrisome features (confluent with subverted ultrasonographic structure). Biopsy was negative for EC metastases. Nevertheless， in consideration of the highly suspected ultrasound characteristics， the patient was referred for nodal surgical staging in March 2021， during which a bulky left inguinal LN was removed and studied intraoperatively. Intraoperative analysis was negative for secondary EC disease； therefore a systematic aorticlymphadenectomy anda radicalization of the previous pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed for staging purposes. Eventually， at the definitive histological examination， over 6 aortic， 3 pelvic and 1 inguinal LNs removed， none was positive for EC metastases.\n\n【29】Genetic analysis\n\n【30】Considering the woman's family history， personal history and the aforementioned IHC features， the patient underwent germinal genetic test， which turned out to be diagnostic for Lynch syndrome.\n\n【31】Adjuvant treatment\n\n【32】In consideration of FIGO stage IIIC2， the patient was referred for adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\nIn this case report we describetheclinicalhistoryofa youngpatient with MMR-d EC conservatively treated， with disease progression duringhormonaltreatment. We comparedtheIHC features ofthe first|删除段之间换行|diagnosis biopsy with the ones on surgical specimen. Interestingly， we identified some relevant differences： on the 2017 endometrial biopsy， tumor cells exhibit MMR-d immunophenotype， whereas the 2021surgical specimen shows features of MMR-p immunophenotype. It is crucial to underline that not only the cancer has changed from a biochemical perspective， but it has also concurrently shifted from a macroscopically confined tumor (early stage) to an advanced disease with bulky aortic and pelvic LNs. Noteworthy， we observed a complete local response to treatment， with no evidence of tumor on uterine samples， with parallel spreading of EC to pelvic and aortic LNs. A post-hoc germinal genetic examination was performed and the patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome.\n\n【35】These data need to be reframed in perspective of the ProMisE classifier， which outlines four molecular groups of EC with different prognosis： 1) POLE-mutated (POLE-mt， goodl prognosis， very high mutational rate and mutations in the exonuclease domain of Polymerase-e)；2) Mismatch Repair-deficient (MMR-d， intermediate prognosis， high mutational rate and microsatellite-instability)； 3) p53-abnormal 通用删除11(英):<u>(p53-abn， poor prognosis， TP53 mutations， low mutational rate and high somatic copy number alterations rate)</u>；4) p53-wild-type 通用删除11(英):<u>(p53-wt， good-to-intermediate prognosis， low mutational and somatic copy number alterations rates)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. In their retrospective study， Chung et al. analyzed how mismatch repair status influences response to EC fertility-sparing treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Among 57 patients， 9 (15.8%) had MMR-d on endometrial biopsy obtained before progesterone treatment. Results show that patients with MMR-d had a significantly lower complete response rate than those with MMR-p/p53-wt in terms of best overall response (44.4%vs. 82.2%) and complete response rate at 6 months (11.1% vs. 53.3%)， concluding that molecular classification has a prognostic significance in EC fertility sparing management， thereby enabling early risk stratification. An Italian study by Falcone et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> investigated on the molecular features of 25 patients with EC conservatively treated通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， stating that ProMisE classifier application on resectoscopic specimens could be a pragmatic model for stratifying genetic risk of women with EC. Specifically， in the group of MMR-d conservatively-treated patients， for a 50% of women the presence of such mutations correlates withh；a worse outcome (persistence/progression or metachronous Lynch syndrome associated tumors). A retrospective Italian study of Raffone et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， investigated the association between MMR status and resistance rate to conservative treatment， recurrence rate and MMR-d reliability in predicting the risk of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Endometrial samples from 69 young women affected from AEH or mucosal-confined EC were collected before conservative approach and IHC features were examined. Results show that 8.7% of women was MMR-d. For this subset of patients， resistance to treatment was more common compared to p53-wt group (33.3% vs. 15.9%) with no statistical significance (p=0.2508) and recurrence after a complete regression occurred significantly more commonly than WOI p53-wt women (100% vs. 26.4%，p<0.0001). Moreover，MMR-d status was found to be a highly specific predictive marker for recurrence(sensitivity =22.2%， specificity =100%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. Moreover， Zakhour et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， observed that in young women with loss of MMR proteins by IHC there was a higher incidence of invasive cancer and a lower incidence of resolution with progestin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【36】According to the few available evidences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，10-12\\]</u>， MMR-d status seems to be related to lower response rate to treatment， higher risk of recurrence and worst prognosis compared to p53-wt. Considering this， we may deduce that a wiser evaluation of molecular the MMR-d\n\n【37】status should had guided to the proper therapeutic algorithm for the patient of this case report： The study of personal and family history with Lynch Syndrome blood test， a closer and more intensive follow-up program or a different surgical management.\n\n【38】This case-report spontaneously arisesquestions about the possibility to apply molecular classification in young EC patients management. The study of the role of MMR status by IHC may represent apotential stand-alone predictor marker for risk stratification in this subset of patients： EC offspring-desirers with MMR-d should be managed more intensively with the inclusion of II-level imaging in their follow-up schedule， contrariwise p53-wt women could be followed-up in accordance with current guidelines.\n\n【39】Further andlarger studies are needed for a deeper understanding of these phenomena and for a wiser application of its potential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

There are， however， scarce data on work disability rates in|删除段之间换行|patients with SLE from South America.\n\n【22】In this study， we pursue to determine the cumulative rate and the variables associated with work disability in the Province of Cordoba， Argentina.\n\n【23】Patients and Methods\n\n【24】This was a cross-sectional，multicenter study of patients with SLE in the Province of Cordoba，Argentina. All participating patients must meet the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> with no time limits in their disease duration. The Institutional Review Board of each participating center approved the study， and written informed consent was obtained from each subject according to the declaration of Helsinki and local regulations. Data were gathered through a patient interview and medical records review.\n\n【25】Variables\n\n【26】Work disability was defined by patients’ self-report of their inability to work because of their health status through the answer of four questions：\n\n【27】Were you employed with a paid job at diagnosis of Lupus?\n\n【28】Are you now employed with a paid job?\n\n【29】号 Is the Lupus the reason of your unemployment?\n\n【30】When did you stop working?\n\n【31】We also examinedvariables from the following domains：socioeconomic-demographic， clinical and1 patient self-reported health-related quality of life.\n\n【32】Variables from the socioeconomic-demographic domain were age at diagnosis， gender and socio-economic status ascertained with the Graffar scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Clinical variables included the number of the 1987 ACR criteria通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> both， at diagnosis and cumulative over time， disease duration， disease manifestations according to the 1987 ACR criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and disease activity assessed as per the SELENA-SLEDAI通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> at the patient enrollment.\n\n【34】The SELENA-SLEDAI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> is a cumulative and weighted index used to assess disease activity across 24 different disease descriptors in patients with SLE. The SELENA-SLEDAI is a validated tool for measuring disease activity in patients with SLE. This assessment can be completed to objectively assess the patient's current state of disease. All SLE-related descriptors (16 clinical manifestations and eightlaboratoryparameters) that are present at the time of the visit or within the previous 10 days are scored. Physicians also grade disease activity using a semi-quantitative scale where 0 is no disease activity and 3 represents severe disease activity.\n\n【35】Comorbidities were assessed as per the SLICC Damage Index and the Charlson Index. The Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) Damage Index (SDI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> documents cumulative and irreversible damage irrespective of its cause in 12 different organ systems. To be scored， each manifestation must be present for at least six months， unless otherwise noted in the instructions accompanying this instrument.\n\nThe Charlson's clinical comorbidity index 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> is a weighted index that takes into account the number and the seriousness of comorbid diseases including 19 categories. The components of the weighted|删除段之间换行|index are then computed giving a final count that ranges from zero to 37， zero accounting for no comorbidity and 37 for the sum of all possible comorbidities included in the index. In this study， we used a modified version， deleting the connective tissue disease category； therefore， diminishing the maximum possible value of the sum to 36.\n\n【37】Finally，self-reported quality of life was ascertained with the Lupus PRO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Lupus PRO is a disease-targeted，patient-reported outcome measure that was developed and validated in the United States of America among patients with SLE. Lupus PRO has two constructs：Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and Non-Health-Related Quality of Life (Non-HRQoL). Individual domains， total HRQoL and total non-HRQoL scores range from 0 to 100， where higher scores indicate better health. In this study， we used a Spanish-translated and validated version 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. This Spanish Lupus PRO version has demonstrated fair psychometric properties.\n\n【38】All the variables were ascertained at study entry， except for cumulative lupus manifestations and co-morbidities that were gathered retrospectively.\n\n【39】Statistical analyses\n\n【40】The cumulative rate of work disability was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The relationship between socioeconomic-demographic， self-reported quality of life (as per the Lupus PRO) as well as clinical data (clinical manifestations， diagnostic criteria as per the 1987 ACR criteria， disease activity as per the SELENA-SLEDAI， damage as per the SLICC Damage Index， co-morbidities as per the Charlson Index) and work disability was examined with Chi-Square and Mann-Whitney U test. Variables with a p value ≤0.10 in these analyses were then examined by multivariable logistic regression with work disability as the dependent variable. Variables with a p value≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The analyses were performed using the IBM SPSS statistics package， version 20.0.\n\n【41】Results\n\n【42】Two-hundred twenty-five SLE patients were studied. Patients were predominantly females (89%) with a median (Interquartile Range， IQR) age at diagnosis of 26.0 (16.0) years. Median (IQR) disease duration was 96.0 (144.0) months.\n\n【43】Work disability\n\n【44】One hundred twelve (49%) patients were working at disease diagnosis. Thirty-nine (17%) patients reported themselves to become work disabled at the time of the diagnosis while 17 (7%) sometime afterwards， summing a total of 55 (24%) patients with work disability specifically attributed to the disease.\n\n【45】The cumulative rate (standard error) of work disability was 5%(0.018) at one year，25%(0.039) at five years and 54% (0.058) at 10years .\n\n【46】Univariable analyses\n\n【47】Disabled patients were more likely to be of low socio-economic status and to have lower levels of quality of life. Hematological and immunological criteria were more frequent among disabled patients. They also exhibited higher levels of disease activity at study entry and a higher number of cumulative diagnostic criteria. Among the comorbidities， congestive heart failure and peptic ulcer disease were more frequent among disabled patients. These data are depicted in Table 1 and Supplemental Table.\n\n【48】Multivariable analysis\n\n【49】As noted in Table 2， variables predictive of work disability were a low socio-economic status \\[Odds Ratio (OR)=1.984；95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.154-3.410\\] and a lower self-reported quality of life(OR=0.953， 95% CI 0.914-0.993). None of the clinical variables were retained in the model.\n\n【50】Discussion\n\n【51】In this study we found that 25% of the patients with SLE become work disabled specifically attributed to the disease at five years and half of them at 10 vears. We also found that socioeconomic status and a lower self-reported quality of life， rather than disease manifestations and co-morbidities， were associated with work disability.\n\n【52】Work disability was reported to be higher among patients with SLE compared to the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> reaching a third of the patients at some point during the disease course. Although most of these studies were performed mainly in Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-13\\]</u>， Canada通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u> and the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-20\\]</u>， these data are consistent with ours. There is， however， one study that have addressed work disability among the Hispanic population in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>； in that study， the rate of work disability among this ethnic group was 20%， similar to our study.\n\n【53】Although ethnicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u>and age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，16\\]</u> was consistently found to affect the patients ability to work， there are some other socio-demographic variables that are associated with the extend of work disability： Education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，18，19\\]</u> and poverty among them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，16\\]</u>. This is not surprising since these two variables are also associated with the rate of employment in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In our study， socioeconomic status was measured with a composite index that reflects not only the patient’s and family income but also the level of education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\nAccording to the latest study performed in Argentina by the National Institute of Statistics and Census in 2018， 11.8% of the|删除段之间换行|Table 1： Socioeconomic-demographic， clinical features and quality of life of lupus patients according to their work disability status.\n\n| Feature  | Work disability  |  | p value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Feature  | Yes n=55  | Non=170  |  |\n| Sex， Female%  | 90.7  | 95.1  |  |\n| Age， years，median (IQR)  | 25.0(19.0)  | 21.0(21.0)  |  |\n| Low socio-economic status，%  | 61.8  | 36.3  | 0.034  |\n| Total disease duration， months， median(IQR)  | 99.0(138.0)  | 84.0(151.0)  | 0.047  |\n| Classification criteria， median (IQR)t  | 6.0(3.0)  | 5.0(1.0)  | 0.026  |\n| Organ-system involvement，%T  |  |  |  |\n| Malar rash  | 64.8  | 61.1  |  |\n| Discoid rash  | 16.7  | 11.4  |  |\n| Photosensitivity  | 79.6  | 77.2  |  |\n| Oral ulcers  | 57.4  | 44.3  |  |\n| Arthritis  | 92.6  | 83.5  |  |\n| Serosal  | 20.4  | 17.7  |  |\n| Renal  | 44.4  | 32.9  |  |\n| Neurological  | 5.6  | 12.7  |  |\n| Hematological  | 51.9  | 30.4  | 0.013  |\n| Immunological  | 90.7  | 77.2  | 0.043  |\n| Disease activity， median (IQR)#  | 4.0(8.0)  | 1.0(4.0)  | <0.026  |\n| Patient's global assessment， median(IQR)  | 4.5(3.4)  | 3.2(2.8)  | 0.03  |\n| Self-reported quality of lifes  | 67.7(14.4)  | 75.1(23.8)  | <0.001  |\n| Health-related quality of life  | 60.5(19.5)  | 81.7(24.5)  | <0.001  |\n| Non health-related quality of life  | 72.3(21.3)  | 76.6(31.3)  | 0.094  |\n\nRheumatolagy criteria， + As per the SELENA-SLEDAI；As per the Lupus PRO|删除段之间换行|inhabitants among the work force had any permanent disability；55.4% among them being unemployed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The frequency of unemployment， however， does not necessarily represents true work disability， as many other variables may be influencing this rate， the current economic situation of the country， among others.\n\n【57】Self-perceived quality of life is also found in the literature to be related to work disability among patients with different chronic conditions； rheumatoid arthritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>， multiple sclerosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>， inflammatory bowel diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and SLE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>， among others.

Although longer disease duration was associated with work disability in the univariable analyses， this variable was not retained in the multivariable model in our study.\n\n【59】While reports on this topic found certain disease specific manifestations， such as integument， renal and neuropsychiatric manifestations to be associated with work disability， this was not the case in our study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，18，25\\]</u>.

We acknowledge that this is a limitation in the design of the study that could have influence the impact of this variable on work disability. Also， we were not able to associate the presence of any comorbid condition or any type of damage with work disability； one possible explanation being that this sample of patients had， overall， accrued a low degree oforgan damage in contrast to that reported in other cohorts.\n\n【63】The study is not without limitations.

As deceased patients were not examined， it is also possible that both， the rate and the variables of work disability， would have been slightly different if this group of patients were analyzed.\n\n【68】In conclusion， in this sample of patients with SLE we found that almost a quarter of the patients become work disabled at any point of the disease course. None of the clinical variables were associated with this outcome. On the contrary， a lower socio-economic status and self-perceived quality of life influenced the patients' ability to work.

Other causes could be post intrathecal procedure， congenital skull defect，neoplasm， gas-producing organism (meningitis， ventriculitis， chronic otitis media and sinusitis)， barotrauma， post invasive procedures (i.e.， lumbar puncture， ventriculostomy， spinal anesthesia)， mask or nasal continuous positive-airwaypressure and can rarely occur spontaneously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Few case reports of air compressor-induced pneumocephalus are described in literature.\n\n【6】In this article， we present the case of a child with extended pneumocephalus caused by air compressor gun and review the available literature on this topic， with the aim to suggest a management strategy to apply in clinical practice.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A previously healthy 7-year-old boy was admitted to our emergency department with chemosis of the left eye due to ocular trauma caused by an air compressor gun. The child hit his eye while he was trying to “brush his hair with the air\". On physical examination he was conscious (GCS15/15)， collaborating， afebrile and in good clinical condition. Painful left palpebral extensive oedema， proptosis and periorbital swelling with mild crepitations on palpation characterized his left eye. No neurological deficits or meningeal signs were detectable. Ophthalmological examination described intact ocular motility， visual acuity and pupillary light reflex. An orbital and brain Computed Tomography (CT) revealed air in the left frontal area， Willis polygonus， ponto-cerebellar and quadrigemina cisterns without midline cerebral shift . There were no detectable skull base or facial fractures. The child was admitted in the neurosurgical department for clinical observation. Topical antibiotic eye drops and endovenous antibiotics were started (vancomycin 15mg/kg TID plus ceftazidime 50 mg/kg TID). In addition，pneumococcal vaccine was recommended to complete the vaccination schedule. After 5 days， a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed resolution of endocrine pneumocephalus and reduction of the air component also in the orbital area and retrobulbar adipose tissue. Endovenous antibiotics were carried on until day 14from admission.\n\n【9】Table 1： Characteristics of reported cases of air compressor-induced pneumocephalus，including our case (NA： Not Available).\n\n| Date\\[referencel  | Age(Year)  | Associatedfracture  | Radiologicalinvestigation  | Conservative therapy  | Antibiotic prophylaxis  | Length ofhospitalization  | Neurological/ophthalmiccomplication  | Infectiouscomplication  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2006通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>  | 4  | No  | Skull X-ray andCT  | Yes  | Yes (topical and systemic)  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 2014通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>  | 9  | No  | CT/Orbital MRI  | Yes  | Yes (topical and parental)  | 7 days  | No  | No  |\n| 2002通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>  | 16  | No  | CT  | Yes  | NA  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 2020\\[11  | 18  | No  | CT  | Yes  | Yes (topical antibiotic)  | 24 hours  | No  | No  |\n| 2007 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>  | 22  | No  | CT  | Yes (Suture of conjunctival laceration)  | Yes (topical and systemic)  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 1999通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>  | 47  | No  | CT  | Yes firrigation and debridement of conjunctival wound)  | Yes (topical and oral)  | NA  | No  | No  |\n| 2016通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>  | 62  | No  | CT  | Yes (closure on the evelid Lacerations and canalicular repair)  | Yes  | 4 days  | Yes (Optic nerveinjury)  | No  |\n| 2020 (Current case)  | 7  | No  | CT  | Yes  | Yes (topical and parental)  | 15 days  | No  | No  |\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Pneumocephalus (PN) is defined as the presence of air in the epidural， subdural， or subarachnoid space， within the brain parenchyma or ventricular cavities. It can be congenital， traumatic(the most common cause)， infectious， neoplastic， iatrogenic or spontaneous. It is classified as simple or， more rarely，tension PN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The CT is the gold standard investigation in the diagnosis of PN， as it can detect as little as 0.55 mL of air in the brain. MRI may also be useful， but not as sensitive as CT scan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【14】There are few case reports of unusual facial injuries as a cause for PN， secondary to accidental air compressor injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-8\\]</u>. These data are summarized in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. Interestingly， all the previous case reports included compressor tip injuries to one or both eyes without any documented skull fractures.\n\n【15】Given the lack of bony fractures， we agree that the most likely explanation is air entry to the cranial cavity via dissection beneath the Tenon fascia， around the optic nerve， and through the optic canal into the subarachnoid space， as firstly postulated by Williams and Frankel in 19996\\].\n\n【16】High-pressure injury to the orbit could be responsible of direct contusion to the orbital contents (as in our case)， traumatic optic atrophy with subsequent poor vision， injection of foreign bodies inside the conjunctiva with risk of infection and inflammation， displacement of the orbital contents with proptosis and fractures通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In the majority of cases PN is asymptomatic， because intracerebral air is generally well tolerated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Similarly， to our patient， also in previous studies patients with air compressor-induced PN presented severe pain and swelling of the eyelids and face， without neurological deficits or meningeal signs.\n\n【18】Despite this， on rare occasions PN might result in tension PN， a neurosurgical emergency that might lead to brainstem herniation and death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Twenty cases of post-traumatic tension PN are reported in literature， mostly associated with severe craniofacial fractures. The imaging appearance of tension PN should be correlated with clinical signs of deterioration or visual symptoms and may require emergent treatment (decompression such as with a burr hole and/or with needle aspiration) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Seizures can sometimes occur by irritating the cerebral cortex； moreover， the risk of meningitis and brain abscesses deserves to be mentioned.\n\n【21】PN secondary to air compressor injury is a rare event and no guidelines on its management are currently available.\n\n【22】Our case， as well as the other similar ones reported in literature， has been treated conservatively. Conservative management includes bed rest， maintaining a supine position， the use of normobaric oxygenation， the avoidance of Valsalva maneuver (like nose-blowing， coughing， and sneezing)， analgesics， antipyretics and administration of prophylactic antibiotics. The use of hyperbaric oxygenation may be useful in the management of symptomatic persistent PN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【23】It is important to report that， to date， there is no evidence supporting the prophylactic use of antibiotics in patients with basilar skull fractures， with or without PN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\nHowever， our concern was that， although we know that high pressure in the compressor could affect microorganisms gene expression and protein synthesis and could induce enzyme denaturation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， the air entered intracranially through a non-sterilepassage. Gram-positive bacteria are more resistant to|删除段之间换行|pressure than Gram-negative bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. As we believed that early antibiotic prophylaxis should be started， we decided to use broad-spectrum antibiotics， particularly effective against Gram-positive microorganisms. Almost all previous reported patients received prophylactic antibiotics， but in the majority of cases authors did not specify which molecules and timing they choose. Even if our approach is not supported by specific literature， the significantly extended not sterile intracranial air allowed us to use aggressive antibiotic prophylaxis with centrally active antibiotics. We decided to continue this antibiotic treatment until the complete reabsorption of PN. No adverse reactions to antibiotics have developed as well as any infectious complications. Considering pneumococcus as one of the most common infecting organisms in PN secondary to trauma， we also suggest an anti-pneumococcal vaccine.\n\n【25】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first mini-review of air compressor-induced PN currently available. Despite this injury being rare， some cases have been reported， especially in the pediatric age.1LIN Prognosis is usually good， as in our case. Few simple steps should be followed to conservatively treat PN and prevent its possible complications.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】Despite air compressor induced-pneumocephalus is usually a rare event， it could be useful for pediatricians and neurosurgeons to follow a few simple steps for better management.\n\n【28】We suggest conservative management including clinical observation， bed rest， maintaining a supine position and avoidance of Valsalva maneuver. Depending on clinical status， remember to consider normobaric or hyperbaric oxygenation； in the rare case of tension PN， urgent neurosurgery could be considered. We also recommend the use of broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis in addition to anti-pneumococcal and anti-tetanic vaccine， in order to complete vaccination schedule. An infectious disease consultation could be indicated. Finally， not forget to remember to avoid diving and air travelling at the time of the discharge.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A large number of studies have shown that the intraocular pressure of a person in lying position is higher than that in the sitting position， and the intraocular pressure will increase rapidly and significantly when the head is at a lower position than the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.

Pathologically increased intraocular pressure is the main risk factor， and the level of elevated intraocular pressure and the tolerance of the optic nerve to pressure damage are related to the occurrence and development of glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy and visual field defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Therefore， for patients who need to be in prone position for a long duration， in addition to paying attention to the overall prognosis， the change of|删除段之间换行|intraocular pressure should be of concern to clinicians. In this study， the intraocular pressure of ARDS patients in our ICUs during January2021 to March 2022 was measured for discussion and analysis.\n\n【17】Materials and Method\n\n【18】General materials\n\n【19】The prospective study and analysis were performed on 10 male ARDS patients in the ICU of the First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province for the period from January to March 2022 based on the clinical materials. The patients were aged between 52 to 74 (62.5±8.04 on average). The prone position group consists of 5 patients who were subjected to prone position ventilation for>10 h/day； the supine position group consists of 5 patients without adoption of prone position ventilation. All patients have no eye diseases history. And this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First People’s Hospital of Yunnan Province (Ethics Number： KHLL2022-KY057).\n\n【20】The criteria of inclusion and exclusion\n\n【21】The criteria of inclusion： Patients in this study met the diagnosis criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome under the Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute Pulmonary Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Thecriteriaaoofexclusion： All patientswithrelative contraindications for prone position ventilation such as ventricular arrhythmias and severe hypotension.\n\n【23】Method\n\n【24】Description of body position：通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Supine position： The patient is face up with their head resting on a 13 cm thick soft pillow， with whose arms in neutral position on two sides and legs stretch flatly.

A soft pillow is placed under the chest and hip respectively and a 13-cm thick ring pad is placed under the face. The patients in prone position group changed from supine position to prone position once and then from prone position to supine position once every day， with a 10-h time in prone position， while the patients in supine position were not adopt a prone position.\n\n【25】Measure method： The intraocular pressure of two eyes was measured independently by an ophthalmologist using icare hand-held portable rebound tonometer (Model： TA011). For the prone position group， the intraocular pressure before adoption prone position， the instant intraocular pressure when changing from supine position to prone position， the intraocular pressure before adoption of supine position， and the instant intraocular pressure when changing form prone position to supine position were measured. For supine position group， the intraocular pressure was measured once to twice/day at9：00 and 17：00. Each intraocular pressure measurement was taken three times and the average was taken.\n\n【26】Statistical method\n\nThe statistical software R (Version 4.1.1； R Core Team， 2021)was used for statistical description and deduction. The quantitative data was expressed with mean and standard deviation， while qualitative data was expressed with frequencies and percentage. The comparison of intraocular pressure between patients in prone position group and supine position group was subject to t test using independent|删除段之间换行|samples. For the same patient， the comparison of intraocular pressure when changing between prone position and supine position， the comparison of intraocular pressure between the start and end of prone position， and the intraocular pressure in the left eye and the right eye at the same time were subject to t test using matched pair design.

Also， there was no statistical difference between the both eyes intraocular pressures， as shown in Table 5 and Figure删除4:<u> 5</u>.\n\n【49】Discussion\n\nIn recent， the use of prone position ventilation is becoming more widespread as an important measure in the treatment of ARDS. Upon meta-analysis of 8 randomized controlled trials over 12 vears， Munshi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> found that prolonged prone position ventilation (at least 12 h， or even longer than 16 h) reduced death rate of patients with moderate to severe ARDS (oxygenation index <200 mmHg) and that prone position ventilation was safe and feasible. However， during their treatment， changes in intraocular pressure due to prone position and even the resulting development and progression of glaucoma disease should be of concern to the majority of intensivists and ophthalmologists|删除段之间换行|Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases characterized by irreversible optic nerve damage and visual field defects that can lead to permanent impairment of visual function and even blindness in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Studies have found that optic nerve damage caused by glaucoma is mainly because of mechanical compression and ocular blood supply disorder induced by pathological increased intraocular pressure通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the long-term high intraocular pressure or large fluctuations|删除段之间换行|in intraocular pressure， patients may have different degrees of eye distension， vision loss， headache on one side， and even nausea and vomiting， and in the advanced stage， patients may have irreversible visual field narrowing in the affected eye， tubular vision， night blindness， which will seriously affect patients lives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Intraocular pressure refers to the tissue pressure against the wall of the eyeball， and under normal physiological conditions， the intraocular pressure of most people is maintained at 10 mmHg to 21 mmHg， with a difference between left and right eyeballs that is not greater than 5mmHg and a fluctuation between day time and night time that is not greater than 8 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The stability of intraocular pressure is mainly dependent on the dynamic homeostasis between production and drainage of aqueous humor， and both increased production or obstruction of aqueous humor can cause increased intraocular pressiire.\n\n【51】In the above test results， it can be seen that there is a statistical difference between the intraocular pressure measured in the prone groups and supine groups. In the study of intraocular pressure during position change in the prone group， patients in the prone group had lower intraocular pressure when changing from prone to supine position and higher intraocular pressure when changing from supine to prone position. Also， during the period when the patients were in the prone position， the intraocular pressure increased further with the prolongation of the prone position. And the range of intraocular pressure changes caused by patients in prolonged prone position exceeds the physiological data in the 2017 Glaucoma Diagnosis and Consensus \\[121.\n\nAccording to current studies， the main factors of changes of intraocular pressure caused by postural changes may include advancement of iridolenticular diaphragm， venous pressure of episclera， blood pressure， ocular perfusion pressure and hormones通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The patients in this testing process were all severe ARDS patients in our ICU. In treatment， the blood pressure and hormones were controlled stably. The venous pressure of episcleral， however， is mainly dependent on the relative position between eyes and heart通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In this experiment， due to the illness of patients， all patients in the two groups were always in lying position， the relative position between eyes and heart at supine position and prone position was virtually the same? Therefore， there was no clinical difference in terms of venous pressure of episcleral. So， we considered that the difference of intraocular pressure between the two groups and the change of intraocular pressure within the same group after change of body position were mainly caused by obstruction ofaqueous humor due to anterior displacement of the crystalline iris septum in the prone position. When a patient is at prone position， there is anterior|删除段之间换行|displacement of crystalline lens because of gravity which causes anterior displacement of the crystalline iris septum and reduced the depth of anterior chamber. As a result， the anterior chamber angle is narrowed and the lens is widely and tightly connected to the iris forming a pupillary block caused obstruction of aqueous humor， resulting in increased intraocular pressure， as shown in Figure删除4:<u> 6</u>.\n\n【53】There was also similar report of this idea in the study by Anderson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， who also found higher intraocular pressure and shallower the anterior chamber depth in the prone position compared to the supine position， the same results as our test， and they found no significant change in the anterior chamber depth between the supine and prone position. Prior to this， Lam et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> considered that the proneposition did notlastlongenough (4min) to cause changes in the anterior chamber depth. But in our study， some patients with ARDS have to be ventilated in prone position ventilation for a long time due to the necessity of their treatment， it means they had to suffer high intraocular pressure for a long term but cannot avoid the significant fluctuation of intraocular pressure caused by change of body position. Although the body maintains hemodynamic stability after a change in body position through a series of regulatory mechanisms， including self-regulation and venous and arterial systems， and neurological reflexes， which regulate intraocular pressure to some extent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. However， prolonged exposure to such pathologically high intraocular pressure and frequent large fluctuations in intraocular pressure may cause damage to the optic nerve cells， affecting visual acuity and visual function and causing irreversible glaucoma damage. And in the treatment of ARDS patients， besides paying attention to the systemic prognosis， their long-term complications and quality of life are also something we cannot ignore. Therefore， for ARDS patients who have to receive prone position ventilation and patients with high risk of glaucoma， early predication and diagnosis of eye diseases should be performed before serious visual impairment is caused， so as to give corresponding treatment 18\\].\n\n【54】In summary， throughout the testing process， some ARDS patients have had their intraocular pressure altered beyond normal physiological standards due to the need to maintain a special body position for long periods of time. Since the increased intraocular pressure and its significant fluctuation caused by unfavorable body positions cannot be avoided， it's a major problem to be addressed in guaranteeing effective treatment to patients while reducing or avoiding increased intraocular pressure and the irreversible impairment to optic nerves and visual field. At last， we hope that this study will provide some reference for clinicians to alert relevant departments that need to perform prone ventilation on patients， so that more physicians will be aware of the changes in intraocular pressure and the increased risk of glaucoma in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

We report a 52-year-old woman who presented with persistent shoulder and back pain accompanied by muscular atrophy of the left upper limb， intermittent headache， and with gradual aggravation for one year. The preoperative diagnosis was difficult and the final postoperative pathological diagnosis was FVPTC. After locoregional and systemic treatments， brain metastasis initialy gradualy shrank and disappeared， but lung， bone， and brain metastases finally enlarged. Eventually， she died of malnutrition and cachexia. FVPTC always shows benign sonographic features and atypical histological and cytologic characteristics. It is easy to misdiagnose.

FVPTC was first described by Dailey et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u> in 1950， who characterized FVPTC as having the nuclear features of conventional PTC but with a follicular growth pattern. A definitive preoperative diagnosis of FVPTC based on fine-needle aspiration cytology is not possible， because signs of malignancy depend on the typical nuclear features of conventional PTC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. In addition， the features of benign and other neoplastic follicular lesions overlap， which can be affected by inter observer variability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Patients with FVPTC or conventional PTC are treated similarly. The standard recommendation has been radioactive Iodine (I-131) ablation for all tumors 21 cm in diameter， and then thyroid stimulating hormone suppression and close follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，13，14\\]</u>. FVPTC is noted as being less aggressive， with a lower incidence of thyroid capsule invasion， extra thyroidal extension， and lymph node metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，15-17\\]</u>. However， other studies found that FVPTC tended to have a higher rate of distant metastasis compared with conventional PTC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，18-20\\]</u>， a higher rate of histologic vascular invasion， and during follow-up a higher rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，21，22\\]</u>.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed space-occupying lesions in the seventh cervical vertebrae，the first thoracic and left frontal lobe. Bone and brain metastases were considered. In July 2013， the patient underwent resection of the space-occupying lesion in the spinal canal. Postoperative pathology suggested intraspinal metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， approximately|删除段之间换行|originating from the lung or thyroid. Computed Tomography (CT) scan showed multiple nodules in both lungs. The thyroid ultrasound displayed a hypoechoic nodule in her right lobe and a nodule with cystic and solid components in her left lobe，and no obvious malignant features of the thyroid nodules. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-CT revealed multiple pulmonary， skeletal， and intracranial metastases from an unknown primary focus. After radiotherapy for cervical spine and brain metastases with a dose of40G/20F in August 2013， she still suffered intermittent headache. In November 2013， pathology indicated an intraspinal mass and metastatic thyroid carcinoma (follicular subtype).\n\n【9】In November 2013 the patient complained of intermittent headache， nausea， and vomiting and was admitted to our hospital. The physical examination found muscle atrophy of the left upper arm， fore arm and left dorsal with muscle strength； volar contracture of the ring finger and with inextensible and normal muscle strength of the lower limbs. The preliminary questionable diagnosis was thyroid cancer， lung cancer， or other malignancy. Thyroid color Doppler ultrasound examination showed a suspicious cystic solid thyroid nodule in the left lobe that might be benign； and a right lobe thyroid hypoechoic nodule that might be cancer .\n\nA lymph node examined by color Doppler ultrasound showed no definite abnormality. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies|删除段之间换行|of thyroid nodules were performed. The pathological report was benign thyroid follicles and fibro-muscular tissue . This was a clinical contradictory conclusion-the intraspinal metastasis was considered PTC metastasis by the pathological report， but no malignant figures were found in the ultrasonography and biopsy specimen. Laboratory tests revealed normal thyroid function and elevated Thyroglobulin (Tg)： Thyroglobulin (Tg) >475 ng/mL (3.5ng/mL to 77 ng/mL). The PET-CT scan showed high metabolism in the right thyroid lobe， multiple metastases in both sides of the lung， multiple bone metastases， and metastasis in the parietal lobe of the left brain . In December 2013， the patient underwent total thyroidectomy； the pathological report was papillary thyroid carcinoma of the right lobe thyroid， follicular subtype， invasion of capsule， and gross tumor size 1.5 cm x1.3 cmx 1.2 cm .\n\n【11】In August 2014， the patient was given cervical and cranial radiotherapy. I-131 treatment (200 mCi) was administered 4 times during January 2014 and November删除4:<u> 2015</u>. In addition， the patient received the following： Thyroid stimulating hormone inhibition therapy； targeted therapy (oral administration of sorafenib mesylate)； surgicaltreatment for bone metastases； mannitolandhormone for the treatment of brain edema；pain relief； and other supportive treatments.

Three clinicopathological entities have been recognized in FVPTC： Encapsulated/Non-Invasive(E/NI)-FVPTC with a more indolent behavior； infiltrative FVPTC， whose behavior is closer to conventional PTC； and a multinodular/diffuse form characterized by aggressive clinical behavior， giving rise to nodal and distant metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29，30\\]</u>. In the present case， the ultrasonic manifestations of thyroid were like that of E/NI-FVPTC， but the biological behaviors were closer to the multinodular/diffuse form of FVPTC with lung， bone， and brain metastases. However， there was no cervicallymph node metastasis in this case. A verylarge proportion of FVPTCs are histologically difficult to distinguish from benign follicularlesions such as follicular adenoma， especially by fine-|删除段之间换行|metastasis and right pelvic bone metastasis was enlarged.\n\n【14】needle aspiration biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，31\\]</u>. This was also seen in the present case. Tg is an independent predictor of malignancy， and in patients with thyroid nodules， Tg should be determined before surgery， especially when cytology is indeterminate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32，33\\]</u>. The level of Tg in our patient increased significantly before thyroidectomy， which signaled thyroid malignancy. In addition， immunohistochemical examination combined with genetic tests can improve the diagnostic rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【15】For the treatment of metastasis， we reviewed the guidelines for radio iodine therapy of differentiated thyroid cancer recommended by the Chinese Society of Nuclear Medicine (2021 edition) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. For lung metastases， I-131 treatment is the first choice. Although I-131treatment may not cure bone metastases with large bone destruction， it can often significantly reduce serum Tg level， relieve pain， improve quality oflife， and prolong survival. Brain metastasis is more common in advanced elderly patients， with poor prognosis. Surgical treatment or external beam radiation therapy should be considered first. I-131treatment is an adjunct to surgeryor radiotherapy for brain metastases. In severe cases， brain hernia and other life-threatening reactions may occur. Therefore， I-131 treatment should be accompanied by glucocorticoid therapy， and patients must be closely observed. In the present case， mannitol treatment for high intracranial pressure and dexamethasone for infective brain edema were used before and after I-131. The brain metastases initially gradually shrank and disappeared and the headache and vomiting symptoms were alleviated.\n\n【16】After multiple I-131 treatments， some iodine-uptake metastases still showed disease progression within one year， including gradual growth of the lesions， emergence of new lesions， and continuous increase of Tg in serum， despite maintaining iodine-uptake ability. This is called Radioactive Iodine-Refractory (RAIR)-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36，37\\]</u>. Lenvatinib and sorafenib have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration， and many other drugs are in trials for the treatment of advanced metastatic RAIR-DTC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Unfortunately， the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment is limited due to the lack of strong cytotoxic action， fast development of resistance， and side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Immunotherapy is also a promising alternative option for RAIR-DTC. The anti-tumor activity of the anti-PDL1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab has been evaluated in advanced PD-L1-positive DTC with promising results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. However， very few clinical trials have been accomplished.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】The available options for patients with metastasizing FVPTC include surgical resection， radio iodine， thyroid stimulating hormone-suppression， locoregional and adjuvant/adjunctive and targeted treatments， immunotherapy， and other novel approaches. None of these are adequate， but the immediate and long-term prospects of individualized targeted therapy look bright.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

An ACL injury is a common sports injury and also occurs during recreational physical activities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The ACL contributes to knee joint stability and neuromuscular control通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. ACL rupture maylimit functional movements that involve cutting， jumping， andpivoting通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Also， collateral medialligament rupture and meniscal tears frequently occur in association with ACL ruptures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Surgical reconstruction is recommended after ACL rupture for elite athletes and for those whose knee instability persists after conservative treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The rehabilitation should be initiated soon after surgical reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\nThe rehabilitation process after ACL reconstruction is divided into different stages. The initial procedures aim to control edema， muscles strengthening， restore the range of motion， and enhance functional movements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The last phase of rehabilitation is based on the gesture performed in real-life sports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， andbalance training 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Individuals with ACL rupture usuallypresent balance deficits after ACL reconstruction， and balance training needs to be included during the rehabilitation period通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Several resources are used for balance training， such as exercises on the ground， on unstable surfaces， and exercises with visual biofeedback through exergaming devices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，9\\]</u>. Exergaming is one exercise modality that allows the user to interact directly with a simulated environment through a television screen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The multidimensional interaction with the environment， multi-|删除段之间换行|sensory experience through visual， audio， and haptic sensations， increasing attention， motivation and adherence are advantages of the exergaming 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. There are also increased body awareness， motor coordination， postural balance，and strength 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Studies reported positively on the use of modern technology via computer， video games， and virtual reality in the rehabilitation of patients with neurological diseases and balance disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. Nonetheless， it is still a growing prospect on the application in the orthopedic field 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，14\\]</u>. Exergaming using Nintendo Wii has been used to provide a realistic environment in physiotherapy settings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However， only two studies have reported the use of Nintendo Wii in the ACL post-operative rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. Further， no study evaluated the effects of virtual reality on the hop tests. Therefore， it is necessary to report the functional outcomes of patients who had undergone ACL reconstruction， using conventional physiotherapy and exergaming in an associated program. The intervention used in the current case report can be a potential therapeutic strategy in future studies. Thus， this study aimed to describe the effects of the combination of exergaming and conventional physiotherapy on the functionality of a patient with ACL reconstruction.\n\n【10】Materialand Methods\n\n【11】A 43-years-old male patient， an employee of the xxx，recreational athlete， sought medical treatment on June 12h，2009， after a traumatic sprained right knee in football， with clinical symptoms compatible with ACL rupture. Imaging exam showed complete ACL rupture， a grade I rupture of the medial collateral ligament and medial meniscus tear. ACL reconstruction surgery was performed with double gracilis and semitendinosus flexor tendon graft and partial meniscectomy in the xxx on May 25h删除4-1:<u>，2010</u>. The participant signed a written informed consent before the inclusion. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of xxx and performed in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration for research in humans.\n\nThe outcome measures included subiective assessment of the knee and objective measures of the lower extremity. The subjective assessments were performed by two self-reported instruments(International Knee Documentation Committee Subiective Knee Evaluation Form -IKDC， and The Cincinnati Knee Score). The objective assessments included the maximum walking speed during the 10-metre walk test， the vertical jump test， the single-leg hop test， and the single-leg triple hop test. Data were collected at four time points： baseline (week 10 after surgery)， during the treatment (week20 after surgery)， end of treatment (week 30 after surgery)， and|删除段之间换行|follow-up (week 40 after surgery). The single-leg triple hop test was not assessed on week 10 because the patient was afraid to perform the test.\n\n【13】A physiotherapist with three years of clinical experience in the musculoskeletal rehabilitation xxx performed the intervention from July to December删除4:<u> 2010</u>. Each session lasted approximately45 min， and the intervention was performed twice weekly. All sessions occurred in the physiotherapy outpatient clinic at xxx. The intervention included two phases： Conventional physiotherapy and exergaming using the Nintendo Wii. Each phase of the physiotherapy program was performed in 10 weeks. Conventional physiotherapy included electrotherapy (i.e.， functional electrical stimulation for muscle strength)， myofascial technique， knee joint mobilization， stretching， and therapeutic exercises with weight and elastic bands. Subsequently， exergaming using Wii-rehab included lower limb strengthening and balance exercises through the Wii Fit Plus game. A detailed description of the Wii-rehab exercises is provided in Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Figure 1A-1H.\n\n【14】Aerobic exercise in a stationary bike was added on week 12， and strength training started on week删除4:<u> 14</u>. During this phase， additional devices such as ankle weights， balance boards， and mini trampoline were added in some exercises. The Wii Fit Plus exercises were similar to those routinely used for ACL injury rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. There were no adverse events during the study. Descriptive statistical analysis of the data was performed in Prism software version 7.0 (GraphPad Software， Inc.， CA，and USA).\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】The subjective assessment demonstrated an improvement in both instruments. The IKDC scores increased from 43.68 (week 10) to85.05 (week 40) out of 100 points， and the Cincinnati Scale scores from 63 (week 10) to 80 (week 40) out of 100 points .\n\n【17】The obiective assessment showed increased maximum walking speed for the 10-metre walk test： 1.52 m/s (week 10)， 2.67 m/s (week20)， and 4.84 m/s (week 30). Despite that， the follow-up assessment presented lower walking speed (week 40= 3.55 m/s). Besides， the vertical jump test demonstrated improvements \\[week 10 (1.17 m)， week 20 (1.36 m)， week 30 (1.59 m)， week 40 (1.80 m)\\] .\n\nSingle-leg hop testand single-legtriple hop test distance presented an improvement during the treatment， which persisted at follow-up evaluation for the injured side. The tests scores related to uninvolved healthy side values remained higher than the involved side in the|删除段之间换行|single-leg hop test (week 10=172 cm； week 20= 145 cm； week 30=157 cm； week 40=160 cm) and single-leg triple hop test (week 10=not performed； week 20= 387 cm； week 30= 428 cm； week 40= 526cm) . The highest leg symmetry of the hop tests was 77%， measured by the lower leg symmetry (involved side performance/uninvolved performance x100%).\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】This study aimed to describe the effects of adding exergaming to a conventional rehabilitation program. The combination of the exergaming and conventional physiotherapy presented subjective and objective improvement after the rehabilitation period. The subjective measures demonstrated progressive improvement. The walking speed increased up to the end oftreatment and reduced at the follow-up evaluation. The hop tests evidenced continuous improvement， and the single-leg hop tests showed a trend to reach similar results compared to the healthy side. Although the combination of the exergaming and the conservative treatment achieved satisfactory results， the case reported did not reach the recommended value for the limb symmetry (90%) in the hop tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\nThere are few studies on Wii-rehabilitation in traumatology and orthopedic physiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8，15，16\\]</u>. A previous study presented no difference between exergaming using Nintendo Wii and conventional treatment on functional tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The two approaches had similar improvement in patients after ACL reconstruction. Moreover， a protocol combining Nintendo Wii and conventional physiotherapy found similar findings related to knee range of motion in patients after ACL reconstruction and total knee arthroplasty surgery compared to|删除段之间换行|conventional physiotherapy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Jir case1presented satisfactory results in the subjective assessment. For instance， the IKDC score was 85 out of 100 at week40， which is similar to the mean of IKDC score (88.4) among subjects who returned to the sport after the ACL rehabilitation program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The IKDC and the Cincinnati Knee Score are considered essential tools to evaluate knee function during the rehabilitation program通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>. Exergaming may play a role as an alternative approach for knee rehabilitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The Wii-rehabilitation could favor patient adherence to sessions due to the playfulness of the games 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，10\\]</u>.\n\nOur findings demonstrated that the patient still improved in the functional tests， which can be associated with the restoration of the normal activities of daily living. Functional tests have been used in clinical settings to evaluate lower extremities performance and predict a return to sport 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Wii-rehabilitation could be used as an alternative tool for physiotherapists. The program may contribute to physical improvements as well as a conventional rehabilitation program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. We encourage further research with a larger sample size to provide new therapeutic strategies involving exergaming in musculoskeletal rehabilitation. In the current study， we offered treatment for an extended period， which probably contributed to functional advances observed on obiective and subjective assessments. An exergaming rehabilitation program is feasible， safe， and cheap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Thus， the exergaming may be used to improve functional tasks as squat， single-leg weight-bearing， and balancing training. The functional outcome of patients suggests that adding exergaming in rehabilitation can be a beneficial adjuvant for patients undergoing surgery for ACL reconstruction and partial meniscectomy. The case reported in the|删除段之间换行|current study was a 43-years-old male， non-professional athlete，and these characteristics may limit the use of the rehabilitation protocol in different populations. ACL injury is usually related to younger adults and athletes. Furthermore， the improvement observed in the functional test was low (limb symmetry<90%) despite the tendency to increase at follow-up and may be affected by the number of sessions per week. Future studies should compare groups with a different frequency of sessions to clarify this issue.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】The patient functional outcomes suggest that adding exergaming in rehabilitation can be a beneficial adjuvant for patients undergoing surgery for ACL reconstruction and partial meniscectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The successful management of infants with ARMs starts with disease recognition. The newborn nursery must deliver high quality care to a high volume of mostly well babies on a day-to-day basis. A reliance on high-reliability principles that fosters teamwork， communication and continuous learning is crucial to this mission.\n\n【2】Upon recognizing an ARM within a newborn patient， clinical team members must be prepared to initiate a tailored， multi-disciplinary workup to ascertain the etiology of and inform the planning for long-term care of these infants.\n\n【3】Case Report\n\n【4】You are rounding in the newborn nursery when the nurse alerts you to a concerning physical finding she noticed during a diaper change. The patient is a two day old term infant female born via uncomplicated vaginal delivery. The mother’s prenatal course was notable only for excessive maternal weight gain in pregnancy but with normal glucose tolerance test. The infant’s birth weight ras appropriate for gestational age. There were no concerns on fetal ultrasound， and mother's prenatal labs were all within normal limits. Review of the chart indicates that the child has passed meconium and urine and she is breastfeeding well.\n\n【5】The child's physical examination is unremarkable except for multiple pink， raised soft tissue protuberances around the anus which expand in size when the infant valsalvas (e.g. during crying). The protuberances immediately reduce when the infant calms. The nursery medical team suspects external hemorrhoids， so pediatric gastroenterology was consulted.\n\n【6】The consultant team confirms the finding and recommends abdominopelvic ultrasound. The concern was for the possibility of an intra-abdominal or hepatic arteriovenous malformation.\n\n【7】At 2 weeks of life， the thriving infant was seen in the pediatric gastroenterology clinic.

Complete blood count demonstrated leukopenia at 1.02×10/uL with severe neutropenia， absolute neutrophil count of 0.02×10/uL，and elevated myelocyte precursors and blasts. Red blood cells were normocytic， and the blood smear did not demonstrate hyper-segmented neutrophils. A comprehensive metabolic panel demonstrated an elevated protein gap at 5.2. Human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis virus testing were negative， and protein electrophoresis was within normal limits. VitB12 level was <146 pg/mL， methylmalonic acid was126 nmol/L， and Intrinsic Factor (IF) antibody was positive. CT abdomen/pelvis and Chest X-ray showed no acute findings.

The natural and nutritional red carotenoid pigment is used as dietary supplements. Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in worldwide but because of very poor prognosis； it is the third most common cause of death among other cancers. There are currently limited therapeutic regimens available for effective treatment of this cancer. The present study was designed to evaluate the beneficial effects of dietary pigment astaxanthin， against Diethyl Nitrosamine (DEN) -induced oxidative stress and liver carcinogenesis in Wistar rats. ASX was orally administered to experimental rats at 20 mg/kg body weight prior to cancer induction. In the present study， we investigated the anticancer effects of Astaxanthin (ASX) during DEN-induced Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) in male Wistar rats.DEN treatments resulted in increased levels of Aspartate Transaminase (AST)， Alanine Transaminase (ALT)， Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)， Acid Phosphatase (ACP)， and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) in blood serum， and decrease the antioxidantenzymic parameters such as Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)，Catalase (CAT)，Glutathione Peroxidase (Gpx)， Glutathione Reductase (GR) and non-enzymic parameters Vitamin A， C， and E in liver homogenates. Pretreatment with ASX significantly attenuated these alterations and increase in antioxidant parameters and decreased the levels of AST， ALT， ALP， ACP and LDH in blood serum. Nevertheless， the experimental and control rats of liver morphological， histopathological examination and immunohistochemical expression of COX-2 and PCNA analysis are authenticated the protective effects of astaxanthin treated rats. These findings suggest that ASX is a potent antioxidant and anticancer agent against DEN induced HCC.\n\n【2】Keywords： HaematocoCCHS pluvialis； Astaxanthin (ASX)；FHepatocellularr carcino\\]ma； Antioxidants； COX-2；PCNA\n\n【3】Introduction\n\nAntioxidants are quenchers of free radicals that are responsible for inducing oxidative stress generated via Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the body； thus they prevent several ROS induced degenerative diseases such as cancer， ulcer， diabetes，cardiovascular diseases etc 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. HCC is a majior healthcare problem worldwide because it is the 54 most common cancer with more than one million fatalities occurring annually worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Liver is one of the most important organs in energy metabolism. Most apolipoproteins， endogenous lipids， and lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver， which depends on the integrity of cellular functions of this organ. Under normal physiological conditions liver ensures homeostasis of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism.HCC impairs this process leading to alterations in the lipid and lipoprotein patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is less common in most parts of the developed western world but appears to be increasing substantially in incidence and its incidence is very high in Asian countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These highly variable geographical distributions of HCC indicate that environmental factors are of major causative importance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The reason for relatively high|删除段之间换行|incidence in Asian countries is due to the widespread contamination of foods with mycotoxins， moderately high prevalence of Hepatitis B virus， Hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease， which are considered as the most important risk factors for the development of HCC. The mortality rate remains high from HCC despite treatment with recent results showing 1-year， 3-years and 5-years survival rates of 66.1%， 39.7%， and 32.5%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】DEN a hepatocarcinogen， is known to cause perturbations in the nuclear enzymes involved in DNA repair/replication and is normally used as a carcinogen to induce liver cancer in animal models 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The presence of nitroso compounds and their precursors in human environment together with the possibility of their endogenous formation in human body have led to suggestions of their potential involvement in human cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The main cause for concern is that DEN is found in a variety of foods like cheese； soybean； smoked， salted， and dried fish； cured meat； and alcoholic beverages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is also found in tobacco smoke at a concentration ranging from 1 ng/cigarette to 28 ng/cigarette and in baby bottle nipples at a level of 10ppb通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The micro alga， Haematococcus pluvialis (chlorophyte) is one of the richest sources of astaxanthin accumulating up to 2% to 3% of dry weight and constitutes ~85% to 88% of total carotenoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. As attributed to carotenoid and closely associated to B-carotene，lutein， and zeaxanthin， astaxanthin shares with them many of the general metabolic and physiological activities. On the other hand， ASX has unique chemical properties based on its molecular structure. The presence of the Hydroxyl (OH) and keto (C=O) moieties on each ionone ring explains some of its unique features， namely， a higher antioxidant activity. ASX (3，3'-dihydroxy-B.B-carotene-4，4-dione) has been documented to provide important metabolic functions in animals， including conversion to Vitamin A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， enhancement of immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， and protection against diseases such as cancers by scavenging oxygen radicals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The antioxidant activity of ASX has been reported to approximately 10 times stronger than that of other carotenoids tested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. ASX also shows strong activity as an inhibitor of oxygen radical-mediated LPO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【7】In recent years， a number of studies on astaxanthin have in vitro and in vivo demonstrated its antioxidant effect， for example， the quenching effect on singlet oxygen， a strong scavenging effect on superoxide， hydrogen peroxide， and hydroxyl radicals and an inhibitory effect on lipid peroxidation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. In addition to these， several other biologic activities of ASX， including anti-cancer， anti-inflammatory， antidiabetic， immunomodulatory activities and a neuroprotective effect， also have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. From the above reports Astaxanthin is known to be a powerful antioxidant，although these facts suggested that ASX might be a potent candidate for a natural hepatoprotective agent， further basic evidence to demonstrate the hepatoprotective effect of ASX is needed.\n\nCyclooxygenases also known as prostaglandin H2 syntheses are the rate-limiting enzymes involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid into Prostaglandins (PGs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Two isoforms of COX exist， with diverse tissue distributions. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in many tissies and cell types， whereas COX-2 is an inducible isoform that participates in pro-inflammatory responses in response to certain stimuli such as mitogens， cytokines and growth factors通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20-22\\]</u>. Upregulation of COX-2 has also been implicated in cancer development and growth. Recent reports on COX-2 expression in cancers show that this enzyme stimulates angiogenesis and is|删除段之间换行|associated with tumor growth， invasion， and metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，23\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is a 36-kDa protein functions as a cofactor of DNA-polymerase and an important marker for evaluating the proliferation of several cancers including HCC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24-26\\]</u>. PCNA is synthesized during the late G1-early S phase of the cell cycle， immediately preceding the onset of DNA synthesis， is most abundant during the S phase， and declines during the G2/M phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，28\\]</u>. X-ray crystallography has shown that PCNA molecules form a trimeric ring around DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The detection of PCNA using immunohistochemical methods is a common way to study the proliferating activity oftransformed cells. Reducing cellular proliferation was one of the hallmarks of controlling the carcinogenic process and higher expression of PCNA protein was closely related to increased proliferation because it plays an essential role in nucleic acid metabolism as a component of the replication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. The present study was conduct to delineate the role of ASX on the expression of COX-2 and PCNA during DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in Wistar rats. To our understanding， no reports have been documented on the same， by morphometric evaluation of the liver along with histological observation and immunohistochemical analysis.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Algal culture\n\n【12】Haematococcus pluvialis Flotow was obtained from the culture collection of Algae， Centre for Advanced Studies in Botany， University of Madras， Chennai， India.

It was observed that Astaxanthin (ASX) at the dose of 20 mg/kg body weight|删除段之间换行|significantly (P<0.05) altered the activities of marker enzymes such as acid phosphatase， alkaline phosphatase， aspartate transaminase， alanine transaminase， LDH in liver tissues and the activities of enzymic and non-enzymic antioxidant parameters in the liver to near normal values in DEN-induced rats during the experimental study. Hence， the dose of 20 mg/kg was chosen for the further study.\n\n【25】The experimental animals were divided into five groups， each group comprising six animals shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【26】After the experimental period the rats were anesthetized followed by cervical decapitation.\n\n【27】Biochemical studies\n\n【28】After cervical decapitation， the blood samples were collected from the experimental animals and liver tissue was removed and washed in ice-cold saline. The total protein in the serum was estimated by the method of Lowry， et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Determination of liver marker enzymes\n\n【30】The activities ofliver marker enzymes Aspartate aminotransferase(AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were assayed by the method of 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>， Acid Phosphatase (ACP) and Alkaline Phosphatase(ALP) by the method of 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>， Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) by the method of 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>， were estimated in the blood serum of experimental animals.\n\n【31】Detemmination of oxidant and antioxidant activity\n\n【32】Lipidperoxidation was determined in theliver tissue and plasma by measuring the formation of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances(TBARS) according to the method of 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.

Induction of DEN to rats (Group II) resulted in loss of body weight， which also exhibited decreased percentage of body weight gain when compared with the(Group I) control rats. Administration of ASX to DEN-induced rats(Groups III & IV) showed significant increase in body weight when compared with DEN-induced rats with more pronounced percentage of body weight gain observed in ASX pre-treated rats (Group III). Body weight changes in ASX (Group V) treated rats were monitored and compared with the control to determine the toxic effects， if any， of ASX during the treatment period. No noticeable changes were observed between the groups that prove the non-toxic nature of ASX.\n\n【47】Astaxanthin decreased the levels of marker enzymes in serum of DEN-induced animals\n\n【48】Table 3： Levels of Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) and Hydroperoxides in Plasma and liver of control and experimental group of rats.

Liver is one of the most important organs in energy metabolism. Most apolipoproteins， endogenous lipids， and lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver， which depends on the integrity of cellular functions of this organ. Under normal physiological conditions liver ensures homeostasis of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. HCC impairs this process leading to alterations in the lipid and lipoprotein patterns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\nHepato specific enzymes were activated when hepatocellular damage give rise to abnormalities of liver function and these enzymes are remarkably increased in HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. One of the most sensitive and dramatic indicators of hepatocyte injury is the release of intracellular enzymes， such as transaminases， phosphates， and LDH in the circulation after DEN administration. The measurement of phosphatase activity is useful as an indicator of liver function通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u>. In the liver， it is closely connected with lipid membrane in the canalicular zone， so that any interference with the bile flow， whether extra-hepatic or intra-hepatic leads to increased serum levels of ACP and ALP activities. Aminotransferases (AST and ALT) are reliable marker enzymes of liver and they are the first enzymes to be used in diagnostic enzymology when liver damage has occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[52\\]</u>. Because of their intracellular location in the cytosol， toxicity affecting the liver with subsequent breakdown in membrane architecture of the cells|删除段之间换行|leads to their spillage into serum， and their concentration rises in the latter. LDH release into the serum reflects a nonspecific alteration in the plasma membrane integrity and permeability or may be due to its overproduction by tumor cells. LDH is a fairly sensitive marker of solid neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u> and many studies revealed increased LDH activity in various types of tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36，54，55\\]</u>. In the present study the levels of marker enzymes were increase in serum was observed， when administration of DEN and treatment with ASX showed a significant reduction in the levels of marker enzymes in serum.\n\n【71】Several studies have demonstrated the antioxidant potential of carotenoids that can significantly reduce free radicals and the oxidative load to help the body maintain a healthy state. Studies have shown that in vivo supplementation with exogenous astaxanthin is capable of suppressing the formation of byproducts (e.g.， TBARS) of membrane LPO induced by superoxide anion. Studies in the past have attributed that the LPO attenuating effect of ASX to its molecular structure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. The above reports were substantiated by our study as administration of ASX to DEN-induced rats significantly reduced the levels of TBARS and hydroperoxides proving its potential antioxidant ability. The enzymatic antioxidants such as SOD， CAT， GPx and GR limit the effects of oxidant molecules on tissues and are activated against oxidative cell injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>. These enzymes work synergisticallyto eliminate active oxygen species and small deviations in physiological concentrations may have a dramatic effect on the resistance of cellular macro molecules and DNA to oxidative damage通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>. The decreased activities of these enzymic antioxidants observed in DEN-induced rats might be due to increased oxidative stress as enhanced levels of LPO along with the reduced activities of enzymic antioxidants has been observed during DEN-induced malignant alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. In this study， ASX administration prevented DEN-induced changes in enzymatic antioxidant enzymes and this could be attributed to its high scavenger potential， which would protect the tissues against free radicals generated by DEN， sparing antioxidant defenses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59，60\\]</u>.\n\nThe non-enzymatic antioxidant parameters Vitamins A， C， and E prevent its oxidation. Vitamin A is involved in epithelial cell|删除段之间换行|differentiation and is known to inhibit carcinogenesis， by preventing biological oxidative damage. Vitamin A at pharmacological doses is reported to alleviate oxidative stress mediated membrane LPO and membranes enriched with vitamin A are protected against oxidative stress in vivo and exhibit resistance to LPO induced in vitro 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>. Vitamin C scavenges ROS generated during the metabolism of carcinogen and thus possibly protects the genetic material at the initiation and promotion stages of carcinogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u>. Vitamin E scavenges free radicals to prevent LPO of polyunsaturated fatty acids， which can act as promoters of carcinogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63\\]</u>. Therefore， the decreasedconcentrations of VitaminsA，Cand Ein DEN administered animals may be due to increased utilization of these antioxidants to\n\n【73】删除5:<u>2</u>\n\n【74】abd\n\n【75】Groupl Groupli Grouplli GrouplV GroupV\n\n【76】counter LPO. Administration of ASX preserved the normal levels of these non-enzymic antioxidants in DEN-induced rats， which might be due to its antioxidant property as ASX has been reported to suppress production of free radicals and subsequent oxidative stress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[64\\]</u>. The histopathological observations clearly showed that ASX administration at pre-initiation stage greatly influences liver carcinogenesis by altering the efficacy at which DEN can initiate histological changes. Well differentiated signs of tissue injury and tumors were observed in liver tissue sections due to DEN induction that was restored to normalcy in ASX pre-treated rats. The ability of ASX to restore the histological changes induced by DEN indicates the anti-carcinogenic potential of this carotenoid. A previous report suggested that elevated LPO induced certain histological alteration in liver tissues of DEN-induced rats. ASX ameliorated the histopathological alterations in DEN-induced rats probably by extenuating the levels of LPO. Thus， the histological findings clearly support the biochemical data and suggest that ASX may play a promising anticancer role with respect to liver carcinogenesis.\n\nASX treatment significantly attenuated these alterations and decreased the levels of COX-2 and PCNA. Cellproliferation is thought to play an important role in several steps of the carcinogenic process. PCNA functions as a cofactor of DNA-polymerase and an important marker for evaluating the proliferation of several cancers including HCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24，25\\]</u>. The detection of PCNA using immunohistochemical methods is a common way to study the proliferating activity of|删除段之间换行|删除5:<u>2</u>\n\n【78】GroupI GroupII GroupIIIGroupIV GroupV\n\n【79】Plate-ll： Representative immunohistochemical staining of PCNA in the liver of contral and experimental animals at 40x of original magnificatian. Plates1-5 represent the liver sections of Groups I-V of experimental animals， respectively. Plate 6 represents quantification of immunastained section of PCNA. Each section was examined at high magnification and the ratio of positive area to hepatic tissue area was calculated. The result was regarded as the mean of five different fields on each section.

Elevated expression of PCNA in the liver of DEN-administered animals indicates the hyper proliferative activity of tumor cells. Reducing cellular proliferation was one of the hallmarks of controlling the carcinogenic process and higher expression of PCNA protein was closely related to increased proliferation because it plays an essential role in nucleic acid metabolism as a component of the replication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. ASX administration resulted in decreased expression of this proliferative marker， which clearly revealed its antiproliferative activity in HCC.\n\n【81】COX2 is a key enzyme in arachidonic acid metabolism， is consistently absent in normal tissue， and is increased in the tumor. Increased expression of COX-2 in HCC was observed by several investigators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22，26，65\\]</u>. In the present study， increased expression of COX-2 was observed in the liver of Group II hepatoma-bearing animals. It is possible that the increased levels of COX-2 serve to lower the intracellular levels of free arachidonic acid， thereby preventing carcinogenesis. ASX treatment significantly inhibited the expression of COX-2， thereby maintaining increased levels of free arachidonic acid in the cells， which might have resulted in the suppression of carcinogenesis.\n\nIn conclusion， we found that the ASX has exhibited potent antioxidant， immunomodulating and enzyme in ducing properties， all of which suggest a potential role for this carotenoid in the prevention of cancer. Moreover， its unique structural properties and its lack of|删除段之间换行|pro-oxidant activity make it aprime aspirant for further investigation in this area of human health. More research is needed on the absorption and metabolism of this promising anticancer agent in humans， and on its interactions with other carotenoids and Vitamins in the human system.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In Pakistan alone the prevalence ofGDM is approximately12% of all pregnancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. GDM has been related with a multitude of factors that include genetic， epigenetic and environmental factors. Furthermore， GDM is associated with both short term and long-term complications and thereby causes a lot of stress to both the mother and the developing fetus. Stress in not only limited to physical stress but also extends to mental and psychological stress to the expecting mother and pregnant females with GDM are four times likely to develop psychological stress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In recent years the role of genetic factors in GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and psychological and behavioral reactions have started to gain global attention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Genetic studies such as Genome Wide Studies (GWAS) have successfully lead to discoveries of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms(SNPs)， common genetic variants and new loci that are related to common complex diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Such studies along with meta-analysis， case-control analysis and linkage analysis have identified candidate genes in the etiology of both GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and psychological stress disorders. However genetic studies that link GDM with psychological stress are less well studied. The aim of this review is to understand the association of genetic changes particularly single nucleotide polymorphisms common in females with GDM and pregnancy induced psychological stress.\n\n【2】Single Nucleotide Polymorphism\n\n【3】Polymorphisms are a form of genetic variation， which refers to the presence of two or more alternative forms of a distinct phenotype. This variation can occur in any morphological， physiological， and behavioral traits and can occur in both coding and non-coding regions of the DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Among these genetic variations the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) are of the most common type occurring in about 90% of the observed differences in the genome. Another feature of a polymorphism is that the most abundant allele should be present in the population at a test frequency of 99% or less. Therefore the rare allele will present at a total frequency of at-least 1%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Most SNPs occur in the non-coding regions of the human genome but about 50，000 SNPs have been estimated to occur in the coding region of the DNA called cSNP where they can alter protein structure. These SNPs are an important genetic variation as they can influence morphological， physiological and pathological traits thereby have relevance to disease mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> as shown in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>.

It is the most common metabolic disturbance duringpregnancy. It is a multifactorial disease with a rising prevalence globally where both environmental and genetic factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease and associated post pregnancy complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In a systemic review done by Zhang et al. have assessed multiple genes that are associated with GDM. Among these they identified seven genes that are very significantly associated with GDM. These are The minor alleles of Transcription Factor 7 Like 2 (TCF7L2)， Glucokinase|删除段之间换行|region. The SNPs in the coding region are further sub divided into synonymous or non-synonymous SNPs. The synonymous SNPs and Non-coding SNPs results in un-altered protein structure whereas as non-synonymous SNPs result in altered protein structure which contributes to the pathogenesis of the disease.\n\n【6】(GCK)， Potassium Inwardly Rectifying Channel Subfamily J Member11(KCNJ11)， CDK5 Regulatory Subunit Associated Protein 1 Like 1(CDKAL1)， Insulin Like Growth Factor 2 MRNA Binding Protein 2(IGF2BP2)， Melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B)， and Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS1). Among these TCF7L2 showed the strongest association with GDM risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)and Psychological Disorders\n\n【8】Gestational Diabetes Mellitus is a pregnancy related metabolic disorder characterized by glucose intolerance that was nonexistent prior to pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. A diagnosis of GDM furthermore increases emotional distress， such as depression， anxiety or stressamong women. A study done by Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> showed that prevalence depression， anxiety and stress were 39.9%，12.5% and 10.6 % respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Pregnancy itself being a stressful condition the superimposed GDM along with stress results in further complications that could potentially lead to postpartum depression or diabetes mellitus post pregnancy. Multiple factors come into plays that contribute towards the development of stress and GDM however genetic factors play substantial role in the etiology of both psychological symptoms and GDM. In a recent review done by Yahya et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> they identified about 83 candidate genes that were associated with GDM of which TCF7L2， MTNRIB， CDKALI， IRSI， and KCNQ1 are the most prevalent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. For the purpose of the review， we would only focus on these 5 major genes any overlap of these genes with psychological symptoms.\n\n【9】Transcription Factor7 Like 2\n\nGenetic studies have showed TCF7L2 is found to be the strongest determinant of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) in the human population. In a review done by Chang et al. encompassing 22 studies6 out of 8 common SNPs were found to be strongly associated with GDM where rs7903146，rs12255372 and rs790169 had the strongest association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Furthermore In vivo studies showed that not only|删除段之间换行|TCF7L2 is associated with T2DM but is also related to altered behavior of the mice which was seen prior to the development of glucose intolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. This shows that TCF7L2 could potentially be associated with stress and GDM however further studies would be needed to make this association.\n\n【11】The Melatonin Receptor 1B (MTNRIB)\n\n【12】The Melatonin Receptor 1B (MTNR1B) is a newly identified candidate gene belonging to the class of G protein coupled receptors. Till date human genetic studies have identified many common variants of this gene associated with T2DM and GDM. Among these the polymorphism rs1387153 and rs10830963 was to be highly significant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，21\\]</u> later being also found in placental tissues associated with increased risk of GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. However when rs10830963polymorphism was assessed for depressive symptoms in T2DM no correlation was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> but independently this polymorphism was associated with increased risk of Schizophrenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The Cyclin-Dependent Kinase5(CDK5) Regulatory Subunit-Associated Protein1-Like 1(CDKALI)\n\n【14】The CDKAL1 is a member of the methylthiotransferase family encoded by CDKALI gene has been implicated in the development of T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and GDM particularly the rs7754840 variant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Although this variant was not yet studied with respect to stress development multiple genetic variants of this gene were found to be associated with depressive symptoms with T2DM通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Insulin Receptor Substrate IRS-1\n\nInsulin receptor substrate-1iIsS：an important endogenous substrate of the insulin signaling pathway. Variants of this gene mainlyrs1801278 have been shown to be associated with both T2DM and GDM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，28\\]</u>. Other variants of this gene particularly rs13411764and rs3820926 in the upstream region have found to be a risk factor for major depressive disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Though not linked via studies as a risk factor for stress in GDM the potential of IRS being involved|删除段之间换行|in GDM and variants having association with psychological illnesses could possibly serve as a question for future research studies.\n\n【17】Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily QMember1(KCNQI)\n\n【18】The Potassium Voltage-Gated Channel Subfamily Q Member 1(KCNQ1) gene variants rs2237892， rs2237895， rs2283228， rs151290， and rs2074196， have been recently identified as a risk factor for the development of T2DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30，31\\]</u>. Among these the variant rs2237892and rs2237895 were found to be associated with GDM in Chinese and Pakistani population respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32，33\\]</u>. Polymorphisms of this gene in relation to psychiatric disorders are not much studied KCNQ1 variant rs8234 was found to be associated with increased of Schizophrenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Studies Showing SNPS in Stress Related to GDM\n\n【20】Currently there are not many studies that have related SNPs associated with stress and GDM. A study done by Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>， have shown 14 genes associated with GDM and stress. These are NPY5R； ANO2； EPHX2； TPH2； NRGI； LHPP； FKBP5； SDK2； RORA； OXTR； BDNF； HTR2C； TEX51； and PLEKHG1 which are important candidates for various psychological disorders such as depression， anxiety and stress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. In another study by Lin et al the authors investigated that association between gene polymorphisms， environment and psychological stress in GDM. The study included COMT， NPSR1， HSP90B1，HSP90AA2， FKBP5. Among these genes only NPSR1 (rs324981) T/T genotype was associated with reduced risk of psychological stress where as the other genes had no significant association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】At present only two studies have shown associations of genetic variants with respect to stress and GDM. However， the candidate genes studied were mostly associated predominantly with stress and psychological disorders. This review further tried to link common candidate gene variants predominantly associated with GDM with potential relation to stress and therefore could serve as a basis for further studies.\n\n【22】Implications of Future Research\n\n【23】There is no any research work conducted in a local setting， highlighting the relationship of stress with GDM in background of genetic mutations. Thus； exploring the genetic profile of pregnant women is of paramount importance. Identifying the epigenetic mechanism of stress and GDM can benefit for sustainable long-term behavioral change measures to address the mental health of pregnant women. Further， the study will help the health providers treat the pregnant woman in a best suited way as well as to determine whether the new born to a woman will be predispose to psychological disorders in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

These complications range from epistaxis and sinusitis to pneumothorax and pharyngo-esophageal perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In a recent integrative review， eight case reports described the occurrence of esophageal and/or pharyngeal perforation related to the insertion of the NGT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Here we report an unusual case of oropharyngeal perforation opposite the left tonsillar compartment while trying to insert a NGT tube under general anesthesia.\n\n【11】A 58-year-old woman with arterial hypertension Was scheduled for ar esophagogastroduodenoscopy to explore dysphagia. During the procedure， the patient presented with major facial emphysema without hemodynamic failure， leading to an emergency intubation. A chest scan was performed finding diffuse mediastinal emphysema， without visible perforation. Probabilistic antibiotic therapy was started with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Due to the persistent suspicion of esophageal perforation， a new CT scan was performed. It found a nasogastric probe in the left para-pharyngeal space along the jugulo-carotid arteries following a probable perforation of the oropharynx opposite the left tonsillar compartment . There was a subcutaneous emphysema， pneumomediastinum and pneumoperitoneum of contiguity. However， a secondary esophageal perforation couldn’t be excluded， though not visible on the CT scan. The nasogastric tube was removed in the operating room by the ENT team. An endoscopic examination was realized， finding ulcerations of the oropharynx without visualizable entry point. Treatment with PPI was started and the initial antibiotic therapy was continued.\n\n【12】The patient was finally extubated after 14 days of mechanical ventilation under the cover of suitable analgesia， after corticosteroid systemic therapy. She also had antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and fluconazole for 14 days to cover a possible mediastinitis. After extubation， the evolution was quickly favorable on the ENT and respiratory level with complete weaning in oxygen，and withoutlaryngeal dyspnea. In terms offood， the ENT opinion recommended the abstention of oral food for at least 7 days， apart from the gelled water which is allowed， to help healing of the pharynx. On the infectious level， the patient was treated with cefepime for nosocomial pneumonia caused by Serratia marcescens and Klebsiella oxytoca.\n\n【13】NGT tube insertion is considered a simple and innocuous procedure，yet it isassociatedwithsevereadverseevents.

By showing how intrinsic the enteric nervous system and its maintenance is to promoting the production of various neurotransmitters involved in mental health diseases， we hope to make its role intricate to the understanding of mental illness and its potential treatment going forward. Gastric acid is involved in the primary function ofpreparing food for digestion and absorption by the intestine. Acid production is a central component of the stomach's contribution to digestion. Low gastric acid means higher susceptibility to food poisoning. Proton pump inhibitors use can cause diarrhea， enteric infections， and alter the gastrointestinal bacterial population by suppressing the gastric acid barrier leading to Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Normally when food leaves the stomach， it is acidic， and it leads to changes in pH and the pancreas and gallbladder release pancreatic juice and bile but if the stomach is not producing gastric acid， the gallbladder stops releasing bile. Prolonged PPI treatment produces bowel symptoms and symptoms such as cramps，hypotension and hypomagnesemia. The gallbladder has a very important role to play as the same nutrients that work in the gallbladder produce bile. Therefore， when a patient undergoes cholecystectomy， they develop an imbalance of neurotransmitters. Bile makes glycine and taurine and when it is depleted we cannot absorb calcium and this leads to hypocalcemia. Gallbladder bile rinses bacteria off the intestinal lining and the bacteria sticks to the wall increasing its bowel population leading to gastrointestinal symptoms such as malabsorption. This now increasing enteric bacterial populace leads to the formation of the \"leaky gut”bacteria causing inflammation and depression by increased intestinal permeability associated with an upload of Lipopolysaccharide(LPS) translocation which induces depression symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Hence gut microbiota and probiotics alter behavior and brain neurochemistry.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\nIn the case of our patient we had a 62-year-old female who had suffered from years of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) as well as obesity class 1 with a BMI of 33. Our patient also complained of alternating bowel movements， abdominal cramps， dyspepsia， and years of H2receptor blockers and PPI use， as well as recurring cholecystitis and its affiliated symptoms. In March of 2017 our patient underwent a cholecystectomy after feeling months of gastric discomfort and dyspepsia and had finally had enough and could no longer further prolong her discomfort. Her ultrasound imaging and lab results pointed to a diagnosis of cholelithiasis with concurrent cholecystitis and she presented to the ER with intractable abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. After initial stabilization with fluids， antibiotic treatment， and pain management， the patient in agreement with the consulting Gastrointestinal (GI) physician， decided to have a cholecystectomy|删除段之间换行|performed as she had been struggling with cholecystitis for years now. The procedure was done laparoscopically with no post operational complications. Three months later the patient presented with severe fatigue and weight gain and the recurrence of her pre-cholecystectomy symptoms. Additionally she did not feel like leaving her house， stopped socializing with her friends， felt a loss of energy and just seemed to stop caring about things. She was taken to her primary care physician， who referred her back to her GI doctor， and recommended a psychiatry consult. After standard imaging and pertinent lab results conducted by the GI physician failed to show any causal gastro intestinal factors that could be contributing to our patients state she visited a psychiatrist who，based on her presenting symptoms， diagnosed her with moderate depression secondary to the life stresses compounded by her recent surgery. The purpose of this report is to theorize how her enteric system undergoing chronic inflammation along with her cholecystectomy further exacerbated the inflammation and ultimately lead to her depression， highlighting the “Leaky Gut\"phenomenon.\n\n【4】Past medical history\n\n【5】删除3:<u>Hyperlipidemia， Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease， Hypertension， Gastritis and Obesity</u>\n\n【6】Past family history\n\n【7】Thepatient's father and motherboth had ahistory ofhypertension， gastroesophageal reflux disease and hyperlipidemia.

She was prescribed cholestyramine andesomeprazole to deal with any residual symptoms post-surgery. The patient was also scheduled to follow up with a dietician who prescribed a course of medical nutrition therapy individualized to our patient， and to follow up with her PCP to better manage her other chronic medical concerns and for medication reconciliation. The patient was advised to limit fat intake， increase dietary fiber gradually， and to avoid caffeinated and carbonated|删除段之间换行|drinks， chocolate， citrus products， spicy foods and to eat small meals. Due to a combination of factors including non-compliance with proposed dietary restrictions and inability to comply with her PCP's instructions pertaining to maintaining a healthier lifestyle， our patient experienced a return of pre-surgical symptoms as well as a sudden loss of interest in activities of daily living and was diagnosed with moderate depression by a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist after a careful review of the patient’s file suggested a thorough course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)， a modified and realistic diet in consultation with a dietician， a workout routine and therapy sessions relating to the patient’s depression and eating habits. After two months of little improvement， the patient was started on Wellbutrin XL by her psychiatrist keeping the associated weight gain with other antidepressants in mind. The patient was instructed to take Wellbutrin XL 150 mg once daily in the morning for the first 4 days after which she would start on Wellbutrin XL 300 mg once daily.\n\n【25】Outcome and Follow-Up\n\n【26】Although our patient was given the appropriate post-op care， she initially did feet better but then began to deteriorate to her pre-surgery levels in terms of symptoms and in addition developed this new feeling of being depressed all the time which could have been related to her non-compliance with the physician ordered lifestyle recommendations in terms of her diet and other appropriate lifestyle changes. After a psychiatric consult and initial assessment， the patient tried to be more adherent to the recommendations and hoped her CBT sessions， therapy， and new dietary guidelines coupled with exercise would alleviate her concerns yet she continued to feel depressed and continued to have abdominal symptoms similar to what she felt before she had her cholecystectomy. The patient was then prescribed Wellbutrin XL and advised to continue her CBTand follow her dietary， exercise， and healthy lifestyle recommendations. After an intense and strict adherence to her diet/exercise/CBT routine together with the medication the patient experienced mild relief within five months post-surgery， her abdominal symptoms had disappeared， and she had started to lose weight and felt happier. The patient started to socialize more and took up a proactive approach to bettering her eating habits and other lifestyle choices. The Wellbutrin XL initially started at 150 mg once a day was increased to 300 mg once today after the initial four day period and then maintained as the patient did not feel like there was any need for an adjustment.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\nA dysbiotic state leads to increased intestinal permeability and allows contents such as bacterial metabolites and molecules as well as bacteria themselves to leak through the submucosa and into the systemic circulation， a phenomenon aptly named leaky gut syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In our digestive gut， sugar precursors E. coli &proteobacteria Bifidobacterial species act on the chorismite from where E. Coli， proteobacteria， B. subtilis， firm elves， mycobacterium and actinobacteria leads to formation of tryptophan which in the intestinal epithelial cells causes serotonin production in the gut. When the concentration of these bacteria is reduced due to antibiotics or PPI use， it decreases their quantity in the gut and the lack of bile post-cholecystectomy prevents the cleansing ofthe gut liningto get rid ofthe bad bacteria. This in part leads to less tryptophan and serotonin being produced in the enteric system，leading to depression. Tryptophan is synthesized from chorismite by members of several bacterial phyla including protein bacterium， actinobacterium & fircules. E. Coli can synthesize chorismite， a tryptophan precursor， which acts as a|删除段之间换行|branch point for microbial metabolic pathways consistent with this key role for bacteria. Antibiotics and PPI treatment alters tryptophan and undoes metabolism leading to less serotonin and melatonin in the brain. Tryptophan， tyrosine， and phenylalanine are made in the gut. When tryptophan is shuttled through the kynurenine pathway there is less tryptophan available to make serotonin and hence less serotonin in the gut available to be transported to the brain via the vagal nerve. Low bile，post-cholecystectomy， causes leaky gut as bile acid stimulates biliary lipid secretion due to their physical chemical properties. They can form mixed micelles together with biliary phospholipids which allows the solubilizing in bile of cholesterol and other lipophilic compounds. Mixed micelles also account for the emulsion of dietary fat and lip soluble vitamins in the gut， helping their absorption. Bile acids also facilitate intestinal calcium absorption. At the intestinal level， bile acids are known to modulate pancreatic enzyme secretion and cholecystokinin release. Moreover， they are potent anti-microbial agents that prevent bacterial over growth in the small bowel.\n\n【29】There is also a systemic IgM-mediated immune response in depression directed against LPS (which is part of the bacterial wall of gram negative bacteria) suggesting that bacterial translocation may play a role in the inflammatory and pathophysiology of clinical depression. Bacterial translocation indicates the presence of “leaky gut”or an increased permeability of the gut wall or loosening of the tight junction barrier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Hyperactivity of the HPA axis is also one of the most reliable biological findings in patients suffering from major depression. Exposure to stress and cytokine responses may impair neuronal plasticity and stimulation of neurotransmission. Administration of exogenous IL-1b significantly enhances IL-1b levels in the Pre-frontal Cortex (PFC) and hippocampus and further increases Hypothalamic， Pituitary， and Adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Likewise， acute stress markedly increases IL-1b levels in the PFC， hippocampus and hypothalamus. Repeated stress sensitizes the HPA axis response to administration of exogenous IL-1b and possibly leads to depression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\nThe gut is composed of nerve tissues and uses neurotransmitters to communicate with the brain. The gut microbiota affects brain development and plasticity by secreting various neurotrophins and proteins， such as Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)， synaptophysin and postsynaptic density 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Our brain has an|删除段之间换行|intimate connection with our gut via vagal nerve， which has hundreds of millions of nerves cells that regulate our digestive processes. This“second brain\" in the gut is spread out throughout the entire length of the gut. This second brain has many sensors in the enteric nervous system. The connection between depression and the gut is integrative from serotonin in the gut and how it relates to serotonin in the brain. Many patients with depression complain of constipation. This might be due to 95% of our serotonin being produced and stored in the gut via enterochromaffin cells which leads to modulation of mood， appetite， and well-being. The serotonin in the gut is synthesized from the food that we inject and the microbes that live in our gut that stimulate the production of serotonin. 60% of the production is due to the signals that come from the microbes in our gut. The serotonin cells are sandwiched between the cells that make the lining ofthe gut. The cells have vagal nerve association and the signal when the cell is activated goes to the brain via the vagal nerve from where it is delivered into the limbic system. This case study involves a patient with a long history of GERD treated with H2 antagonists， PPIs， and a host of other medications over the vears who underwent a cholecystectomy. This was followed by symptoms of depression that required treatment with an ant-depressant coupled with healthier lifestyle changes and dietary restrictions. This case study is being written to establish a possible connection between the gut microbiome and depression.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Also， there are relatively few literature data referring to the etiological hypotheses of this condition. This paper presents our results regarding the histopathological appearance highlighted in surgically resected venous aneurysm specimens that reveal the potential causes that lead to this condition onset， as well as a brief review the literature data. At the same time， current therapeutic options are discussed.\n\n【2】Keywords： Primary venous aneurysm etiology； Endophlebohypertophy； Endophlebosclerosis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Isolated Venous Aneurysms (VA) can be defined as a focal dilation at least two or three times larger than the diameter of the venous trunk， and it should not be contained in a varicose vein segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. VA is a relatively rare abnormality (literature data reveal a number between 300 and500 cases described around the world so far) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. However， the etiology of VA is uncertain. This article discusses possible hypothesis of etiology for VA by presenting our results obtained from morphological analysis of several specimens (surgically resected VA， optical microscopy analyses) and a brief review of literature.\n\n【5】Methodology\n\n【6】Seven specimens (surgically resected primary VA) from 7 different patients (4 females， 3 males， age： 44.6± 8.2 years， BMI： 29.1±3.4)， were analyzed by the Pathology Laboratory (Hematoxylin-Eosin and the Masson trichrome stain). Our results were compared with literature data searched in PubMed and Google Scholar database (publications in English written from the establishment of the database to September 2022).\n\n【7】Results\n\n【8】Sixgreat saphenous vein aneurysms measuring between 2.2/1.5 cm and5.5/3.8 cm，and one small saphenous vein aneurysm (2.3/2.1 cm) were analyzed. Histological examination demonstrated that the pathophysiological processes which occur once with primary venous aneurysm development， involve all layers of the vein wall. Irregular intimal surface with disrupted endothelial layer and marked cellular infiltration of the intimal layer was noted in most of the cases. For that reason， intima appears thicker than the media， due to the pronounced infiltration. Most affected seems to be tunica media， where there is significant degradation of collagen fibers， fibrosis， and a reduction in the number of vascular smooth muscle cells. Progressive loss of smooth muscle tissue is most likely due to inefficient reparative elastogenesis. In some places， the tunica media is replaced by hyalinized connective tissue， and the elastic lamina is damaged. At the level of the tunica media and tunica externa， an inflammatory reaction occurs with predominantlylymphocytes and macrophages，which form vascular-associated lymphoid tissue and develop vasa vasorum thickening. The inflammatory reaction is present in places， consists mainly of lymphocytes and macrophages， eosinophils， neutrophils， and plasma cells may be present . In 2 cases， a thrombus (adherent to the endo-vein surface) was noticed.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\nChronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a common pathology that significantly affects patient’s quality of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， on the opposite side， primary venous aneurysms are a relatively rare pathology. There are not many literature data related to the microscopic morphological appearance|删除段之间换行|of varicose veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， and no regarding venous aneurysms and their etiology， either.\n\n【11】Morphological analysis of various surgically resected specimens revealedi an aneurysm venousSwall with thickened， fibrotic， moderately cellular intima adiacent to a densely fibrotic adventitia fragmentation， attenuation of the elastic lamellae， and loss of smooth muscle cells. In the case of thrombosis， medial fibrosis in areas of thrombus adherence was observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6-8\\]</u>. The cases we described present similarities with the microscopic morphology described in the literature. In the case of large venous aneurysms， the deposition of fibrous tissue between the smooth muscle lavers that explained the degeneration of the media can be considered the cause which led to their enlargement. There are theories that the development of VA is the result of the congenital absence of smooth muscle in the venous media 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， associated with low amounts of elastin fibers and smooth muscle cells， fibrous connective tissue， and elastic fibers in the venous wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.Endophlebohypertophyand endophlebosclerosis，processes that occur with age， have also been considered to have a potential role in the development of aneurysms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，11，12\\]</u>. Considering the age of the patients included in this study， our results plead for endophlebohypertophy (marked cellular infiltration of the intimal layer，intima appears thicker than the media)and endophlebosclerosis(fibrous tissue dispersed between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers， excessive subendothelial collagen deposition) as the most probable hypothesis of etiology.\n\n【12】Even if treatment guidelines are not clearly established and thus treatment strategies vary， depending on the location and clinical manifestations， some principles have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. Some data recommend conservative treatment for uncomplicated or asymptomatic aneurysms， or with jugular， subclavian， thoracic， or visceral localization. There are also reported cases with iliac localization successfully treated conservatively by anticoagulant medication and inferior vena cava filter. In the case of symptomatic， complicated or growing aneurysms， or those located in the deep veins of the lower limbs， primary surgery is indicated. Interventions for aesthetic reasons have also been described. As surgical techniques， ligation/excision，tangential aneurysmectomyand lateral venography， resection of VA with interposition autologous vein graft can be practiced. The endovascular approach has also been described in some cases for subclavian VA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Cryostripping has been described as a feasible therapeutic alternative for the surgical resection of the venous segments containing the aneurysm删除4:<u> 14</u>.\n\n【13】Due to the decreased frequency of this disease， there are still insufficient studies that provide data for its etiology. For patients who are not in the first decades of life， we consider that the presence of aneurysms is due to the processes of endoflebosclerosis. The destruction of tunica media produced by the separation of the smooth muscle bundles and the significant deposits of fibrous tissue， which weaken the structure of the venous wall， allows aneurysmal dilatation. Multicentric studies which analyze more data about the VA etiology would be useful to reach a consensus. Regarding the treatment， most data， including our clinical experience， recommend venous aneurysm resection performed through different procedures as the first therapeutic option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

There has been a rapid rise in the incidence of one such entity called Acute Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) or Rhino-Orbital Cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM) in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India， which has led to a significant health crisis， mainly associated with the administration of steroid therapy in a background of concomitant hyperglycemia通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

The recent upsurge in the cases has been ascribed to the immunomodulation and metabolic compromise in post-COVID-19\n\n【10】patients caused by the virus， as well as due to the immunosuppressive medical therapy in the form of parenteral and oral steroids， broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunomodulators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Pathophysiology\n\nThe portal of entry of the fungi is by inhaling the spores， which lodge in the upper airway， nasopharynx， nasal cavity， and paranasal sinuses， and finally， release hypha after sporulation. The initial infection commences in the nasal cavity， presents as acute sinusitis， and then rapidlyprogresses into pan-sinusitis. After the hypha invade the walls of the blood vessels and lymphatic's， the angioinvasive process is initiated. There is the contiguous spread of infection to the paranasal sinuses， palate， orbit， craniofacial soft tissue， the base of the skull， and finally into the brain parenchyma， leading to|删除段之间换行|aggressive necrosis， infarction， and ischemia of the involved tissues， and vascular thrombosis. Extension into the orbit is along the weak medial orbital wall， ethmoid sinus groups， and the nasolacrimal duct. At the same time， involvement of the brain occurs through the superior orbital fissure， the network of vessels， the cribriform plate， and via the perineural spread. The pterygopalatine and infratemporal fossa are critical for spreading an infection to craniofacial soft tissues and at the skull base.

Yet， it is not the standard of care to screen for either of these sexually transmitted diseases upon diagnosis of primary penile cancer. We present a 50 year old male who had a confirmed diagnosis of penile cancer for 2 years prior to his presentation to our clinic in Dakar， Senegal. Outside institutions repeatedly failed to screen the patient for sexually transmitted diseases， namely HPV and HIV. We share this case to emphasize the importance of sexually transmitted disease screening upon diagnosis of penile cancer with hopes to increase awareness in both developed and developing nations. We call for consensus in sexually transmitted disease screening guidelines upon penile cancer diagnoses.\n\n【2】Keywords： Penile cancer； HPV；HIV； STD screening\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Primary penile cancer is a rare malignant overgrowth of cells， typically located on the glans or the internal prepuce of the penis. It has a worldwide incidence of 1/100，000 and most commonly affects males between the ages of 50 years to 70 years. Delayed diagnosis often yields significant morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. While penile cancer is uncommon in Europe and North America， the developing world has much higher rates of incidence up to 8 cases per 100，000 in some countries通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Variations in incidence worldwide are hypothesized to be affected by socioeconomic status， healthcare accessibility，cultural tradition，and psychological factors of the patient populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Over 95% of penile carcinomas are Squamous Cell in Carcinoma (SCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Additionally， there are a wide variety of other histological variants， such as basaloid， verrucous， and sarcomatoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The majority of lesions are found on the glans (48%)， with the remainder located on the prepuce(21%)， both glans and prepuce (15%)， coronal sulcus (6%)， and shaft (<2%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Diagnosis is often clinical， though clinical presentation is variable and commonly asymptomatic initially. Lesions can present as indurated nodules， ulcers， or fun gating masses. With progression， symptoms such as itching， bleeding， discharge， or pain may occur. Advanced disease can present with palpable lymphadenopathy， weight loss and fatigue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\nCertain biological pathologieshavebeentiedto increased incidence. Poorhygiene， uncircumcised males， urethral stricture， tobacco use，and even psoralen ultraviolet A photochemotherapy have all been associated with increased penile cancer incidence in prior studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Chronic inflammation may also be a critical component of tumor development， as many penile cancers arise from sites of infection， chronic irritation or injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Further， penile cancer is best known to have a strong association with carcinogenic strains of Human Papillomavirus (HPV). For example， HPV infection is found in 45% to 80%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> of penile SCC cases. This association is even higher in other histological types such as verrucous， basaloid and sarcomatoid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The most commonlyaccepted explanation for the association is HPV's ability to produce the oncogenic proteins E6 and E7， which interfere with the p53 and Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor genes， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This carcinogenic mechanism is especially important in populations with high HPV infection rates， such as Sub-Saharan Africa. HPV incidence was found to be around 61% of the male population in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2012通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may also play a role in SCC pathogenesis. Though a|删除段之间换行|causal link between immunosuppression and penile oncogenesis has not yet been made， men who are HIV+ carry up to an 8X greater risk of penile SCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，9\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Despite HPV and HIV's well known association with penile cancer， there is a serious lack of attention to the preventive health component of this condition. For example， the European Urological Association's (EUA) guidelines for penile cancer address diagnostic standards， staging， and possible treatment avenues that individual cases may necessitate. However， there is little acknowledgement of the public health risks that penile cancer may pose with an underlying HPV and HIV infection. Additionally， there seems to be no recommendation for penile cancer management specifically in developing nations， including Sub-Saharan Africa， which may have unique socioeconomic roadblocks. Consequently， this case report aims to emphasize the critical importance of screening for HIV/HPV upon a diagnosis of penile cancer， such that it should be included in official penile cancer guidelines. Prompt evaluation of a patient's STD status can not only decrease morbidity and mortality for the patient， but also provide preventative measures against future HPV-related cancers， as well as HIV complications in the community.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】We present a 50 year-old Senegalese male with a history of recurrent urethritis， who presented to our clinic for an evolving ulcerative swelling on his penis for the past 2 years. The patient's medical history is limited secondary to lack of documentation and resources from outside institutions. The patient had presented to several local clinics before the diagnosis of penile cancer was made； those records were unable to be obtained. The patient received 12chemotherapysessions before being referred to our clinic. Ofnote，the patient was polygamous with 2 wives， though became divorced since the beginning of the disease. He did not report having unprotected intercourse with other women.\n\n【10】CT scans demonstrated local invasion of the cancer into the subcutaneous fat overlying the pubic symphysis. Lymph node metastases with left inguinal necrotic lymphadenopathy of 5 cm were also present. Furthermore， there were bilateral， multiple lung nodules of different sizes， mostly predominant on the left side.\n\n【11】The patient never received an STD screening since his diagnosis. We performed an HIV and HPV test that came back positive for HIV2，previously unknown to the patient. The results also came back HPV (+) for serotype删除4:<u> 16</u>. As of May 2020， the patient is currently alive and being treated accordingly.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】There are no written recommendations for STD screening in patients diagnosed with penile cancer despite overwelming evidence that there is some association between HIV， HPV and penile cancer通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>.Evidenced by our patient remaining undiagnosed with HIV2after initial presentation 2 years ago， delay in STD diagnosis can have dire consequences. An earlier diagnosis for our patient may have prevented the eventual progression of his penile cancer and further metastatic disease.\n\nWe hypothesize that early diagnosis of HPV and HIV infections in patients can have a marked benefit for public health as well. With earlier identification and Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy(HAART)，HIV transmission will likely decrease. A case report written by Konan et al. acknowledges a link between HIV and penile cancer|删除段之间换行|and suggests that a diagnosis of HIV may worsen the prognosis of the disease. Additionally， Konan recommends screening HIV+ patients for penile cancer so that tumors can be discovered in earlier stages. Patients would therefore be more likely to be treated conservatively. As for HPV， there is evidence to suggest that good clinical suspicion to screen for the virus in sexually active patients may reduce the risk of subsequent oropharyngeal cancers in the public 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. Hence， it may be extrapolated that early diagnosis of these viruses may prevent their transmission and subsequent complications in the community.\n\n【15】Despite the plethora of information on the internet， there is still not enough consistent information to educate developing nations on the infectious disease management ofpenile cancer. For example， the EUA never recommends screening for HPV/HIV in penile cancer patients and the American Urologic Association has no specific guidelines for penile cancer whatsoever. Consequently， Teh et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> was right to describe finding consistent information on penile cancer as a “needle in the haystack\". Additionally， they state that there seems to be a discrepancy in the quality of websites in differing languages， with significantly lesser quality available in the developing world. With all of the inconsistencies in literature， the severity of our patient's case could have been prevented by access to clear， concise STD recommendations.\n\n【16】Necessarily，wecallforspecific，evidenced-basedrecommendations for STD testing for penile cancer diagnosis. A clear consensus would address the discrepancies and current confusion across resources.For our future patients and the entire medical community， we seek more thorough guidelines in regards to testing for HIV and HPV upon a diagnosis of penile cancer.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\nThe association between penile cancer， HPV， and HIV has been well established. However， in the developing world， it is not always common practice to properly screen for STDs upon a diagnosis of|删除段之间换行|penile cancer. Prompt screening of these patients can lead to earlier treatment， better outcomes， increased public health awareness， and potential for more cost effective care. Thus， screening for sexually transmitted diseases should be the standard of care in anyone diagnosed with penile cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

She had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus， obesity and hypertension. Her blood glucose was regulated with oral anti-diabetic drugs at home. At the time of hospital admission her blood glucose was： 248 mg/dL， creatinine： 0.62 mg/dL， CRP： 127.62 mg/L，leukocyte： 4630 (lymphocyte： 730). Her D-dimer：and procalcitonin results were detected 305 ng/mL and 0.14 respectively. Her infection was due to coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) infection that confirmed by computed tomography of chest  in connection with a positive Reverse-Transcriptase-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction in line with(RT-PCR) assay. In the absence of another etiology， we concluded she had pneumonia possibly associated with COVID-19 infection， and started on Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg per day and ceftriaxon 1 gr twice daily. Due to higher D-Dimer levels， low molecular weight heparin4000 unit per day subcutaneously was also added to her treatment regimen. On the sixth day of admission her dyspnea， shortness of breath， repetitive cough with fever were worsened and she was transferred to intensive care unit. Treatment was continued with favipiravir， piperacillin-tazobactam and low molecular weight heparin. On the seventh day her venous blood gas analysis as follows； pCO2 was 20.2 mmHg； pH was 7.28； HCO3 was 10.5 mmol/L.， serum lactate was 1.9； glucose was 151 mg/dL， creatinine： 0.53 mg/dL， sodium： 135； color： 104 mEq/L and anion gap： 20.5. Her blood glucose monitoring was done and glucose levels were between 150 mg/dL to 200 mg/dL； glucose was negative and ketone was +3 in her urine test. On the ninth day of hospitalization her dyspnea progressed and she had hypoxemia consistent with respiratory failure. Thus， she was intubated her arterial blood gas analysis as follows； pO2 was 54.3 mmHg， pCO2 was 48.1 mmHg； pH was 7.22 HCO3 was 19.4 mmol/L， serum lactat was 1.53； procalcitonin： 2.67. Kidney and liver functions were normal. Immune plasma treatment was also given to the patient. Her respiratory failure was improved during ICU follow up and then she was extubated. The patient was transferred to the service after 25 days hospitalization in ICU. Total 37 days of hospitalization she recovered and discharged from hospital.\n\n【7】Diabetes is the one of the most frequently detected comorbidities in patients infected with COVID-19. When current data are examined， increased risk of COVID-19has not been detected in diabetic patients compared to the general population. Nevertheless， diabetes mellitus can increase the risk of severe and critical forms of COVID-19， as a result of this the need for an intensive care unit and/or use ofinvasive mechanical ventilation might increase， with high mortality rates删除4:<u> 31</u>.\n\n【8】The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection vary but mainly cause fever and cough. Although mild upper respiratory disease and gastrointestinal disease are mostly observed in COVID-19 infection， severe viral pneumonia with systemic organ failure， or even death might be seen.\n\n【9】Recently some studies have reported that older age or medical comorbidities， such as cardiovascular disease， diabetes mellitus， hypertension， and obesity are risk factors for severe illness and mortality among patients with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

In vital signs； blood pressure： 170/110 mm Hg， pulse： 170/min. Rapid ventricular atrial fibrillation(velocity： 170-180/min) was detected in the ECG of the patient . The patient’s medical story and hospital records showed that he had never had atrial fibrillation， palpitations， or any arrhythmia. This was evaluated as atrial fibrillation provoked by a drug containing PEH. The patient was given a 25 mg diltiazem slowly and then isotonic sodium hydration was added. The patient whose symptoms were improved and the sinus rhythm were obtained at ECG， and blood tests did not reveal any significant pathology was discharged with the recommendation of cardiology outpatient clinic.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nEspecially in spring and winter， many people use excessive or often over-the-top topical or systemic decongestants to get rid of allergic or infectious nasal congestion.

He had a past medical history of hypertension， dyslipidemia and acute myocardial infarction in 2008. His daily medication included bisoprolol， rosuvastatine， enalapril and hydrochlorothiazide. He lived in an urban area， with no exposure to biomass burning and had no pets. He worked as stonemason， carving marble for 38years and had also worked with wood and upholstery. He reported a 12-month history of dyspnea on exertion， worsened after SARS-CoV-2 infection (3 months earlier). Chest High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) at the time of infection revealed diffuse Ground Grass Opacities(GGOs)， subpleural reticulation and traction bronchiectasis with upper lobe predominance， and also mediastinal lymph nodes with “eggshell” calcification.

She presented with depression and decreased medical adherence， resulting in prolonged hypertension and pregnancy prohibition. FP was started 40 weeks after stillbirth， and a blastocyst was preserved at the fifth oocyte retrieval. Her medical adherence improved， and her BP became 120-130/90-100 mmHg. After thawed embryo transfer， she conceived a singleton pregnancy. Her BP was 120-130/70-90 mmHg during this pregnancy. At 32 weeks， she delivered a baby due to abnormal findings in Cardiotocogram.

It is well accepted that Blood Pressure (BP) control， before conception or since early pregnancy， is important. However， the target BP is controversial. The International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy (ISSHP) states that the target BP should be in the range of 110-140/80-85 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence(NICE) recommends a target BP of 135/85 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In contrast， in 2019， the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommended that anti-hypertensive therapy for CH should be started when pregnant women have a BP≥160/110 mmHg， and that the target BP should be 120-159/80-109 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This recommendation is based on the finding that strict control of diastolic BP did not improve maternal/fetal outcomes. In April 2022，however，ACOG revised the target BP to 140/90 mmHg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， based on the results of the Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy study.\n\nPregnancy with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is also a high-risk pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>.

It was suggested that embryo preservation during pregnancy-prohibited period may have contributed to improvement in depression and medical adherence， resulting in BP control and a livebirth. To our knowledge， this is the first report on the embryo preservation in pregnancy-prohibited woman with CH or SLE.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\nA 21-year-old woman presented to our hospital with cheek erythema， oral ulcers， finger arthralgia， and thrombocytopenia； she was subsequently diagnosed with SLE at the department of rheumatology in our hospital. Her BP was normal， and her medical history was uneventful. An evaluation of the patient’s family history showed that her mother had hepatic cancer， but there was no family history of autoimmune diseases， hypertension， thrombosis， or sudden death. The patient showed positive results in autoantibody tests for anti-DNA， anti-RNP， anti-Smith， anti-SSA， anti-SSB， and Lupus Anticoagulant (LA)， and negative results for anti-cardiolipin and anti-B2 Glycoprotein I (B2-GPI). SLE flares were observed twice during the following 2 years. During the second flare， her BP was130/80 mmHg. Subsequently， she was in remission and was taking 7mg/day Prednisolone (PSL) and 4 mg/day Tacrolimus (TAC). She got married at the age of 30 years， and her disease remained in remission. She conceived spontaneously at 31 years of age， but the pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage at 7 weeks. LA and anti-B2-GPI tests were|删除段之间换行|repeated 8 weeks after the miscarriage， but both showed negative results.\n\n【9】The patient subsequently visited a private fertility clinic， and her BP that time was 137/89 mmHg. She conceived dichorionic diamniotictwins after intrauterine insemination in a natural ovulatory cycle at 33 years of age. At 5 weeks of gestation， her BP was 138/102mmHg. At 9 weeks， she presented with thrombocytopenia and skin erythema， and an SLE flare was diagnosed. Her PSL and TAC doses were augmented， and treatment with Hydroxychloroquine sulfate(HCQ) was initiated . At 13 weeks， she was referred to our Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGY) department， a tertiary perinatal care center， and was subsequently managed in cooperation with the rheumatology department at our institute. At 13 weeks， LA test again showed negative result. Hypertension (150/110 mmHg) was observed at 13 weeks， and methyldopa， labetalol， and amlodipine were administered； however， her BP remained around 150/90mmHg. She was admitted at 17 weeks because thrombocytopenia had not improved. Although intensive immunosuppression therapy， including intravenous immunoglobulin， augmentation of PSL， and initiation of Cyclosporin A (CyA) and azathioprine， was administered for the SLE flare，the thrombocytopenia did not improve. At 20 weeks， rapid progression of renal dysfunction was observed， which was indicated by changes in the serum creatinine levels (from 0.86 mg/dL to 1.19 mg/dL) and the eGFR (from 62.0 mL/min/1.73 m² to 43.4mL/min/1.73 m). Her serum uric acid levels were also elevated (6.8 mg/dL). Because the patient's thrombocytopenia and renal dysfunction did not improve despite intensive immunosuppressive therapy， we concluded that SPE was complicated with the SLE flare， although the gestational age was only 20 weeks. Considering the gestational age， we recommended termination of pregnancy for maternal safety. After obtaining informed consent， therapeutic termination was performed\n\n【10】Table 1： Summary of embryo preservation trials.\n\n| Trial  | Weeks afterthe still birth  | Stimulation  | Number of QQcytesretrieved  | Number ofpreservedtrophoblasts  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1s1  | 40  | Short  | 4  | 0  |\n| 2d  | 56  | CC  | 1  | 0  |\n| 3d  | 64  | CC  | 2  | 0  |\n| 41h  | 68  | CC  | 2  | 0  |\n| 51h  | 72  | CC  | 2  | 1  |\n\n【12】CC： Clomiphene Citrate\n\n【13】at 20+2 weeks using a cesarean section， and two babies (292 gand 272g) were delivered.\n\n【14】Afterthestillbirth，immunosuppression therapy was administered more intensively， including steroid pulse therapy (intravenous methylprednisolone， 1，000 mg/day for 3 days)， initiation of mycophenolate mofetil (which is contraindicated during pregnancy)， and augmentation of CyA. As a result， her serum creatinine levels decreased， and platelet counts increased. Although her hypertension was prolonged， she was discharged 28 days after stillbirth.\n\n【15】Following the discharge， SLE was treated with PSL， CyA， HCQ， and belimumab， and renal function test results and platelet counts were controlled within normal ranges . However， her BP remained around 150-160/100-110 mmHg； therefore， pregnancy was not permitted. She became depressed soon after the stillbirth； at approximately 20 weeks after stillbirth，her depression became severe， and she stopped taking prescribed medicines. She contemplated suicide， but it was avoided with the help of a psychiatrist.\n\nAs we could not predict when pregnancy would be permitted， a prenatal team of doctors suggested embryo preservation to the fertility treatment team. We proposed that the couple undergo|删除段之间换行|embryo preservation 36 weeks after the stillbirth to preserve fertility. The couple chose to proceed with the embryo preservation. Embryo preservation started 40 weeks after the stillbirth . The stimulation methods and outcomes are shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. The first trial used the “short”protocol， and the following trials used administration of Clomiphene Citrate (CC). A blastocyst with good morphology was preserved for the first time at the fifth trial 72weeks after the stillbirth. Following the embryo preservation trials， the patient’s depression had ameliorated， and her adherence of medicines improved. Her BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg， with the systolic BP falling into the normal range. SLE was in remission， and LA was negative once again. Rheumatology and OBGY doctors had a conference and permitted her pregnancy 76 weeks after the stillbirth.\n\n【17】After obtaining informed consent from the couple regarding the risks of pregnancy that included a possibility of twin pregnancy(2% in single blastocyst transfer)， an SLE flare， preterm birth which could result in a neonatal mortality/morbidity， and the risk of mortality/morbidity to the patient， a thawed Embryo Transfer (ET) was performed in a spontaneous ovulatory cycle 80 weeks after the stillbirth. The patient developed a singleton pregnancy. In this pregnancy， her BP was maintained around 120-130/70-90 mmHg. However， serum creatinine was elevated to 0.97 mg/mL at 32+4weeks， and she was subsequently admitted. At 32+5 weeks， elevated serum creatinine (1.06 mg/dL)， decreased eGFR (53 mL/min/1.73m’)， and abnormal findings on Cardiotocogram (loss of variability) were observed； therefore， an emergency cesarean was performed. A 1，580 g baby was delivered with a 5-min Apgar score of 9. After delivery，the serum creatinine levels became normal. Both the mother and baby were in good health 1 year after the delivery.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\nWe presented the case of a woman with CH and SLE whose first|删除段之间换行|pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage， the second pregnancy (without pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in therapeutic termination at20 weeks， and the third pregnancy (with pre-conceptional BP control) resulted in a livebirth.\n\n【20】First， we estimated that the patient's hypertension was drug-induced due to administration of PSL and TAC for approximately10 vears.\n\n【21】Second， we diagnosed an SLE flare and SPE during the second pregnancy. In the management of pregnancy in patients with SLE， differential diagnosis of SLE flares and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) is important because the treatment for an SLE flare is immunosuppression， while the final treatment for HDP is termination of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However， a differential diagnosis may be challenging for clinicians because both conditions present with proteinuria， hypertension， and lower-extremity edema， and may also have systemic effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In this case， we concluded that both SLE flare and SPE were present because immunosuppressive therapy did not control the disease； therefore，therapeutic termination at 20 weeks was done. A twin pregnancy is a strong possible cause of SPE at an early gestational age. Postpartum improvement of renal dysfunction and thrombocytopenia supports this diagnosis.\n\n【22】Third，wediscussedthesafetyofAssistedReproductiveTechnology(ART) in women with SLE. The most serious complication associated with ovarian stimulation and ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome is thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. To avoid thrombosis， selection of appropriate ovarian stimulation， a \"freeze all” strategy， and appropriate heparin administration should be performed， especially for those with Anti-Phospholipid Antibodies (APAs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. To avoid thrombosis in thawed ET， a natural ovulatory cycle is the first choice. If hormone replacement is necessary， non-oral natural estradiol andprogesterone should be administrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Furthermore， single ET should be performed to avoid the risks associated with multifetal pregnancy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. ART is not indicated in the women with acute flare， poorly controlled arterial hypertension， pulmonary hypertension， advanced renal disease， severe valvular or heart diseases， or major previous thrombotic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this case， we considered that the patient had alow risk ofthrombosis，because her anti-mullerian hormone was low (0.84 ng/mL)， her APAs were negative， and she had no previous episode of thrombosis. In addition， because her platelet count was>10×104 /uL， the risk ofovarian bleeding with Oocyte Retrieval (OR) was low. Therefore， we concluded that ovarian stimulation and OR were acceptable in this case.\n\n【23】Fourth， we discussed the validity of ET in this case as the patient’s BP was 120-130/90-100 mmHg with a relatively high diastolic BP. As mentioned in the introduction， the target BP is controversial in pregnancy in women with CH， with ISSHP，NICE，andACOG having different guidelines. In a retrospective analysis of 215 women with CH， Ueda et al. showed that systolic BP<130 mmHg within 14 weeks of gestation reduced the risk of developing early-onset SPE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. We(Kurashiki Central Hospital) participated in this study and recognized the importance of systolic BP control. In this case ET was performed in 2020 when the international guidelines for target diastolic BP ranged from 85 mmHg to 110 mmHg. Therefore， we believed ET to be acceptable in this case.\n\nLastly， we discussed Fertility Preservation (FP) in women with SLE， who are prohibited from getting pregnant. It is well accepted that SLE itself is not a cause of infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7，11，12\\]</u>. However，|删除段之间换行|administration of Cyclophosphamide (CPA) decreases ovarian reserve， resulting in decreased fertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7，11，12\\]</u>. Additionally， when a woman with SLE is advised not to conceive for a long period， her fertility decreases because of a decreased ovarian reserve and oocyte ageing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is demonstrated that clinicians should give information on FP，including cryopreservation of embryos/oocytes/ovarian tissue， to the female patients with SLE who are going to be administrated with CPA， in European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology(ESHRE) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Accordingly， FP counseling before CPA administration is a common practice at present. In Japan， there have been reports on this issue since删除4:<u> 2015</u>. However， FP counseling for women with SLE who are advised not to conceive for a long period is not yet a common practice； FP counseling for these women is not present in the ESHRE or ASRM guidelines. A review by Italian doctors showed that FP should be considered for women who are advised not to conceive for a long period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， suggesting that FP had been practical in Italy or European nations in these cases. However， we could not find such reports in English. We believe that FP for women prohibited from pregnancy is not yet a common practice because it is undetermined whether ART in women with SLE during a pregnancy-prohibited period is safe and effective. Additionally， we could not find the reports on FP in women with CH.\n\n【25】In conclusion， we present a woman with CH and SLE， in whom post-stillbirth depression and medical adherence improved during embryo preservation， resulting in systolic BP control and a livebirth. We reported this case because it provides in formation on FP in women with CH or SLE during pregnancy-prohibited period. However， the safety and effectiveness on this approach is undetermined，and careful consideration is necessary on a case-by-case basis.\n\n【26】Ethical Consideration\n\n【27】We have obtained the written informed consent from the patient for the publication of this report.

Hence， have a better quality oflife. Potentially Malignant Lesions (PML) such as leukoplakia， erythroplakia， smokeless tobacco keratosis， oral sub mucosal fibrosis， oral lichen planus， Condylom Acominatum and actinic queilitis， should be address in each consultation to prevent late stage diagnosis of oral cancer.\n\n【2】We present two cases from our hospital in Argentina， during this last year. Two clear examples of oral cancer and potentially malignant lesion， and we review the literature with the most updated information on early diagnosis and screening.\n\n【3】Keywords： Oral cancer， Oral mucosa cancer； Potentially malignant disease； Leukoplakia； Oral dysplasia\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Oral cancer annual estimated worldwide incidence is approximately 275，000， and it is increasing通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There is a broad geographic discrepancy in the incidence of the disease with two-thirds incurring in low and middle-income countries from Latin America as our patients in this article， South and South East Asia， and Eastern Europe. In South America and Caribean countries it is the 5h cancer in frequency in men and 6 in females. Brazil is the country with the highest reported prevalence， followed by Argentina and Uruguay with an average 5-year survival rate of approximately 60%. Over 90% are Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas (OSCC) in both males and females and is associated with invasion and destruction oflocal tissues and maxillofacial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Oral mucosal disorders with increased risk of cancer transformation are termed Potentially Malignant Disorders (PMDs) of the oral mucosa by the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Oral PMDs are categorized into leukoplakia， erythroplakia， actinic cheilosis， and oral submucous fibrosis， palatal keratosis associated with reverse smoking， oral lichen planus， discoid lupus erythematosus， and dyskeratosis congenita and epidermolysis bullosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The etiology of the previously mentioned disorders varies from genetic aberrations predisposing for altered tissue regeneration， inherited diseases， disorders caused by exogenous factors such as tobacco， alcohol， HPV， cannabis use， chronic inflammation and immune-mediated disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Case 1\n\n【9】Female patient， 90 years old， consul the dermatology department for a painful white lesion in the lateral border of the tongue， which persisted for over 6 months and measured 1.5 cm x0.5 cm in diameter . She had received fluconazole 150 mgs per week for 6 weeks and nystatine mouth wash without any response. Neither has she been a smoker nor a social alcohol drinker.No marihuana use or HPV diagnosed previously. In the ultrasound no adenopathy was observed. The histopathology report said moderate epithelial dysplasia . She refused to have surgery or any other treatment for now.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\nFemale patient of 74 years old， presented for an oral mucosal check up， reporting she was a smoker since 15 years of age of 1.800 cigarettes per year and alcohol drinker of 250 ml of gin three times a week. We observed an asymptomatic，4 mm×4 mm hard elastic lesion in the inferior left|删除段之间换行|oral mucosa beside the retro molar area with palpable submandibular nodes in the same side . The histopathology report came back with a diagnosis of squamous epithelial carcinoma .\n\n【12】The most common form of potentially malignant disease is leukoplakia with a worldwide estimated prevalence of 2.6%. Its overall malignant transformation rate is up to 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， the extent and rate of progression of dysplasia in leukoplakia is not uniform and can vary from site to site and within the same lesion， so predicting malignant transformation is problematic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>.\n\nThere have been reports on oral mucosa vital stains used to help|删除段之间换行|select the specific area of a PMD for a biopsy， such as 1% Methylene Blue， Lugol solution or 1% Toluidine Blue. The latter， is said to have90% sensibility， 69% specificity and less toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Apart from the mentioned stains， there are also adjuvants for cancer detecting based on light and spectrophotometry， which show different absorption and reflection between healthy tissues and those with structural and metabolic disorders. Some other method is the oral cytology， obtaining epithelial cells from the mucosal surface through rubbing with a cytobrush and using light microscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Sperandio et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> published a retrospective study evaluating dysplasia and aneuploidy(the change in the chromosome number) in biopsies of lesions with clinical suspicion of malignancy. They showed that dysplasia and aneuploidy gave a higher predictive value than any other technique for malignancy.\n\n【14】The incidence of head and neck cancer subsets such as cancers of lip， oral cavity， larynx， hypo pharynx， and nasopharynx has declined significantly during the past 20 years in the United States and other developed countries，largely due to declines in the habit of tobacco smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-12\\]</u>. In contrast to this pattern， the incidence of oropharyngeal and oral tongue cancers has significantly increased during the same period， attributed to increased acquisition of oral Human Papilloma Virus (HR-HPV) types 16 and 18 probably related to an increase of oral sex practice通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The reason of most failures to treatment after oral cancer diagnoses is the late arrival to it. It is usually diagnosed in advance stages (IIIandIV)，larger than 4 cm or with metastasis， with a survival of 20% to 50%.On the other hand， if diagnosed in stage II， or I the survival is between 50% till 80%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The most important determinant factor in cancer survival is diagnostic delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Additionally， the morbidity associated with surgery is high； the probability of a second primary tumor is greater than any other type of cancer (3% to 7%annually) which is frequently the cause of death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Important risk factors in the development of the Potentially Malignant Disease (PMD) or in oral cancer are tobacco， alcohol， HPV， betel quid， age， male gender and sunlight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The known carcinogenetic compounds known today in tobacco smoking which can have primary role in oral cancer development are： Butadiene， Naphthylamine， Amino biphenyl， Benzene， Acetaldehyde， Ethylene oxide， Formaldehyde， Toluidine， Vinyl chloride， and metals such as Arsenic， Beryllium， Cadmium， Chromium (VI)， Lead and Nickel compounds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. People especially in India and Sweden consume smokeless tobacco and areca nut (betel quid) which both contain psychoactive products nicotine in the case of tobacco and arecoline in the case of areca nut 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，18\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Heavy drinkers and smokers have 38 times the risk of developing oral cancer compared to abstainers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. This is thought to be due to acetaldehyde， the first metabolite of alcohol， which is classified as a Group 1 carcinogen and is also present in tobacco 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Epidemiological evidence from USA populations indicates a strong association between HPV and oropharyngeal cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Update information from the United States of America show a substantial increase of HPV-positive 16 and 18 in oropharyngeal cancers， rising by 225% in the period between 1984 and 2004 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\nRecreational Cannabis smoking has importantly increased among individuals all around the world raising the hypothesis of a role as a risk factor for oropharyngeal and oral tongue cancer通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Nevertheless， epidemiologic studies that have overlooked the|删除段之间换行|association of marijuana use with head and neck oral cancers have been inconsistent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Marks in et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>2013 observed that cannabis use was inversely associated with oral tongue cancer， which is similar to what has been reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-26\\]</u>. The rationalization to this finding is related to the major bioactive cannabinoid compound found in marijuana smoke， D-Tetra Hydro Cannabinol \\[D-THC\\]， which has been shown to have anti carcinogenic potentialities through engagement of specific cell surface receptors CB1， expressed on a variety of cell types and CB2 present predominantly on a variety of immune cells， suppressing the release of inflammatory products with an antitumor effects as a consequence through strengthening of apoptosis， arrest of uncontrolled cell growth， and down regulation of angiogenesis and cellular migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，28\\]</u>. Conclusions to marijuana and cancer should be taken with caution as the pooled analysis of 9 case control studies from USA and Latin America in2014 showed heterogeneity through the measurement of marijuana use， study sample recruitment， demographic and other risk factors for HNSCC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The immunohistochemistry markers are not usually used as a routine. They are still used for investigation protocol. The only one that is used in certain histopathology laboratories is the protein Ki-67 (also called MKI67). This protein is exclusively observed in those cells， which are in proliferation process in human tumors， in cell cycle G1， S， G2 and M. Its high expression is related to worse outcome according to a recent Meta analysis 29\\].\n\n【21】Saliva is a valuable body fluid for disease diagnosis， due to its noninvasive nature， and has been increasingly used as a source for discovery of oral cancer biomarkers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. The ability to detect molecules in saliva from patients with head and neck cancer and defining abnormal values is a critical step before the clinical implementation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Salivary molecules have already been proposed as potential oral cancer biomarkers. For example， salivary soluble CD44， salivary Cyfra 21-1， tissue polypeptide anti-gene， and CA125have been proposed as oral cancer markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Nevertheless， no single bio molecule has been shown to meet the real-world requirement for high accuracy in identifying early disease onset， suggesting that multiple biomarker candidates are needed for high accuracy and sensitivity in detecting OSCCs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. End products of free radical damage and nitrite levels are importantly increased in individuals with oral leukoplakia. Reciprocally， levels of glutathione S-transferase and uric acid are decreased. An elevated level of reactive species with a concomitant reduction in antioxidants in leukoplakia denotes its potential as an early diagnostic marker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Evidence shows that a visual oral examination of high-risk individuals is a cost-effective screening strategy and the development and use of adjunctive aids together with biomarkers is becoming increasingly common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. The gold standard method for diagnosis of oral cancer today， is still the traditional biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\nOral cancer is a significant worldwide healthcare matter， its incidence is increasing and late-stage presentation is common with high mortality and morbidity. Oral examination of high-risk individuals is a cost-effective screening strategy. Screening programmes must be implemented for oral cancer and potentially malignant disease detection， especially leukoplakia. Till today there is no molecular or even histopathological pathognomonic hallmark that can predict malignant transformation of a PMD， the accurate|删除段之间换行|clinical observation of oral lesions remains the only way to control the development of oral cancer and the biopsy is today still the gold standard but biomarkers use is becoming more common and helpful each year.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It is increasing in some world regions when compared to adults and the incidence increase from one year to the next and more predominant among boys than girls 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The most common presenting symptoms of urolithiasis in children are abdominal or flank pain， dysuria， oliguria， hematuria， sterile pyuria， urinary tract infection and vomiting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this regard， our case report the girl was presented with hematuria and flank pain.\n\n【19】Calcium oxalate stones are radiolucent and the main difference from uric acid stones which are also radiolucent and have identical chemical reactivity.

Although the identification of DHA on a stone analysis is highly suggestive， there can be a false identification of DHA as a kidney stone component by infrared and ultraviolet spectrophotometry and/or X-ray crystallography.

Probiotics-induced adverse drug reactions like， urticaria is an unusual incidence and here we found an event of probiotics-induced acute urticaria.\n\n【2】Case Description： An 18-month-oldpediatric patient was suffering from diarrhea for last 2 days and took the consultation of a doctor. He was prescribed with probiotics (a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus-2 billion， Lactobacillus bulgaricus-1 billion and Bifidobacterium bifidum-1 billion) at a dose： one capsule per day orally. On the day one， the patient was experienced with probiotics-induced acute urticaria just after 3 and half hour of ingestion，and most of the symptoms of urticaria were resolved within 4 hr to 5 hrs without any anti-allergy medication. Same incidence happened in the second day. As per the doctor's advice， probiotics were discontinued and he was not experienced with any allergic reaction， after that.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Any drug may be treated as an allergen by a living human body and consequently， may develop allergic reactions such as， urticaria. Although，probiotics are considered as safe drugs， but in our case， we found a usual probiotics-induced acute urticaria case in a pediatric patient.\n\n【4】Keywords： Acute Urticaria； Probiotics； Adverse Drug Reactiona\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Acute urticaria， also known as hives， characterized by episodic， pale red， pruritic edematous lesions (wheals) on the skin， as a result of body's unpleasant symptomatic response to an allergen with or without a known etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Probiotics are host friendly live microorganisms that are helpful for reestablishing host's beneficial microbial flora in the digestive system and this concept was established in the20h century through a hypothesis proposed by a Russian scientist and won a Nobel Prize. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN) have uniquely defined probiotics as live microorganisms， which， when administered in adequate amounts， confer a health benefit on the host’通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Probiotics， such as L. acidophilus，L. bulgaricus and B. bifidum are widely used as probiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and adverse reaction with any of these probiotics is not recorded to date. We found a case of acute urticaria (an adverse drug reaction) followed by the oral administration of above mentioned probiotics in a pediatric patient.\n\nA 18-month-old healthy male pediatric (toddler) patient went to a doctor (out-door) of a tertiary level hospital in Dhaka， Bangladesh with the complain of lose stool， persistently occurred for last 2 days with a frequency of 3-4 times a day and only oral rehydration saline (ORS) was administered in home. During consultation， doctor prescribed a probiotic combination in hard capsule form containing L. acidophilus (2billion)， L. bulgaricus (1 billion) and B. bifidum (1 billion)， at a dose： one capsule once a day， orally for the next 10 days for the treatment of diarrhea. Adequate ORS intake was advised for rehydration in the prescription. On that day， patients body weight was|删除段之间换行|10.8 Kg， blood pressure was 100 over 55 mmHg and pulse rate was120 beats per minute. The patient took the first dose (1 capsule) of the probiotics in the afternoon of the same day. After about 3 andhalf hour of administration， he developed acute urticaria characterized by pale red wheals with itchy and swelled feature， mostly in the chest and back . Patient looked fatigue. About 4 hr to 5 hours later， most of the pale read wheals were disappeared and itchiness reduced， significantly without taking any medication for that allergic reaction. The patient's parents were confused with that incidence of the first day and again experienced with the same incidence on the second day with probiotics ， which was again resolved after 4 hr to 5 hrs of ingestion without any sequelae except， mild itchiness in the chest and back. On the third day， parents avoided the ingestion of probiotics to their child and took him to doctor， immediately. His probiotic was stopped and by this time， his diarrhea was resolved. The pediatric patient was prescribed with syrup Chlorpheniramine Maleate (1 mg twice a day， orally) for his mild itchiness and he had not been experienced with any allergic symptom in the following days.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nUrticaria is an unpleasant adverse cutaneous reaction that may occur without any perception with a prevalence of 0.5% to 1% in population. The primary symptom of urticaria is pruritus.According to the symptoms’duration of stay and presence of stimulus/antigen， urticaria is generally classified as acute， chronic and physical 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Any urticaria， size ranges from few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter，lasts for less than 6 weeks called， acute urticaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In some cases， skin lesions may last forless than 48 hrs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It appears suddenly in response to a trigger， which may be a viral infection or an allergen， such as drug， food and insect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

Urticaria mostly occurs in the range of 20-40 years of age. Urticaria with a deeper swelling is called， angioedema. Generally， urticaria is occurred due to the activation of mast cell by both immunologic and non-immunologic mechanisms， which causes the release of inflammatory mediators， such as cytokines， histamine， leukotrienes and prostaglandins. These mediators increase vascular permeability which as a result， develops edema and pruritus. Mast cells are widely distributed throughout the body and possess Immunoglobulin E(IgE) receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A study on 411 pediatric patients found that 76.4% patients are experienced with acute urticaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Approximately30% urticarias are chronic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. An acute urticaria was observed in that pediatric patient with mild angiedema and severe pruritus， and|删除段之间换行|resolved within a period of less than 48 hrs.\n\n【10】A data analysis report showed that drug-induced urticaria and fixed drug rashes are most frequently occurred with carbamazepine(16.23%)， phenytoin (15.15%) and cotrimoxazole (13.53%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The age of the patients is an important factor for occurring any type of cutaneous drug eruptions. Geriatric patients， boys younger than 3years and girls older than 9 years have been found more susceptible to drug-induced skin eruptions. Several factors of the culprit drugs are responsible for the skin eruption likes， urticaria and factors are： route of administration， dose of the drug， frequency of dosing， duration and drug-metabolism pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the current case， urticaria was developed in that boy with the ingestion of oral probiotics， significantly.\n\n【11】Probiotics are orally ingestible and nondigestible drug products that help to reestablish the naturally developed beneficiary host-microbiota in the digestive tract and synbiotics are formed when probioticsincluded inthecurrent intestinalmicrobiota 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.Hundreds of different bacterial species are living in the intestine and among the intestinal microbes， those are beneficial for host's health， are termed as probiotics.

This diagnosis was based on both immunohistological and PET/CT findings.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 62-year-old male with no medical history complained of left orbit pain and decreased visual acuity for a period of 6 months. Physical examination was negative.\n\n【10】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a homogenous relatively well-defined intraconal mass lesion in the left orbit isointense on T1 sequences and hyperintense on T2 sequences . The patient underwent a left orbitectomy and histopathological examination of the excised mass was consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma with an immunohistological profile suggestive of lung or thyroid origin (CK+， TTF1+， CK20-). Serum tumor markers were negative. PET/CT performed as a part of the initial process revealed a mild IF-FDG uptake in an apical nodule of the upper right lobe with pretracheal lymph nodes involvement and lytic bone metastasis on the right temporal bone and the sternum . Thyroid gland was normal on both F-FDG PET/CT and ultrasound examination. A diagnosis of primary malignancy in the lung with metastases was made based on immunohistological profile of the orbital mass and FDG PET/CT findings， since lung biopsy had not been made. The patient was treated with 6 courses of palliative chemotherapy according to the protocol paclitaxel and carboplatine， followed by radiotherapy on the orbital lesion(30 Gy spread over 10 sessions). Follow up F-FDG PET/CT showed recurrence of the left orbital mass that appears hypermetabolic . The patient is still alive 10 months after the diagnosis of his metastatic cancer.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nCarcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) represents a heterogeneous group of metastatic malignancies for which no primary site of the tumor can be identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The anatomical site of origin remains occult after checking patient history， careful clinical examination and extensive|删除段之间换行|diagnostic workup. These efforts to detect the primary tumor ar often time consuming， expensive and so unsuccessful.\n\n【13】Because of its high sensitivity， IF-FDG PET/CT may be an interesting alternative to other radiological investigations in detecting the unknown primary tumor. Elective use of PET-CT is currently limited to patients with squamous-celllymphadenopathy of the neck(cervical carcinoma of unknown primary site). In these patients， PET-CT may guide the biopsy， determine the extent of disease， facilitate the planning of radiation therapy， and help with surveillance通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In contrast， the value ofF-FDG PET/CT is less well studied in CUP patients with extra cervical metastases. Moller et al. reviewed the utility of lF-FDG PET/CT as a diagnostic test in patients with extra cervical CUP site.BF-FDG PET/CT detected the primary tumor site in 39.5% patients with extra cervical CUP. The lung was the most commonly detected primary tumor site， accounting for 50% of all cases. The pooled estimated sensitivity， specificity， and accuracy for LBF-FDG PET/CT in the detection of the primarytumor site was 87%，88%， and 87.5%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Orbital metastases from malignantt tumors are relatively uncommon.

Tramadol is commonly used in place of other potent opioid analgesics for treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain associated with osteoarthritis， rheumatoid arthritis， and low back pain and neuropathic conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. There are controversies about the seizure inducing effect oftramadol. Some earlier studies suggested that Tramadol when given in overdose in patients with extant disorder of seizure or when used along with antidepressants， alcohol etc. instigates seizure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. It was also disclosed from other studies that Tramadol also instigates seizure when used as monotherapy in approved dose. It has also been found that appearance of seizure following tramadol use is not dose dependant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， in our patient the seizure occurred at a dose of 37.5 mg oral tramadol hydrochloride. Tramadol-induced seizures have been reported to be generalized tonic-clonic in nature， without aura and focal deficit， as seen in our patient. Tramadol has very less abuse potential when compared to other opioids. So， it is prescribed very commonly in clinical practice. A recent cross-sectional study conducted by Labate et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> in 2005 examined 106 patients with tramadol induced seizure found the entire patient had tonic clonic seizure within 12 h of oral intake of tramadol in supratherapeutic and recommended doses.

Tramadol induced seizure may be associated with agitation， tachycardia， confusion and hypertension， leading to serotonin syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the present case， the continuing tachycardia ranging from 120 bpm to140 bpm was found to be the only salient observation that could be accountable to low serotonergic action.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Tramadol has been otherwise a safe drug over many years； however with evidence of serious reaction like seizure even at low doses， the scientific community should consider ensuring strict pharmacovigilance with respect to its use especially in the developing countries where such monitoring systems are inadequate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Transthoracic echocardiography  confirmed the presence of VSD but no evidence of endocardial vegetation was found. According to ESC guidelines， we performed a transesophageal echocardiography. No vegetation was detected but we noted a hypoechogenic thickening near the VSD ， probably due to turbulent flow. We think it’s very likely that this zone can favor bacterial growth， which was prevented by the presence of rapid flow at this level； however， microlesions created by the turbulent flow itself may have triggered transient bacterial permanence.\n\n【23】The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g once daily and blood culture， 4 weeks later， were negative.\n\n【24】Obstetric ultrasounds showed no fetal suffering.

Transmission occurs mainly via inhalation of respiratory or aerosol droplets from an infected person， produced via coughing and sneezing. Consequently， due to its rapid spread， a meeting held on January 30h，2020， as per the International Health Regulations(IHR， 2005)， World Health Organization declared the outbreak as a disease of Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission. Anadditional landmark occurred on February 26h，2020， as the first case of the disease， not imported from China， was recorded in the United States (US) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【2】Evidence suggests that environmental factors play a significant role in influencing SARS-CoV-2\n\n【3】transmission though there is still limited information regarding its spread into the environment. The major environmental factors that can lead to a quicker spread of SARS-CoV-2 include water， air， faecal matter，handling of used face masks， and other medical wastes according to the World Health Organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Even though most enveloped viruses are not usually excreted in faeces or urine， there is increased evidence that SARS-CoV-2，or at least their genomes， are excreted in faeces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. If infective viruses are excreted into the environment， faecal contamination could be a major transmission route and people could be exposed by interacting with water contaminated with untreated faecal matter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Discarding face masks and empty bottles of hand sanitizers together with tissue papers results in a huge pile of medical waste in the environment. Discarding of face masks and empty bottles of hand sanitizers together with tissue papers results in a huge pile of medical waste in the environment. Workers involved in the collection of garbage and maintaining the city clean on a daily basis are at high risk of contracting the virus from respiratory shed droplets that could be on discarded masks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Arising from this fact， it is therefore， imperative to explore the various environmental characteristics that would drive the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through a One Health approach and also identify potential environmental foci and how it may enhance the rapid spread of the infection among the human population. The potential environmental factors identified1wouldenable policy-makers to plan for sustainable collaborative environmental intervention strategies.\n\n【6】Lusaka being centrallylocated has the potential to drive the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to other parts of the country if effective and efficient sustainable interventions are not in place. Although sociocultural factors including movement patterns， people's livelihood， and way of life have been demonstrated to influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics， the role of environmental risk factors had not yet been documented. Against the evidence from the literature indicating environmental contamination， it was important to investigate the contribution of environmental risk factors in the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia.\n\n【7】Aim of the Studv\n\n【8】The aim of this study is to investigate environmental risk factors contributing to the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia.\n\n【9】Methods\n\n【10】A cross-sectional study was conducted in selected SARS-CoV-2-affected households in the Lusaka district from September to December，删除4:<u> 2020</u>. A purposive sampling technique was used to select SARS-CoV-2 affected households from Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI) database following positive SARS-CoV-2diagnosis. The rationale for selecting the affected households was to maximize the chances of identifying contaminated surfaces that plaved a critical role in the transmission of the virus and also describe the methods of disposal used for face masks. Furthermore， the Lusaka district was one of the epicenters having recorded a high number of SARS-CoV-2 cases.\n\nEnvironmental samples were collected from door knobs/handles， taps， light switch， floor surfaces， work top surfaces， beddings， remote controls and mobile phones using the DaAnGene 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u> sample|删除段之间换行|collection， transport， and processing procedure for tissue and cytopathological analysis specimen preservation. In order to increase the positive predictive value of the environmental sampling process， multiple swabs were taken for each sampling area. The samples were triple packaged and transported to the University of Zambia， School of Veterinary Medicine， BSL3 Virology Laboratory within 24 h after collection.\n\n【12】Total RNAwas extracted from the environmental samples using QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time RT-PCR assays were carried out using The DaAnGene 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u> detection procedure was utilized to identify the presence ofSARS-CoV-2according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To ensure the safety of research assistants and research team members during the training， travel，and data collection process， the use of appropriate PPE and physical distancing was practiced. Extraction of RNA was done in a biosafety level -3 laboratory.\n\n【13】Epidemiological data were collected using a pre-tested close-ended questionnaire to capture exposure risk factors that could lead to household contamination such as the type of dwelling， household size， age， gender， occupation， and cultural practices such as funerals and religious gatherings. Further， the respondents were asked to provide information on methods of disposal of used face masks. Participants were identified by codes to ensure anonymity.\n\n【14】Data were analyzed using the statistical software package SPSS version 21 and all the statistical tests were determined at a5% significance level. The proportion of infected households was determined by dividing the number of positive householdsby the total number ofhouseholds tested similarly， the percentage contamination of surfaces or articles was estimated using the same approach.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】A total of 40 respondents as shown in Table 1 from SARS-CoV-2 affected households were interviewed with a breakdown of 55% (22/40) representing males while 45% (22/40) representing females. From this total， 37.5%(15/40) resided in a 1 to 3 roomed house， 32.5%(13/40) resided in a 4 to 7 roomed house and 30%(12/40) resided in >7 roomed house. A breakdown of face mask use was： 75% (30/40) disclosed using recyclable face masks while 25%(10/40) none recyclable face masks. Of the 38 pooled environmental surfaces swabbed and analyzed， 21.05% (8/38) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 contamination. The breakdown was as follows： - cell phones at 10.53%(4/38)， door knobs at 5.26%(2/38)， the beddings and remote control were 2.63%(1/38) and 2.63%(1/38) respectively. A. correlation coefficient of 0.25 was documented for the association between occupancy density and surface contamination.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only 21.05% of all environmental samples tested. Among the environmental surfaces swabbed， mobile cell phones were more prominently significant to contain SARS-CoV-2 compared with the other environmental surfaces. These results show that there is a risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 via mobile cell phones if the appropriate SARS-CoV-2 health guidelines of hygiene are not maintained. A study conducted by Chin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， reported that SARS-CoV-2 was viable in the environment at 4°C for a long time however this reduced with a raise in temperature， and at70°C the virus was inactivated in 5 min. This therefore shows that the environment and human behavioral conditions have a critical role in transmitting the virus. Thus， the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2\n\n【19】Table 1： Sociodemographic characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination.\n\n| Variable  | Mean (SD)/n (%)  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age  | 28.43(13.13)  |\n| Gender  |  |\n| Males  | 22(55%)  |\n| Females  | 18(45%)  |\n| Marital status  |  |\n| Single  | 8 (20%)  |\n| Separated  | 6(15%)  |\n| Marriec  | 25(62.5%)  |\n| Widow  | 1(2.5%)  |\n| Number of Occupants per Household  |  |\n| 1-3 Roomed House  | 9(32.1%)  |\n| 4-7 Roomed House  | 11(39.2%)  |\n| Greater than7 Roomed House  | 8(28.6%)  |\n| Type of Face Mask used  |  |\n| Recyclable  | 30(75%)  |\n| None recyclable  | 10(25%)  |\n| Disposal Method for None Recyclable  |  |\n| Incineration  | 3(30%)  |\n| Indiscriminate  | 7(70%)  |\n| Positive Environmental Surfaces  |  |\n| Remote control  | 1(2.63%)  |\n| Beddings  | 1(2.63%)  |\n| Door knob  | 2(5.26%)  |\n| Cell phone  | 4(10.53%)  |\n\n【21】from one person to another via contaminated environmental surfaces can be higher if appropriate disinfection measures are less rigorously respected and not adequately conducted upon detection of SARS-CoV-2 cases from different households.\n\n【22】Solid waste materials generated from households with infected or suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases may contain traces of SARS-CoV-2and could be a source of infection for people within and outside the households. As recently discovered， SARS-CoV-2 can stay on hard surfaces for long periods of time， specifically， 72 h on plastic， 48 h on stainless steel and 24 h on paper and cardboard. Therefore， a72-h-delay in the collection does not seem to be sufficient to ensure safety and may lead to SARS-CoV-2 infection amongst solid waste collectors. A poor management of solid waste can possibly increase the chances of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the environment due to transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 through respiratory means and physical touch. Apart from human-to-human transmission，droplets may also stay active on surfaces where the virus could remain viable. Thus， the immediate environment of an infected individual can serve as a source oftransmission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\nThe study had revealed that the majority of the respondents were using recyclable face masks. The research further established that almost all the closer contacts of SARS-CoV-2 cases at household level were putting on face masks to prevent any possibility of contracting and spreading the virus. This is in agreement with a study conducted by Nzediegwu and Chang， which noted that the total number of face|删除段之间换行|masks used during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak had increased and this depended on the number of contacts closer to SARS-CoV-2 cases， number of occupants per household， face masks acceptance rate(percent) and average daily face masks per capita.\n\n【24】This research established that most of the SARS-CoV-2 cases were reported in both densely and low densely populated sub-districts and that most of the transmissions occurred between household members as described by Hui et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 cases were residing in a three-roomed household structure with an average family size of nine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>. The occupancy density was noticed to be higher particularly in densely populated households thereby increasing the chances of SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. The findings clearly show the importance of testing close contacts of SARS-CoV-2 cases to promptly identify and isolate infections in the incubation period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，16\\]</u>. This would also be appropriate if the lower estimated transmission probability of SARS-CoV-2 during the illness period than during the incubation period could be partially attributed to self-distancing within households when the primary cases developed symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. The estimated probability of daily SARS-CoV-2 transmission was higher in households of six people or less than in larger households (more than six people).\n\n【25】Study Limitations\n\n【26】This study was only done in Lusaka and particularly targeted households with affected cases of COVID-19. The results of this study cannot be generalized to the whole Zambian population however； the study provides initial scientific baseline data regarding the environmental risks contributing to the transmission of COVID-19factors. This can help in refining policies that will target the prevention of potential environmental surfaces that would enhance the further spread of COVID-19 in the population.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】There is a need to ensure that active case finding and isolation in conjunction with comprehensive contact tracing and quarantine are instituted for preventing infected contacts from spreading the virus during their incubation periods. The positive samples documented were indicative of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 on environmental surfaces. It is thus， plausible to conjecture that the environment could have played a role as a source of infection for SARS-CoV-2in Zambia. There is a need to also explore the long-term association of environmental and climate indicators with the SARS-CoV-2pandemic and to study the inter-district and provincial responses towards the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak to provide a better outlook for understanding the spread of SARS-COV-2. Furthermore， we recommend that bank notes should also be investigated as environmental surfaces which significantly contribute to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Zambia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Although usually diagnosed in the first decades of life， it is possible that manifestations are not recognized at older ages. This article aims to report the case of a 70-year-old female patient， admitted to the emergency department with delirium， and who， after ruling out organic causes， was diagnosed with a rare mitochondrial syndrome. The detailed evaluation of the case allowed the diagnosis of MELAS syndrome， with symptoms manifesting late. In this report， the importance of possible differential diagnoses regarding encephalopathies of atypical course is highlighted， even in patients with advanced ages.\n\n【2】Keywords： MELAS； Delirium； Mitochondrial Diseases； Older adults\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】MELAS (Mitochondrial myopathy， Encephalopathy， Lactic Acidosis and Stroke) syndrome is one of the most common mitochondrial diseases， although its prevalence is rare (0.18 cases per100，000 population/year) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. There are reports of more than 30 pathogenic variants related to this syndrome， as the m.3243A>G mutation is known as the most commonly found. It is a mitochondrial DNA pathogenic variant， and maternal relatives of patients with the syndrome may carry this mutation without showing symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The prognosis of patients with MELAS is quite unfavorable， with rapid and aggressive progression； thus， patients hardly ever reach advanced ages and only 1% to 6% of cases occur after the age of 40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Especially for patients at older ages， MELAS syndrome manifests as cumulative multi-organ disease with broad manifestations that are relatively common to agingpopulation including stroke-like episodes， dementia， hearing impairment， muscle weakness and diabetes. Such impairments， evaluated separately， would hardly be attributed to a rare genetic syndrome， especially in an older patient and could possibly be undiagnosed. Similarly， the syndrome may course with cognitive deterioration in different degrees， and its manifestations may mimic an acute confusion condition， that could be attributed to other cause or even and undefined etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】This case report aims to describe a patient with an initial clinical manifestation of delirium， which， after extensive investigation， led to a late diagnosis of MELAS syndrome. Previous cognitive alterations， history of familial migraine，neuroimaging exams， and a positive family history with the pathogenic variant m.3243A>G helped in the diagnostic conclusion.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】cited.\n\n【9】A 70-year-old white female patient was admitted to the emergency room with a history of psychomotor agitation and worsening of disorientation that began the day before admission. Her comorbidity history was referred by a son and consisted of systemic arterial hypertension， type II diabetes mellitus not properly controlled， visual and auditory impairment since the age of 50， and no history of smoking. During her medical history， it was also reported that， approximately a year before， the patient had a stroke， manifested with aphasia and transient motor deficit (right hemiparesis). Since then， she had been apathetic， with periods of disorientation and psychomotor agitation， associated with tonic-clonic seizures. She presented a neuroimaging exam that showed previous ischemic insults. In the first 24 h of hospitalization， the patient presented with decreased level of consciousness associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures， with gasping respiratory pattern， being submitted to orotracheal intubation in the emergency room and referred to the intensive care unit for neurological monitoring and hemodynamic control.\n\n【10】During the investigation， Computed Tomography (CT) of the skull demonstrated cortical-subcortical hypodensities in the left temporal and occipital region with liquor density， suggesting encephalomalacia due to a previous ischemic event， and another temporal cortical-subcortical hypodensity on the right， suggesting another area of ischemia. Laboratory testing showed elevated blood glucose， with no evidence of bacterial infection and negative viral serological markers. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and repolarization alteration； transthoracic echocardiogram with preserved cardiac function and mild mitral insufficiency； doppler of carotids showed no obstructions. Sedation was discontinued a couple of days after but the patient did not recover consciences.\n\n【11】Furthermore， an electroencephalogram was performed， which showed no epileptiform seizure pattern， as well as a control CT scan of the skull， with no evidence of acute ischemic or hemorrhagic events. Thus， it was decided to collect Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)， which showed elevated lactate (58 mg/dl-RV： 9-19 mg/dl)， with no other alterations. During hospitalization， the patient underwent skull Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MRI) due to clinical worsening， demonstrating an alteration in the cortical-subcortical intensity of the temporal lobes，hyperintense on T2 and FLAIR， notably to the left. Contrast enhancement in the thalamic capsular vascular lesion， on the left. Lentiform nucleus has hypersignal on FLAIR， hypoxic-ischemic lesion， dilatation of the ventricular system . Cranial arterial and venous angioresonance was also performed， which showed no evidence of aneurysmal dilatation or stenosis.\n\nRegarding clinical evolution， the patient underwent treatment for subsequent infectious conditions， required dialysis therapy with recovery of renal function and， due to the indispensability of|删除段之间换行|mechanical ventilation without neurological recovery， needed a tracheostomy. Approximately 90 days after admission， the patient evolved with refractivity to the instituted treatments， with progressive clinical worsening and death in the intensive care unit.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Genetic diseases involving pathogenic variants are more prevalent in youngpatients， rarely developing symptoms after the age of 65. Among the diseases caused by pathogenic variants， one of the most frequent is MELAS syndrome. The manifestations of MELAS are typical in childhood， with a prevalence of 65% to 76% of affected individuals presenting symptoms until the age of 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Although the onset of MELAS manifestations is more typical in young patients， this case report shows a later onset of symptoms.\n\n【15】MELAS syndrome is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the decreased ability of cells to produce sufficient energy in the form of Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate (ATP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. Dysfunctional mitochondria are unable to generate enough ATP to meet the energy needs of various organs，particularly those with high energy demands， including the nervous system， skeletal and cardiac muscles，kidneys， liver， and endocrine system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【16】MELAS involves multiple organ involvement with diverse clinical manifestations， including neurological symptoms， lactic acidosis， myopathy， recurrent headaches， hearing impairment， psychiatric， renal， gastrointestinal， and endocrine disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Symptoms develop when the metabolic demands of the body exceed the available energy supply of the defective mitochondria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The most com manifestations of MELAS include altered level of consciousness， stroke-like e episodes， focall or generalized1 seizures， migraine headaches， and dementia. Stroke-like episodes are so described because they do not present an ischemic etiology， and the affected areas do not correspond to the classical vascular distributions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，9\\]</u>.\n\nThe reported patient initially presented with two important clinical manifestations： Acute onset disorientation and psychomotor agitation， attributed at first to a delirium possibly superimposed on a previous neurodegenerative condition. Acute changes in the emergency department have a high prevalence in patients over 65years of age. Commonly， these patients are rashly diagnosed with delirium， and the organic cause is often not identified. Delirium is defined as an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome marked by cognitive and behavioral changes. It comprises a brain dysfunction， with|删除段之间换行|multifactorial etiology， of abrupt onset and fluctuating course. Delirium is a common disease， but 55% to 80% of cases are not recognized and are not documented by the clinical team treating the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，10\\]</u>. Initially， the management involves identifying several etiologies， such as： Psychoactive drugs， hydroelectrolytic alterations， severe pain， hypoxemia， severe anemia， infections， and significant immobility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-14\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In the present case， after excluding the most common etiologies that trigger delirium， the presence of clinical manifestations， such as seizures， decreased level of consciousness and behavioral changes， associated with a history of recurrent headaches， psychiatric alterations and maternal family history， and neuroimaging exams， stimulates clinical reasoning focused on differential and uncommon diagnoses of other encephalopathies. After a joint investigation of the clinical， family， laboratory， and imaging history， it is concluded to be a rare mitochondrial syndrome.\n\n【19】As a genetic disease with hereditary characteristics， MELAS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with polygenic mutations， inherited from the mother， of the mitochondrial DNA通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Thus， a rigorous review of family history is of great importance， especially in relation to maternal antecedents， including a history of migraine， exercise intolerance， and psychiatric alterations. In the clinical case reported here， the family history proved to be of enormous magnitude to hypothesize MELAS as a possible diagnosis.\n\n【20】As well as the clinical history， the radiological examination is extremely important to aid in the diagnosis， since the lesions are similar to stroke in the temporal， occipital and parietal regions. The affected areas do not correspond to the classical vascular distributions， presenting an irregular distribution， well associated with metabolic or small vessel etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the reported case， neuroimaging exams showed cortico-subcortical alterations in temporal and occipital regions， on the left， and thalamus， justifying the symptoms presented， such as migraine and neuropsychiatric alterations.\n\n【21】The managementofMELAS syndromeinvolves a multidisciplinary approach， with lifestyle modification by means of diet and physical exercises， in addition to symptomatic treatment and treatment of complications. There is no drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration or therapeutic protocol established to date for the treatment of MELAS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u>. Affected individuals need to be evaluated globally， with assessment of the organs most affected by the disease and should be followed up at regular intervals to monitor progression， with screening for possible complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. One of the most important behavioral measures is smoking cessation since it can worsen mitochondrial dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Among the treatments， supplements， such as antioxidants and cofactors， are being used in MELAS syndrome based on limited clinical trials， for example， L-arginine and citrulline， which aim to increase the availability of nitric oxide， leading to an improvement in vasodilation and， consequently， blood flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>. More studies are still needed to effectively establish a drug therapy that can interfere with the prognosis and improve the quality of life of patients with MELAS， especially those with a later diagnosis.\n\nThe case reported here demonstrates the importance of screening and initial evaluation of older patients with delirium or acute encephalopathy， reinforcing the concept of the need to perform a detailed review of the clinical history of these patients， including family history. It is emphasized the importance of expanding the range of differential diagnoses when the most prevalent and common|删除段之间换行|etiologies are discarded or when the evolution of the case presents clinical manifestations that do not confirm the context of delirium. The present report also emphasizes that MELAS disease， although rare， may be diagnosed in older patients and it is possible that the incidence is underestimated due to underdiagnosis.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Acute neurological conditions are highly prevalent in patients over 65 years of age in the emergency department； therefore， detecting their etiology might be challenging. In cases that present with unusual clinical manifestations and atypical evolution， less prevalent diagnostic hypotheses should be considered. Mitochondrial pathologies， although more common in young people， can mimic an acute neurological condition in older adults. Although there is an unfavorable and progressive evolution， without therapeutic possibility， the diagnosis of MELAS is fundamental for the planning of patient comfort care and support in the face ofunfavorable evolution. The diagnosis also allows genetic counseling of family members and its better recognition and investigation in future studies，contributing to the understanding of the causative mechanisms of this disease and therapeutic possibilities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Clinical examination revealed the presence of a pulsating mass at the level of the middle third of the arm. Left radial and ulnar pulses were present.\n\n【16】Thepatient was a former smoker withhypertension and COPD. He also had a history of end-stage renal disease due to Post-Streptococcal Glomerulonephritis， for which he started hemodialysis by a left radio-cephalic Arteriovenous Fistula (AVF) 20 years previously. He subsequently underwent a successful renal transplant and surgical AVF's closure 11 years previously and had been administered immunosuppressive and steroid therapy to prevent renal rejection.\n\n【17】Duplex ultrasound showed a fusiform aneurysmal dilatation of the left brachial artery with turbulent flow. A Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) was then performed and documented a left brachial artery aneurysm of approximately 36 mm in maximum diameter with thrombotic apposition at the level of the middle third of the arm .\n\n【18】Considering clinical presentation and size of the aneurysm， decision was made to perform a surgical exclusion. Through an“S-shaped”incision at the level of the left antecubital fossa extended to the middle third of the arm， the median nerve was recognized and mobilized anteriorly， and the brachial artery was isolated proximally and distally to the aneurysm . The aneurysm was resected， and the brachial artery was reconstructed with a collagen-coated polyester graft interposition (Intergard Synergy Knitted Ultrathin 8mm，Maquet). An end-to-end anastomosis was performed proximaly and distally with a 5/0 polypropylene continuous suture(Prolene， Ethicon). At the end of the procedure radial and ulnar pulses were present. No neurological deficits were reported.\n\n【19】The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 4， on single antiplatelet therapy.\n\n【20】A 1-month follow-up duplex ultrasound showed patency of the graft and normal perfusion of the radial and ulnar arteries.\n\n【21】At the 6-months follow-up visit the patient continued to be in good clinical conditions， with normal perfusion of the left upper limb and no neurological symptoms or pain.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Brachial artery aneurysms represent a rare disease， with a prevalence of 0.5%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. They are usually false aneurysm secondary to traumatic， infectious or iatrogenic causes. True BAA have an even more rare presentation and many of the patients with these lesions have a history of intravenous drugs abuse or frequent arterial catheterizations. Other causes associated with BAA occurrence are atherosclerosis， vasculitis， and connective tissue disorders， such as Behcet disease， Takayasu disease， Kawasaki syndrome， Ehlers-Danlos syndrome， Buerger disease， Kaposi sarcoma or cystic adventitial disease.\n\n【24】Regarding our patient， he had no history of trauma， connective tissue disorders， iatrogenic punctures or drugs abuse.\n\n【25】However， one ofthe other causes that can be associated with true BAA is a history of AVF creation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\nIn fact， it is described in literature how an AVF creation can increase blood flow in proximal brachial artery and lead to its expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In addition to this， some collateral factors， like steroids and immunosuppressants’ use after renal transplantation， might contribute to the formation and enlargement of arterial aneurysms 11|.\n\n【27】The presentation of BAA is similar to that of other peripheral arteries aneurysms. They can present as an asymptomatic pulsating mass or can cause pain or paresthesia's from nerve compression. Less commonly， patients can report symptoms of distal ischemia due to thrombosis or distal embolization.\n\n【28】A proper diagnosis should be made with physical examination and duplex ultrasound， which allows to determine the size ofthe mass and the perfusion of the downstream area. CTA may be performed for operative planning.\n\nBecause of its low incidence， the management of a brachial artery aneurysm is not well defined， with conventional surgical repair being the main treatment option， although in some cases the endovascular approach may be considered. The interposition of an autologous venous graft is preferred， with the Great Saphenous Vein (GSV) used in most cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The ipsilateral cephalic or basilic vein is also used in order to preserve the veins of the lower limbs for possible future|删除段之间换行|3D reconstruction (B).\n\n【30】vascular reconstructions. If these options are not feasible， prosthetic grafts represent a good alternative.\n\n【31】In our case report， prior to the intervention， a vein mapping was performed to the patient： Ipsilateral cephalic vein was not feasible due to the previous AVF，and great saphenous vein was incompetent and ectasia bilaterally. Therefore， a prosthetic graft was considered.\n\n【32】A goodd outcome wwaass achieved using a collagen-coated polyester graft， as demonstrated by a duplex ultrasound following the intervention that showed the patency of the graft and the good perfusion of the distal arteries. A long-term follow up is necessary to better evaluate the results.\n\n【33】Relationships between AVF creation with immunosuppressive and steroids therapy after renaltransplantation and the occurrence of true BAA are not yet well defined.

Cutaneous lesion involvement is a rare clinical manifestation of IgG4-RD. We report a case of IgG4-RD presenting with cutaneous lesions in combination with autoimmune pancreatitis and subacute thyroiditis. A skin biopsy pathology confirmed the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. Here we present an uncommon case of IgG4-RD with subacute thyroiditis with pancreatic and skin involvement and provide a brief literature review of skin manifestations and treatment.\n\n【2】Keywords： Autoimmune pancreatitis； IgG4-related disease； Rash Skin pathology\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A 78-year-old woman was presented to the rheumatology clinic a year ago for scattered rashes on her lower extremities and pain in. The skin lesion began to be pinpoint-like and gradually merged， with clear boundaries， no pruritus， and hyperpigmentation . Six years before this presentation， she was treated for diarrhea and anorexia in another hospital. Pancreas Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed which revealed suspected pancreatic cancer . Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) revealed a 2.5 cm×1.6 cm round mass in the pancreatic tail. The EUS of a fine-needle aspiration ofpancreatic mass showed clumps of acinus and ductal epithelium， and no malignant cells and atypical epithelial cells were discovered. The serum IgG4 concentration was 4.78 g/L. Treatments such as supplementation of pancreatic enzymes， inhabitation of retinoic acid and protection of the gastric mucosa were initiated. But the patient is still suffering from recurrent diarrhea. Autoimmune pancreatitis was presumed after CT angiography of the pancreas was administrated with contrast material. Treatment with prednisone at an initial dose of 25 mg per day was started in April 2015， and the dosage was gradually reduced to 5 mg per day. After half a year of treatment， the diarrhea had not significantly abated， so the therapy was withdrawn. The pancreas lesion did not no progress at the 6-year follow up confirmed by CT scan， however IgG4level increased to 7.01 g/L.\n\nThree years before this presentation， the patient was evaluated by colonoscopy due to abdominal IOS pain and asubmucosaleminence lesion was detected in the ascen ding colon. Therighthemicolectomy was performed to remove the cancer. The biopsy demonstrated a partial mass-like lesion in which all mucosa infiltrated with lymphocytic clusters， fibrous tissue hyperplasia， twisted blood vessels， and no granulomatous lesions was found. The distribution of T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte infiltration was proportional. No medication was administrated to her. The patient also had a history of hypertension and thrombocytopenia. On examination， she was found to have cutaneous lesion on her lower extremities and tenderness in her neck. The polymorphic eruption consists of multiple， scattered， dark brown rashes， varying in size up to 5 cm on both lower extremities， with no desquamation or raised lesions. Hemoglobin was 109 g/L (reference range 115-150 g/L)， C-reactive protein was 26.37 mg/L (reference range 0-10 mg/L)， erythrocyte sedimentation rate was50 mm/H (reference range 0-20 mm/H)， procalcitonin was 0.051 ng/mL (reference range <0.046ng/mL)， creatinine was 90 umol/L (reference range 41-81 umol/L)， IgG4 was 2.56 g/L (reference range 0.03-2.01 g/L)， serum thyroglobulin was more than 500 ng/mL (reference range 3.5-77 ng/mL). Coagulation， complement， thyroid function and tumor markers were normal. Autoantibodies were positive for antinuclear antibody with titer 1：300 (Immunofluorescent pattern： Granular type). Antinuclear antibody profiles， rheumatoid factor， anti-CCP antibody， anticardiolipin antibody， and antineutrophil antibody were all negative. B-ultrasound ofperipherallymph nodes revealed enlarged|删除段之间换行|inguinal and axillary lymph nodes. Thyroid B-ultrasound suggested an abnormal echo in the right lobe of thethyroid， and subacute thyroiditis was considered. Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography(MRCP) showed splenomegaly and esophagogastric varices. Skin pathology was necessary for the differential diagnosis and a skin biopsy was performed. The pathological manifestation demonstrated a small amount of plasma cells and infiltrated lymphocytes in the papillary dermis and adjacent to small blood vessels， collagen fibers hyperplasia with hyaline degeneration in the dermal reticular layer， adnexa reduced， IgG4+ plasma cell staining， 12 to 14 IgG4+ plasma cells per high magnification .\n\nThe clinical manifestations involved multiple organs and combined with increased serum IgG4 concentration and the biopsy results， the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-RD associated with|删除段之间换行|subacute thyroiditis. Accordingly， the patient was prescribed oral prednisone 30 mg daily. Her rash and diarrhea gradually improved after treatment. After two months， IgG4 was reduced to 1.24 g/L， the rash had completely subsided， and the diarrhea had improved significantly. The prednisone was reduced to 5 mg per day as a maintenance therapy， and there was no rash and diarrhea recurred during the subsequent 1-year follow-up.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】IgG4-RD is a unique clinical pathological disorder characterized by elevated circulating IgG4 levels and tissue infiltration of IgG4+plasma cells. Various organs are involved in IgG4-RD including the pancreas， salivary glands， lacrimal glands， bile ducts， peritoneum， kidneys， pituitary glands， lungs， and thyroid glands. Thus， symptoms and signs vary depending on the organs involved and the severity of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【9】This case provided a patient with IgG4-RD involving the pancreas， skin and subacute thyroiditis. The cutaneous pathology facilitated a definitive diagnosis for this patient and allowed her to respond well to therapy. Only a few dozen cases of skin lesions associated IgG4-RD had been reported so far. Skin lesions can present as erythema， subcutaneous nodules， or papules， and are mostly distributed around the ears， face， and limbs， and are often combined with dacryoadenitis and sialadenitis， with infrequent involvement of the pancreas，liver， and biliary tract. Given this patient's previous history， clinical presentation， and constellation of symptoms， we suspect that subacute thyroiditis is secondary to IgG4-RD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【10】The specificity of skin lesions related to IgG4-RD is very poor. At present， the skin lesions can be classified into seven subtypes： 1) cutaneous plasmacytosis (multiple papulonodules or indurations on the trunk and proximal part of the limbs)，2) pseudolymphoma and angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (plaques and papulonodules mainly on the periauricular， cheek and mandible regions)， 3) Mikulicz disease (palpebral swelling， sicca syndrome and exophthalmos)， 4) psoriasis-like eruption (strikingly mimicking psoriasis vulgaris)， 5) unspecified maculopapular or erythematous eruptions， 6) hypergammaglobulinemic purpura (bilateral asymmetrical palpable purpuric lesions on the lower extremities) and urticarial vasculitis (prolonged urticarial lesions occasionally with purpura) and 7) ischemic digit (Raynaud phenomenon and digital gangrene). Most of the lesions are subacute and it often takes months or years to be diagnosed. Regardless of the organ involved， the key histologic features are dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration， storiform fibrosis， and thrombophlebitis. Among skin lesions， however， thrombophlebitis is rarely observed and occurs clinically in IgG4-RD通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-7\\]</u>.\n\nNot all patients with skin lesions require treatment， but without treatment， skin lesions are at risk of persistence or enlargement， whether treated or not， depending on symptoms and the extent of organinvolvement. IgG4levels can often be used as a markerto monitor therapeutic response. Steroids are usually effective in treating IgG4-RD， but immunosuppressants such as methotrexate， azathioprine， and mycophenolate mofetil are also effective. In addition， rituximab also has some effect on IgG4-RD treatment. After this patient was treated with a moderate dose of prednisone monotherapy， the rash did not recur， thyroid pain and diarrhea significantly resolved， and the levels of serological marker IgG4 returned to the normal range. Imaging findings on the pancreas is still under follow-up. While|删除段之间换行|patients respond well to glucocorticoids， relapse rates remained high during reduction and maintenance therapy. Currently， the optimal therapy is still being explored 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>.\n\n【12】This patient also had a mucosal protrusion in the ascending colon. She received a diagnosis of suspected Crohn's disease by a gastroenterologist at another hospital. The diagnosis was ruled out after a multi-disciplinary team discussion. We speculate that the mucosal lesion in the ascending colon may be related to IgG4-RD.\n\n【13】In conclusion， we have described an infrequent patient with IgG4-RD involving the skin and pancreas who was definitively diagnosed and effectively treated with the help of skin pathology. Importantly， it has been recognized that many different morphological rashes can also occur in IgG4-RD. Correct diagnosis relies on serum IgG4 levels and histological and immunohistochemical analysis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

On laparotomy， no gross ascites or peritoneal or omental deposits were present. Peritoneal wash fluid sent for cytology. Uterus， right ovary and right fallopian tube were WNL while a left ovarian multiloculated cyst of 4 cm x6 cm was seen with intact capsule. Left fallopian tube was also WNL. Left salpingo-opherectomy was done and was sent for HPE.\n\n【11】On histopathological examination， to our surprise， this was reported as adult type granulosa cell tumor Stage IA1 with presence of typical Call-Exner bodies and coffee bean shaped nucleus. Serum inhibin levels done after HPE， one week postoperatively were normal. This diagnosis of androgen secreting variety of a commonly known estrogen secreting tumor， lead us to undergo literature search and publish this unusual presentation . Patient resumed her menses in very next cycle of surgery and her virilizing and hirsute features got resolved， other than clitoromegaly， during her follow up examination at 3 months. She have no complaints for last one year of follow up and is on regular follow up with USG and serum testosterone and DHEAS levels .\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Granulosa Cell Tumors (GCT) is derived from the granulosa cells of ovary. They constitute less than 5% of all ovarian tumors and more than 70% of the sex cord-stromal tumors. There are two distinct histological types -Adult GCT (AGCT) and Juvenile GCT (JGCT)， which display different clinical and histopathological features. AGCTs are more common (95%) and are usually seen in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. JGCTs are rare tumors， representing 5% of all GCTs and usually occur in premenarchal girls and young women通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. On microscopic examination， two characteristics distinguish juvenile from adult granulosa cell tumors： The nuclei of juvenile granulosa cell tumors are rounded， hyper chromatic and un-grooved with moderate to abundant eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm， and the theca cell component is luteinized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nThe majority of patients with GCT will present with one or a combination of the following clinical symptoms： Abnormal vaginal bleeding， abdominal distention， and abdominal pain. Other clinical manifestations are breast tenderness， uterine myo-hypertrophy， and endometrial hyperplasia. All these are consistent with an estrogen-|删除段之间换行|secreting tumor. The endocrine function of GCTs， specifically the production of estrogens， has been repeatedly demonstrated by assessment of the end organ i.e.， endometrium， and measurements of peripheral levels of estrogen before and after surgery. Also， there are studies where selective ovarian venous catheterizations during surgery have the secretion of large quantities of estrogen from the ovary harboring the GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. On molecular level， FOXL2 gene is required for the normal development of the granulosa cell and mutation of FOXL2 seen in 97 % of adult GCT and is considered as pathognomonic for GCT (particularly adult GCT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This mutation leads to unregulated aromatase action and excessive estrogen production by action of aromatase on androstenedione in GCT's.\n\n【15】GCTs are low potential malignant neoplasms with the capacity forlocal or lymphatic extension， particularly to the para-aortic lymph nodes. As GCTs usually detectable in early stages due to features of hyper estrogenism， unilateral oophorectomy is recommended treatment for women who wish to preserve their fertility. However， GCT has a tendency for late recurrence and once the tumor recurs it’s fatal in 80% cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Therefore， it is important to have a circulating marker as an early predictor or recurrent disease.\n\n【16】Estrogens are generally produced by GCTs， but role of estrogens as a tumor marker is limited， as no correlation between serum estrogen levels and tumor load was noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Other tumor markers being considered for GCT are Inhibin B and MIS. In the postmenopausal women， with depletion of ovarian follicles， inhibin levels become undetectable. But in GCT， inhibin(predominantly inhibin B) is secreted by granulosa cells， thus inhibin B can be used as a marker for GCT in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Inhibin act as autocrine and paracrine granulosa cell growth factors and hence， levels of inhibin reflect the tumor burden. However， not all GCTs express inhibin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and epithelial ovarian tumors especially the mucinous variety may also secrete inhibin (82% cases) suggesting that inhibin is not specific for GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. MIS is also formed in granulosa cells during reproductive life and parallels changes in inhibin levels in GCT. Also， an elevated level of MIS is highly specific for GCT通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nOccasionaly， patients with GCTs also presents with decidual reaction of the stroma or secretory characteristics of the glands nendometrium which consistent with tumor production of progesterone. Rarely， virilizing changes as primary or secondary amenorrhea， hirsutism， and clitoral hypertrophy， deepening of the voice， masculine features and acne due to elevated testosterone levels|删除段之间换行|are seen in GCTs\\[71.\n\n【19】Androgen secreting adult type GCT is a rare tumor in young females but was do reported over years. Castro et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported first case androgenic adult GCT in a prepubertal female presented with hirsutism， raised serum testosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. Unilateral salpingo-opherectomy was done and histopathology showed findings suggesting adult type GCT. A reported case of Juvenile GCT， with androgenic manifestations in a 13-year-old girl was also found. Juvenile GCT is as such less common and usually manifest estrogenic features. Her plasma testosterone level was elevated and pelvic ultrasonography revealed a left adnexal cyst(14.4 cm x 9.1 cm x9.7 cm). The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy， revealing a left ovarian cystic tumor reported as juvenile granulosa cell tumor on histopathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Although， androgen secreting GCT are similar to estrogen secreting GCTs in histopathology， it is suggested that they may have a sertoli-leydig cell component which can cause androgen secretion in these women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Another hypothesis is based on the two-cell hypothesis of estradiol production i.e. granulosa cells produce estradiol if the precursor testosterone is secreted by adjacent theca cells. However， in androgenic granulosa cell tumors， few theca cells and lack of aromatase activity of varying degrees in granulosa cells， were seen， leading to accumulation of androgens as they can’t be converted to estradiol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Although， Inhibin B is commonlyused as tumor markers for GCT but Inhibin B levels were normal in above mentioned cases including our case. While serum testosterone and DHEAS levels were raised in all of these cases， but use of these as tumor markers is still a matter to be subiected for further research. Other serum biochemical markers were also reported to be raised in androgenic GCTs by some authors.\n\n【22】Niwa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> reported a 32-year-old Japanese woman， with signs of virilization & pelvic mass on USG with raised serum LH， serum testosterone and DHEAS levels. She underwent laparoscopic right salpingo-opherectomy and the tumor was diagnosed as an adult-type GCT. The reason for the elevation of LH levels in this case was not clear but serum LH levels falls to normal range after surgery. Authors proposed the role serum LH levels in such females for follow up通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Honda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> reported another rare case of androgenic adult GCT in a 29 year old female presenting with secondary amenorrhea and adnexal mass and no other signs of virilization. On investigation serum testosterone levels and aPTT were raised which returned to normal levels after surgery. Authors proposed role of an inhibitor to an APTT-based clotting factor being produced by tumor causing raised APTT.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】Authors conclude that preoperative diagnosis of androgenic GCT is not feasible and histopathology remains the gold standard. But， a possibility of androgenic GCT should be considered in women with virilizing features and ovarian mass. During follow up of these cases， serum biochemical markers which were raised preoperatively such as serum testosterone & DHEAS in present case along with established tumor marker for GCT i.e.， serum inhibin B levels， in addition to clinical examination and pelvic imaging at regular intervals， should be done. Further research and need of analysis of existing literature is required on time to time basis in order to suggest relevant tumor markers， follow up and prognosis in these cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Facial asymmetry is not only bothersome to the patient but also challenging to treat for the surgeon. Identifying the cause， understanding patients concern forms an important aspect in the treatment of facial asymmetry. The present case report highlights how an untreated condylar fracture in the childhood can lead to facial asymmetry. Two stage repair was planned for the patient. First stage-simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction for correction of occlusal cant and lengthening of right ramus of mandible； second stage-genioplasty to correct the deviated chin. This method used for correction of facial asymmetry gives acceptable results.\n\n【2】Keywords： Simultaneous maxilomandibular distraction； Facial asymmetry； Molina technique\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Facial asymmetry means altered balance between the right and left sides of the face. It can be an aesthetic or a functional concern sometimes both. Understanding patients’desires and expectations is critical in treatment planning.\n\n【5】One of the various causative factors of facial asymmetry is secondary to condylar trauma. Condylar fracture in growing children can cause disturbed mandibular growth. In majority of the cases， growth and remodeling maintain the symmetry of the mandible. However， in children older than 10 years， progressive asymmetry can result 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Management of pediatric fractures is predominantly conservative owing to their remodeling potential. Proper treatment planning based on fracture type and patient’s growth status is required to avoid future complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The current case report describes treatment using simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction for correction of facial asymmetry secondaryto condylar fracture. Simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction is an extension of distraction osteogenesis for mandibular lengthening described by McCarthy. This procedure utilizes the traction principle for the growth of the mandibular ramus. Maxilla follows the mandible during distraction with intermaxillary fixation in situ.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 17-year-old male reported to the department of maxillofacial surgery with a chief complaint of facial asymmetry. The patient gives a history of fall from a bicycle when he was 11 years old following which his parents noticed gradually progressing facial asymmetry along with a mild decrease in mouth opening. On extraoral examination， gross facial asymmetry was evident with fullness on the right side and elongation on the left side， chin deviated towards the right. An increase in canthus-left commissure distance was evident on the left side. Profile view examination revealed a convex profile with an obtuse chin-throat angle. Occlusal cant was seen deviating towards the left. The mouth opening was 30 mm. On intraoral examination， there was a class 2 molar relation on the right side and a class 1 molar relation on the left side.\n\n【9】Investigations\n\n【10】Orthopantomogram showed flattening of the right condylar head and shortened ramus on the right side with the tipping of lower anterior roots towards the right. Preoperative Posterior-anterior cephalogram showed Menton deviation towards the left and decreased Condylion-Antegonial point(Co-Ag) length on the right side. Preoperative CT shows a flattened condylar head on the right side with increased width suggestive of remodeling after dislocation of the condylar head post-trauma.\n\n【11】Based on the findings and patient concerns， a treatment plan was devised： simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction followed by sliding genioplasty for residual deformity as second-stage surgery.\n\n【12】Surgical technique\n\nThe patient was put under general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation. Right ramus osteotomy cut was given anterior-posteriorly above the level of lingula through an extra oral post-ramal incision. A stainless steel 25 mm ramus distractor was placed and secured with screws on either side of osteotomy. Through a subcutaneous nick flexible port for distraction was brought extra orally. Following this， an intraoral incision was given in the maxillary vestibule. A procedure for modified Lefort osteotomy cut through third molar extraction sockets bilaterally (Tidemann and Trimble et al. modification) was|删除段之间换行|carried out with down fracture of the maxilla. Non-rigid fixation using 3-26-gauge braided wires was done on the left side.\n\n【14】Distraction protocol\n\n【15】Post-surgery， after a latency period of 5 days the patient was put in Intermaxillary Fixation (IMF) using elastics and an upper lower Erich arch bar placed preoperatively. Distraction was initiated-0.5mm twice daily that is 1 mm/day distraction was done for 16 days. IMF was left in situ for 6 weeks for consolidation.\n\n【16】Second-stage surgery\n\n【17】Following the consolidation period patient was posted for a second-stage surgery. A sliding genioplasty and distractor removal were then performed to correct the residual chin deformity.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Management of facial asymmetry is indicated for aesthetic and functional reasons. From a surgical point of view， Choi et al. have classified facial asymmetry according to the vector ofasymmetry into Horizontal asymmetry with chin deviation， vertical asymmetry with occlusal cant and a mixture of both 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In the current scenario， the patient presented with both chin deviation and occlusal cant. Hence the aim of surgery was to correct horizontal and vertical components of asymmetry without causing the occlusal discrepancy.\n\n【20】Various osteotomies for the correction of facial asymmetry secondary to trauma are available in the literature. The traditionally used method is orthognathic surgery. In case of vertical asymmetry of the mandible， bilateral sagittal split osteotomy will not provide adequate correction of angle. For this reason， oblique intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy can be performed such that the angle is a part of the distal segment which can be rotated to achieve adequate correction of roll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. There exists a possibility of proximal segment flaring in ramus osteotomies after correction of asymmetry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Modified L-shaped osteotomy with or without distraction can be used to increase the height of the ramus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. All the osteotomy techniques described require a Lefort-1 osteotomy to obtain a correction of occlusal cant.\n\n【21】Salins et al described Orthomorphic osteotomy for the correction of facial asymmetry. However， when occlusal cant correction is required， orthognathic surgery should be performed first followed by orthomorphic osteotomy for residual deformity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The long-term results following orthomorphic osteotomy are yet to be studied.\n\n【22】Limitations of osteotomies are the need for bone graft and a possible second surgical site， soft tissue envelope restricting the extent of correction. These factors contribute to long-term stability causing relapse. Distraction osteogenesis can be used to overcome these limitations.\n\n【23】Distraction osteogenesis for the treatment of facial asymmetry especially in cases of hemifacial microsomia is largely followed. The advantage of using simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction is it avoids occlusal discrepancy caused by using distraction in a single jaw. Distraction osteogenesis causes simultaneous expansion of soft tissue envelope in contrast to osteotomy 8\\].\n\n【24】In the original technique described by Ortiz Monasterio et al. in 1997 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， maxillary Lefort down fracture and mandibular ramus osteotomy were done with inter-maxillary fixation during distraction and consolidation. Plaza et al. modified this technique by avoiding down fracture of the maxilla to prevent bony ankylosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In the current case report， non-rigid fixation of bone was done on the unaffected side to avoid lengthening of the maxilla on the unaffected side.\n\n【25】After the required distraction of the maxillomandibular complex， minor chin discrepancies can be corrected with a genioplasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. There is a significant change in the occlusal cant， length of the ramus， canthus and commissure distance in the current case report with simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction followed by sliding genioplasty.\n\n【26】Disadvantages of this procedure include requiring longer hospital stays， patient compliance for treatment being of utmost importance， failure of the distractor device， and problems with a vector of distraction.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Weighing the risks and benefits of each technique， the best suitable procedure to meet the patients requirements should be used. With the advent of virtual surgical planning， a proper vector extent of distraction can be planned to obtain predictable outcomes. Simultaneous maxillomandibular distraction is a proven technique for the correction of facial asymmetry with favorable results.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Similar to that in general population， post-spinal meningitis may be caused by bacterial and aseptic reasons. The latter comprises of infection by viruses， meningeal involvement in autoimmune and neoplastic diseases， and Drug-Induced Aseptic Meningitis (DIAM). DIAM may in turn be caused by two mechanisms -direct chemicalirritation ofthe meningesbyintrathecaladministration ofanesthetic and chemotherapeutic drugs or systemic immunological hypersensitivity (antibiotics， non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， intravenous immunoglobulin) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. When associated with spinal anesthesia， it generally has an acute onset within 24 h of dural puncture， and a self-limiting and benign course. Multiple authors have reported DIAM following bupivacaine spinal anesthesia. We present a case of likely DIAM， subsequent to bupivacaine subarachnoid block for elective arthroscopic surgery， posing a diagnostic dilemma for the involved surgeons， anesthetists and intensivists. Informed consent was taken from the patient before reporting this case.\n\n【15】Case Summary\n\n【16】A 36-year-old male patient presented with history of injury to the right knee， resulting in multiple locking episodes and joint instability. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed partial ACL tear. The patient was posted for arthroscopic right anterior cruciate ligament repair with partial medial meniscectomy under subarachnoid block. Pre-anesthetic check-up was completely normal， and the patient was declared ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists) grade I. On the day of elective surgery， subarachnoid injection was given with 2.4ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 20 mcg fentanyl as additive. Cleaning and draping were performed as per departmental protocol and the spinal was given at L3-L4 level using 25 Gauge Quincke needle after local anesthetic injection. Patient was positioned and surgery was started after achieving a sensory level of T8. Surgerylasted for less than an hour and patient was shifted to the Post-operative Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) with stable vitals. From here， the patient was transferred to admitting ward when level of sensory block receded to L1 level. Four hours after shifting to ward， patient started complaining of severe headache for which injection diclofenac 75 mg was given. This was followed by 2 episodes of vomiting， tachypnea and disorientation to time， place， and person. The surgeon and anesthetist on duty decided to shift patient to Intensive Care Unit(ICU) for further evaluation and management.\n\n【17】The patient arrived in ICU with a low GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) score of E2V2M3 and dyspnea， necessitating tracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. Neck rigidity was observed but there was no fever. Bilateral pupils were normal in size and reaction. Blood investigations revealed a White Cell Count (WBCs) of 12，300/cumm and neutrophilia (89%) on differential count. Serum procalcitonin level was 4.1 ng/ml. A working diagnosis of bacterial meningitis was made， and neurology consultation was sought. Ceftriaxone， vancomycin， phenytoin， and dexamethasone 8 mg thrice a day were started empirically， while the patient was investigated further. Non-Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) and MRI brain were done， which were normal. Fundus examination did not reveal any disc edema. A lumbar puncture was subsequently performed， which showed cell count of 400 cells/cumm with 60% mononuclear cells and 40% polymorphs in Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) on cytological examination. CSF biochemistry revealed a glucose level of 150 mg/dl and protein of 777 mg/dl. Gram staining and culture were found to be negative.\n\nAs per the above findings and the observation that patient never exhibited any fever， the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis seemed unlikely. We started thinking along the lines of aseptic meningitis， post-subarachnoid block. Antibiotics were de-escalated， but steroids|删除段之间换行|and phenytoin were continued. After 3 days of assisted ventilation and supportive care in ICU， the patient's GCS， blood investigations and ventilation parameters improved markedly. The patient was responsive， neck rigidity was absent and diaphragmatic excursion was normal on ultrasonography. Trachea was extubated and patient's neurological assessment， including higher mental functions were found to be normal， except for some residual amnesia about surgery and post-operative period. The patient was kept in ICU another day and then shifted to orthopedics ward for further care.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Neurological complications after an uneventful spinal anesthesia and surgeryareinfrequent，but when they occur，theypose a diagnostic dilemma to the physicians. It is essential to differentiate DIAM from bacterial meningitis， as the latter is a potentially life-threatening condition， requiring urgent intervention and leaves the patient with neurological sequela. Additionally， establishing the diagnosis of DIAM also prevents unnecessary treatment with advanced antibiotics and hospital/ICU stay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However， symptomatology and clinical findings may not help us distinguish between bacterial and aseptic meningitis， as both may present with headache， nuchal rigidity and febrile episodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. CSF findings may also confuse the situation further， showing pleocytosis with neutrophil predominance(later， may shift to mononuclear predominance) and raised protein levels (hyperproteinorrachia). CSF glucose levels may be low(hypoglycorrachia) or normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Bihan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> reported in their study on 329 cases of DIAM that a clear meningeal syndrome， involving headache， neck stiffness and vomiting may be seen in only 15.5% of cases. Out of the typical symptoms of the meningeal triad， only headache is present in >2/3of DIAM cases. All other symptoms are reported in only 20% to40% of cases. Ducornet et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> published certain defining criteria for diagnosis of aseptic meningitis： Time to onset of signs within 24hours after spinal anesthesia； the absence of prior antibiotic therapy； apyrexia； a WBCs in CSF similar to bacterial meningitis； high protein value in CSF； a normal glucose value in CSF； negative bacterial CSF culture； full recovery in less than 48 h Our patient met each of the above criteria.\n\nThis goes to show that DIAM is a diagnosis of exclusion and empirical antibiotics should be started initially in all cases. When negative CSF cultures are obtained， antibiotics may be stopped to prevent development of antibiotic resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However， some clinicians favor the continuation of antibiotics till complete symptom resolution， as bacterial meningitis may masquerade as DIAM and is almost always more dangerous， leaving neurological complications.

Diagnosis is straight forward in individuals with bone fragility and a positive family history or several extra skeletal manifestations (hearing loss， dark or bluish sclera). OI is classified into a number of major subtypes based on genetic， radiographic，and clinical characteristics， but more useful is the clinical classification， based upon the typical problems that manifest in infants， children， and adults with mild， moderate to severe and lethal disease.\n\n【2】This case report describes a 53-year old female patient with an unknown genetic disorder， but with medical history of bone fragility， currently presented with spontaneous ace tabular fracture that led to the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfect a type I. OI is associated with multiple perioperative complications， thus the patients require extensive preoperative evaluation and an individualized surgical and anesthetic management.\n\n【3】Keywords： Osteogenesis imperfecta； COVID-19； Periarticular\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Osteogenesis imperfecta is rare inherited connective tissue disorder， being characterized by bone brittleness and increased fracture risk. Its incidence is described at 1：10.000-20.000 live births通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Clinical diagnosis includes fractures from the mildest oftrauma， short stature， bone deformities， blue sclera， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Clinical severity varies from mild forms with only premature osteoporosis or severe postmenopausal bone mineral loss determining normal life expectancy in OI type I， to perinatal death in OI type II. Almost 90% of cases are caused by mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Perioperative management can be challenging due to difficult airway， respiratory failure due to scoliosis or abnormal platelet function with easy bruisability. It is essential to predict these risks and implement a high-quality management for trauma in such patients. Treatment ofOI depends on the severity and age， the main objectives being to maintain autonomy and prevent long term complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This current case report describes a patient with an unknown genetic disorder and her medical history that led to the diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta.\n\n【6】Materials and Methods\n\n【7】In September 2021， a 53 year-old female (body mass 78 kg， height 157 cm， body mass index31.6 kg/m²) was admitted for a minor trauma (same height fall)， which resulted in a complex left acetabular fracture and protrusio acetabuli .\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed blue sclera ， moderate scoliosis， and mild skeletal deformities of the forearms， dentinogenesis imperfecta and deafness.\n\n【9】Twenty years prior she developed early onset deafness and underwent a stapedectomy for presumably right ear otosclerosis. Her hearing worsen in both ears over the next six years and needed hearing aid. That’s when she was first told she had a genetic disorder， but at the present time she did not possess any medical history， nor remembered any details. Family history revealed the patient’s mother also had blue-gray colored sclera. The patient had multiple rheumatology admissions for osteoporosis， tendinitis and bilateral chronic hip and knee articular pain requiring treatment with analgesics and bisphosphonates (alendronic acid). She also had a history of essential arterial hypertension， gastro esophageal reflux disease and smoking. She required immediate plate osteosynthesis of the posterior column of acetabulum  with normal perioperative evolution， being discharged in good clinical condition.\n\n【10】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Corticosteroids induce fat mobilization and may promote fat emboli occlusion of blood vessels， disrupt calcium metabolism and increase osteoclasts activity and bone resorption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In January 2022， on a follow up visit the patient had recurrence of acute， severe， left hip articular pain. Although all her previous follow-up visits shown progressive healing of the fracture， this time her radiology report showed aseptic necrosis of the left femoral head ， requiring total hip arthroplasty .\n\n【11】During recovery， in November 2021 she develops respiratory signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection (fever， cough， muscle aches and sore throat) and is diagnosed with a positive RT-PCR test through her family doctor. She had a mild to moderate form and received inpatient low-flow supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula and 8 mg daily dexamethasone for 5 days.\n\n【12】The patient received general anesthesia combined with an ultrasound-guided fascia iliaca block to ensure adequate perioperative analgesia， with good outcome. General anesthesia was preferred over neuroaxial anesthetic procedures due to the coagulopathy found in OI patients which includes reduced platelet aggregation， reduced factor VIII activity and an increased capillary fragility. Difficult airway must be anticipated in these patients and video laryngoscopic or fiber optic endotracheal intubation should be readily available. The moderate scoliosis with restrictive lung disease and long-term effects of COVID-19 like lung fibrosis can impede perioperative respiratory function.\n\n【13】The approach to management of COVID-19 evolves rapidly as clinical data emerge， but corticosteroids are almost a constant in treatment protocols for moderate to severe cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The use of high doses of dexamethasone was lifesaving in many cases，but one adverse effect is corticosteroid induced a vascular necrosis of the femoral head\n\n【14】Results and Discussion\n\nA vascular necrosis of the femoral head can be a consequence of the trauma， it can be corticosteroid-induced， but OI can also|删除段之间换行|associate periarticular bone dysplasia and lesions of ischemic origin. Taking that into account， the differential diagnosis can prove difficult in a patient with history of osteoporosis， chronic hip pain and corticosteroid treatment. Considering all of the above， a clinical diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta type I was formulated.\n\n【16】OI is also known as “brittle bone disease\" because of high risk of fractures after mild trauma， or ever from transporting or mobilization of patients. Diagnosis of OI on the basis of clinical and radiological findings is straightforward in most cases， but bone mineral density measurements， bone metabolic markers and morphological bone studies may aid the process. Genetic testing can be useful in differentiating between quantitative and qualitative collagen I defects. Bone fragility， osteoporosis and coagulopathy can complicate or prolong surgical interventions. OI is associated with multiple complications， thus the patients require extensive preoperative evaluation and an individualized orthopedic and anesthetic management.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】Currently， only symptomatic therapy is available， such as growth hormone or bisphosphonates and surgical treatment is necessary for decreasing the rate of complication. Most of the literature focuses on diagnosis and management of OI in the pediatric population， but the manifestations are lifelong and some cases can be first diagnosed throughout adulthood. In this case the new onset of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head was pluri factorial， corticotherapy-induced， a complication of bone brittleness and ischemic lesions found in OI， as well as the recent history of acetabular fracture. The approach to such a heterogeneous disease should be multidisciplinary in order to assure adequate long-term quality oflife and decreasing complication rates，", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In addition to autoantibodies， Helicobacter pylori or Hepatitis C may be the cause of ITP. These illnesses are accompanied by co-existing antibodies that may have an impact on the antiphospholipid antibodies， and coexisting immune dysfunctions and molecular mimicry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Ayurveda， yoga therapy， and nutrition modification can all be used as integral part of an integrated treatment plan for a variety of illnesses.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】The patient， a 10-year-old girl， was identified having Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(ITP) in 2019. She was admitted in the hospital due to symptoms that included an unremarkable peripheral smear， a physical exam that only indicated minor signs of bleeding linked to the low platelet count. The doctor suggested repeated hospital stays in addition to typical conventional medical therapy. Romiplostim 500 mcg Sc/once weekly， Pantop 40 mg/daily， Folvite 5 mg once daily， Tab. Tranexamic acid 1 g when bleeding occurs， and Tab. Shelcal 500 were normally administered to the patient as part of the standard care. Till June 16\"， 2023， these said medications were still being used. On the same day， the girl was brought to a clinical set up having the facility of complementary and alternative medicine near Betnoti，Odisha， East India. In addition to having an abnormal differential leukocyte count (Neutrophilic leukocytosis with myeloid left shift， Dc：Myelocyte + metamyelocyte=16%， Stab Segmented=67%，Lymphocytes =15%， Monocytes =02%)， the patient also had a lower platelet count (68，000/mm’of blood) and a higher white blood count(18100/mm’of blood). Additionally， the patients complained of excruciating bodily pain， weakness， and excessive menstrual flow. The patient additionally underwent yoga and ayurvedic therapy in addition to normal medical care. The patient asked to en gage in yoga meditation， Yoga Nidra 通用删除1(英):<u>(longer version of yoga induced relaxation)</u>， and Sukshma Vyayam (subtle light intensity yoga techniques). Two turmeric tablets， two Giloy tablets， one table spoon of Triphala churna (a blend of Emblica officinalis， Terminalia bellerica， and Terminalia chebula)， and one teaspoon of Chirata powder (Swertia chirayita) each day was recommended. Four tablespoons of each of two different plant leaf juices were taken by the patients on an empty stomach. For a week， the following plants were utilized to make a chart： Syzygium cumini L， Carica papaya， Triticum aestivum， Dalbergia sissoo， Murraya koenigii， Mangifera indica， and Psidium guajava L are some examples of related plants. Any two-plant leaf that is prepared as leaf juice on a rotating basis. For preparation of leaf juice， healthy young plant leaves were frequently selected and crushed in a stone grinder. Additionally， the patient was told to have a vegetarian diet composed of 50% raw food and50% cooked food. The dish was cooked with Indian indigenous ghee. For detoxification， the patient was instructed to consume one bowl of papaya and one bowl of guava.\n\n【4】After undergoing additional treatment for 21 days， the patient significantly improved. The platelet count (342000/mm’ of blood)， hemoglobin concentration， and RBC count increased markedly.Neutrophil by 69.2%， Lymphocytes 25%， Eosinophil 3%，Monocytes 0.5%， Basophils 0.7%were the normal differential leukocyte counts， and the total WBC count (11725/mm’of blood) was reduced to a normal level. The patient reports feeling better， having less physical discomfort， and having fewer blood stains on their skin after receiving the Yoga and Ayurveda treatment module.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】In general， yoga practice improved mental stability， happiness， and mental calmness， as well as overall life quality. Moreover， a study reported that pregnant women who practiced yoga for three months had higher platelet counts than the control group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This is in response to the patient's requesttoincorporate yoga to their treatment regimen. ILP is mostly caused by autoantibodies， and a study found that doing yoga for 8 weeks couldreducethe symptoms ofautoimmune disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In addition， the patient was instructed to take several Ayurvedic drug combinations， which were primarily composed of plant extracts. In dengue patients， platelet counts increased by taking extracts of the leaves of the giloy (Tinospora cordifolia) plant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The herb giloy has an immunomodulatory effect， improves cellular immunity， encourages the formation ofantibodies， and also improves lysosome activity and antibody responses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. In a mouse model， a methanolic extract of Syzygium cumini L dramatically increased both the platelet and leukocyte counts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Moreover， a study with Busulfan-treated mouse models， demonstrated that administering nanocurcumin (curcumin derivatives) could retain bone marrow integrity and enhance the quantity of circulating platelets while the patient is receiving treatment with turmeric tablets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. To boost immunity against autoantibodies and raise platelet count， patient was instructed to take various leaf extracts. The platelet count in dengue patient markedly elevated with the juice of Carica papaya leaves 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Mango leaf was shown to considerably boost RBC count in normal albino rats 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Patients with thrombocytopenia caused by alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis， Carica papaya and Tinospora cordifolia phytoextracts increased platelet count within 15 days and return it to normal within 90 days of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However， a study reported that giving a patient one tea spoon of Chirata (Swertia chirata) powder dramatically increased the platelet count in healthy rats when given at high doses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Murraya koenigii is a rich source of phenolic chemicals， alkaloids， flavonoids， and steroids. According to one study， Murraya Koenigii semi-solid plant extract ingestion increased blood count in phenylhydrazine-induced anemic rats 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. An excellent source of phenolic acid and flavonoid content is wheat grass (Triticum aestivum) and it was reported in thrombocytopenic rats that wheat grass (Triticum aestivum) considerably lowered bleeding and clotting times and raised platelet counts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. As the patient was advised to consume papaya fruits and leaves，possibly the polyphenolic chemical present in papaya fruit， leaves， and seeds had improved the formation of RBC and platelets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. It was accepted with the fact that the immune system was made more tolerable by a number of plant extracts， which prevented autoimmune diseases. WBC count， cellular immune response， and humoral immune responses were enhanced by Dalbergia Sissoo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The patient was instructed to consume Triphala powder because it has a positive effect on the immune system.

Numerous studies demonstrated that the plant extracts used in Ayurveda increased platelet count， while its mechanism of action remains unclear. Yoga also boosts the immunity and enhances the production of blood cell. Precisely we can conclude that Yoga and Ayurveda module improved the quality of life by improving the physicaland mental health. Since there have been very few studies on Ayurveda and Yoga therapy， it is exceedingly challenging to pinpoint the exact mechanism by which the platelet count rises in ITP. Future researches may be carried out to understand its mechanism more appropriately.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The common genetic factor that is associated with T2D is single nucleotide polymorphism. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205of the TCF7L2 gene with diabetes type删除4:<u> 2</u>. Total of 300 samples (150 T2DM patients and 150 non-diabetic controls) together with demographic factors were taken from public and private hospitals of the Southern Punjab. This was a case-control study and contained 150 T2D patients and 150controlled samples. To analyze the polymorphisms in KCNJ11 and TCF7L2， PCR-RFLP and Tetra-arm PCR were used. The findings of this study were that in KCNJ11 gene， homozygous AA genotype was predominant (83.33%) than the GG genotype (14%) and heterozygous genotype GA was present in very a small amount (2.66%) while in case of TCF7L2 gene， CC 28.00%， GG 27.33%and GC 44.67%. The insignificant statistical association was found between rs5219， rs11196205 and T2D as p-value of KCNJ11 (rs5219) is 0.4125 and TCF7L2 (rs11196205) is 0.6. The conclusion of this study is that rs5219 of the KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 gene are not associated with diabetes type 2 in the Southern Punjab population.\n\n【2】Keywords： KCNJ11； TCF7L2； PCR-RFLP； Tetra-arm PCR； Insignificant\n\n【3】Introduction\n\nType 2 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic multifactorial disorder described by high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia)， which is due to the resistance of insulin or lower insulin secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Both genetic and environmental factors play a significant role in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Environmental factors are age， obesity， lack of physical activity， hypertension， diet， and smoking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. International Diabetes Federation reported that in 2017， the number of patients with diabetes was 425 million and this ratio will increase to 629 million in 2045 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Pakistan is South Asia Country and diabetes and obesity is more common in South Asia. 12，000 deaths are noted every year in Pakistan due to diabetes. Different studies revealed that people in urban areas are more affected by this disease due to lack of physical activity， hypertension， and intake ofhigh-calorie food 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. For diabetes， Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) identified different susceptibility genes. Genetic factor is more involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus because of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Different studies found many genes that are associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Among these genes， the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily J member 11 (KCNJ11) gene and TCF7L2 gene are the main candidate genes for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. KCNJ11 gene is situated on the human chromosome at 11p15.1 and consists of one exon with no intronic sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Inward rectifier potassium ion channel (Kir6.2) protein is encoded by this gene. KCNJ11 gene plays a significant role in the secretion of insulin. Kir6.2 protein with Sulfonylurea Receptor 1 (SUR1)， forms K， channel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the K channel， when these two proteins are combined then it mediates the secretion of insulin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. When the level of glucose increases then it results in the closing ofthe K， channel and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. The Channel of K allows the potassium ions entry. The Intracellular level of calcium ion increases when the cell membrane becomes depolarized due to the increased amount of potassium ions and result in insulin secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Insulin production and its secretion are controlled through glucose metabolism by the K， channel. Many KCNJ11 gene SNPs have been identified and among these SNPs， rs5219 has been gaining more consideration for its association with type2 diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. KCNJ11 gene polymorphism rs5219 is caused when at codon 23， glutamic acid is substituted into lysine amino acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this variation， guanine is changed into adenine. The Sensitivity of the potassium channel is reduced due to this variation and this substitution caused|删除段之间换行|insulin resistance and leads to diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The genes which are elaborate in the cell multiplication and distinctness are regulated by the Transcription Factor 7-like 2 genes(TCF7L2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This gene contains the High Mobility Group (HMG) box and also elaborates in the Wnt signaling channel that plays the principal role in galactose stability and this gene is the master regulator of the proinsulin a nuclear receptor for B-catenin is encoded by this gene that involved in lipid metabolism. Variants of TCF7L2gene increased the risk of T2DM with an impaired insulin secretion showed a strong association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Wnt wave channel is essential during normal functioning and this function is done by the same receptors in which Frizzled (Fz) and LDL receptor-related proteins are included 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. B-catenin is also important for the activation of many genes when it binds to the TCF receptor. In which Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1(GLP-1) is also included in this way the beta-catenin level is increased and also increased the growth of beta cells. When the mutation in the TCF7L2 gene impaired the secretion glucagon-like peptide-1 due to which production of insulin is low and beta-catenin level also reduced， also disturb the beta-cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Objectives of this study was to determine the SNP association with body mass index， fasting blood glucose， random blood glucose in controlled and cases subiects. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation between rs5219 of KCNJ11 gene and rs11196205 of TCF7L2 with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the population of Southern Punjab， if any.\n\n【7】Materialand Method\n\n【8】Study participants\n\n【9】A total of 300 were selected for the analysis including 150 cases and 150 controlled subjects from government and private hospitals of the Southern Punjab.\n\n【10】Data collection\n\n【11】To study the epidemiological factors such as age， gender， body mass index， smoking， and personal medical history， questionnaire was conducted for this purpose.\n\n【12】Anthropometric and biochemical evaluation\n\n【13】By using a standard protocol， anthropometric measurements such as height， weight， and waist were acquired. The calculation of BMI was done by dividing the body weight in kilograms by square of height in meters. A routine investigation of patients such as fasting and random blood glucose level， HbA1c was measured.\n\n【14】DNA extraction\n\n【15】In EDTA tubes， Sample of blood (3ml to 5 ml) from each participant was preserved and kept at -4℃ for storage. Inorganic DNA extraction method was used for DNA extraction and DNA was collected from the collected samples of blood and stored at-20C.\n\n【16】Genotyping KCNJ11 E23K Variant\n\n【17】For amplification of KCNJ11E23K polymorphic region，\n\n【18】PCR-RFLP method was used for this purpose， Oligonucleotide primersSsequences55GACTCTGCAGTGAGGCCCTA 3 and5'ACGTTGCAGTTGCCTTTCTT 3were used. Master Mix of 25 ul was prepared that consist of 3 pl DNA， 2 ul of 25 mM MgCl。 2 pl dNTPs， 12 pmol ofeach primer， 1 pl Taq polymerase and 5 ul Buffer. The amplification started with a preliminary denaturing step at 94C for 5 min along with 28 cycles of 94°C for 30 s， annealing at 59°C for30 s， and ultimate extension at 72°C for 30 s with a final elongation step at 72°C for 5 min. 209 bp PCR product was analyzed on 1.8%agarose gel electrophoresis. PCR product was restricted by Ban II enzyme. Restriction was carried out in volume of 20 u删除4-1:<u>1</u>. 8 ul PCR product，1 ul Ban II enzyme， 5 ul tango buffer and 6 ul distilled water. Keep it at 37 for °C sixteen hours. By electrophoresis on 3% agarose gel， restriction products were separated and presence of bands was shown under the fluorescence of UV light. 100 bp ladder was used to know the exact position of particular band size which differentiated the genotypes of KCNJ11 i.e.， for 150， 59 bp (GG)， 150， 59， 209 bp(GA) and 209 bp (AA).\n\n【19】Genotyping of TCF7L2 rs11196205 variants\n\n【20】The genotyping of rs11196205 (C/G) was done by the Tetra-ARMS-PCR(Tetra Primer Amplification Polymerase Chain Reactions) for the detection of single nucleotide polymorphism in TCF7L2 gene. The primer that was designed and their product size for rs11196205 in TCF7L2 gene is following and mention in this table.\n\n【21】Master Mix of 25 ul was prepared that consist of 3 pl DNA，2ul of 25 mM MgCl。 2 pl dNTPs， 12 pmol of each primer， 1 pl Taq polymerase and 5 pl Buffer. The amplification started with a denaturation followed by 30 cycles in which initial denaturation at95°C for 6 min， final denaturation at 95°C， annealing at 64°C for 45s， and elongation at 72°C for 45s and a final elongation step at 72C for6 min.

The significance level was considered at P<0.05. The correlation between DM and all demographical variables was studied by using binary logistic regression followed by logistic regression analysis which was carried out to find the association between DM and selected biochemical factors. A Chi-square test was performed for determining the risk factors frequency between control and diabetic patients. Also， the frequency of genotypes was determined by direct counting whereas，the frequency of alleles was found out with the help of Hardy Weinberg equilibrium calculator and to find the correlation between diabetes and rs5219 (SNP) of the KCNJ11 Chi-square test was applied.\n\n【24】Table 1： Primers and the product size of TCF7L2 genotypes.\n\n| S.NO  | SNP  | Primer Type  | Sequence  | Amplification Size  | Product Size  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Inner Forward  | CTGAAAGTTCTCAACATTTATAACTGCC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Inner Reverse  | CAACCATAACTCTCTTACATACTGGTC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Outer Fonward  | TAGATTGTCTCCTTTTGTTTCTGCTAC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n| 1  | rs11196205  | Outer Reverse  | TAAACATCTGACCTTGAAGCCTACC  | 434bp  | C：253bpG：235bp  |\n\n【26】Results\n\n【27】Genotyping of KCNJ11(rs5219)\n\n【28】KCNJ11 PCR amplification was carried out and produced a band size of 209 bp as shown in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【29】The 209 bp band was digested with ban 2 enzyme and gave different genotypes pattern such as GG： 59 bp and 150 bp， AA： 209bp， GA： 59 bp， 150 bp and 209 bp .\n\n【30】Tetra-ARM-PCR for TCF7L2 analysis\n\n【31】The Tetra-ARM-PCR forTCF7L2 (rs11196205 C/G) that give the amplification of following products size in which 434 bp band as a control， 253 bp C wild type allele and 235 for the G mutant allele.\n\n【32】Association of various demographic and biochemical factors with diabetes\n\n【33】Through binarylogistic regression， different demographic factors were contrasted between cases who were suffering from diabetes and healthy individual. It was noted that family history that has p-value=0.000 and Planned diet that has p-value=0.001 were more significant between patients and control while smoking showed the significant relation between normal healthy individual and patients and has a p-value 0.005. The statistical relation was insignificant between control and patients about age， exercise， treatment regularity，gender， and marital status because they have a p-value greater than 0.05.\n\nThrough logistic regression testing，variousSbiochemical parameters were contrasted between T2D patients and healthy individuals. It was noted that all biochemical parameters were not associated with the incidence of developing T2D because all biochemical parameters have a p-value greater than 0.05 that denotes|删除段之间换行|a non-significant association.\n\n【35】Through1binary logistic regression testing，different anthropometric measurements were contrasted between T2D patients and Normal people. It was noted that the waist and body mass index were highly significant linked with diabetes because both variables have a p-value greater 0.000 while weight was significantly associated with diabetes. The height is a non-significant parameter that was not associated with diabetes.\n\n【36】Association of rs5219 KCNJ11genotypes with the demographic， biochemical and anthropometric parameters associated with T2DM\n\n【37】Through the chi-square test， when different genotypes of the KCNJ11 gene were compared with various demographic， biochemical and anthropometric parameters then it was noted that all demographic and biochemical factors showed no association between the polymorphism of KCNJ11 and diabetes while BM1is a highly significant parameter and was associated with KCNJ11polymorphism while weight， height， and waist， were non-significant factors that were not linked with genotypes of KCNJ11.\n\n【38】Association of rs11196205 TCF7L2 genotypes with the demographic， clinical and biochemical parameters associated with T2D\n\n【39】From the test of chi-square when the different genotypes were contrasting with these risk factors that linked with DM. it was seen that age， genus， smoking， inheritance detail， exercise， planned diet， and marital information was the non-significant factors and are not linked with the one or more genotype . From the test of chi-square when the different genotypes were contrasting with these clinical factors linked with DM. it was seen that BMI， waist， fasting glycogen level， diastolic plasma pressures， systolic plasma pressures， HbAlc and， random plasma glycogen level was the non-significant factors and are not linked with the one or more genotypes.\n\n【40】Association of genotypic and allelic frequency of rs5219in KCNJ11 and rs11196205 in TCF7L2 with T2DM\n\n【41】The KCNJ11 genotype ofpatients and control showed insignificant results as the p-value is 0.415. The allelic frequency of A was 0.886in control and 0.846 in patients. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was used to determine the allelic frequency in controland cases. In TCFL2gene， the p-value was the 0.62 that showed the non-significant linkage with the DM.

In this current study， there was majority of AA genotype and mutant allele A in both non-diabetic and diabetic patients thus，rs5219 (E23K)polymorphism was insignificantly associated with T2D. The difference between KCNJ11genotypes in two groups was found statistically insignificant as p value is 0.415. Our results of KCNJ11 gene were similar with other studies such as Iranian， Ghanian and Nigerian population which confirmed the non-significant association of KCNJ11 polymorphism with T2DM. On the other hand， these findings were found to be inconsistent with many studies like Korean and Mexican population. This difference may be due to the diversity of ethnicity， sample size and geographicallocation.\n\n【47】Based on the results ofthis study， the high significance of BMI was shown with the polymorphism of the KCNJ11 gene which conforms with the findings of the Euro-Brazilian population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.

Given the repeated episodes of thrombotic microangiopathy while the patient was on various high-dose immunosuppressive therapeutic regimens， other causes responsible for the relapse of the microangiopathic syndrome had been considered. By exclusion of the causes frequently incriminated in this pathology the determination of ADAMTS13 was determined， the results revealing a deficiency in the activity of this factor. The patient continued treatment with MPD and therapy with Mycophenolate mofetil was initiated. The disease course was favorable with no relapse episodes recorded.\n\n【15】The definitive diagnosis was SLE and thrombotic microangiopathy due to ADAMTS13 deficiency.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) is a rare condition (3.7cases per 1 million patients) characterized pathophysiologically by an injury to the vascular endothelium of small vessels (most often of autoimmune origin) followed by a microvascular thrombosis， consumption thrombocytopenia， and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia， as well as neurological manifestations (through the mechanism of cerebral microthrombosis) eventually leading to ischemia and infarction in the affected organ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Etiologically， TMA is divided into：\n\n【19】TMA due to genetic defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>\n\n【20】Acquired TMA (Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura(TTP) due to ADAMTS13 deficiency， shiga-like toxin-mediated or Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated hemolytic anduremic syndrome， malignant hypertension， drug-inducedTMAA-by overdose or intolerance to active substances， complement-mediated TMA)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】ADAMTS13 is a protease responsible for the cleavage of von Willebrand factor multimers and for their adhesion to the vascular endothelium. In cases of ADAMTS13 deficiency， von Willebrand factor multimers accumulate (through clearance deficiency) causing platelet adhesion with microthrombosis in small vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>.\n\n【22】TTP due to ADAMTS13 deficiency can be acquired (mediated by antibodies directed against ADAMTS13 activity) or hereditary(Upshaw-Schulman syndrome - homozygous and heterozygous mutation of the gene encoding ADAMTS13 on chromosome 9q34)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. The classic manifestations are the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia， severe consumption thrombocytopenia， and kidney damage- presence of nitrogen retention， proteinuria and/or hematuria， various neurological manifestations， and fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The diagnosis is made based on clinical data (skin pallor with scleral subicterus，fever，rash， neurological manifestations-headache， convulsions， obnubilation， coma) and laboratory data (presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia， severe thrombocytopenia， nitrogen retention， proteinuria， determination of ADAMTS13activity can range between <5% and 10%11，12.\n\n【24】TTP by ADAMTS13 deficiency is a severe form of thrombotic microangiopathy with increased mortality that requires prompt， effective and rapid therapeutic intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The treatment of choice is plasmapheresis and high-dose corticosteroid therapy (pulse therapy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Used soon after diagnosis， it can ensure improved survival.\n\n【26】Patients with autoimmuneTTP may y also benefit from immunosuppressive medication. Immunosuppressant's such as cyclophosphamide， cyclosporine， vincristine， mycophenolate mofetil have been used with inconsistent results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.

TMA may be a rare form of lupus in the hematopoietic system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The difference between a lupus-related hematological disorder and pure TTP is difficult in some situations (especially when it precedes the diagnosis of SLE).\n\n【29】In SLEpatients，TMA is causedbythepresence ofantiphospholipid syndrome or a mechanism of lupus vasculitis， while the mechanism of pure TTP is different. The association of SLE with pure TTP is extremely rare and inconsistently reported in the literature.\n\n【30】The two clinical entities need to be diagnosed and differentiated rapidly because any delay in initiating the treatment of choice(plasmapheresis) can have a major impact on mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. ADAMTS13 determination is required in cases of suspected TTP in a patient previously diagnosed with SLE， but not mandatory. Demonstration of ADAMTS13 deficiency in the presence of classica TTP phenomena confirms the diagnosis， but isSIOT essential. The reasoning behind this is that other microangiopathic hemolytic anemia accompanied by thrombocytopenia may have low ADAMTS13 activity but are not diagnosed as TTP (bacterial endocarditis， malignancies， and systemic inflammatory diseases). The sensitivity and specificity of the ADAMTS13 determination is 95%25.\n\n【31】In a 2015 study of a group of 50 lupus patients who experienced various thrombotic events， low ADAMTS13 activity and increased circulating levels of VW factor monomers (66%±27% vs.101%±8%， P<0.01， and 325%±151%vs. 81%±14%，P<0.001) were recorded. Low ADAMTS13 activity and the presence of a PL were recorded in patients with active disease. The authors concluded that ADAMTS13activity could be a useful predictive biomarker for screening patients with active disease and risk ofthrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【32】In our patient， lupus renal involvement， WHO class IV nephritis was confirmed by Renal Puncture Biopsy (RPB).\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】The peculiarity ofthis case is represented by the repeated episodes of thrombotic microangiopathy accompanied by moderate nephritic-type relapses identified during SLE activity.\n\n【35】The therapeutic response to immunosuppressant's after various treatment regimens (cyclophosphamide/corticosteroids according to2 protocols-NIH and EURO-LUPUS， administration of fresh frozen plasma without plasmapheresis) but with frequent TMA relapses，led us to investigate other causes of TMA. Thus，low ADAMTS13 activity corroborated with clinical and laboratory findings， confirmed the diagnosis of TTP.\n\n【36】Another peculiarity of this case was the absence of neurological phenomena during TMA relapses (except for headache)， thus raising the suspicion of TTP being delayed.\n\nAfter a definitive diagnosis was made and the therapeutic regimen was changed (introduction of mycophenolate mofetil) the patient had not experienced any TTP episode (follow-up period 2 years). In the literature there are few reported cases in which patients diagnosed with TTP associated with ADAMTS13 deficiency have benefited from treatment with MMF/steroids/plasmapheresis， with complete remission of TTP and no relapses. This would be a promising therapeutic alternative that requires further study in patients with|删除段之间换行|TTP refractory to classical treatment， a problem raised by the authors of the article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

As well as our own volunteers going out to colony locations to directly rescue the stray and abandoned cats， we often loan cages to members of the public who have unwanted strays on their property. Each cat rescued is taken to a local vet for a temperament and health assessment， with the great majority being collected by a local foster home通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Lonely Miaow Focus and Strategy\n\nWe focus on stray and abandoned cats in unmanaged colonies in the Auckland region. We are|删除段之间换行|not involved with owned or feral cats， nor do we manage stray cat colonies.\n\n【20】Our management strategy is Trap， Assess， Resolve. We do not return a cat to a situation where its health and welfare are not being cared for. We work with members of the public who report stray cat colonies to us to achieve the best outcome for the individual cat， and we welcome collaboration with other rescue groups.\n\n【21】Reasons for our focus I am sure are clear to all. In spite of the significant numbers mentioned at the start of this talk Lonely Miaow has not made a substantial impact on the overall total. A guesstimate figure of 200，000 stray and abandoned cats in Auckland was published in Animals’ Voice in 2012， which could mean around 1 million unwanted kittens born in Auckland each year.\n\n【22】The main reason we operate a Trap， Assess， resolve management strategy is because stray and abandoned cats are suffering， from starvation， sickness， and lack of shelter from inclement weather. A cat is a domestic animal， New Zealand's most popular companion animal. We believe it does not have a place outside of the human bond as a stray or feral in New Zealand. The suffering they endure is highlighted by a recent study made by Sarah Jolly， Unitec， 2014，“Welfare Comparison between managed and unmanaged colony cats in the Auckland Region.\" To quote： “It was of great interest that there was a significant difference in body condition score between the managed and unmanaged colony cats. Thin condition was much more prevalent in the unmanaged colony cats than the managed.\"“There was a substantial difference in the subjective quality of life score given to managed and unmanaged colony cats. No excellent quality oflife scores was given to unmanaged colony cats.”\n\n【23】What is a Stray Cat?\n\n【24】Lonely Miaow receives an unending stream of calls and reports from members of the public about stray and abandoned cats and kittens. All communications are responded to， to ascertain the number of felines involved， their exact location and type of location， and what steps have been taken to establish that these are stray or abandoned felines. Often these cats have turned up， usually at the place of residence and occasionally at the workplace of the person reporting. Most often too the person reporting has started feeding， then kittens have arrived， and now there are too many and none are wanted. We confirm that enquiries have been made to ascertain whether there is an owner， and no owner has been found. We may check ourselves with Pets on The Net， or distribute flyers around the neighborhood. Often， we are told that an old guy or lady had some entire cats， and now that person has gone the cats have dispersed throughout the neighborhood. On visiting the location to rescue those reported we are often told that “there are more down the back.”There are always more!\n\n【25】删除3:<u>Trap，Assess，Resolve</u>\n\nEach cat trapped is assessed by the rescuer and by the vet for temperament and health. The great majority are assessed as suitable for fostering and rehoming， with the main reason for a negative outcome being unsuitable temperament. The great majority of sick cats are treated by a vet， fostered， and rehomed. Whilst no cat is returned to a colony situation， Lonely Miaow makes a great effort to work with members of the public to achieve the desired outcome. Occasionally a cat is wanted back， and therefore after confirming that the person is willing and able to feed it cat food every day， the cat|删除段之间换行|is defleaed， dewormed， vaccinated， desexed and microchipped and returned to the place where it was rescued from， but as an owned， not a colony， cat.\n\n【27】What is a Cat Colony?\n\n【28】According to the Companion Cats Animal Welfare Code， 2007， published by NAWAC， Section 13： \"Stray cats may live singly or may join colonies.\"Lonely Miaow considers a colony to comprise of one or more stray cats. A single stray is often a pregnant female， resulting in a sudden increase in numbers. The largest colonies we have been involved with have comprised 120 stray cats. An average colony is around five， basically a mother and kittens. The majority of colonies，80%， are located on residential land.\n\n【29】Cat Colonies - How they are Managed and Resolved\n\n【30】At Lonely Miaow we define anything from one cat to a large group of cats at a property as a colony. When people contact us through our website， email or phone to report cats our call loggers log these in our database as colonies.\n\n【31】From these colony logs the Rescue Manager goes through daily and assesses the urgency of each colony based on：\n\n【32】If the cats are in danger?\n\n【33】Are they being fed?\n\n【34】Do they pose a risk to people?\n\n【35】Do we have foster space?\n\n【36】Any cat that is not being fed， is pregnant or is in danger is our top priority.\n\n【37】Usually if a cat is injured and requires urgent attention or is being mistreated， they will be referred to the SPCA. Sometimes we get reports of cats that are putting people at risk. We have recently been involved with a stray pregnant cat coming into a 99-year old’s home and posing a tripping hazard. In this case not only is it a priority due to the cat being pregnant but also because the man could come to harm by it being there.\n\n【38】Once it is decided that the cats will be rescued a rescue volunteer is organized to go to the property to trap the cat， or the person reporting can drop it to one of our participating vets. When all the cats are in our care the colony can be closed.\n\n【39】We have still a number of colonies we have been working on for a long period of time that are not as simple to bring in. They have a ale 110colony manager who takes care of trapping and assessing these cats to slowly work towards resolving these larger and possibly wilder colonies.\n\n【40】Foster Homes andFostered Cats- How thev are Humanely Managed and Adopted Out to a Responsible Owner\n\nLonely Miaow currently has over 100 active foster homes throughout Auckland， a number that has almost doubled in the past vear. The foster home management team have spent the last two years focused on both refining procedures and the growth of Lonely Miaow， hindered only by a lack of financial resources， a limitation that is shared by so many other rescue organizations. Winter is the quieter season when a lot of our hardworking volunteers take a short|删除段之间换行|break and we usually house upwards of about 60 cats and kittens. In kitten season the number of cats and kittens in our care can exceed删除4:<u> 200</u>.\n\n【42】All of our foster homes are volunteers - supplies and access to veterinary care is provided by Lonely Miaow， but the heart and soul of our efforts lie with them. The gift they give Lonely Miaow is one that many of you will be familiar with- not only do they contribute their valuable time while juggling family and work commitments， they are often found staying up late to feed orphaned or abandoned kittens， administering to cats that are unwell， and exercising patience with those that need a bit of time to come around to the idea of living with people.\n\n【43】It's not uncommon for a cat who lacks confidence around people to remain in our care for six months or more before even being ready to meet potential adopters， and the foster homes who not only have the perseverance to continue rehabilitation efforts， but the strength to invest so heavily in these cats， and then see them leave to go to new homes are a huge， and sadly very limited asset that helps to give these less confident， less desirable'strays a chance at a life where they are healthy， safe and cared for.\n\n【44】Lonely Miaow’s cats and kittens are all desexed， microchipped， and started on a flea treatment， worming and vaccination protocol before leaving our care. Our adoptions include microchip registration on the New Zealand Companion Animal Register database， which is processed immediately after adoption to ensure that these microchips can be utilized without delay in the event that a cat goes missing. We are proud to be partnered with Pet Plan Pet Insurance， who offer a free four-week cover with almost all of our adoptions.\n\n【45】Our policies in assessing potential adopters include a mandatory meet-and-greet before an adoption can be mutually agreed upon(while we will allow a short hold' period， we do not consent to adoptions sight-unseen)， owner-occupancy or confirmation that a landlord is agreeable to a new feline family member， and an open discussion on the household's suitability to the cat (or vice versa). We are lucky to have developed a relationship with Pet Stock stores in Auckland late last year， who have shown exceptional judgement and heart in caring for our more confident cats and kittens in-store and facilitating many more adoptions than we would have been able to achieve on our own. It is this collaboration that has allowed us to achieve our recent growth sustainably with only a few scary financial moments!\n\n【46】Lonely Miaow is only as great as our volunteers， and we are so proud of each one of them， and the development and improvements that we have been able to make in recent years. It is the combined efforts of all of us， as well as supporting and helping each other， that will ultimately see us achieve our common goal.\n\n【47】FutureManagementofStrayand Abandoned Cats\n\n【48】As stated earlier Lonely Miaow has not been successful in making a significant impact on the overall number of stray cats and colonies.\n\n【49】This is because we operate a scatter-gun approach， rushing to rescue cats from a colony in one suburb to a colony in other miles away. Over the years we have rescued cats from colonies in ninety-nine Auckland suburbs. We simply can’t keep up. In discussing this issue with William Gomaa， Alley Cat Allies USA， over dinner at a recent NZCAC conference， he put forward a different approach. Start with one colony at one house， expand to neighboring properties， cover the whole block， then adjacent blocks， the whole neighborhood， adjacent neighborhoods， and finally the whole city， region， and country. But that would mean condemning cats in say Henderson to carry on suffering whilst we focused on say Otahuhu. We care for them all equally， so we keep rushing about rescuing a few from everywhere， and meantime the problem continues.\n\n【50】Sarah Jolly's study， referred to earlier， points the way for the future.“Global cat overpopulation is no doubt a human responsibility.\"Compulsory， subsidized desexing， microchipping and vaccination laws for owned cats as well as colony cats could be implemented. Registration of cats would help enforce these laws.\"“More resources are needed for the removal of unmanaged colony cats from urban areas and for funding of larger animal shelters to make the potential of rehoming greater. Colony carers， wildlife managers， animal control，shelters， and veterinarians and most importantly the public must all work together to find the most humane solutions to this huge problem. Adoption for socialized cats remains the ideal solution but isn’t possible for all stray cats. The responsibility of managing cat populations lies ultimately with both local and central government who can create and enforce laws and provide funding and resources Non-governmental organizations also play a large role and should work together with the government for the best possible solutions.”\n\n【51】We are delighted that the Wellington City Council has introduced compulsory microchipping and registration for cats which will come into force in February 2018， and we hope that this initiative will be taken up by all New Zealand's Territorial Authorities.\n\n【52】It is pleasing that the NZCAC has created the National Cat Management Strategic Group comprising NZVA， Companion AnimalSociety， RNZSPCA，locallgovernment，the Morgan Foundation，and NZCAC representatives， to proactively address the impact of cats in New Zealand， and by doing so taking up a number of Sarah's recommendations. The Strategic Goals are commendable， and achievable if we all work together. Management， a comprehensive database， staff and volunteers， legislation and bylaws， Cat Rescue Centers， and above all finance， are all requirements for success. Lonely Miaow fully supports the Intent， Strategic Goals， and Strategic Outcomes and we will play our full part in achieving these.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

AIHA is a severe hematological manifestation ofCMV infection. AIHA is an erythrocyte (RBC) hematologic disorder that is rarely seen in infants and young children. Most cases are associated with viral or bacterial infection， but the immunologic events leading to hemolysis are poorly understood. We report two cases of infants who presented with severe anemia and CMV infection. The first infant had chronic refractory mixed AIHA and the second infant had anemia directly attributable to CMV infection.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection presenting as severe anemia in infancy is rare. Auto-Immune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) is characterized by the presence of auto antibodies that bind to RBC membranes and lead to their premature destruction. It can be classified as primary or secondary AIHA. The latter is due to lymphoproliferative and autoimmune diseases， drugs， and severe injuries. Bacteria and viruses can be associated with AIHA in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Amongst its various hematological manifestations， Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause transient neutropenia with thrombocytopenia or more severe， such as AIHA and pancytopenia. We report two cases of infants who presented with severe anemia， thrombocytopenia， and CMV infection. The first infant had chronic refractory mixed AIHA and the second infant had severe anemia and thrombocytopenia directly attributable to CMV infection.\n\n【4】Case Series\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【7】A six-month-old male child born out of third-degree consanguineous marriage presented with new onset progressive paleness of the body and worsening respiratory difficulty in the last 20 days. He received 7 aliquots of packed RBC every 2 to 3 days in the past 20 days and was started on syrup prednisolone at 2 mg/kg/day with no response. His physical examination was remarkable for severe tachypnea (54/min)， tachycardia (166/min)， pallor， icterus with moderate hepatosplenomegaly. CBC at admission showed severe anemia with thrombocytopenia with a hemoglobin of 3.1 g/dl with a platelet count of 43，000/uL. The corrected total leukocyte count was 18，600/uL with 30%neutrophils， 68% lymphocytes， and 2% myelocytes and metamyelocytes each. Peripheral smear showed numerous spherocytes with reticulocytosis of 23%. There was indirect hyperbilirubinemia， LDH was 2150 U/L and Direct Coombs Test (DCT) was strongly positive (4+). DCT positivity was due to IgG (titer ≥ 1000) of subclasses IgG1 (titer >100) & IgG3 (titer >100) coating the red cells along with C3d， a very weak coating with IgM was also seen. A diagnosis of AIHA was made. Serologic and virologic testing revealed CMV IgM and CMV IgG positive. CMV PCR blood and urine showed 200 copies and 2120 copies， respectively. Flow cytometry for double negative TCRaB+T cells was negative.\n\nHe was started on intravenous ganciclovir (dose calculated as 3 x BSAx Creatinine clearance) daily for 10 days. He also received IVIg at 1g/kg daily for 2 doses with methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg for 3 days followed byprednisone at 2 mg/kg for 2 weeks followed by a slow taper of 0.25 mg/kg/week. At discharge he was shifted to Valganciclovir. His hemolysis continued with persistent requirement of blood transfusion. He had a poor response to steroids and was started on weekly rituximab at375 mg/m. Peripheral blood PCR for CMV DNA came negative after 3 weeks of valganciclovir. His hemoglobin stabilized at 10.8 g/dl， platelet count normalized， LDH was 568 U/， and bilirubin was|删除段之间换行|0.8 mg/dl after 3 weeks of rituximab.Steroids were slowlytapered and stopped as he was in complete remission. He relapsed after 2 months of stopping steroids and 6 months after rituximab therapy. He was restarted on steroids followed by mycophenolate mofetil at a dose of400 mg/m’as the steroid sparing agent. He started responding within1 month and the steroids were tapered slowly and stopped. At his last visit to the OPD in June 2021，he was 1 year and 8 months of age， his parameters were- hemoglobin 14 g/dl， LDH 368U/L， bilirubin 0.53mg/dl.MMF is planned to be tapered slowly .\n\n【9】Case 2\n\n【10】A five-month-old male child was symptomatic from 2 months of age with pallor， decreased activity with decreased feeding. There was no history of fever， jaundice， or any bleeding. He had received 4 PRBC transfusions in the past 2 months. On examination he had pallor with moderate hepatosplenomegaly. Blood investigations revealed hemoglobin of 3.9 g/dl， normal total leukocyte count of 17100/uL， platelet count of 23，000/uL， and absolute reticulocyte count 45，000/uL. His serum bilirubin was 2.3 mg/dl， with indirect bilirubin 1.3 mg/dl， LDH was 590 U/L. DCT was negative. A bone marrow biopsy was done and revealed marked erythroid hyperplasia with unremarkable megakaryocytes and myeloid cells.\n\n【11】Presence of anemia with hepatosplenomegaly with hepatitis with marked erythroid hyperplasia in bone marrow， differential of thalassemia； CDA and infection related (TORCH) was kept. TORCH profile was positive for CMV IgM and IgG antibodies. CMV PCR revealed 2130 copies/uL. A diagnosis of CMV infection causing recurrent anemia was made. He was started on ganciclovir and received it for 18 days. He became transfusion independent and his liver and spleen regressed on ganciclovir.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\nIn this case series， we report two infants both with CMV infection with severe anemia， thrombocytopenia， and moderate hepatosplenomegaly. The cause of anemia in case 1 was mixed autoimmune hemolytic anemia and on the other hand， the cause of|删除段之间换行|anemia in case 2 was attributed directly to CMV infection. In both these cases， thrombocytopenia improved with treatment of CMV infection. The mixed AIHA in case 1 was steroid refractory and required rituximab as secondarytreatment， further during the course， relapsed and required steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy(mycophenolate mofetil). We would be discussing case 1 in detail.\n\n【14】Heisel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> evaluated prognostic factors in childhood AIHA and concluded that there are two distinct varieties of AIHA in children， the acute disease generally occurred in 2 to 12 years of age， had a sudden onset of symptoms， showed low reticulocyte counts and had normal platelet counts. This acute disease variety responded well to steroids and the disease resolved within 6 months without mortality. On the other hand， children with chronic AIHA were generally less than 2 or greater than 12 years of age， had a more prolonged onset of symptoms， had increased reticulocyte counts， and had decreased platelet counts. These children with the chronic variety had a variable response to steroids， frequently requiring other modalities of treatment and had a mortality of 25%. It also seems to be the scenario as in case number 1，he had a poor response to steroids and relapsed 6 months after Rituximab， warranting maintenance of second line steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nLiterature was reviewed regarding CMV as the cause of AIHA in children. In the largest series of pediatric AIHA patients， Aladjidi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， we evaluated 265 children with AIHA and reported 6 patients with Cytomegalovirus as the causative agent for AIHA. Naithani et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， reported 26 patients (range， 0.2 to 17 years) with AIHA. Secondary AIHA was seen in 9 (35%)patients， with only 1 patient with CMV as the etiology. Thatikonda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， in their study evaluating50 childhood AIHA patients， CMV was the causative etiology in 1patient only. In a study by Fan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>，7 patients out of 68 cases were EBV/CMV positive. Few case reports of CMV with AIHA are reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. All these studies suggest that CMV is a rare cause of AIHA in children. Comparing with adults， Rafailidis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， we performed a systematic review of 290 immunocompetent patients with severe CMV infection， 25 patients were found to have various|删除段之间换行|hematological manifestations among them only five were found to have hemolytic anemia， so AIHA secondary to CMV infection is a rare event in adults.\n\n【16】Efficacy of Rituximab in steroid refractory AIHA in children has been reported in small case series. Zecca et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， reported data of fifteen children (range， 0.3 to 14 years) with AIHA who were given rituximab， 375 mg/m²/dose for a median of 3 weekly doses. Three responders relapsed at 7， 8 and 10 months after rituximab infusion. Quartier et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> reported five children with refractory idiopathic AIHA who received rituximab. All children remained in complete remission for 15 to 22 months after receiving rituximab. In adult patients， the median duration of response after Rituximab is 20 months. In our case number 1， the infant started responding to rituximab after the 3 weekly dose but relapsed after 6 months. Rituximab use is associated with absence of circulating B cells and hypogammaglobulinemia，which have implications for vaccineefficacy especially in infants. Ideally inactivated vaccines should be completed at least 1 week prior， and any live-attenuated vaccines should be completed a minimum of 4 weeks prior to commencing treatment. Due to lack of immune cell function， all future immunizations should be withheld whilst on rituximab. Post the completion of rituximab therapy， immunoglobulin and B-cell levels should be checked every 3months. Once both levels have returned to normal AND 26 months post treatment has lapsed (whichever is later)， immunization with both inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines can recommence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【17】According to the guidelinesfromAIEOP for second-linetreatment nwarm AIHA pediatric patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>， second-line treatment options for steroid dependence on a dose of prednisone ≥ 0.1 mg/kg/day to 0.2 mg/kg/day， include rituximab， immunosuppressive drugs， splenectomy， alemtuzumab and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Immunosuppressive drugs， with the exception of cyclophosphamide， are an appropriate second-line treatment， as they can be used as steroid-protective drugs in steroid-dependent patients. Given that these drugs require a long time to elicit a response， in fact， they should be infused early with the help of powerful drugs， such as steroids. Mycophenolate mofetil， a potent inhibitor of the enzyme containing 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase， is the most widely indicated in steroid-dependent patients to reduce the dose of steroids. Panigrahi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> reported in 3 pediatric AIHA patients that MMF appears to be an effective and well-tolerated adjunct immunosuppressant that allows for rapid weaning of steroid usage， minimal adverse side effects to the patients， and long-term stabilization ofcounts. Therefore，this novel combination therapy may be an excellent alternative for the treatment of persistent or chronic autoimmune cytopenia's in the pediatric population. In our patient， MMF with steroids was started and the patient achieved complete response on MMF and steroids could be tapered. He tolerated MMF and had no side effects and remains in complete remission.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\nCMV infection should be considered when evaluating patients with severe anemia and thrombocytopenia. AIHA may be primary or secondary to other diseases， including infections， autoimmune|删除段之间换行|disorders， and malignancies. The mixed AIHA in our case was secondary to CMV infection. It was steroid refractory and relapsed after 6 months of rituximab therapy and received MMF as the steroid sparing immunosuppressive therapy. The patient had no side effects to MMF. MMF may be an excellent alternative for the treatment of chronic AIHA in pediatric patients. Vaccination should be carefully planned in children， especially infants receiving rituximab.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Its worldwide prevalence is unknown， however， there are epidemiological reports that consider that Aspergillus fumigatus colonizes the respiratory tree of 25% of asthmatics； however， only 2% of patients go on to develop ABPA. Currently， worldwide， the global burden of ABPA exceeds 4.8 million， being an underdiagnosed entity that affects the quality of life of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Although the disease is acquired by inhaling the microscopic spores of Aspergillus， most people do not contract it， and there is a higher risk of infection in patients with any immunosuppressive condition or presence of pulmonary disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【7】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【8】For its diagnosis， predisposing factors such as a history of asthma or fibrosis should be taken into account， in addition to laboratory tests， such as a positive Aspergillus test， high IgE levels and eosinophil counts. It should be clarified that in most patients with uncontrolled asthma， despite receiving adequate standard treatment， it is recommended that ABPA be suspected\\[51.\n\n【9】We present the case of a 45-year-old female patient with a history of uncontrolled bronchial asthma， who was admitted to hospital with the initial diagnosis of infected bronchiectasis，laboratory revealed increased IgE， eosinophilia and positive galactomannan antigen， confirming the diagnosis to ABPA.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】cited.\n\nFemale patient， 45 years old， from Lima-Peru， with family history of bronchial asthma.

With medical history ofbronchial asthma 5 years ago， whose usual treatment consists of fluticasone-salmeterol 250/50 ug (2 inhalations every 12 h) and salbutamol on demand， adherent to treatment； with history of asthmatic crises of mild to moderate intensity several times a year in the last 3 years despite regular treatment. No history of previous hospitalizations. She was admitted to the emergency department of Hospital Dos de Mayo on January 21 ， 2020 due to 5 days of illness|删除段之间换行|characterized by increased respiratory frequency and consistency of expectoration， with mucopurulent features， associated with progressive dyspnea. On the day of admission， she presented a fever of 38°C associated with dyspnea on moderate exertion， which was the reason why she went to the emergency department.\n\n【13】At the time of evaluation， the patient presented tachycardia140 bpm， tachypnea 24 rpm， oxygen saturation 92% (FiO， 21%)， body temperature 38.5℃ and blood pressure 110/80 mmHg. On preferential. physical examination there were diffuse wheezing in both lung fields and fine crackles in lung bases. The rest of the evaluation was unaltered. Subsequently the patient was referred to the hospitalization area of the Pneumology service.\n\n【14】Among the laboratory findings on the first day of admission to that service， the hemogram showed mild anemia (Hb： 10.5 g/dL)， leukocytosis (leukocytes： 19670 mm’ and abastonates： 393.4 mm) with mild eosinophilia (750 mm) and a value of C-reactive protein of 185 mg/dL. The electrolytes， urine and sputum GenXpert tests showed no other alterations.\n\n【15】Pulmonary CT (HRCT) showed pulmonary parenchyma with multiple bronchiectasis of cylindrical and varicose appearance of bilateral central location .\n\n【16】The patient received antibiotic therapy with ceftazidime 2gr/24 h for 14 days， prior sputum culture which was positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa， in addition to inhaler therapy (salbutamol2 PUFF/6 h and Ipatropium bromide 2 PUFF/6 h). On the fifth day of treatment there is evidence of persistent bronchospasm，the results of the control laboratory tests show a slightleukocytosis (10，140 mm’- abastonates： 0 mm’) with a slight eosinophilia (750 mm) and a decrease in c-reactive protein (58.7 mg/dl).\n\n【17】Due to the persistence of bronchospasm， eosinophilia and the distribution of bronchiectasis in the pulmonary HRCT， it was decided to expand the laboratories， obtaining a value of immunoglobulin E greater than 2500 IU/ml and a positive result of galactomannan antigen (Aspergillus).\n\n【18】With these results a diagnosis of Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA) was made and she was discharged with Itraconazole 200 mg c/12 hand prednisone 20 mg c/24h.\n\n【19】The patient continues to attend her check-ups at the hospital， with clinical improvement and absence ofbronchospasm episodes.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】ABPA is an inflammatory lung disease produced by an infection of the Aspergillus fungus， as a response to the antigens of this infection， with immune responses mediated by antibodies (IgE and IgG) and by cells，release of cytokines and interleukins， among others. These responses， combined with the toxic effects of the fungus， cause airway damage such as epithelial rupture and activation of immune responses， which can lead to bronchiectasis and fibrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6\\]</u>.\n\nThe International Society for Human and Animal Mycology(ISHAM) has proposed diagnostic criteria， grouping them into3 blocks： Predisposing conditions， mandatory criteria and other criteria. For diagnosis， one of the predisposing conditions must be present： Asthma or cystic fibrosis； both mandatory criteria： Positive Aspergillus skin test with elevated serum IgE levels >1000 IU/mL； and at least 2 of 3 of the other criteria： Total eosinophil count >500cells/uL， presence of IgG antibodies to Aspergillus furigatus or chest|删除段之间换行|radiograph consistent with ABPA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the present case， the patient reported a history of asthma and at the laboratorylevel presented IgE concentrations greater than 2500 IU/mL，eosinophilia and a positive galactomannan test， which corroborated the diagnosis of ABPA.\n\n【23】With the development of ABPA， there is a poor control of asthma， so they may worsen and manifest with cough or increased expectoration， considering that some patients may have brownish black expectoration， secondary to the accumulation of degenerated eosinophils， desquamated epithelial cells and mucin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6，8\\]</u>. They may also present hemoptysis， fever or febrile fever， weight loss， general malaise， wheezing and bronchial hyperresponsiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【24】At the imaging level， chest radiography usually shows the presence of fugitive opacities as indicative of ABPA， and is useful in follow-up， avoiding the need for repeated CT scans. For patients with ABPA， High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) of the chest is the most sensitive test， as it allows better evaluation of the distribution of bronchiectasis and other findings that are not apparent on radiography. Bronchiectasis and mucoid impaction are the classic ABPA findings on CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，10\\]</u>. In this patient， bronchiectasis was evidenced in the middle lobe and lingula， which， in the context of a patient with a history of asthma， increases the clinical suspicion ofABPA\n\n【25】Regarding treatment， itraconazole and voriconazole are used in the treatment of ABPA and only for patients who cannot taper oral corticosteroid or have an exacerbation of ABPA. The use of other drugs such as Omalizumab， itraconazole and voriconazole are still being investigated删除4-1:<u>10</u>. In this case the patient was prescribed Itraconazole and Prednisone.\n\n【26】In conclusion， we report a case of ABPA witha clinicalpresentation of uncontrolled asthma. It is recommended that serological screening tests for Aspergillus fumigatus be routinely performed， together with high-resolution chest CT， in asthmatic patients， particularly in those with uncontrolled and/or difficult to treat asthma， since a timely diagnosis and treatment will improve the prognosis and quality of life of these patients.\n\n【27】删除6:<u>1\\.

Up to now， inclusive education was considered as “children with special needs and ordinary children study and live together in the same physical space， and enjoy equal， non-discriminatory and high-quality education”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In the 1990s， China carried out the work of learning in regular class for children with disabilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. With the vigorous implementation of learning in regular class， its quality had attracted more attention. Two periods of special education promotion plans had been issued successively， aiming to put forward requirements for running special education well in the new era and caring for special children. On December 31，2021，the General Office of the State Council forwarded“14h Five-Year Plan\"Special Education Development and Upgrading Action Plan， which clearly pointed out that it was necessary to explore an inclusive education model that could adapt to the common growth of children with disabilities and ordinary children， and promote the integration of children with disabilities and ordinary children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The importance of inclusive education could be clearlyseen. However， in the implementation ofinclusive education， “along with the class but just sitting “mixed study with class and students reflux frequently occurred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> and the teaching effect of inclusive education had always been questioned. Therefore， how to improve the quality of inclusive education is more and more important.\n\n【12】删除1:<u>Copyright @ 2022 Fu W.

Therefore，|删除段之间换行|improving the quality of inclusive physical education could not only promote the physical and mental healthy growth of special and ordinary children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>， but also promote the overall development of inclusive education in China. The direct implementers of inclusive physical education were physical education teachers， who determined the quality of inclusive physical education. Among them， the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers played an important role 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

On the basis ofprevious studies， this study defined the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers as the basic conditions and abilities that physical education teachers needed to have when carrying out inclusive physical education teaching activities， including professional attitude， professional knowledge， professional skills and the capacity ofacquiring supports.\n\n【14】To sum up， the development of inclusive physical education in China was still in its initial stage. A large number of studies remained in the exploration of inclusive physical education theories， and the relevant research on improving the quality of inclusive physical education was few. High-quality inclusive physical education could not only promote the physical and mental development of special children， but also realize the care for the life of special children， so that special children could enjoy life. While there are few studies pay attention on the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers. In order to provide practical implication for improving the quality of our inclusive physical education， this study analyzed the factors influencing the inclusive educational quality of physical education teachers in primary and secondary schools based on the analysis of the inclusive education quality of P.E. teachers in primary and secondary schools.\n\n【15】Method\n\n【16】Participants\n\n【17】P.E. teachers in primary and secondary schools were selected as the subjects by convenient sampling throughout the country. It covered 20 provinces， including the northeast， east， central and west， with a total of 317 people. After screening， 286 valid questionnaires were obtained， with an effective rate of 90.2%.

In order to investigate the structure of the questionnaire and the expression of the items， five primary and middle school P.E. teachers and one special education expert were consulted for their opinions. After adjusting the items and expression， the questionnaire on Inclusive Educational Competency of Primary and Middle School P.E. Teachers was formed. The questionnaire consisted of the basic information of the subjects and the status quo of inclusive education competency. The first part was the basic information of the subiects. The contents include gender，|删除段之间换行|province， school district， education background， teaching age， study section， taught special children or not and the length of training related to inclusive education. The second part was the core content of the questionnaire， which was the current situation of the inclusive education competency. It was divided into four parts with a total of28 questions. Part one， professional attitude， 9 questions； Part two， professional knowledge， 6 questions； part three， professional skills， 7questions； part four， capacity of acquiring supports， 6 questions. The questionnaire used a five-level scoring method. According to whether the respondents agreed with the item description， the options were divided into \"strongly agree\"， “relatively agree\"， “not sure\"， “not quite agree” and “strongly disagree\"， which were respectively scored 5，4， 3， 2 and 1 points. The higher the score， the higher the inclusive education competency of the teacher. The reliability analysis of the questionnaire showed that the internal consistency coefficients of the four factors of professional attitude， professional knowledge， professional skills and capacity of acquiring supports were 0.931，0.951， 0.958 and 0.952， respectivelyy.The internal consistency coefficient of the total questionnaire was 0.968， indicating that the reliability of the questionnaire was good. The construct validity of the questionnaire was tested， and the KMO value was 0.937， and the significance level of chi-square value of Bartlett sphericity test was P=0.000<0.001， so this questionnaire was suitable for exploratory factor analysis. The principal component analysis method was used to extract the common factors， and the maximum variance method was used to rotate the factors. Finally， four common factors were extracted，and the cumulative variance contribution rate was 78.58%. Confirmatory factor analysis of the questionnaire was performed， the result found 区/df=1.416， p<0.001， GFI=0.968， AGFI=0.922， RMSEA=0.051， showed that the questionnaire structure validity is good.\n\n【20】Data analysis\n\n【21】In this study， the data wereobtainedbydistributing questionnaires， carefully screening questionnaires and eliminating extreme values and outliers. SPSS 26.0 software was used to test the reliability and validity of the data and analyze the differences.\n\n【22】Results\n\n【23】P.E. Teachers inclusive education competency\n\n【24】In order to investigate the scores of each dimension of the inclusive education competency of the subjects， Table 2 showed the mean and standard deviation of the scores of each dimension.Among them， the score of professional attitude dimension of P.E. teachers was significantly higher than that of professional knowledge (t=8.639， p<0.001)， professional skills (t=4.903， p<0.001) and capacity of acquiring supports (t=6.296，p<0.001)， and the score of professional knowledge dimension was significantly lower than that ofprofessional skills (t= -5.664， p<0.001). and the capacity of acquiring supports (t=-3.873， p<0.001). The score of professional skills was higher than that of the capacity of acquiring supports (t=1.980，P<0.05).\n\n【25】Difference analysis of P.E. teachers inclusive education competency\n\n【26】Under different background variables， the differences of inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers were analyzed， and it was found that there were no significant differences in gender， school district and study section， while the statistical test results of four background variables， teaching age， taught special children or not， and the cumulative duration of training related to inclusive education，\n\n【27】Table 1： Demographic information of the participants (N=286).\n\n| Teacher's information  | h  | 100%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender  |  |  |\n| Male  | 228  | 79.7  |\n| Female  | 58  | 20.3  |\n| The school district  |  |  |\n| City  | 204  | 71.3  |\n| Town  | 58  | 20.3  |\n| Village  | 24  | 8.4  |\n| Education background  |  |  |\n| Master degree or above  | 40  | 14  |\n| Undergraduate  | 242  | 84.6  |\n| Junior College and below  | 4  | 1.4  |\n| Teaching age  |  |  |\n| Novice (0~5 years)  | 142  | 49.7  |\n| Skilled (6-15 years)  | 80  | 28  |\n| Expert (over 16 years)  | 64  | 22.4  |\n| Study section  |  |  |\n| Primary school  | 82  | 28.7  |\n| Junior high school  | 90  | 31.5  |\n| High school  | 114  | 39.9  |\n\n【29】Table 2： The general situation of inclusive education accomplishment of P.E. teachers in primary and secondary schools.\n\n| Dimensions  | M±SD  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Protessional attitude  | 4.08±0.79  |  |\n| Protessional knowledge  | 3.41±0.97  |  |\n| Professional skills  | 3.73±0.89  |  |\n| Capacity of acquiring supports  | 3.64±0.90  |  |\n| Inclusive education competency  | 3.76±0.74  |  |\n\n【31】reached the significant level. Furthermore， one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the length of training related to inclusive education， and independent sample t-test was conducted on whether the children with special needs had been taught up .\n\nWe found on the teaching age background variables， novice and expert P.E. teachers in professional knowledge dimension and the capacity of acquiring supports dimension of dab at significantly higher scores of P.E. teachers， in general， the novice and expert P.E. teachers' education quality is significantly higher than for a master type fusion of P.E. teachers’ education quality. In terms of the background variable of whether brought special children or not， P.E. teachers who have brought special children have significantly higher scores in all dimensions of inclusive education competency than those who have not brought special children. P.E. teachers who have brought special children have higher inclusive education competency. In terms of the background variables of cumulative duration of inclusive education-related training， the scores of P.E. teachers who have received inclusive education-related training in the three dimensions of professional knowledge， professional skills and capacity of acquiring supports were significantly higher than those who have not received inclusive education-related training. However， the length of time receiving inclusive education-related training had|删除段之间换行|no significant effect on the inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers. In general， the inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers who had received inclusive education-related training was higher than that of P.E. teachers who had not received inclusive education-related training.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】P.E. Teachers’ inclusive education competency\n\n【35】The study found the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers in Chinese primary and middle schools needed to be further improved. Among the four dimensions， professional attitude scored the highest， followed by professional skills， capacity of acquiring supports， and professional knowledge scored the lowest.\n\n【36】In the professional attitude dimension， most P.E. teachers held a positive attitude towards inclusive physical education. They generaly believed that special students should receive physical education on an equal basis with ordinary students. They also believed that special students and ordinary students attending classes together was conducive to the social development of special children and the alleviation of social discrimination against special groups， which could also have a certain positive impact on the physical and mental development of ordinary students.\n\n【37】In the professional knowledge dimension， most P.E. teachers believed that their theoretical knowledge of inclusive education was not enough. On the one hand， they did not know much about the relevant policies， laws and regulations of inclusive education， on the other hand， they did not master the specific teaching methods of inclusive physical education and did not have the knowledge of how to analyze and adjust the psychology of special children. The reason for this problem was that most physical education teachers usually graduated from the major of physical education， while students majoring in physical education in China had not received the study of inclusive physical education related knowledge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In addition， 72percent of teachers had no post-service training related to inclusive education. Therefore， there was a lack of inclusive education and other relevant training in both pre-service training and post-service training systems， which hindered the accumulation of teachers professional knowledge and further affected the improvement of teachers'inclusive education quality.\n\n【38】In the professional skills dimension， the score of professional skills was significantly lower than the score of professional attitudes， but higher than the score of professional knowledge and capacity of acquiring supports. Some P.E. teachers believed that they lacked the ability to adjust the teaching objectives and teaching strategies according to special students in P.E. teaching， and they had low self-efficacy in implementing group cooperative learning and effective management for special students. The lack of training related to inclusive education would have a negative impact on theaccumulation of professional knowledge， as well as the promotion of professional skills. However， the score of the dimension of professional skills was higher than that of the dimension of professional knowledge and capacity of acquiring supports. The reason was that， on the one hand， professional skills could accumulate practical experience in physical education and improve by imitating other teachers or professional teachers. On the other hand， most physical education teachers had not participated in the inclusive physical education teaching or the training of relevant professional knowledge and skills， which led to their lack of understanding of the actual classroom teaching situation，\n\n【39】Table 3： Summary of descriptive statistics of different teaching years， special children and training duration in each dimension.

On the one hand， the lack of professional knowledge of physical education teachers could affect their capacity of acquiring supports. Lack of understanding of relevant policies， laws and regulations could affect teachers'understanding of the channels through which they can obtain relevant support. On the other hand， due to the traditional examination evaluation system for pursuing higher education， physical education teachers paid more attention to the physical education examination of all students， but ignored the children with special needs， which limited the initiative ofteachers to\n\n【46】Influencing factors of P.E. Teachers' inclusive education competency\n\nDifference of inclusive education competency of P.E. Teachers with different teachingage： First， we analyzed the inclusiveeducation competency of P.E. teachers with different teaching age. It was found that different teachingages werethe main factors affecting the inclusive education quality of primary and secondary school teachers. On the whole， the inclusive education competencyof novice P.E. teachers was significantly higher than that of skilled P.E. teachers， and the inclusive education competency of expert P.E. teachers was significantly higher than that of skilled P.E. teachers. Generally speaking， the longer they had been teaching， the longer they had received training related to inclusive education， and the more likely they were to improve their|删除段之间换行|inclusive education competency. Therefore， the longer they had been teaching， the higher their integrated education competency was. However， the data of this study showed that the longer the teaching time， the higher the inclusive education competency was not necessarily. The score of inclusive education competency of skilled teachers was the lowest， while the score of novice teachers (0 to 5 years of teaching) and expert teachers (more than 16 years of teaching) had no significant difference. Relevant studies had found that skilled teachers (who have been teaching for 6 to 15 years) were in the most serious stage of job burnout 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Teachers in this stage had negative emotions towards work and low sense of self-efficacy， resulting in the lowest inclusive education competency. Novice teachers were relatively rich and skilled in theoretical knowledge and skills， and had a high sense of self-efficacy. Moreover， they might not have been exposed to inclusive education-related work， leading to high scores. Constrained by their original thoughts and limited training， expert teachers held a negative attitude towards such a form of education and were unwilling to adjust their teaching strategies to promote the development of inclusive physical education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， resulting in a low score of their inclusive education competency.\n\n【48】In terms of experience of teaching children with disables， we found that “taught special children or not\"had a significant impact on the inclusive education competency of P.E. teachers. The scores of physical education teachers who had taught special children in all dimensions of inclusive education competency were significantly higher than those who had not taught special children. Through interviews of physical education teachers who had taught special children， it was found that physical education teachers who had taught special children had certain teaching experience， had certain understanding of the characteristics of physical and psychological development of special children， and could adjust teaching strategies and teaching methods so that all students could adapt to physical education， so as to show high inclusive education competency. Relevant studies also showed that teachers' experience in inclusive education was an important factor affecting teachers' attitude toward inclusive education， and experienced teachers had more positive attitudes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The quality of education experience had a significant impact on teachers'attitudes towards inclusive education. Teachers with successful inclusive education experience had a more positive attitude than teachers without successful inclusive education experience 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Continuous contact with special children could also improve teachers’ professional knowledge and skills related to inclusive education， to a certain extent， so as to improve their inclusive education competency.\n\nInfluence of training on inclusive education competency for P.E. Teachers： It was found that whether they had received training related to inclusive education had a predictive effect on the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers， and the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers who had received relevant training was significantly higher than that of physical education teachers who had not received relevant training. Generally speaking， the longer the relevant training time， the higher the inclusive education competency of teachers would be. However， the results ofthis study showed that there was no significant difference in the inclusive education competency of teachers who received training within one month and more than one month， which was consistent with the research results of Wang 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Through interviews with teachers who have participated in relevant training， this study found that the reasons for this situation could lie in the following|删除段之间换行|two points. First， the training content was too shallow. The training related to inclusive education mostly stayed on the concept， without real and systematic teaching. Second， teachers lacked practical exercise. The training content was completely lecture-style without practical training， which hindered the improvement of inclusive education competency.\n\n【50】Practical Im plications\n\n【51】Firstly， enhance support for P.E. teachers implement inclusive education. Relevant studies showed that external adequate support could improve teachers' attitude towards inclusive education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， and thus improve their inclusive education competency. Therefore， this study suggested that physical education teachers should be equipped with sufficient external support to carry out inclusive physical education， so as to promote the improvement of inclusive education competency of physical education teachers. First， improve the construction of resource classrooms to ensure that every school had at least one resource classroom. Resource classroom was the most important part of inclusive education. The resource classroom was also equipped with special resource teachers who had rich experience in special education. Under such a condition， improving the construction of resource classrooms could not only provide individualized education for students with special needs， but also promote the mastery of knowledge and skills of ordinary physical education teachers and improve their inclusive education competency.Second，bring in a variety of sports equipment. Various kinds of equipment could be customized to meet the needs of different special children， to promote the steady progress of the teaching plan.\n\n【52】Secondly， increase the pre-service and post-service training on inclusive education for P.E. teachers. It was found in the survey that teachers who had received training related to inclusive education had significantly higher inclusive education competency than those who had not received training， and inclusive education courses for pre-service physical education teachers could improve their self-efficacy when teaching special children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Therefore， carrying out training related to inclusive education was the key to improve the inclusive education competency of physical education teachers， mainly in the following two points. First， improve the pre-service training. Relevant content such as inclusive education and special education should be embedded into the compulsory curriculum system of physical education major. Relevant teaching content could be learned from western countries to improve the pre-service training system. Second， improve post-job training. Experts and scholars related to inclusive education and special education were invited to compile training programs. In terms of content， due to the strong practical characteristics of physical education， it was necessary not only to have reasonable teaching content with increasing difficulty， but also to have practical operation content， so that physical education teachers could fully explore and understand relevant theories in practice， but also to ensure frequent training and promote the specialization of post-service training.\n\n【53】Thirdly， incorporate the inclusive education competency into teacher assessment of P.E. Teachers. As a baton， evaluation could effectively intervene teachers’actions， and the school’s reward mechanism was an important factor affecting teachers' enthusiasm通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>. Therefore， this study suggested that inclusive education competency should be included in teacher assessment to enhance the external motivation of physical education teachers to improve inclusive education competency.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In addition， a higher level of multiple micronutrient deficiency and exposure to heavy metals through environment priming the health issue. The etiology of anemia is multi-factorial， among physiological iron deficiency and hemopoietic toxicity caused by Lead (Pb) are considered as important. Current study aimed to unveil serum essential element (Fe， Zn， Cu， Mg and Ca)， blood Pb and Cd levels among anemic (Group-A； n=77) and non-anemic children (Group-B， n=77). Blood Pb， Cd and serum elements were quantified by Graphite Furnace and Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy， respectively. Hemoglobin， reticulocyte count and 8-Aminolevulenic Acid Dehydratase (8-ALAD) activity were also assessed. Mean Hb， serum Fe and 8-ALAD activity was significantly (p<0.01) lower in Group-A compared to Group-B. Blood Cd levels were non-detectable， whereas mean Pb levels were higher among Group-A compared to Group-B but in prescribed safe limits (<10ug/dL). Group-A children's serum Fe levels correlated positively with ALADactivity(p<0.05)，serum Zn and Ca levels (p<0.01)； whereas a significant (p<0.01) inverse correlation was noted between Hb levels and serum Zn levels.Elevation of 8-ALAD activity is presumed under IDA to meet the physiological requirement of Hb， but in the current study despite severe anemia in Group-A no such observation was noted. In conclusion， anemia among Group-A children may be iron deficient rather induced by hematopoietic toxicity. Further， Zn deficiency is more prevalent in children of both the groups， which need intervention strategies. Dual deficiency effect of Fe and Zn on physiological levels and function of 8-ALAD activity needs to be elucidated.\n\n【2】Keywords： Iron deficiency anemia； Blood Pb levels； 6-ALAD； Seru essential elements\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells is insufficient to meet the body's physiologic needs. It is a widespread public health problem associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality， especially in pregnant women and young children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The etiology for anemia is a multi-factorial classified as nutritional such as vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well as non-nutritional such as infection and hemoglobinopathies. It is well documented that nutritional anemia is the most prevalent condition compared to non-nutritional anemia； further about 50% of the anemia is due to iron deficiency， and the remainder due to other causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The prevalence of anemia is particularly high in developing countries， where 39% of children under five years old， 48%of 5 to 14 year old children， 42% of all women and 52% of pregnant women are anemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The diagnostic procedures to determine anemia involves a number of tests such as physical examination of conjunctiva， tongue and laboratory tests such as estimation of hemoglobin， reticulocyte count， complete blood picture， peripheral smear for shape and size of RBCs， serum iron and ferritin levels. A set of any of these tests may give an indication of type of anemia. A normal Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) associated with an increased reticulocyte count suggest rapid RBC loss， as in hemolysis or acute blood volume loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Multiple micronutrient deficiencies often coexist in populations in developing countries. A deficiency of one micronutrient may influence the absorption， metabolism and/or excretion of another micronutrient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Moreover， excess zinc ingestion is a cause of copper deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\nOn the other hand， the heavy metals such as Lead (Pb)， Cadmium (Cd)， Mercury (Hg) and|删除段之间换行|Arsenic (As) are known as potential environmental contaminants and pose public health problem. Further， due to vast industrial applications of Pb， lack of enforcement strategies coupled with awareness， the population of developing countries are more prone to exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The recent studies suggested a higher prevalence of blood lead levels(BLL) among the children residing in the industrial area compared to urban； whereas the children from rural background had no exposure to Pb. Similarly the accumulation of Cd has raised concern recently due to its vast industrial and agricultural practices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It was proposed that Pb and Cd are similar to trace element， and may enter in to blood stream through “Divalent Metal Ion Transporter-1'(DMT-1). The recent studies suggest that iron deficiency further increases absorption per se of Pb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Exposure to Pb affects many organs， primarily hemopoietic， renal and central nervous systems， especially in growing children and pregnant women. The recent reports suggest that subclinical Pb toxicity affects the heme synthesis by inhibiting the 6-Aminolevulenic Acid Dehydratase activity (6-ALAD)， which is one of the key enzymes in heme synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. It is well established fact that inhibited 8-ALAD activity' has been considered as a hallmark of“Pb toxicity， whereas in iron deficiency this enzyme levels were also altered. Our studies on induction of iron deficiencyin laboratory animals through dietary restriction have shown the elevated levels of 8-ALAD activity to meet the physiological levels of hemoglobin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【7】In view of the given background， current study aimed to determine the serum essential element levels (Fe，Zn， Cu， Mg & Ca)， blood Pb and Cd levels as well as their interactions， if any， in anemic children undergoing blood transfusion.\n\n【8】Methods Study design and selection of subjects\n\n【9】A cross sectional case-control study was conducted among children from ‘Pediatric division of Niloufer Hospital， Hyderabad， India. The National Family Health Survey-4， India (NFHS-4： 2015-16) reported prevalence of moderate and severe anemia were 30%and 2% respectively among children. Therefore， considering total prevalence as 32%， an odds ratio 2.6 and power 90， a sample size of154 was arrived.\n\n【10】Anemic children (Group-A； n=77) admitted in the pediatric in-patient ward of Niloufer Hospital for ‘Blood Transfusion’ were enrolled as study subjects. The children with moderate (Hb： 8.00%g to 9.99% g) to severe (Hb<8.00% g) anemia was included in the study (WHO Criteria). Children aged between 1.6 to 11.0 years， with no history of previous blood transfusion were included in the study. Similarly age and sex matched non-anemic’ children (Group-B； n=77) admitted in the same in-patient ward suffering from ‘other than anemia'were selected as control subjects. The children who have the history of blood transfusion， evidence of hemolysis/blood loss， hemotological malignancy and chronic diseases were excluded from the study.\n\n【11】The information on age， height， weight， clinical signs and symptoms’ forr anemia， heavy metal toxicity andd nutritional deficiencies were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. In addition the information on dietary habits and cooking practices was alsocollected from the attendants of subjects. The studyandprocedures were approved by Institutional Review Board (Institutional Ethics Committee for Human Studies) of the ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition， Hyderabad， India. As per the recommendations of IRB， written consent was obtained from the participants or their parents.\n\n【12】Sample collection\n\n【13】Approximately 3.0 mL of blood was collected by venipuncture from all the children. Two aliquots of blood samples were prepared using vacutainer tubes， one for whole blood and other aliquot was used for serum. The blood samples from Group-A children were collected before the blood transfusion. Peripheral blood smear was prepared for examination of abnormalities in RBC， WBC and platelets. Reticount was performed to determine the percentage of reticulocytes.\n\n【14】Laboratory Analysis\n\n【15】Estimation of serum albumin and hemoglobin levels\n\n【16】Serum albumin levels were estimated as described by Doumas &Biggs. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， based on increase in absorbance of Bromocresol Green(BCG) at 630 nm. Binding of the dye to serum albumin at pH 4.2 is directly proportional to the concentration of albumin estimated using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as standard. The Hemoglobin (Hb%) levels were determined by cyanmethemoglobin method， briefly， 20uL of blood was mixed with 5.0 mL of‘Drabkins reagent'(Potassium Ferric Cyanide Solution) and allowed to stand for 5 min to develop color. The color intensity was measured at 540 nm against known standard using Spectrophotometer (UNICAM-UV 300， Thermo， Cambridge，UK). Levels of Hb in each samples were then calculated based on \\[A540unk X Conc. of Hb Std. (g/dL)\\]/A540std.\n\n【17】Preparation of sample for metal/elemental estimations\n\n【18】To estimate the blood Pb， Cd levels and serum elemental levels， samples were subjected to closed microwave digestion”as explained by Reddy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Briefly， 1.0 mL of blood and 0.5 mL of serum were digested with 2.0 mL of ultrapure nitric acid (Merck， Mumbai， India) in a closed microwave (MARSXpress， CEM Corp.， Matthews， USA) digestion system. The certified reference standard samples for Pb， Cd and serum essential elements were also processed along with the samples， as quality controls\n\n【19】Estimation of blood Pb， Cd and serum elementallevels\n\n【20】ThebloodPband Cdlevels were determined in microwave digested samples against standard plot obtained from Pb and Cd standards on Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (GF-AAS， Thermoelectron， USA). Certified blood Pb and Cd standards were used to ensure quality of estimates. Serum essential elements such as Fe，Zn， Cu，Mg and Ca levels were measured using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (Varian 220， Pala Alto， CA， USA) in the closed microwave digested serum samples. Certified serum standards with two levels of essential elements were also analyzed simultaneously on the instrument to ensure quality ofestimates.\n\n【21】6-ALAD activ ity\n\n【22】Blood 6-Aminolevulenic Acid Dehydratase (8-ALAD) activity was determined as explained by Granick et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， method. In brief， aliquots of 50 uL heparinized whole blood were added to Saponin buffer with and without aminolevulenic acid' as substrate and each was incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After termination of the reaction by addition of 50 uL trichloroacetic acid-HgCl2 solution， the samples were centrifuged (1000 × g， 5 min， 25°C). The resulting supernatant was isolated and combined with an equal volume of freshly-prepared modified Ehrlich reagent. After 10 min at 25°C， the absorbance of the mixture was determined at 553 nm using the UV300 spectrophotometer. ALAD activity (as nM/hr/mL blood) in each sample was calculated as=(OD553×1378).\n\n【23】Prevalence of deficiency/toxicity and interactions\n\n【24】The WHO criteria followed for categorization of anemia in to moderate (Hb： 8.00% g to 9.99% g) to severe (Hb： <8% g). The prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies was computed considering the cut-off values of serum Fe (<70 ug/dL)， Zn (<70 ug/dL)， Cu (<80hg/dL)，Mg (<1.8 mg/dL) and Ca (<8.0 mg/dL). The safe cut offlimits for blood Pb and Cd levels were considered as <10.0 ug/dL and <0.12ug/dL in children (CDC， Atlanta). The interactions/associations between essential elements and Pb， ALAD activity was assessed using statistical method of \"Pearson’s correlation co-efficiency.\n\n【25】Statistical analysis\n\n【26】Mean and Standard Deviation (SD) were calculated for all the variables. The student t-test was applied to assess the statistical difference in mean levels of various parameters between two groups. Relationships were identified by means of Pearson’s bivariate moment correlation coefficient. The results were considered significant at p<0.05. The data were analyzed using SPSS 15.0 Window’s version.\n\n【27】Results\n\n【28】Anthropometry\n\n【29】The information on anthropometry， dietary habits of Group-A and Group-B children were given in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. The mean age of children from both the groups was comparable. Whereas mean height (p<0.05) and weight (p<0.01) of Group-A children was significantly low as compared to Group-B. However， mean Body Mass Index (BMI) was comparable between groups. The albumin levels were ranged from1.18 g/dL to 4.69 g/dL in Group-A， whereas 1.65 g/dL to 4.54 g/dL in Group-B children . Mean serum albumin levels in children from Group-A and Group-B were 3.1 ± 0.73 g/dL and 3.5±0.47 g/dL，respectively.\n\n【30】Clinical profile\n\n【31】The information on signs and symptoms ofanemia， metal toxicity and nutritional deficiency'were given in Table删除4:<u> 2</u>. Pale conjunctiva(99%) and fever (61%) was observed among the majority of children from Group-A， whereas no pale conjunctiva was reported in control Group-B. Bald tongue and anorexia was alsohigh among the Group-A children compared to Group-B . The signs and symptoms for nutritional deficiencies such as Bitot spot， keratomalacia etc. was not observed except conjunctival xerosis in 3% of Group-A children.\n\n【32】The mean serum albumin levels were significantly (p<0.01) low among Group-A children compared to Group-B . Hemoglobin levels were ranged from 5.6 g/dL to 9.9 g/dL and 12.0g/dL to 15.4 g/dL in Group-A and Group-B children， respectively. The mean Hb levels were significantly (p<0.01) low in Group-A compared to Group-B .

Serum Fe levels ranged from 10.5 ug/dL to241.0 ug/dL and 16.0 ug/dL to 269.0 ug/dL in Group-A and Group-B children， respectively. The mean serum Fe levels were significantly(p<0.01) low among the children from Group-A as compared to Group-B . Serum Zn levels ranged from 28.0 ug/dL to245.0 ug/dL in Group-A， whereas Group-B children had 32.0 ug/dL to 156.0 ug/dL. Mean serum Zn levels were comparable between the groups. Group-A children serum Cu levels were ranged from 36.5 ug/dL to 195.0 ug/dL， whereas Group-B children serum Cu levels were|删除段之间换行|24.0 ug/dL to 195.0ug/dL.\n\n【45】Mean serum Cu levels was significantly (p<0.05) higher in Group-A children than Group-B . Serum Mg levels were ranged from 1.57 mg/dL to 4.13 mg/dL and 1.19 mg/dL to 3.31 mg/dL in Group-A and Group-B children， respectively. Serum mean Mg levels were significantly (p<0.01) higher in Group-A children compared to their counterparts . Group-A children serum Ca levels ranged from 4.8 mg/dL to 15.3 mg/dL， whereas in Group-B it ranged from 9.6 mg/dL to 14.2 mg/dL. A significant (p<0.01) low levels of serum Ca was noted in Group-A children compared to their counterpart children .\n\n【46】Blood Pb， Cd levels and ALAD activ ity\n\n【47】Blood cadmium levels were below the detection limits (0.1 ppb) in children of both the groups. While， the Blood Lead Levels (BLL) varied widely among Group-A children. The BLLs were ranging from0.15 ug/dL to 39.81 ug/dL in Group-A， whereas in Group-B children were 0.18 ug/dL to 8.14 ug/dL . The mean BLL were 4.9±7.45 ug/dL and 2.4±2.12 ug/dL in Group-A and Group-B children， respectively. Though the mean BLL of Group-A children were significantly (p<0.05) higher than Group-B， they were within the cut-off limits specified (<10 ug/dL) by CDC， Atlanta. The ALAD activity of the Group-A and Group-B children were ranged from 52.0 nM/mL to 841.0 nM/mL and 267 nM/mL to 909nM/mL erythrocytes/hr， respectively. The mean ALAD activity of Group-A children (437.8±215.93 nM/mL erythrocytes/h) was significantly (p<0.01) lower than counterparts (583.0±142.07nM/mL erythrocytes/h).\n\n【48】Prevalence of deficiency and toxicity\n\n【49】Among Group-A children， moderate anemia was noted in 55%children， whereas， severe anemia in 45% suggesting the need to undergo the blood transfusion. Serum Fe levels were deficient in 42%of Group-A and 5% of Group-B children. However， 47% of children from Group-A and 39% ofGroup-B children had serum Zn deficiency. About 12% of the children from both the categories were deficient for serum Cu levels. The serum Mg levels were deficient in 4% and 18%of the children from Group-A and Group-B， respectively. Whereas， serum Ca levels were deficient in 7% of children from Group-A， but no such deficiency was observed in their counterpart children.\n\n【50】Ten percent of Group-A children had BLL above 10 pg/dL， the safe cut-off limits set by Centre for Disease Control and Prevention， Atlanta， USA. In addition， 7% of Group-A children had elevated (>20ug/dL) blood Pb levels. In contrast， the BLL among the Group-B children were within the acceptable limit (<10 ug/dL) of CDC， Atlanta. However， 25% of Group-A and 16% of Group-B children had BLL above 5 ug/dL.\n\n【51】Correlations among Pb， Hb and ALAD Activity with serum elements\n\n【52】The correlations among the blood Pb levels， Hb， ALAD activity with serum elemental levels was given in Table删除4:<u> 4</u>. Blood Pb levels didn't correlated either with Hb levels， ALAD activity and serum elementallevels except with serum Caand albumin levels in Group-A. However， Group-A children's serum Fe levels correlated positively with ALAD activity (p<0.05)， serum Zn and Ca levels (p<0.01). Whereas， a significant (p<0.01) inverse correlations was noted between Hb levels and serum Zn levels among Group-A children .\n\n【53】Blood Pb levels of Group-B children correlate inversely with serum Zn (p<0.01)andMg(p<0.05)levels . Nonetheless， the ALAD activity was correlated positively with serum Zn (p<0.01) and Mg (p<0.05) levels in Group-B children. Whereas， neither Hb nor serum Fe levels have shown correlations with either BLL or serum elemental levels among Group-B children.\n\n【54】Discussion\n\n【55】Iron Deficient Anemia (IDA) is still a devastating public health issue in the third world countries like India. It is well established that the etiology for anemia is a multi-factorial and classified as nutritional deficiencies such as vitamin and minerals， as well as non-nutritional such as infection and hemoglobinopathies. It is noteworthy to mention that the predominant cause of anemia is due to iron deficiency， which could be attributed to inadequate dietary intake or consumption of foods with low amounts of bio-available Fe along with presence of inhibitors such as phytic acid and low intake of animal foods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，12\\]</u>.\n\n【56】Physicians relies on pale conjunctiva and bald tongue’ as characteristic ‘sign and symptom’of anemia. In the current study， Group-A children were moderate to severe anemic and were undergoing for blood transfusion. Majority of children from Group-A had characteristic feature of pale conjunctiva (>98%) and bald tongue. In addition， significantly lower levels of Hb， serum Fe and albumin levels among the anemic children suggests the magnitude of Iron Deficiency Anemia’ among Group-A children. As per the WHO criteria of anemia categorization， severe anemia was noted among 45% of children and moderated anemia was55% in the anemic children.

This was further corroborated with a 2 fold increase in reticulocyte count (above 1.0%) and ‘microcytic hypochromic condition'among anemic children compared to non-anemic children suggest a rapid turnover of the reticulocytes.

In the current study， the serum Fe levels were deficient in the anemic children； in addition to this， they were deficient for other essential elements such as serum Zn， Cu， Mg and Ca levels.

In the current study though the mean BLLs of anemic children were higher compared to non-anemic children， but within specified limits (<10 ug/dL) of CDC， Atlanta. So the anemia among Group-A children could be due to nutritional deficiency. Further， higher mean of BLL in anemic children compared to controls could be due to increased absorption per se of Pb under essential elemental deficiency， which could be mediated through Divalent Metal ion Transporter-1(DMT-1) at the mucosal surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，8\\]</u>.

In the current study anemic children had hypoalbuminism， which could be malnutrition/altered nutrition or low protein intake by the children. In addition， significant positive correlations were|删除段之间换行|noted between serum albumin levels with serum Cu， Mg， Ca and Pb.

The positive association between albumin and Pb could be to attributed to presence of -thiol’group containing amino acids in albumin， which has higher affinitytowards Pb， and deficiency of essential elementals might have increased the Pb absorption per se 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，14\\]</u>. In addition， significant inverse relationship between Zn & Hb and positive association of Fe with ALAD and Zn suggests the importance of co-factors’ for heme synthesis. Similarly， complex interactions were noted between different essential elements in both anemic and non-anemic children infers the interdependency of various elements to perform physiological function. Lack of data on serum ferritin/transferrin levels and MCV are the limitations of current study， whereas the strengths are quantification of various essential elements and heavy metals and assessing their interactions.\n\n【65】Conclusion\n\n【66】The results of present study conclude that anemia among the Group-A children may be iron deficient rather heavy metal induced hematopoietic toxicity. Further， Zn deficiency is more prevalent in children of both the groups， which need intervention strategies.

Systemic manifestations are rare. We present the case of a middle-aged man with polyarthralgia and constitutional syndrome under study. He underwent diagnostic imaging tests that helped establish the differential diagnosis as SAPHO syndrome without skin involvement. To ourknowledge， this is the first reported case ofSAPHO syndrome that debuted as a constitutional condition， and this syndrome should be considered in the diagnostic spectrum.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】SAPHO syndrome (Synovitis， Acne， Pustulosis， Hyperostosis and Osteitis) is an autoimmune-autoinflammatory disorder. It is linked to genetic determinants associated with Human Leukocyte Antigens (especially HLA-A26，HLA-B27，HLA-B39， HLA-B61)，infections (e.g.，Propionibacterium acnes， Staphylococcus aureus， Haemophilus parainfluenzae， Actinomyces)， and immunological factors (e.g.， increased Th17 cells in the peripheral blood， undetectable plasma IL-10 levels) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Epidemiologically， the annual prevalence of SAPHO syndrome ranges from 0.00144 per 100，000people (in Japan) to nearly 10 in 100，000 (in people of European descent) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It generally affects people in middle age and is more frequent in women. Despite its low prevalence， the syndrome can be masked by other diseases， such as invasive neoplasms， so it is important to be familiar with it and know which diagnostic tests are the most appropriate to identify it. Among the available tests， we focus on PET-CT due to its usefulness in supporting and establishing the differential diagnosis(ruling out seronegative spondyloarthropathies， psoriatic arthritis， anterior chest wall syndrome， and neoplasms)， since SAPHO syndrome can be considered a diagnosis of exclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-10\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We present the case of a 51-year-old man with an unremarkable pathological history who presented with a constitutional syndrome， following three weeks of joint pain and bouts of fever of up to 39·C. Physical examination revealed pain at the level of the bilateral sternoclavicular junction and in both tibiotalar joints， as well as weakness in the shoulder and pelvic girdle. The patient had no skin changes or other accompanying symptoms.\n\n【7】Blood tests showed leukocytosis (14，700 cells/pL)， neutrophilia (76% neutrophils)， C-reactive protein of 14.63 mg/dL，and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm in the first hour. Muscle enzymes (CPK，LDH， aldolase，GOT，GPT) and tumor markers were normal. ANA (<1/80)，ASMA(<1/80)， and anti-LKM(<1/80) titers were negative， as was anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (<1\n\n【8】IU/mL).\n\n【9】Theultrasound showed increasedspace inthe right subacromiodeltoid bursa and at the level of the tibiotalar joint， an increase in the bilateral Doppler flow and diffuse thickening of both Achilles tendons. There was a dramatic increase in the Doppler flow in both metacarpophalangeal joints and an increase in the adjacent soft tissues. The cervical-thoracic-abdominal CT showed bilateral thickening of the sternoclavicular joints ， with increased uptake in the PET images  along with signs of arthropathy in the dorsal column and two instances of spinous apophysitis.\n\n【10】On suspicion of SAPHO syndrome， a bone scintigraphy was requested， confirming increased uptake in the sternoclavicular joints， predominantly the right one .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】We present a clinical case of an adult male with polyarthralgia and constitutional symptoms， fever， increased acute phase reactants， and imaging tests that helped guide the clinical judgment and establish the differential diagnosis. SAPHO syndrome is an entity that affects middle-aged adults and presents as frequent osteoarticular pain. In most cases， there is true axial and peripheral arthritis (which most frequently affects the sternoclavicular joints)， sternoclavicular and spinal hyperostosis， and recurrent foci of osteitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4，7，8\\]</u>. The syndrome may be accompanied by skin lesions such as acne， palmoplantar pustulosis， and hidradenitis suppurativa. In fact， skin involvement usually precedes the onset of joint symptoms， although it can occur at any time during the disease. The epidemiology of this entity is difficult to define given its low prevalence (approximately1/10，000 people， with a certain predominance of middle-aged women)， and it frequently goes undetected or has a delayed diagnosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，10\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Diagnostic imaging techniques help to establish a differential diagnosis. CT can show the presence ofhyperostosis， bone hyperplasia at the insertion points of the costoclavicular ligament， foci of osteitis， and other chest wall abnormalities at an early stage of the disease通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-14\\]</u>. Whole-body bone scintigraphy can show the classic “bull's head sign\"in approximately a third of patients (reflecting the elevated uptake at the level of the sternal angle and sternoclavicular joint)， which helps to confirm the suspected diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，15，16\\]</u>. Bone scintigraphy is especially important for diagnosing atypical or incomplete forms of SAPHO syndrome (for example， in the absence or atypical presentation of skin lesions) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，17\\]</u>. In early stages of the disease， 85% to 95% of cases will present hyper-uptake of the tracer in the anterior part of the thoracic cavity and the characteristic inflammatory involvement of the sternoclavicular and costosternal joints， with true arthritis in 90% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，8-14\\]</u>. The chest X-ray was normal in our patient， as is typical in the initial stages ofthe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\nIn recent years， the use of PET-CT for the differential diagnosis of SAPHO has increased notably. These scans can reveal multiple skeletal lesions in the anterior or spinal chest wall，low-moderate FDG uptake，|删除段之间换行|and the coexistence of osteolysis and osteosclerosis. The convergence of the functional information on 18FDG uptake demonstrates the presence of anatomically located active inflammatory lesions. Diagnostic PET-CT is also useful to determine the stage of SAPHO syndrome. Early-stage disease is characterized by osteolytic bone destruction with increased FDG uptake， whereas the bone lesions are inactive in the late stage， resulting in normal FDG uptake. 18FDG-PET/CT also allows us to differentiate benign lesions from metastatic bone lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18-20\\]</u>. In our case， the FDG uptake shown in the PET-CT was low/moderate， which allows the differential diagnosis with other diseases.\n\n【15】In our case， no skin lesions were observed. The appearance of these lesions is not essential for reaching the diagnosis， as they can appear after arthritis in 30% to 60% of cases， especially if the patient does not start and maintain adequate treatment. Typical skin involvement includes palmoplantar pustulosis， persistent conglobata acne， and hidradenitis suppurativa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Following the initiation of treatment with a descending regimen of prednisone 30 mg and follow-up in outpatient clinics， the patient reported adequate pain control andpresented synchronous resolution of polyarthralgia and constitutional symptoms. Acute phase reactants showed normalization on successive visits， with no appearance of skin lesions to date. The course of the disease is usually chronic and eventually resolves spontaneously.\n\n【17】In patients who present constitutional syndrome associated with polyarthritis， especially with joint involvement in the anterior part of the thorax， and elevated acute phase reactants， SAPHO syndrome must be included in the differential diagnosis， even without skin alterations. Bone scintigraphy， CT， and PET/CT will help establish the definitive clinical judgment. To the best of our knowledge， this is the first case of SAPHO syndrome presenting as a constitutional syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Effects of this condition on perinatal outcomes were inconclusive across a broad range of studies. We reviewed the literature on isolated oligohydramnios with perinatal outcomes. Electronic databases like PubMed，CINAHL， Web of Science，EMBASE，and Medline were searched from inception to 2022 using keywords and MeSH terms for perinatal outcomes and isolated oligohydramnios. Observational studies (Cohort， case-control) and systematic review & meta-analysis studies published in English were included. Whereas， letters of personal communications， case reports， and case series were excluded. Studies with singleton and low-risk pregnancy， cephalic presentation， and oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index ≤5 cm) were included. Exclusion criteria were studies that include pregnancies with fetal malformation， chromosomal anomaly； growth restriction， and interventional drugs. We obtained 557 full texts from electronic databases but only35 articles met the inclusion criteria. The narrative review revealed that an association does not exist between isolated oligohydramnios and low Apgar score， non-reassuring fetal heartbeat pattern， fetal distress， and umbilical artery/vein pH less than 7.1/7.2. However， isolated oligohydramnios is significantly associated with higher rates of labor induction and cesarean sections. Nevertheless， the impact of isolated oligohydramnios on meconium-stained amniotic fluid and neonatal intensive care unit were inconclusive across the finding. Further large-scale follow-up studies are needed to better elucidate the available evidence.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Adequate amniotic fluid volume is a sign of normal placental functioning and it is the most important component of biophysical profile for fetal well-being tests 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Amniotic Fluid Index(AFI) is the preferred method of amniotic fluid measurement. To measure AFI， the uterus is divided into four equal quadrants. AFI is the sum of the deepest pocket from each quadrant. The normal range of AFI is 5 cm to 24 cm. Any value greater than 24 cm is considered as polyhydramnios and a value below 5 cm is oligohydramnios 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Isolated Oligohydramnios (IO) refers to the presence of oligohydramnios without any fetal and maternal underlying conditions. Globally， IO incidence ranges from 0.5% to 5%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Oligohydramnios has been associated with a variety of adverse perinatal outcomes prospective study conducted among 180 pregnant women at 37 to 40 weeks of gestation with IO with an AFI ≤5h percentile associated with low Apgar score and cesarean delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Likewise， study conducted among 3，050 women showed oligohydramnios carries an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcome， even in low-risk pregnancies after 40 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Moreover， study conducted on oligohydramnios at or beyond 34 weeks gestation was showed antepartum oligohydramnios is associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A meta-analysis of studies showed an antepartum or intrapartum amniotic fluid index of less than or equal 5.0 cm is significantly increased risk of cesarean delivery for fetal distress and a low Apgar score at 5 min 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Similarly， studies revealed， perinatal death， non-reassuring fetal status， meconium-stained fluid， need for resuscitation， admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)， and risk of Operative Vaginal Deliveries (OVD)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>.\n\n【5】However， recent studies showed IO is not associated with fetal growth restriction or an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Adverse perinatal outcomes were associated with IO due to the higher rates of obstetrical interventions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Additionally， a five retrospective cohort study isolated oligohydramnios showed at term by itself is not associated with increased obstetrical morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【6】In contemporary obstetrics， termination is a recommended intervention for term pregnancy complicated with oligohydramnios通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The time of intervention for IO complicated pregnancy remained controversial. However， clinicians are managing IO as they do for oligohydramnios at term 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. This approach leads to unnecessary obstetric intervention without a benefit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Besides， some studies suggested that AFI is not a good predictor of perinatal outcome alone in the case of IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Hence， routine intervention for oligohydramnios at term may not be justified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Findings about the effect of IO on obstetric and perinatal outcomes are inconclusive. Updated evidence on the effect of this condition on adverse outcomes will help health care providers to improve clinical interventions. This narrative review was designed to compare perinatal outcomes related to IO in low-risk singleton pregnancies and normal amniotic fluid volume.\n\n【8】Literature Search\n\n【9】Studies for this review were obtained from Pub Med， CINAHL， Web of Science， EMBASE， and Medline databases from inception to 2022 published the English language. The following keywords/MeSH terms were used for searching. Amniotic fluid， pregnancy， amniotic fluid index， perinatal outcome， obstetrics outcome， fetal outcome，neonatal outcome， isolated oligohydramnios， induction of labor， cesarean delivery， operative vaginal delivery， mode of delivery， instrumental delivery， Apgar score， non-reassuring fetal status， meconium stained amniotic fluid， meconium aspiration syndrome， perinatal morbidity， perinatal mortality， admission to neonatal intensive care unit， neonatal resuscitation， umbilical artery PH， and fetal weight. The bulian words (AND/OR) were used to combine the aforementioned keywords. Also， the search strategy has been complemented by checking the reference lists of the retrieved articles for additional articles.\n\n【10】Study Selection\n\n【11】We included observational studies (cohort and case-control) and meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria for this review were articles with a singleton pregnancy， cephalic presentation and define Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) ≤ 5 cm， and outcomes compared with/without a control group (pregnancies with normal amniotic fluid volume). Exclusion criteria were studies that included pregnancies with fetal malformation， chromosomalanomaly or growth restriction and other obstetric complications. In addition， we excluded studies that did not clearly define the timeframe between measurements of the amniotic fluid index. Letters of personal communications， case reports， case series， and non-English language articles were also excluded.\n\n【12】The initial database search returned a total of 557 articles and 8meta-analysis review articles were retained for the narrative review. After the initial electronic database search， 7 additional relevant articles were identified through manual reference and Google searches. Though， this review is synthesized from 35 sources . A summary table is presented with study year， study design， sample size， key points， and limitation for the studies include in the review .\n\n【13】Findings\n\n【14】Isolated oligohydramnios and antepartum feta surveillance\n\nAntepartum fetal surveillance is one of the indicators for fetal well-being in utero. IO was associated with an increased risk of|删除段之间换行|abnormal Doppler indices of the umbilical artery， non-reactive for Cardio Topography (CTG) and a non-stress test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，20\\]</u>. Similarly， a prospective matched case-control study revealed deceleration of fetal heart rate was significantly associated with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Furthermore， a review of meta-analysis indicated， when oligohydramnios cases were followed using fetal electronic monitoring during labor abnormal findings were detected. For this reason， obstetric interventions were high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Isolated oligohydramnios and maternal outcomes\n\n【17】Isolated oligohydramnios and induction of labor： According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)， diagnosis of oligohydramnios after 37 weeks is an indication for labor induction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Two prospective cohort studies aimed to evaluate perinatal outcomes in women with IO， depicted a risk of induction Wassignificantly highfor isolated1oligohydramnios\\[23，24. Correspondingly， a prospective case-control study over a period of 21 months from November 2014 to July 2016 was conducted on50 pregnant women complicated with complicated with IO. The result showed increased rate of induction of labor among women complicated with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Furthermore， a retrospective cohort study (IO=987 & normal AFI=22，280) to analyzed the obstetric and perinatal outcome on IO showed higher labor induction among pregnancies complicated with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Also， IO was associated with significantly higher rates of labor induction as compared to pregnancies of normal amniotic fluid volume for fetal/maternal indications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，26\\]</u>. These findings strengthen by a systemic review and meta-analysis study； in the twelve studies were included with 35，999 women： 2，414(6.7%) with isolated oligohydramnios and 33，585 (93.29%) with normal AFI. Women with isolated oligohydramnios had significantly higher rates of labor induction (OR=7.56， CI： 4.58，12.48)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Retrospective matched case-control study (IO=206， normal AFI=206) showed IO has no significant association with failure to the progress of labor or failed induction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A retrospective case-control study conducted on 138 women with uncomplicated oligohydramnios (IO) at term (AFI ≤ 5 cm) and a low Bishop score(≤ 6) compared with 67 women at 42 weeks’ gestation underwent induction oflabor showed insignificant difference between the group in induction progress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Similarly， Rainford and Manzanares et al. were reported there were no differences between the two groups in progress of induction of labor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，28\\]</u>. In contrast to these findings， one study reported significantly higher rates of failed induction among preterm gestations presented with IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The possible difference might arise from the study included only preterm pregnancy. Moreover， a single study conducted on women with IO required the use of drugs to manage tachysystole/hyperstimulation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Further longitudinal study is needed to accept for the impact. However， study conducted on there was no difference in duration of labor， need for oxytocin， and augmentation between women with IO and normal amniotic fluid index 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，31\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Isolated oligohydramnios and mode of delivery： A meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of obstetric interventions in the IO group (89/657；13.5%) compared with the control group(165/3306；5.0%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Moreover， pregnancies complicated with IO showed a statistically significant association with operative vaginal delivery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. However， a small Randomized Controlled Trial(RCT) showed there were no significant difference in assisted vaginal deliveries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The difference might be due to the small sample size\n\n【21】Table 1： Summary of studies on adverse abstetric and perinatal outcomes.\n\n| Author and year  | Design and sample size  | Key points  | Limitation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fatima Chaudhry etal.2020  | Randomized Control Trial O=72 lO (expectant management)=72  | IO is not associated with a low Apgar score or MSAF.  | Used Chai square test and smallsample size.  |\n| Musthaq et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>  | Prospective cohort O=70 Normal AF=140  | IO didn't show any statically significant difference in perinataloutcome.  | Used Chai square test.  |\n| Nefise Nazli et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>  | Prospective case-controlO=159 Normal AF=165  | Io is not associated with a higher rate of cesarean section.  | Used Chai square test and inclusion ofpost-term pregnancy for comparison.  |\n| Samata Gupta et al.2018  | Retrospective case controlO=51 Normal AF=176  | IO is not an indicator of adverse perinatal outcome.  | Used Chai square test (it showedweak association).  |\n| Neeta Sarma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>  | Prospective case-controlD=100 Normal AF=300  | IO adversely affects the perinatal outcome.

Similarly， a prospective cohort study was carried out in women with isolated oligohydramnios(n=70) and normal pregnancy (n=140))were included.

Nevertheless， statistically significant association was not reported in these studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，21，42\\]</u>. The difference might be inclusion of high-risk pregnancies， showing weak association and inclusion high blood pressure pregnant women in the studies respectively.\n\nAdditionally， a large retrospective cohort study conducted on 987pregnancies complicated by isolated oligohydramnios and to 22，280low-risk pregnancies with normal AFI.

However， after controlling potential confounders like parity and induction of labor the risk of CD in IO was similar to their counterparts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This finding may be supported by a higher rate of CD in IO which might partially attributable to obstetricians’|删除段之间换行|practice choices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>.\n\n【29】A retrospective cohort study exclusively conducted on IO complicated pregnancies showed that rate of CD in early term and late-term pregnancies were high compared to full-term pregnancies.

Although low fifth minute Apgar score is associated with long-term severe neurologic sequels \\[46-481， many studies in the literature showed an absence of association between IO and fifth minute Apgar score删除4:<u> 14，15，17，20，21，23-26，28，32-37，39，41-43，49，50</u>.\n\n【32】Similarly， a prospective case control study conducted on 80women with isolated oligohydramnios and these were compared with 320 with normal AFI. The finding showed there is no difference between the cases and controls as regards of fifth minute Apgar score通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Matched case-control study conducted on IO=120， Normal AFI=116 also revealed the same finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. This evidence supported by with large retrospective cohort (IO=987 Normal AFI=22，280) study conducted by Ashwal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In addition， meta-analysis of four articles which includes 3，943 pregnant women (IO=679(17.2%)， Normal AFI=3264(82.8%)has the same result 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Correspondingly， a large retrospective cohort study conducted on after induction of labor women with normal AFI and induced labor because of IO had no significant effect on the first minute Apgar score less than four 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Additionally， retrospective matched case-control study conducted on women with IO=206， and Normal AFI=206showed no significant difference in first minute Apgar score between the groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Those findings is also supported by a comparative study among women with IO and normal amniotic fluid after 41weeks of pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Similarly， findings from two studies were revealed isolated oligohydramnios is not associated with low first minute Apgar score \\[17，251. Furthermore， a small RCT conducted among actively and expectantly managed women with IO revealed no significant difference on first， fifth-， and tenth-minute Apgar score通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\nOn the contrary， a meta-analysis indicated that IO was associated with low first and fifth minute Apgar scores. However， after they excluded studies with extreme values， IO had evidence of effect only|删除段之间换行|on the first minute Apgar score less than seven 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Similar findings were reported from two meta-analyses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，40\\]</u>. A meta-analysis on IO published by Chauhan et al. showed antepartum and intrapartum oligohydramnios were associated with low fifth minute Apgar score， which might be because of the inclusion of high-risk pregnancies in the analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Isolated oligohydramnios and non-reassuring fetal heartbeat pattern/fetal distress & umbilical artery acidosis Case-control and retrospective cohort studies showed Io had an association with NRFHBP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，23\\]</u>. NRFHBP and the first minute Apgar score have poor sensitivity for fetal status and outcome， cord pH is a direct measure of the fetal oxygenation status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u>. Also， many published works including meta-analyses explicitly showed no relationship between IO and NRFHBP， fetal distress and umbilical artery/vein less than 7.1/7.213-16，21，26，27，32，35，41，42.\n\n【36】Isolated oligohydramnios and meconium-stained amniotic fluid： Meconium-stained amniotic fluid during the intrapartum period is an indicator of fetal distress. Most recent studies suggest that an association exists between IO and MSAF通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，21，23，24，28，29，31，32，39，40，52-54\\]</u>. In contrast， other studies concluded IO had no effect on MSAF通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-16，19，27，34，36，40，42，49，50\\]</u>. However， the association of MSAF and IO was gestational age-dependent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，55\\]</u>. A meta-analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u> showed no difference in the rate of meconium-stained amniotic fluid and IO. However， it increased the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome (RR： 2.83， CI1.41-5.70). Conclusive evidence is needed on the association of MSAF with meconium aspiration syndrome and poor neonatal outcomes， and status of meconium (thick or thin). Moreover， the inclusion of different indicators of fetal compromise along with MSAF is important 56\\].\n\n【37】Isolated oligohydramnios and admission to neonatal intensive care unit： Many prospective/retrospective cohort， case-control and meta-analysis studies showed IO has no significant effect on NICU admissions通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，15，16，19-21，23，24，26，31-33，35，36，54\\]</u>. However， a meta-analysis and some epidemiologic studies revealed IO has a significant effect on admission to NICU 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，27，37，38，40，57\\]</u>. The observed difference might be due to the inclusion of preterm and intrauterine growth restriction neonates in the studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40，54\\]</u>. For conclusive results， a large RCT is important.\n\n【38】Isolated oligohydramnios and neonatal morbidity/mortality：IO has no association with the following outcomes： immediate cry， hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy， need for neonatal resuscitation and phototherapy， transit tachypnea of the newborn， hypoglycemia， sepsis， seizure， hypothermia， meconium aspiration syndrome， jaundice， intubation， and stillbirth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，38\\]</u>. Similarly， IO showed an absence of significant association with composite adverse neonatal outcomes (cesarean/operative vaginal delivery due to NRFHRP， low Apgar score， umbilical artery pH<7.10， neonatal intensive care admission， meconium aspiration syndrome， and intubation or hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Moreover， IO did not show differences in perinatal mortality or morbidity compared to normal amniotic fluid volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，19\\]</u>. However， a study conducted in Nepal evidenced an association between early neonatal death and IO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.\n\nIsolated oligohydramnios and birth weight： Neonatal/fetal weight indicates fetal wellbeing in the uterus. Comparison studies showed there was no difference in birth weight less than 2000/2500gramsbetween门pregnancies complicated bby IOand normal|删除段之间换行|amniotic fluid volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Neonates born to mothers with isolated oligohydramnios had a higher risk of low birth weight compared with normal amniotic fluid volume. However， their weight difference had no clinical significance通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，25，26，29，31-33，35，37，42，49\\]</u>. Furthermore， a similar finding was observed from a meta-analysis study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】Studies show that IO increases the rate of induction. Moreover， a lot of findings depicted woman with IO had a higher rate of cesarean delivery compared to a woman with normal amniotic fluid. More than 20 studies including meta-analyses reported low first， fifth， and tenth-minute agar score has no relation with IO. Similarly， this narrative review revealed that a relationship doesn’t exist between IO and NRFHBP， fetal distress and umbilical artery/vein less than7.1/7.2. Moreover，IO didn'tshow differences in perinatal mortality or morbidity compared to normal amniotic fluid volume. Even though the weight difference had no clinical significance， neonates born from mothers with isolated oligohydramnios had a higher risk of low birth weight compared with their counterparts. Furthermore， the impact of IO on MSAF and neonatal intensive care unit was inconclusive across the results. For decisive evidence large RCT and inclusion of different indicators of fetal compromise along with MSAF is important.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

There is reported significant negative association of semen volume， total sperm count， sperm motility， and morphology with advanced male partner’s age. Therefore， combination of the sperm preparation and assisted reproductive treatment were used for a better chance of pregnancy. This study was aimed to evaluate the in fluence of age on the sperm quality and pregnancy outcome in couple with subfertility undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).\n\n【2】Material and Methods： This retrospective cross-sectional study in vestigating 181 cases of IUI cycles from reproductive clinic of two public universities from January 2019 to December删除4:<u> 2020</u>. They were categorized into study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner’s age less than 40 years old). Sperm parameter reports were extracted from the patients records. Clinical pregnancy was the criteria for the IUI success.\n\n【3】Results： The mean age of male and female partners were similar in both groups. Sperm parameters showed an improvement after density gradient centrifugation sperm preparation with significant results in grade 1 and grade 3 sperm motility. There was no significant different in the clinical pregnancy between the groups.\n\n【4】Conclusion： There is an improvement in sperm parameters after density gradient centrifugation and the male age is not significantly affect the pregnancy outcome following IUI. Further study with larger sample is needed to confirm these findings.\n\n【5】Keywords： Density gradient centrifugation； Insemination； Paternal age； Pregnancy outcome； Semen analysis\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Lately， the topic of male infertility has been popularly discussed. A man who failed to produce high quality sperm in terms of density， motility and morphology is considered as infertile male. There are increase rates of infertility and adverse pregnancy outcomes seen after the age of 40 years old (independent of female partner’s age)， thus the male age factor might have some contribution to this matter， even though the spermatogenesis known to continue in elderly men， in contrast to oogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. From the literature， contribution to conception by male partner is still occur ev after 40 years of sexual maturity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. But， degenerative changes in germinal epithelium occur with aging， causing Leydig cells to reduce in quantity and its function， thus affecting the spermatogenesis process due to decrease testosterone level， in which it starts at 30 years ofage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，3，4\\]</u>. Studies suggest that male partner's age is associated with diminished semen volume， sperm motility and/or sperm morphology. Increasing seminal ROS levels and changes in epididymal and accessory sex gland function may be possible causative factors for the decline in motility with aging. Emergence idea of intrauterine insemination with sperm preparation has shown some improvement in semen parameters but with conflicting data. In this respect， our objective is to established evidence on influence of age on the sperm quality and effect of density gradient centrifugation on pregnancy outcome in infertile couple undergoing Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).\n\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study involving two university hospitals in Malaysia|删除段之间换行|with fertility services. Completed one hundred and eighty-one IUI cycles from January 1， 2019 to December 31， 2020 were included in this study.\n\n【9】Couples who underwent IUI during the study period were enrolled in this study. Only the first IUI cycle of the couples were included in the study.\n\n【10】The inclusion criteria were as follow： Men age between 18 to 70years old， with semen analysis results either normal or one， or two of the sperm parameters were below the normal value established by the WHO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The semen parameters are the sperm count， sperm motility with characterized into Grade 1 (rapid and slow linear progressive motility)， Grade 2 (non-progressive motility) and Grade 3 (immotile spermatozoa). The female partner had regular menstrual cycle， normal pelvic ultrasound findings and at least one fallopian tube patent in hysteroscopy or laparoscopy dye insufflation test.\n\n【11】The exclusion criteria were including men with azoospermia， femalepartnerwith endometriosis，polycystic ovarian syndrome，poor ovarian responder， or premature ovarian insufficiency. Incomplete data on pre- and post-processing semen analysis or missing data regarding the pregnancy outcome were also being excluded.\n\n【12】All the data such as age of the couple， duration of infertility， semen analysis parameters before and after sperm processing， and the IUI results were obtained from the patient’s records. Pregnancy was defined as positive serum beta Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(b-HCG) taken at 14 days after IUI followed by presence of the fetal heart activity after 6 weeks period of a menorrhea.\n\n【13】The eligible couple were stratified into two groups according to the male partner’s age - study group (male partner’s age 40 years and above) and control group (male partner's age less than 40 years old). The semen parameters and pregnancy outcome were compared between the groups.\n\n【14】Semen sample collection and preparation for IUI\n\n【15】Semen samples were collected from the male partners following2 to 5 days of sexual abstinence by masturbation in sterile plastic containers at the clinic. Liquefaction was performed at roor temperature for 30 min. The initial analysis of the semen parameters(semen volume， sperm count， and sperm motility) was performed manually according to WHO guidelines 通用删除7(英):<u>(2010)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\nSubsequently the semen samples were processed using the density gradient centrifugation to remove seminal fluid and enhance sperm quality for IUI. The total volume of semen was divided so that a 15-ml conical tube marked with patient's identification would contain2 ml of a 90% density lower layer， 2 ml of a 45% density upper layer， and 2 ml of semen upper most layer. A gentle and careful move was required to ensure the layers were not mixed-up at each centrifugal stage. The sample was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 20 min at Room Temperature (RT). After centrifugation， the supernatant was removed and the spermatozoa (pellet) was placed into another 15-ml conical tube， which contained 2.0 ml of sperm rinsing medium and mixed thoroughly； it was then centrifuged at 1，500 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was again removed， and the final pellet was suspended in the same medium solution， obtaining a final volume of 0.5 ml. A 10-ul aliquot was used to perform the analysis of post-processing seminal parameters. The motility of spermatozoa in the sample determined and incubated sample at 37°C until ready for insemination. The Makler counting chamber was used to assess|删除段之间换行|the count and motility and the processed sample in the best possible way. The sample was ensured to maintain its temperature at 37°Cby placing it in a test tube warmer before IUI procedure.\n\n【17】Ovulation induction and insemination\n\n【18】Standard protocol was used involving administration of 100 mg clomiphene citrate from the second day of menstruation for five days and injection of human menopausal gonadotropins (75 IU to 150IU) on day five onwards up to day ten of menstruation， either daily or every other day. When at least one follicle achieved more than 17mm， intramuscular HCG 10，000 IU was given for final maturation. Single insemination was done at thirty-six hours later with 0.5 mL to 1.0 mL of processed sperm from the fresh semen sample， injected intrauterine using a Gynetics catheter. After the insemination the patient was lying in the supine position for 15 min to 30 min. Oral dydrogesterone 10 mg three times daily was prescribed for the luteal phase support.\n\n【19】Statistical analysis\n\n【20】The Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows 通用删除1(英):<u>(SPSS version 22.0)</u> was used to record and analyzed the data. Quantitative variables were compared using Mann-Whitney test and the results were expressed as mean ± Standard Deviation (SD) and percentage. Categorical variables were evaluated using the Chi-squareand Fisher's exact test. A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered as statistically significant.\n\n【21】Results\n\n【22】A total of 181 of IUI cycles， from January 15， 2019 and December31，2020， were analyzed. The mean (± Standard Deviation， SD) age of male and female partner included in this analysis were similar for each group. Majority of the indication for the IUI was unexplained infertility .\n\n【23】Table 2 showed the results of sperm parameters of the two studied groups. As can be noted， there was no difference of sperm parameters among the male partner with different age groups. There was an improvement in the sperm concentration and Grade 1 sperm motility after the DGC， however not statistically significant. In the study group (male age 40 years and above)， there is significant increment in the grade 1 sperm motility and significant reduction of immotile sperm after GDC as illustrated in Table删除4:<u> 3</u>. Regarding the successful pregnancy， there was also no significant difference of the semen parameters between the studied group . The number of pregnancies was higher in group of male partner less than 40years old， compared with older age male partner，however， it was not statistically significant .\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】Semen fluid analysis is the first step in the evaluation of male infertility. Semen characteristics that being evaluated includes the volume， sperm concentration， sperm motility， and sperm morphology. The standard value of semen analysis that is accepted by the World Health Organization (WHO) 2010 is the volume of1.5 mL， pH of 7.2， sperm concentration of 20 million/mL or more， total motility (progressive and non-progressive) of 40%， and normal sperm morphology of 4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【26】There was an association between male age and sperm parameters in the literature. Decrease in sperm quantity except for concentration was more compelling among men aged 30 to 50 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

In conjunction， study in Central India by classified age 36 to 42 as under the 3d group in a five-age class (21 to 60 years) that is relates with the decline in semen parameters and it is significant when the individual is after the age of 35通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Meanwhile， Gao et al. revealed a significant association between the increasing age and a drop in sperm quantity and quality based on 7-age groups among men aged25 to 51 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The large dispersion also believed to derive this smaller|删除段之间换行|number of groupings to elucidate age as factors in differentiating the sperm counts. This study showed better sperm motility of the younger male compared to the older male who aged more than 40years old. Therefore， testing the subjects with different age level may validate the influence of age on semen parameters at certain degree of comparison.\n\nMost of the finding showed an increase of the mean value in the count and motility. The significant difference was obtained in the study mostly in the post DGC for Grade 3 motility (immotile|删除段之间换行|sperm) suggesting positive effect of DGC on semen motility. Density gradient is the preferred technique for sperm processing for ART as it improved sperm motility and quality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This study also highlighted the higher chance of pregnancy in female with the male partner who aged less than 40 years old， control group (3.3%) compared to female with male partner aged more than 40 years old. It showed that as the age of the couple grows older， the likelihood of pregnancy decreases， and most studies link aging to a drop in sperm parameters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【43】On a separate note， Dong et al. concluded that chances of pregnancy from IUI decreases as semen sample contained lower than 2 million motile sperm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Thus， other studies specified that pregnancy from IUI is more probable with the existing of linear progressive motile among pairings with subfertility male with the higher likelihood of pregnancy from larger counts of post-prepared sperm with greater motility in IUI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. In addition， Ajayi et al. suggested than men with lower sperm counts had a 4 times higher likelihood to develop progressive sperm motility than men with normal sperm counts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Somehow， Ombelet et al. reviewed that studies should consider association of sperm parameters with other factors that may determine the success of IUI such as female age and period of subfertility. In addition， they iterate that prediction on pregnancy rate is acceptable yet considered as poor in sensitivity as comparison made with standardized limit sperm counts classing. Perhaps this study may output to different significance if sperm counts categorized in to non-parametric groupings for comparison with the nominal measure of pregnancy status. For the time being， this study suggests that IUI has done effectively in ensuring pregnancy from samples with lower sperm counts from pre-processed total or from post-processed non-progressive spermatozoa that originates from men below 40 years old.

He received 8 cycles of AC-T chemotherapy in the early stage of triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma， followed by local radiotherapy. Follow up until Tune 2022 showed no tumor recurrence or metastasis.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Adenoid cystic carcinoma of breast is a rare and special type of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， the incidence of which accounts for about 0.1% of all breast malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， and the patients are mostly elderly women通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In 2012， WHO classification of breast tumors was defined as breast cancer with low malignant potential， morphologically similar to adenoid cystic carcinoma occurring in salivary glands， which can be cured by simple mastectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Adenoid cystic carcinoma was classified into rare tumors and salivary gland tumors in the fift edition of WHO classification of breast tumors published in 2019， and its diagnosis was consistent with that of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the salivary gland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of invasive breast cancer without specific types通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It is extremely rare for both of them to be independently and originally from unilateral breast cancer. In the process of domestic literature review， only a case of bilateral primary breast cancer with unilateral adenoid cystic carcinoma reported by Xiao Xuewen et al. was found 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， and a case of mixed adenoid cystic carcinoma and ductal carcinoma of breast cancer reported by Kontos et al. was found in foreign literature search 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition， individual cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma mixed with small cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and spindle cell melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> were reviewed and analyzed. Independent primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the same breast were rarely reported.\n\nThehistological characteristics ofbreast adenoid cystic carcinoma in frozen sections are often not obvious， and due to the limitations of frozen material extraction and production， it is often difficul to distinguish it from other benign and malignant breast tumors，leading to misdiagnosis. Among the 8 cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast reported by Liu Yufei et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， 5 cases underwent intraoperative rapid freezing examination，and only 1 case was clearly diagnosed. This case of intraoperative freezing was also a tumor with a descriptive cribriform and trabecular tubular arrangement， which was not clearly diagnosed； when the tumor mainlypresents as a sieve-like structure， the following types need to be identified： 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> Invasive sieve-like carcinoma： An invasive carcinoma with a significant sieve-like structure， often accompanied by tubular carcinoma components， with mucoprotein secretions and dead bodies visible in the sieve pores. The tumor cells lack neoplastic myoepithelial cells， mainly glandular epithelial cells， with immunohistochemical ER and PR positive， and CD117 and myoepithelial markers negative. Adenoid|删除段之间换行|cystic carcinoma exhibits invasive growth and heterogeneous tissue structure. Tubular， trabecular， and ethmoidal structures， as well as basement membrane like or mucoid substances in the lumen， are important clues for diagnosis. Morphological glandular epithelial cells are mixed with myoepithelial and basal like cells， with typical immunohistochemical ER and PR negative， and positive staining for CD117， myoepithelial Calponin， and p63 are helpful for differential diagnosis； 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Sieve shaped ductal carcinoma in situ： Intraductal lesions in which the glandular epithelium exhibits a sieve shaped neoplastic proliferation. The tumor cells are relatively consistent and both ER and PR are diffusely positive. Myoepithelial cells exist around the duct， and myoepithelial cells such as p63，Calponin， and SMA are positive， while CD117 is negative， which is helpful for differential diagnosis.\n\n【21】The main diseases that need to be differentiated from invasive ductal carcinoma include 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> sclerosing adenopathy： A tubular adenopathy with lobular hyperplasia accompanied by fibrosis and sclerotic interstitial hyperplasia that constitutes a pathological change in the conscience， but its gland/tubule compression is obvious， making it difficul to identify the double layer cellular structure， and its growth pattern is similar to nerve invasion， especially in intraoperative rapid freezing and biopsy of small specimens， which is difficul to distinguish. Diagnosis needs to be very careful， and can be made with the help of calponin immunohistochemical staining of muscle epithelium such as p63 was used to label the remaining lobular structures on the muscle epithelia to assist in diagnosis. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Invasive lobular carcinoma： The classic type often presents a private like or target circular arrangement， and the atypical morphology of the two often overlaps， making it difficul to distinguish. Immunohistochemistry P120 and E-cadherin can be used to assist in the differential diagnosis： Both invasive ductal carcinomas are positive for cell membrane； the cytoplasm of lobular carcinoma P120was positive， while E-cadherin was negative.\n\n【22】In differential diagnosis， it can be seen that immunohistochemical CD117 can be specifically expressed in adenoid cystic carcinoma， mainly related to regulatory genes. Research has found that C-KIT is one of the downstream genes regulated by MYB， and C-KIT mutations can be detected in adenoid cystic carcinoma at different sites such as salivary gland and breast， and their protein products express CD117 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. At the same time， the literature suggests that about half of adenoid cystic carcinoma is accompanied by the MYB-NFIB fusion gene， but the use of the C-KIT targeted drug imatinib has poor efficac in treating adenoid cystic carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>， So the treatment is still primarily surgical. The treatment of invasive ductal carcinoma has shifted from surgery+hormone+neoadjuvant treatment to neoadjuvant treatment+surgical treatment， provided that HER2 testing is positive and trastuzumab can be used for targeted treatment.\n\n【23】In summary， simultaneous independent primary adenoid cystic carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma of the unilateral breast are extremely rare， with unique histomorphology，immunohistochemical characteristics， and biological behavior.

The clinical issues are sensitivity (particularly to cold)， rapid wear and poor aesthetics， all of which can vary depending on the type of AI. Other anomalies with AI include disturbances in eruption， anterior open bite， pulpal calcifications，pathological root or crown resorption and taurodontism，all of which can present in the pediatric patient. This case report describes the preventive strategy of a case with amelogenesis imperfecta in a young patient who has 4-year-old with 18 months follow-up.\n\n【2】Keywords： Amelogenesis imperfecta； Preventive strategy； Primary teeth\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Amelogenesis imperfecta has been defined as a complex group of hereditary enamel defects not associated with evidence of systemic disease. It can affect all or some teeth in deciduous and/or permanent dentition. The prevalence of AI varies according to different studies ranging from1/700 to 1/14.000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. These differences are mainly due to diagnostic or demographic criteria or to mutant genes in the studied population. Different classifications of AI have been reported in literature， usually related to phenotype characteristics (clinical and radiological appearance) or to the description of the mode of inheritance of the disease (autosomal dominant/recessive). Clinically four types of AI have been recognized according to enamel types： Type 1 (hypoplastic with a deficiency in the quantity of enamel)； Type 2 (hypomaturation， with an opaque and chalky enamel)， Type 3 (hypocalcified， characterized by a normal amount of poorly mineralized enamel) and Type 4 (hypoplastic-hypomaturation enamel associated with taurodontism). In some classifications， the type 4 is also related to other dental anomalies such as multiple impacted teeth and congenital missing teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>. The Problems associated with amelogenesis imperfecta include an increased incidence of plaque deposits and consequent gingivitis， dental hypersensitivity， loss of vertical dimension due to a rapid wear of the dentition，poor esthetic appearance and the potential need for lifelong， extensive restorative care. These in addition， psychological problems need to be considered， mainly related to the difficulties that these patients report in their social interaction due to the unesthetic appearance of their smile. The chalenges faced in managing a young patient with Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) are numerous and prevention is the most important tool in any clinician'sarmamentarium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. It is particularly important when teeth are known to be vulnerable. This report describes the preventive strategy of a case with hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta in a young patient who has 4 years old， with 18 moths of follow-up.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 4-vear-old female patientpresented at to the Department of Pediatric Dentistryand Prevention of Rabat University. She was referred with an unsightly appearance affecting all the primary teeth and dental sensitivity . The family history was negative for the disease. Past medical history was reviewed and there was no remarkable report. The initial clinical examination did not reveal any extra-oral pathology signs. Dental examination revealed poor esthetics due to a yellowish aspect of all maxillary and mandibular primary teeth with no dental caries. Radiographic examination showed generalized loss of enamel with high pulp horns and no periodontal defects were present. The occlusal function showed several characteristics typical of a first dental class. On evaluation of the vertical dimension of occlusion using phonetics， interocclusal measurements and facial appearance as guides， it was determined that the vertical dimension of occlusion was maintained. After doing a professional Tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste， dental discoloration still existed in all maxillary and mandibular primary teeth. Based on the clinical and radiographic findings，|删除段之间换行|easily chipping， with loss of dental structure.\n\na diagnosis of hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta was made. After explaining to the patient and her mother this enamel defects， we opted for a preventive strategy to reduce sensitivity， to protect dental structure， to prevent caries， occlusal disorder and periodontal disease. The first aim of our preventive strategy was to confirm diagnosis of this enamel defects. After accomplishing a professional Tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste to avoid the confusion with an extrinsic-tint， we studied clinical and radiographic signs and we concluded a diagnosis of hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta. In order to reduce dental sensitivity， to prevent caries and periodontal disease and to protect dental structure， we used topical fluoride in the form of a varnish to foster the protection of the smooth surfaces of primary teeth and the remineralization of the first carious lesions. It was applied twice every month during our preventive strategy. The enamel alterations， which are characteristic of the disease and observed at maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth 通用删除7(英):<u>(51-52-61-62-71-72-81-82)</u> were protected using a direct composite resin. The main goals of this stage were represented by the need to protect the occlusal dental surfaces from the abrasion and provide a satisfactory esthetic result. Dental abrasions particularly in posterior teeth， when if not protected may determine the loss of the vertical dimension as well as a diffuse and marked dentinal hypersensitivity. To prevent the occlusal disorder， we used Performed Metal Crowns (PMCs) restorations on the occlusal surfaces of maxillary and mandibular primary molars. After assessing the tooth shape， contact points/areas and the occlusion， orthodontic separators were used to create space for fitting a performed metal crown at the mesial and distal contacts. The patient was seen 3 days later for removal of the separator and the inter-proximal area of the gingiva was inspected. Different sizes of crowns was selected until we find one which covers all the cusps with no tooth preparation and approached the contact points with a slight feeling of “spring back\". Then， we loaded the crown generously with a glass ionomer luting cement from the base upwards， fitting the crown and we did a first stage seating. After wiping the excess cement away， we checked fit and we did second stage seating. Then we removed excess cement， flossed between the contacts and checked occlusion and discharge. Anecdotally，preformed metal crown placed high in occlusion do not cause problems for children and avoidance of interferences of >1.5 mm are recommended. It has been suggested that interferences <1 mm are well tolerated with dento-alveolar compensation occurring within a few weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. In summary， young children appear to have an adaptable masticatory system in which changes occur quickly. After finishing and polishing， the crowns restorations were checked radiographically. At last， in order|删除段之间换行|to maintain all results and a high oral health status， the patient was instructed to use Tooth brushing with fluoride toothpaste three times a day (250 to 550 ppmF) and we used topical fluoride in the form of a varnish (10%) twice yearly during our post-preventive strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， and the mother was informed about the importance of maintaining meticulous oral hygiene and regularly returning for clinical and radiograph monitoring. The patient was seen every 3 months and she was asymptomatic. After 18 months， clinical and radiographic signs were still stable with a good aesthetics and periodontal health.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The term Amelogenesis Imperfecta (AI) refers to a heterogeneous group of genetic disorders characterized by defects in enamel formation of the teeth in the absence of any generalized or systemic diseases. It can affect all or some teeth in deciduous and/or permanent dentition.Recent studies have identified five genes as beingresponsible for AI by mutation or altered expression： AMEL (amelogenin)， ENAM (enamelin)， MMP20 (matrix metalloproteinase-20)， KLK4(Kallikrein-4)， and FAM83H4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. A diagnosis of amelogenesis imperfecta can present challenges for patient and clinician alike. This can be further complicated in a child due to cooperation and the ever-changing dentition. As with all children， initial experience of the dental profession plays a part in their cooperation for the future. Children with AI often require extensive dental treatment throughout their lives， therefore it is essential to ensure the initial experiences are positive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， this can be hard to achieve when a child may be experiencing sensitivity when brushing their teeth and eating/drinking cold things. Seeing a child as early as possible will enable the clinician to build up a rapport with the child and parents/carers.\n\nIn our case， the patient was diagnosed with hhypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta and an early preventive strategy was realized to reduce sensitivity， to protect dental structure， to prevent caries，|删除段之间换行|occlusal disorder and periodontal disease. Prevention is the most important tool in any clinician's armamentarium. It is particularly important when teeth are known to be vulnerable， as is the case in AI. Oral hygiene can be particularly difficult for this group of patients due to sensitivity when brushing. Advising the use of warm water for tooth brushing will go some way to relieving symptoms when rinsing. Regularuse offluoride mouthwashes can also helpto reduce sensitivity and prevent caries in children old enough to be trusted not to swallow it. However， the discomfort associated with brushing cannot always be overcome and cases where there are significant plaque and calculus deposits are not unusual. In addition， psychological outcomes need to be considered， mainly related to the difficulties that these patients report in their social interaction due to the unesthetic appearance of their smile.\n\n【11】Clinical management may vary according to the type and severity of the disease， the age of the patients， as well as their socioeconomic status. For these reasons， a wide range of possible and different treatments for teeth restoration of patients affected by AI has been reported in literature. With regard to the possible treatments related to the clinical case here reported， the therapies vary from a conservative to a prosthetic approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In particular， the conservative treatment of the affected teeth may be used during childhood， as transitional treatment， but cannot be used for a longer period because it does not satisfy esthetic needs and it would not prevent the abrasion of posterior occlusal surfaces over time with consequent loss of the vertical dimension. The preventive strategy described in the present case report is reasonably simple. In the anterior teeth， direct composites have the advantage that they can be started as soon as there is sufficient tooth erupted and added to as further eruption occurs. However，the child and parent should be warned that with continuing eruption and gingival maturation， the margins of any restoration will become visible and additional treatment will be required， at intervals， to maintain good aesthetics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In the posterior regions， Preformed Metal Crowns (PMCs) restorations were placed on the occlusal surfaces of primary molars. Orthodontic separators between molars will assist placement of crowns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. No tooth preparation is required to undertake this treatment， assuming the dentition is caries free. In an anxious or young child compromise may be necessary， in which case； second deciduous molars are considered to be higher priority to maintain the occlusion and placing aesthetic veneers on anterior teeth may be used as acclimatization and help to motivate the child and family 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-21\\]</u>. However， there is always a risk that the child may not return as their primary complaint may be addressing the aesthetics.\n\nAs with all dental procedure， following-up is of critical importance. The patient should be seen at 3， 6 and 12 months and yearly at mixed and permanent dentition. Esthetics and periodontal status should be confirmed both clinically and radiographically at these control visits. In this case after 18 months， clinical and X-ray examinations showed satisfactory esthetic and functional outcomes|删除段之间换行|and a good state of periodontal health .\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Developmental disturbances such as amelogenesis imperfecta not only impair the function and aesthetics but also have a profound psychological effect on the patient’s self-esteem and confidence especially in childhood. An early preventive strategy is essential to reduce sensitivity， to protect dental structure， to prevent caries， occlusal disorder and periodontal disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Surgery， including debridement and patella truncation，had positive effects on lower extremity circulation， infection control， cavity treatment， bone destruction， surgical debridement， recovery of foot function， and nursing. After five months， the patient’s foot ulcer had healed， and walking function was preserved.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Scheduling interventional surgery and debridement are the key point in a complicated diabetic foot ulcers case， and multidisciplinary collaboration in treatment of diabetic foot is significantly important.\n\n【4】Keywords： Multidisciplinary collaboration； Diabetic foot ulcer； Timing； Interventional therapy\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】In China， in 2010， the prevalence of diabetes was 11.6% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， while the proportion of diabetic patients>50 years old with lower extremity arterial disease was 19.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>； the proportion of diabetic patients >60 years old with lower extremity arterial disease was 35.4%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The incidence of new foot ulcers in Chinese patients with diabetes during the period from 2010 to 2011 was 8.1%，and the incidence of new ulcers in patients with diabetic foot ulcers within that period was 31.6%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Diabetic foot ulcers have gradually become a challenge in clinical therapy and a leading cause of hospitalization among patients with diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The medical community has reached a consensus in favor of multidisciplinary collaboration in treatment of diabetic foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-9\\]</u>. The complexity of treatment for diabetic foot determines the importance of optimizing the timing of multi-disciplinary and sequential treatments. This case presentation describes a complicated process of treatment for an elderly patient with diabetic foot ulcers， who had signs of poor baseline physiology. The wounds healed， and foot function was maximally preserved.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 68-year-old man with 21-year history of type 2 diabetes presented with an ulcer on the left heel. Height was 162 cm； body weight was 69 kg； body mass index was 26.3. The patient had been diagnosed with lower extremity atherosclerotic obliterans 7 years earlier. The left lower limb has been numb for 6 years， with intermittent claudication and rest pain for 1 year. The patient reported that his sleep was affected， but his degree of pain was decreased with the intermittent use of analgesic agents. For the left lower limb with claudication， walking distance was 90 meters.\n\n【10】The patient was hospitalized on 10 July删除4:<u> 2017</u>. Twenty days before hospitalization， irritation and pain developed on the lateral skin of the toes of the left foot， with no obvious inducement. Purulent exudate was observed after skin ulceration， and the patient's body temperature increased to 39.5°C. During hospitalization， the five toes of the left foot were black， necrotic， and associated with aggravated rest pain. Although the dose of oral analgesics was increased， the patient’s pain was not relieved， and his sleep was severely affected.\n\n【11】The patient's appearance on initial evaluation is shown in Figure 1A， 1B. The five toes of the left上foot were almost entirely black and necrotic. The skin extending from the bottom of the foot to the5hh metatarsophalangeal joint was red and swollen， with obvious tenderness； skin temperature v S\n\n【12】normal. The muscles of the left foot had clearly atrophied； the skin was thin， bright， and hypertonic. Incision and drainage (approx. 5.0cm long) was immediately performed between the 4h and 5h toes. Necrotic tissue， minimal purulent exudation， and limited bleeding were observed.\n\n【13】The diagnostic results on obtained on July 13 are shown. Secretion cultures displayed Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. X-ray film showed in Figure 1C， 1D revealed no obvious destruction in foot bone. The lower limb Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) is shown in Figure 1E.\n\nThe Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the foot obtained on July 14.h is shown in Figure 1F， 1G. Subcutaneous inflammatory|删除段之间换行|tissue in the lateral 54h humerus bone was confirmed as an infectious submerged cavity . The first incision performed at the bedside resulted in limited purulent exudation， as well as decreased local tension and reduced foot swelling. However， progressive necrosis of the skin margin was noted .\n\n【15】On July 17， basal therapy consisted in controlling blood sugar with insulin (58 units/day). The initial antimicrobial application of ceftazidime infusion (2 gm， twice daily) was replaced by the sensitive drug Sulperazon (Cefoperazone Sodium and Sulbactam Sodium for Injection， Pfizer)， according to the bacterial culture result of the secretion， and the application of antibiotics was stopped after July删除4-1:<u>22</u>. The patient showed improved circulation and blood pressure. Treatment was maintained with protein and iron supplements.\n\nOn July 18h， interventional therapy was performed on the lower limb. The balloon was expanded in the superficial femoral artery， anterior tibia artery， iliac artery， and tendon. A thrombus had formed in the lower segment of the superficial femoral artery. The catheter for thrombolysis was left in place until July 20 . Skin temperature in the left foot increased， and swelling extended to the center of the foot. The amount of purulent exudation increased， as did pain and body temperature. The foot was therefore incised and|删除段之间换行|drained， once more. Multiple subcavities were found .\n\n【17】On July 21， we performed patella truncation and debridement on toes 4 and删除4:<u> 5</u>. The procedure was performed in the operating room， with the patient under sciatic nerve block. Results are presented in Figure删除4:<u> 4</u>. Submerged cavities were filled with povidone-iodine gauze. The amount of nonviable tissue in the submerged cavity gradually decreased. The submerged space became shallow， and the granulation filled. All subsequent treatments were performed in the outpatient department.\n\n【18】From July 25 to September 30\"， the left foot plaster was fixed at a functional position and applied intermittently . After October 15， the plaster was removed. The patient was given diabetic shoes， and walking was guided. The first signs of wound healing were observed on November 19 .\n\n【19】Discussion Debridement schedule\n\n【20】In order to minimize adverse effects， local debridement must be initiated in an expedient fashion. In the case presented above， the foot was severely ischemic and therefore could not support local blood transport after incision. In addition， infection easily spreads along the physiological cavity extending from thelittle toe. Efforts to avoid skin necrosis and wound expansion typically render comprehensive and meticulous debridement impossible.\n\n【21】After the initialtreatment， we continued with nibbling debridement， in order to preserve as much residual tissue as possible. Debridement can be performed more thoroughly after blood transport is improved. The surgeon must continue to avoid over-injury， in order to restrict the area of infection. After the second episode of debridement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， the opening of the cavity was patent and incompletely dissected . It is also possible to cut into the subcavities of the heel  and the lateral portion of the 5tibia .\n\n【22】Intervention\n\n【23】Endovascular treatment may improve the blood supply to the lower limbs and create conditions conducive to thorough debridement and healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Such treatment should be initiated once the local infection is restricted， and the patient is stable. However， after the intervention，improved wound circulation increases the in flammatory response. In this case， the patient underwent substantial debridement during thrombolysis， when it was discovered that the infection had spread along physiological lacunae . Blood supply to the lower extremities was not considered sufficient for skin grafting.\n\n【24】Debridement\n\n【25】The term “nibbling debridement”denotes debridement that is gradual in spatial and temporal dimensions. Debridement is generally used to treat diabetic feet， which often have insufficient blood supply. The surgeons attempted to preserve as much tissue as possible， with the extent of debridement determined by guidelines for treatment during the infection， proliferative， and healing phases. The sites of debridement included： necrotic skin margins， fascia， deeper cavities， residual tendon and inactivated tissue in shallow lances，and hyperplastic granulation (during the later stages of treatment).\n\n【26】Preservation of foot function\n\nIn the early stage of treatment， it is necessary to fix the functional position in order to avoid supporting and walking. Such precautions|删除段之间换行|are necessary to avoid the flexion and extension of large joints. During the middle stages of treatment， joint activity may increase slightly. Once the plaster is fixed， the foot may be supported on the floor. However， walking should be forbidden， in order to avoid movement between tissues. During the latter stages of treatment， when healing is clearly underway， the patient should be given shoes tailored specifically for diabetic feet， to provide support during walking 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Training sessions to improve function of thelower extremities should be completed with increasing frequency， but the use of conventional shoes is prohibited.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】The treatment of diabetic foot ulcers is extremely complicated. During the initial stages of diagnosis， a multidisciplinaryteam should make treatment recommendations based on the severity of ischemia and the degree of infection. If the foot cannot be preserved， thorough debridement may be performed during the initial stages of treatment to reduce adverse effects on the body. In combination with standard treatment， conditions for amputation should be achieved in as expedient a fashion as possible. Multi-disciplinary cooperation and optimization of the treatment schedule are necessary if there is even a remote possibility of preserving any portion of the foot or toes.\n\n【30】Declarations\n\n【31】Ethics approval and consent to participate\n\n【32】All procedures performed as part of this study were approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital in Capital Medical University (No.2015PBL-128).

Histology of the tumor in the lower gastric body was adenocarcinoma with papillary or tubular structures in the mucosal area. However， in the submucosal area， majority of tumor cells was changed to clear cells resembling cytotrophoblasts as seen in trophoblastic neoplasms. Furthermore， solitary growth of the spindle cells resembling Syncytiotrophoblast cells was apparent in the layers of muscularis propria and subserosa. Immunohistochemically， syncytiotrophoblast type cells were positive for beta-subunit of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin(HCG). Three out of 28 regionallymph nodes had metastases of the neoplasm with adenocarcinoma as well as choriocarcinomatous components. The tumor on the posterior wall of pylorus was a tubular adenocarcinoma only recognized in the mucosal layer. The tumor did not contain any trophoblastic components.\n\n【2】Choriocarcinomatous differentiation of the gastric carcinoma was suggested to occur during the down growth of the neoplasm. Present gastric choriocarcinoma supports the concept that gastric choriocarcinoma arises from alternate differentiation pathway of adenocarcinoma. Such synchronous occurrence of double carcinomas in the stomach may also suggest a higher oncogenesis stage of the stomach of this woman.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Stomach may be a common site oforigin of non-gonadal， non-gestational trophoblastic tumors， although gastric cancers with germ cell tumor components are uncommon. Choriocarcinoma， hepatoid adenocarcinoma， carcinoma with enteroblastic differentiation， and York sac tumor like carcinoma are known as special type of gastric cancer. Choriocarcinoma is a trophoblastic tumor as a rare primary miscellaneous tumor in the stomach. It is known that some of gastric cancers have choriocarcinomatous components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Regarding the pathogenesis of gastric choriocarcinoma， retro-differentiation or dedifferentiation theory has been accepted upon the observation that gastric choriocarcinoma are found with coexistent adenocarcinomas or adenocarcinoma components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. In a few tumors， the primary gastric lesion was pure adenocarcinoma and the choriocarcinomatous differentiation only became manifest in the metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Certainly， it is plausible that since all cells contain the entire genetic material for the whole organism， cancers may differentiate in unusual directions， including even the formation of malignant trophoblasts. However， precise mechanisms for the trophoblastic differentiation of gastric cancers are still unknown. Presently， we report a unique case with a carcinoma exerting choriocarcinomatous differentiation and another separated adenocarcinoma in the stomach. Significance of such synchronous gastric carcinomas particularly for the point ofassociation between tumor growth and differentiation is discussed.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA78-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of epigastralgia. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed existence of a type 3 tumor on the greater curvature of lower gastric body and a type 0-IIa+IIc lesion on the posterior wall in pylorus. By biopsy， both lesions were diagnosed as adenocarcinomas， suggesting that the stomach had double cancers with different stages. The distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u> was performed. The|删除段之间换行|Papillary or tubular growth of the neoplastic cells are recognized in the surface area. In the submucosal area (lower half)， are growing the tumor cells with clear cytoplasm. A few elongated cells with amphophilic cytoplasm are mixed in these areas (HE-stain). A high-power view of the clear cell population showing coexistence of dark cells with more pleomorphic nuclei(insert).\n\ntumor mass on the greater curvature of lower gastric body measured40 mm x 40 mm was a nodular， irregular， gray-pink appearance having central ulceration with a raised rolled margin. The neoplastic mass on the posterior wall in pylorus measured 18 mmx18 mm was a polypoid lesion with surface erosions； type 0-IIa+IIc . On the operation， the tumors looked to be localized in the stomach wall and metastases to lymph nodes and other organs were not confirmed. On microscopy， the surface area of the neoplasm on the greater curvature of lower gastric body exhibited common features of adenocarcinoma with papillary or tubular growth. However， the main neoplastic cells infiltrating laminapropria and occupying submucosal space were changed to those composed of single nucleus， vacuolated or clear cytoplasm. They were relatively uniform population and lacked typical glandular structures. Less number of bizarre cells resembling syncytiotrophoblast cells with more pleomorphic nuclei， deeply eosinophilic to basophilic cytoplasm and less distinct cell membranes was mixed with the clear cell population . The tumor infiltrated through the muscularis propria into the sub serous space. In the layers of muscularis propria and subserosal area， solitary growth of syncytiotrophoblast type cells which were|删除段之间换行|encountered infrequently with clear cells in the submucosal area， was often recognized . Immunoreaction of HCG was localized exclusively to these syncytiotrophoblast type cells . Three out of 28 regional lymph nodes had metastatic lesions of the neoplasm. Interestingly， the metastatic lesions also contained adenocarcinomatous as well as choriocarcinomatous components with immunoreaction of HCG. Immunostaining of Cytokeratin(CK) 7 was strongly positive for all neoplastic cells in the all layers of the stomach. However， CK 20 was negative in any tumor cells. Furthermore， Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) was clearly positive in the cells of adenocarcinomatous features. Production of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) was not recognized in any tumor cells of this tiimor.\n\n【8】Histology ofthetumorlocated on theposterior wall of pylorus was a combined type of well differentiated and moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma . The carcinoma was growing only in the mucosal layer. It is assumed that the tumor in the pylorus had multifocal origin， since the carcinoma was a combined type andsome normal epithelium was remained among the neoplastic epithelium. The tumor did not contain any trophoblastic components. HCG， CEA and AFP were not immunoreactive. CK 7 was partially positive in the tumor tissues， although CK 20 was negative.\n\nPostoperatively， the patient has been stable， and no evidence showing possibility of malignancy in other organs including ovary and uterus was recognized. She had taken S-1 for six months as adjuvant chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. The recurrence and metastases of the gastric cancer have not been recognized for a year. However， the patient unfortunately died two years after the operation due to the|删除段之间换行|abdominal dissemination of the neoplasm.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Presently， HCG positive syncytiotrophoblast type cells came into existence mainly in the layers of muscularis propria and subserosa， not in the mucosal area where was present only the cells with features of adenocarcinoma. Thus， choriocarcinomatous differentiation is suggested to occur during the down growth of the tumor. In this case， typical mix of cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblastic elements as seen in representative choriocarcinomas was not apparent. However， clear cells lacking HCG activity often coexisted with syncytiotrophoblast type cells in the submucosal area. Furthermore， morphology ofthese cells resembles cytotrophoblasts of trophoblastic neoplasms. Accordingly。appearance of such cell population was suggested to be an evidence for the choriocarcinomatous differentiation of the adenocarcinoma.\n\n【12】Cytogenetic study on the gastric choriocarcinoma also supports the theory that gastric choriocarcinoma arises from alternate differentiation pathway of adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Although， HCG-producing cells were not confirmed in the normal antrum mucosa in this study， some authors reported presence of immunoreactive cells against beta subunit of HCG in the neck region of normal antral mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. Such specific feature of the stomach might be related to the choriocarcinomatous differentiation.\n\n【13】In this case， synchronous development of two separated carcinomas was present in the stomach of the woman. Furthermore， the intramucosal carcinoma in the pre-pylorus was suggested to be multifocal. There is evidence that some of larger early gastric carcinomas may result from collision of smaller neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Thus， existence of multiple cancers in the stomach of this woman implies a higher oncogenesis stage of this organ. The concept of field cancerization is recognized in different human organs. Regarding the mechanism of field cancerization of human stomach， genetic instability in the mucosal cells is suggested to relate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Meanwhile， McDonald et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> reported from the analysis using mitochondrial DNA mutations that human gastric body units are clonal and contain multiple multipotential stem cells， thereby mutated gastric stem cells spread widely within the stomach. In the present case， the patient developed two separated gastric carcinomas， one of which accompanied choriocarcinomatous differentiation. Similar case with double carcinomas of the stomach is reported by Eom et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Recently， collision tumor of choriocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma of the stomach was reported by Fukuda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In the present case， the carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation showed the staining pattern of CK 7 positive and CK 20 negative. Similar staining pattern of cytokeratin is also confirmed in a gastric carcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. CK 7 is evaluated as an accurate intracellular marker to assess the purity of human placental villous trophoblast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Choriocarcinomatous differentiation may be concerned with function of some cytokeratin， although evidence is uncertain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

From 2015 onwards， the observed order of serovars prevalence was Typhimurium， Enteritidis， or Infantis according to the year， followed by Newport. In the United States， it was S. typhimurium， Enteritidis followed by Newport， and monophasic Typhimurium 4，通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， 12：i：-. S. enteritidis， Typhimurium， monophasic Typhimurium1，4，通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>，12：i-， Infantis， and Newport in the European Union 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. Although the role of animal-based foods in the transmission of this pathogen to humans has been previously demonstrated， the prevalence of Salmonella serovars in these products is not yet fully understood. The prevalence in different food matrices varies according to countries and regions， influenced both by culture and food production practices， as well as by geographic location and economic power. Furthermore， production animals are often asymptomatic carriers， and after entering the slaughterhouse， Salmonella can be transferred to other substrates during industrial processing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\nSalmonella typhimurium represented29.4% ofthetotal(918/3，113isolates) being the main serovar agent of salmonellosis in Brazil. The results reported here confirm that the Typhimurium serovar shows a cosmopolitan profile. It is considered an example of a generalist serovar. Therefore， these results corroborate those associated with S. typhimurium and its monophasic variant from a global point of view confirming that pork meat is the main source of this serovar. Thus， it is not surprising that it ranks second in Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and third in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> in reports of human salmonellosis. Despite the decrease in the number of diseases caused by S. Enteritidis this serovar ranked second with 20.8%(647/3，113 isolates) of the total.In this study， S. enteritidis was found to be the most prevalent serovar associated with human cases up to 2014. This is in agreement with the global increase in the incidence of this serovar since the 1980s associated with consumption of eggs and poultry and its decrease in the 2010s. It’s followed by S. Infantis with 5.1%(159/3，113 isolates). Table 1 details the top 10 serovars of each year in the analyzed period. Most of these serovars have a wide host range that can colonize several animals and are primarily transmitted to humans bv foods of animal origin， such as raw meat， pork， poultry， and eggs. Seafood， fruits and vegetables can also serve as vehicles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Several countries reported S. typhimurium， S. enteritidis， and S. Infantis as being the most related to enteric and invasive diseases in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In 2015 S. Heidelberg emerged among the main serotypes causing human salmonellosis with the peak of cases in 2016， becoming the second most common|删除段之间换行|serovar. However， as of 2017， the frequency of serotyped strains such as S.

Three months earlier， the patient had been fully independent， with no previous cognitive difficulties. Language and executive function were the first to be affected. Attention and memory were initiallypreserved. Within a few weeks， however， he had become restless， disorientated， and dependent on others for basic activities of daily living. We therefore carried out cerebral scintigraphy， which showed a discrete bilateral parietal and posterior cingular hypofixation compatible with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and a second lumbar puncture.\n\n【11】Two months before presenting at our Geriatric Department， our patient developed predominantly left peripheral bilateral facial palsy (House Brackmann III left and II right) without any cognitive impairment. He had then undergone initial neurologic assessment at another hospital. CSF analysis highlighted lymphocytic meningitis performed then. Infection workup with PCR HSV， VzV and Lyme antibodies in the CSF was negative. Miller-Fisher and Guillain-Barre Syndromes were excluded on the basis of a lower-limb EMG and the absence of anti-GQ1b antibodies. No facial Electroneuromyography(ENMG) was performed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed FLAIR hyperintensity in the right head of the caudate nucleus and the right anterior arm of the internal capsule； this was consistent with ischemic lesions.\n\n【12】The second CSF analysis showed pleocytosis with 34 cells/mm. Cytomorphological examination of the CSF showed abnormal lymphocytes highly suggestive of lymphoid malignancy .

Investigations after an infectious outbreak (blood and urine cultures， and chest radiography) came back negative. An Electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a highly diffused slow component of the trace that was consistent with encephalopathy. A new ENMG showed severe motor and sensory axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy of the lower limbs.\n\n【17】In view of his severe functional and cognitive decline， multidisciplinary discussions that included the patient’s relatives decided on best supportive care.

Her MRV taken one week later revealed partial recanalization， and her clinic had significantly improved.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\nThere is no effective drug therapy in the fight against COVID-19， and the most effective way to be protected from COVID-19 is to try to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 through vaccination. There are two types of vaccines， viral vector vaccines and messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. CVST is one of the serious side effects seen in association with the administration of mRNA vaccines， albeit rare. Vaccine-induced thrombocytopenic thrombosis is blamed for this serious side effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. However， in addition to cases with CVST accompanied by thrombocytopenia， cases who developed thromboembolic events without thrombocytopenia have also been reported duringthe post-vaccination period. In parallel， in the study of Perry et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， in which cases that developed CVST after vaccination against COVID-19 were examined， vaccine-induced immune thrombocytopenia was observed in 70 of the 95 CVST patients， while the remaining 20 patients did not develop thrombocytopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In comparison， the first case presented in this study developed CVST on the second day after vaccination. This is different than the results reported in the literature in that the cases presented in the literature were reported to have developed thrombosis within 4 to 19 days after vaccination. The platelet count of the patient was normal， however he was found to have hyperhomocysteinemia， vitamin B12 deficiency and homozygous MTHFR (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase)|删除段之间换行|mutation. Accordingly， the presence of additional risk factors is thought to have predisposed the patient to thrombosis， which caused the patient to develop thrombosis as early as on the second day after vaccination. This result raises the question whether genetic examination， homocysteine， vitamin B12 level and other coagulation factors should be checked before vaccination， even if the patients do not have a history of thromboembolic events. On the other hand， the etiology of the second case presented in this study included hyperfibrinogenemia as well as obesity as a predisposing factor. Brain MRI revealed venous watershed infarct areas in both of the cases investigated in this study， and a dramatic improvement was observed in their clinics after treatment. There was extensive thrombus in both deep and superficial veins in the second case presented in this study， yet the fact that recanalization was observed in the follow-up MRV taken on the 7h day suggests that early diagnosis and treatment were effective on the prognosis.\n\n【22】In CVST， venous pressure increases secondary to obstruction， whereas capillary perfusion decreases. Initially the cerebral collateral network tolerates this pressure， yet venous stasis， vasogenic edema， and hemorrhagic infarctions occur in the later period as the capacity of the collateral network is exceeded. Decreased cerebral perfusion causes cytotoxic edema and increased intracranial pressure. There are studies in which it was demonstrated on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) that the resulting increase in intracranial pressure causes ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The reported etiological causes of patients with watershed infarcts secondary to CVST in the literature vary. The course of the disease was not mortal in any of these patients， and clinical improvement was observed in all of them after treatment. Deep venous thrombosis was common to all these patients. Presence of deep venous thrombosis indicates a poor prognosis as venous watershed infarcts are seen in relation thereto， but there were no patients with a mortal course among the reported cases.\n\n【23】In conclusion， early diagnosis seems to be a very effective parameter in prognosis. Additionally， the presence of genetic mutations in the two cases presented in this study in association with COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination suggests that genetic tests should be carried out in these patients.\n\nWatershed infarct areas are mostly observed in hypotensive cerebral infarction. Differential diagnosis is important since different|删除段之间换行|treatments are indicated in arterial and venous watershed infarcts. It should be kept in mind that CVST may be present in patients with watershed infarct areas and clinically prominent headache， and that watershed infarcts may be of venous origin， albeit rarely.\n\n【25】Highlights\n\n【26】Watershed infarcts are not always arterial.\n\n【27】Cerebral venous thrombosis should be excluded in the presence of headache and watershed infarct.\n\n【28】Heparin may worsen the clinic in thrombosis induced by COVID-19 infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In their treatment tetracyclines (doxycycline) were used and azithromycin and ciprofloxacin for treating the smaller number of ill people. Doxycycline showed the best clinical efficacy. All patients were cured. In this epidemia， the Q-fever in people was caused by the infected sheep and contaminated area in which the infected sheep stayed.\n\n【2】Keywords： Q-febris； Clinical characteristics； Epidemiology\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Q-fever is a zoonosis caused by the intracellular gram-negative bacterium Coxiella (C.) burnetii， which is distributed worldwide， except in New Zealand 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Q-fever in animals usually causes a clinically inapparent infection. Q-fever in humans can be an acute or chronic disease， and they differ in duration， clinical presentation and serological test findings. Acute Q-fever can be asymptomatic or manifest as a short-term febrile illness， atypical pneumonia， and granulomatous hepatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Chronic Q-fever is most often presented as endocarditis， and less often as endovascular infection， chronic infection during pregnancy， chronic hepatitis， chronic lung infection and infections of the locomotor system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Endocarditis is responsible for 60% to 70% of cases of chronic C. burnetii infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is a disease of some wild and almost all domestic animals， among which it is maintained and transmitted by vectors (ticks). Among domestic animals， the most common hosts are ruminants， but it has also been proven in horses，pigs， camels，bison， rabbits， squirrels， mice， wild game， domestic poultry and wild birds. The most common source of infection for humans is sheep， goats and cattle. The causative agent， C. burneti， is excreted in the milk of infected animals， and there are extremely many causative agents in amniotic fluid， sheaths，lochia secretions and on wool通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Humans are usually infected by inhaling dust contaminated with C. burnetii bacteria and by contact with infectious materials， during childbirth， abortion or slaughter. In humans， the infection is manifested by a severe headache，high fever， pain in the back and joints， and atypical pneumonia usually occurs. In the chronic form， a person can suffer from endocarditis and hepatosplenomegaly， and the outcome can be fatal.\n\n【5】In our country， Q-fever regularly appears at the end of winter or in spring， during the lambing of sheep， so it is extremely seasonal. In previous years， Q-fever in our country was more frequent and associated with nomadic sheep grazing. Thelast Q-fever epidemic in the Banja Luka region occurred in 2004. In 2015， 42 cases of this zoonosis were registered in the Banja Luka region. Epizootics and epidemics have been described in various countries. Nebreda et al. In 2001， it was described in Spain by Serbezov et al. 1999 in Bulgaria and Slovakia， Literak and Rehacek，1996) in the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic， Tringali and Mansueto 1987 in Italy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The goal of the paper was to show the importance of this disease， a zoonosis that occurs in our area， especially in the differential diagnosis of unclear febrile conditions， by presenting the Q fever epidemic.\n\n【7】MaterialandMethods\n\n【8】In the period from February 1' to April 304， 2016， 28 people， 23men and 5 women， fell ill with Q-fever. Most of the patients were from Banja Luka， the Laus settlement (80%)， and 20% from the surrounding towns， Celinac， Kotor Varos， Gradiska， Han Kola. The youngest patient was 31 and the oldest删除4:<u> 66</u>. The affected population consisted of 82.1% men and 17.9% women. The extracted blood was sent to the Department of Microbiology， UKC RS Banja Luka for serological testing for Q-fever.\n\n【9】The diagnosis of Q-fever was made by detecting specificantibodies by日 enzymeeimmunoassay(ELISA，Virion-Serion， Wiitzburg， Germany). Specific IgM and IgG antibodies to the C. burnetii phase2 antigens， which appears in the acute phase of the disease， and specific IgG antibodies to the C. burnetii phase 1 antigens， which are indicative of the chronic form in addition to elevated antibodies to the C. burnetii phase 2 antigens， were determined. diseases. IgM antibodies to C. burnetii phase 2 antigens as well as IgG antibodies to C. burnetii phase 1 antigens were expressed quantitatively and were considered positive if the measured extinctions were greater than the extinctions for the standard control sample that determined the assay cutoff. IgG antibodies to C. burnetii phase 2 antigens were expressed quantitatively and a titer result greater than 30 U/mL units per mL was considered a positive finding. Values of 20 U/mL to 30 U/mL were considered a borderline finding. IgM antibodies for phase 2antigens and IgG antibodies for phase 1 C. burnetii can be expressed as index values，i.e.，the ratio of the measured extinction for the serum and the extinction of the cutoff value of the test. An index value greater than 1.1 is considered positive， while the threshold score is an index value of 0.9 to 1.1.\n\n【10】Results\n\n【11】Incubation in humans ranged from two to three weeks. In sick people， the most common symptoms were elevated bodytemperature(some higher than 40C)， nausea， vomiting， diarrhea， fatigue and malaise. An elevated temperature is the dominant sign in all patients， and in most patients， it was over 39°C. Headache of high intensity， especially in the frontal part and retrobulbar， was pronounced in most of the patients. Cough as a significant sign was dry and irritating with admixtures of blood in the sputum in only one patient. Atypical pneumonia developed in 100% of patients. Liver damage manifested by elevated values of Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)， and Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (yGT) was recorded in 19 (67.8%)， 17 (60.7%)， and 10 (35.7%) of the patient. The value of aminotransferases in one patient was increased more than five times expressed in international units per ml (i.j/ml)； AST349 IU/ml and ALT 1422 IU/ml. Serological tests included testing of serum from a group of patients， taken about 10 days after the onset of the disease， in the group of patients a significant titer ofantibodies to C. burnetii was demonstrated. In the treatment， doxycycline was most often used， and in some cases， azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. All applied antibiotics and chemotherapeutics were effective in the treatment.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\nQ-fever is known in humans as primary atypical pneumonia， seven-day fever， desert fever， Balkan flu， Italian fever， Crimean fever and Cretan pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. People who work with animals， veterinarians， cattle breeders and workers in slaughterhouses are|删除段之间换行|most often exposed to the infection. During February， March and April 2016， a total of 28 patients were treated in the UKC RS Banja Luka， 21 in the Clinic for Infectious Diseases， six in the Clinic for Pulmonary Diseases and one patient for Internal Diseases.\n\n【14】The sick mostly came from the Banja Luka settlement of Laus， who came into contact with sheep infected with C. burnetii. Airborne route of infection， inhalation of contaminated dust. In this epidemic， there was contact of most people with a herd of infected sheep， and a part with a contaminated area. It is known that C. burnetii， in the form of spores， can survive for a long time in the external environment and cause disease in people who have been in contact with infected aerosol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition， it has been confirmed that Coxiella can be blown by the wind to greater distances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. The resistance of the bacterium C. burnetii to adverse environmental conditions，especially to desiccation，played a crucial role. The authors state that C. burnetii remains infectious in an aerosol for up to two weeks， and in the soil for up to five months. In dried material， the causative agent can survive from 30 to 500 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Just one C. burnetii bacterium is enough to cause disease in a susceptible person. This agent can be developed for use as a biological weapon and is considered a potential terrorist threat. Human-to-human transmission is rare. Kruszewska et al. described the possibility of sexual transmission of Q-fever in humans. The research was conducted on nine pairs of shepherds from Poland who worked seasonally in Spain. After returning to Poland， shepherds and their wives fell ill with Q-fever. C. burnetii was isolated from urine and semen samples of men. Cases of Q-fever in pregnant women have been described. Hellmeyer et al. describe placentitis and premature birth in 30%， slow fetal growth in 46%， spontaneous abortion in 22% and fetal death in the womb in 7% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Q-fever belongs to acute febrile diseases. The clinical symptoms were as follows： elevated body temperature， in some patients higher than 40°C， accompanied by fever. Other symptoms included cough， chest pain， headache， myalgias， nausea， vomiting and diarrhea， fatigue， malaise， confusional state (delirium). An X-ray of the lungs was performed in all patients upon admission to the hospital， and in 100% of patients an interstitial infiltrate was detected， located in one lung lobe (25 or 89.3%). Pleural effusion was registered in three(10.7%) patients.\n\n【16】28 or 100% of patients had an elevated CRP value. 9 or 32.1%had a CRP value of 10 mg/L to 100 mg/L， 101 mg/L to 200 mg/L 16or 57.2%， and 201 mg/L to 300 mg/L 3 or 10.7% of patients. Liver damage manifested by elevated values of aspartate aminotransferase， alanine aminotransferase， and gamma glutamyl transferase waS present in most of our patients. One third of patients， 9 of them(32.1%) had normal aminotransferases. Also， blood cultures were taken from all hospitalized patients， and sputum from some patients for bacteriological processing.\n\n【17】The disease was serologically confirmed in 28 patients. They were treated with tetracycline (doxycycline) for fourteen days， and a few patients with azithromycin and ciprofloxacin. In the initial therapy， some of the beta-lactam antibiotics were used in the majority of patients 20 (71.4%). Most of the patients were hospitalized， and some were treated on an outpatient basis. Various antibiotics (mainlybeta-lactams， quinolones， azithromycin) were administered to patients on an outpatient basis， before hospitalization， in 85.7% (24 patients)， which indicates a sometimespremature and quick decision to include antibiotics.\n\n【18】C. burnetii is innately resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides， and sensitive to tetracyclines， co-trimoxazole， rifampicin and fluoroquinolones. Mortality of untreated chronic Q-fever can be more than 65% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，8\\]</u>. Adequate antimicrobial therapy significantly reduces mortality， but the causative agent is difficult to eradicate， which is why prolonged antimicrobial therapy is needed. Monotherapy with any of these antibiotics reduces the symptoms of chronic Q-fever. According to in vitro research， inside the phagosome where C. burnetii is located is an acidic medium that may be responsible for the loss of the bactericidal properties of some antibiotics. When antimicrobial therapy is stopped， disease relapses often occur， which is why combined antimicrobial therapy is preferred 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Pebody et al. found respiratory disorders in 57% of patients with Q-fever，heart disease in 7% and hepatitis in 5%. Marrie lists headache， myalgia and pneumonia as the main symptoms of Q-fever. Connolly et al. found pneumonia in 62.8%， influenza-like illness in 24.6%，heart problems in 9% (endocarditis)， and hepatitis in1.6% of Q-fever patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>. We did not have endocarditis in our patients. No deaths were registered.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】In the differential diagnosis of unclear febrile conditions， the clinician should consider Q-fever， both acute and chronic form of the disease， especially if the patient has an indicative epidemiological history.\n\n【21】In vitro， tetracyclines， quinolones， rifampicin， co-trimoxazole and macrolides are active against C. burnetii 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，12\\]</u>， but the drug of choice in the treatment of Q-fever is doxycycline in a daily dose of200 mg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.

Half of them due to fibrosing mediastinitis and use of indwelling catheters which increase incidence of thrombosis while other causes are rare.\n\n【10】Antiphospholilpid syndrome is a thrombophilic syndrome in which venous or arterial thrombosis or both， may occur in patient with antiphospholipid antibodies positive， the diagnosis of definite antiphospholipid syndrome must include at least one clinical event of arterial or venous thrombosis and at least one ofthe laboratory criteria\\[lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin IgG or IgM antibodies， this was reported in three case at Iran Journal of Immunology通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， Spain通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>and Israel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\nTraditionally， the presence of soft thrombus in an occlusion should require prompt attempts to relieve the clot burden before deciding to treat more invasively. The presence of a thrombus should be considered in patients with acute onset of symptoms， occlusions that can easily be traversed by a wire， and when SVCS are secondary to central venous catheters. In these patients， a trial of systemic anticoagulation or， in the acute setting， thrombolysis can be attempted by using thrombolytic agents delivered at the site of the clot through a catheter， which allows more effective local action. Reports of systematic administration of thrombolytic agents have also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. By reducing the thrombus load， the length of the obstruction can often be reduced， thus reducing the number of stents needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.

Patient was clinically asymptomatic and discharged. Follow-up MRI could not be done since patient informed us on telephone that she was absolutely fine and not willing for repeat imaging.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】cited.\n\nNeuroenteric cysts are rare tumor like cystic lesions seen in spine and brain harboring heterotopic endodermal tissue. In 1928， Kubie 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> first described it as teratomatous cysts and later as intestinomas by Puuseep 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> in 1934. In 1954， the current name of Neuroenteric cyst was given|删除段之间换行|by Matson et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【20】These are benign cysts of foregut origin with endodermal lining from the incomplete dissolution of the neuroenteric canal. There are two theories which describe the origin of these cysts. First， at the time of notochordal development， failure of separation of notochord and foregut during the process of excalation leads to incorporation of endodermal cells with notochord which later becomes Neuroenteric cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. Second theory is of an endodermal diverticulum behind the oropharyngeal membrane called as Seesel pouch which may be a progenitor for midline supratentorial cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.\n\n【21】These cysts are mostly seen in the spine but can be rarely seen intra cranially. They are commonly seen in posterior fossa， anterior to brainstem， frequently in midline and sometimes in cerebellopontine angle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Histologically the intracranial Neuroenteric cysts are classified as mucin poor and mucin rich based on the content of mucin within the cyst. The mucin poor cyst shows pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium while the mucin rich cyst shows simple columnar epithelium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Few important imaging features of neuroenteric cyst have been described. Also， the imaging characteristics vary as per the content of the cyst like the mucin， a proteinaceous secretion. On Computed tomography， Mucin rich cysts appear hyperdense and mucin poor appear mildly hypodense. In MRI imaging， the protein content tends to vary the signal characteristics on T1 and T2. The lesions appears hyper intense on FLAIR sequence， predominantly hyper intense on T2W and sometimes hypo intense and on T1W it appears hyper to isointense compared to CSF. Contrast study shows no obvious contrast enhancement except at the site where the cyst is adherent with brain parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Neuroenteric cyst can be circular or lobulated and significantly hypo intense on T2W images due to presence ofhigh protein content， squamous metaplasia and keratin debris. Presence of NAA like peak at 2.02 ppm on MR spectroscopy was considered specific for these cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. This NAA like peak is supposed to be secreted by celllining of the cyst wall and contains perchloric acid or sialic acid bound to macromolecules resonating at 2.02 ppm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The main differential diagnosis of neuroenteric cyst are arachnoid cyst， epidermoid cyst， dermoid cyst rarely Rathke and colloid cyst. However imaging features can differentiate between these cysts. Arachnoid cyst is of CSF intensity on all the MRI sequences， epidermoid cyst shows restricted diffusion， Rathke and colloid cyst have different site of location. The presence of N-Acetyl Aspartate(NAA) like peak at 2.02 ppm is also considered as specific finding in neuroenteric cyst which is absent in other cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，14，15\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Similar imaging features were noted in our case. In addition we found heavily T2W sequence like CISS 3D very useful in differentiating these cysts. IN CISS sequence we can clearly define the wall of the cyst and it appears hypo intense compared to surrounding CSF with smooth wall. The wall of epidermoid cyst however can appear irregular or frond like on CISS sequence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. As a rare complication， these cysts can spontaneously leak slowly or rupture following trauma leading to aseptic chemical meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>.\n\nThe recurrentaseptic meningitis is calledasSMollaret|删除段之间换行|meningitis associated with CSF pleocytosis predominantly with polymorphonuclear cells and caused by virus however Mollaret meningitis due to slow leakage of epidermoid cyst are reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Similarly Mollaret meningitis is also reported due to slow leakage from neuroenteric cyst删除4:<u> 21</u>.\n\n【28】In a ruptured dermoid cyst， fat globules can be seen in the subarachnoid space as hyper intensities on T1 weighted images， subtle sulcal FLAIR hyper intensities and leptomeningeal enhancement on contrast study due to chemical meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Similar imaging picture can be seen in ruptured neuroenteric cyst. The chemical meningitis in neuroenteric cyst could be due to its enteric mucin contents删除4:<u> 17，19，20</u>.\n\n【29】In our case， patient initially presented with headache and vomiting probably suggesting leakage of neuroenteric cyst and aseptic meningitis however there was no obvious contrast enhancement on imaging. Subsequently，the neuroenteric cyst ruptured spontaneously during the hospital course causing chemical aseptic meningitis with sulcal and cisternal FLAIRhyperintensity and intense leptomeningeal enhancement. Following treatment with steroids， patient recovered completely within two days. Follow-up imaging showed near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst. In our knowledge this is first case， showing near total resolution of the neuroenteric cyst following spontaneous rupture without any obvious trauma. We could not get the imaging follow up of the patient but telephonic follow-up suggested that patient was asymptomatic.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】Clinical signs of headache and vomiting in a known case of neuroenteric cyst could be the warning sign of impending rupture and spontaneous rupture can occur leading to partial or complete resolution. Also CISS 3D sequence (heavily T2W) can be used additionally to further characterize the cystic lesions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

However， all these are not enough for an accurate diagnosis， being the pathology report of foremost importance for the definitive diagnosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Adrenal tumor， Adrenalectomy， Hirsutism， Hyperandrogenism， Virilization\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pure Androgen-Secreting Adrenal Tumors (PASATs) are sporadic and are often confused in clinical practice with adrenocortical carcinomas. Eighty percent occur in females and present with hirsutism， menstrual disorders， and virilization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The following is a clinical case of PASAT in a47-year-old woman，and a bibliographic search was carried out to update the evidence.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 47-year-old female patient with no relevant background presents with a history of 5 years of hirsutism and amenorrhea， intensified in the previous year， adding alopecia， increased muscle mass， and voice deepening . The physical examination reports an average weight， normal blood pressure， moderate hirsutism (18 on the Ferriman-Gallwey scoring system)， and clitoromegaly without elements of Cushing's syndrome nor acanthosis Nigricans syndrome.\n\n【7】Laboratory tests highlight the value of Total Testosterone of 937 ng/dl (reference value 8.4 to48.1)； serum Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) 331 pg/dl (reference value 56.2 to 282.9)； normal serum Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)， Luteinizing Hormone (LH)， and Prolactin(PRL)； finally， a serum cortisol level of 1.6 ug/dl was obtained after a dexamethasone suppression test.\n\n【8】Imaging\n\n【9】An abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) shows a solid nodular right adrenal mass with hypodense areas inside， 40x34x32 mm， washout of 16.3%， deemed uncharacterizable.

The total testosterone and DHEAS levels dropped to a normal range for age and sex regarding laboratory findings.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Epidemiology\n\n【18】Virilizing adrenocortical tumors are rare in adults. About 50%appear before puberty， 39% correspond to adenomas， and 80%are seen in women. They have a high chance of malignancy (70%) if virilization appears in adult women， with rapidly progressive symptoms and Cushing syndrome. This association was ruled out in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【19】According to Moreno et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， PASATs make up for 2.4% of all adrenalectomies and cause 49% of women’s virilizing syndromes. In their review of 34 patients with PASAT， Gabrilove et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> report a slight predominance ofthe right adrenal compared to the left 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【20】PASATs secrete DHEA and DHEA-S rather than testosterone. On the other hand， the predominance of testosterone tends the diagnosis towards an ovarian pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It should be noted that there are no alterations found in the patient's ovaries. Exceptionally， there are adrenal tumors that secrete only testosterone in the absence of other androgens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Clinical findings\n\n【22】The androgen excess in women clinically shows with hirsutism and progress to virilization with clitoromegaly， voice deepening， alopecia， increase of muscle mass， changes in body fat distribution， and decrease in breast volume， among others. However， other entities present similar clinical manifestations， such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)， ovarian tumors， and congenital adrenal hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. The literature has described cases of malignant PASAT patients without hirsutism. These cases could be explained by abrupt tumoral appearance， without leaving time for androgens to act on hair receptors and manifest this sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Diagnosis\n\n【24】A biochemical confirmation， using DHEAS and increased total testosterone (12-fold above the upper limit of normal range orients to malignancy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> will confirm the clinical suspicion. Some authors suggest that dynamic tests should be performed， such as dexamethasone androgen suppression test for establishing a differential diagnosis between an adrenal tumor and other causes of hyperandrogenism. A decrease in post-dose androgens of at least 40%allows the identification of non-tumor pathology with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 88%， given that adrenal tumors secrete androgens autonomously without ACTH regulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Diagnosing PASATs in males represents a challenge for the clinician since they are only evident when the peripheral androgen-to-estrogen conversion is present 8\\].\n\nImaging diagnostic tools include abdominal CT as the initial approach，followed by MRI or 18F-FDG PET-CT. This last technique reveals its usefulness in evaluating intratumoral metabolic rate通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. In our case， due to the CT characteristics and the equipment's availability， an 18F-FDG PET-CT was requested， and it revealed low|删除段之间换行|intratumoral metabolism.\n\n【27】PASATs are almost always large-sized， which is not surprising since the adrenal glands secrete few androgens compared to virilizing ovarian tumors， which are often small and may even be hidden通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The maximum diameter of the adrenal mass typically predicts malignancy； however， in PASATs， the size does not always correlate with malignancy probability. A series of 9 cases presented by Tong et al. described two adenomas exceeding 9 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Unlike adrenal carcinomas， which generally have a larger size， the literature usually reports that most adrenal adenomas are less than 4 cm to 6 cm in diameter， confusing the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【28】In addition to the size， the classic imaging features that guide us to tumor benignity， such as the lipid-rich nature (Hounsfield units <10) or a contrast wash-out >60% of the 10-min protocol， also generate confusion， since the PASATs do not always comply with them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Treatment\n\n【30】The surgical approach is recommended in all functioning adrenal tumors. Some authors recommend the open approach in tumors larger than 10 cm with or without suspected malignancy.Otherwise， the laparoscopic approach may be considered. Complete surgical removal is the key to a good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，14\\]</u>. Finally， the definitive diagnosis will be established through the pathologic report of the surgical specimen， using the Weiss criteria  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Regarding the follow-up， Moreno et al. did not show an increase in androgen levels or post-surgical tumor relapse in their series of11 benign PASAT patients， who were followed for an average of 17years 3\\].\n\n【32】In summary， our case presents a 47-year-old female， without previousillness，who had a progressiveclinicalcourse OI hyperandrogenism and virilization and was diagnosed as a PASAT with no evidence of malignancy in the right adrenal gland， and an adenoma in the left adrenal gland. She had an excellent post-surgical evolution and no clinical， biochemical，or structural recurrence than the different case series findings. Provided a contralateral adenoma， a clinical follow-up is proposed， requesting a new image in case of recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】PASATs are rare tumors that predominate in the female sex. The diagnosis is achieved by clinical suspicion with signs of hyperandrogenism andvirilization， elevatedserum androgen levels， and imaging evidence of adrenal tissue lesion. Nevertheless， these elements are not enough to make an accurate diagnosis，being the pathological report of foremost importance for the definitive diagnosis. The 18F-FDG PET-CT is a new diagnostic tool to take into account to assess tumor characteristics. Surgical treatment is the gold standard， and the approach will depend on the size and tumor characteristics. The pathological report will determine the medium and long-term prognosis.\n\n【35】Recommendations\n\n【36】PASATs must be considered when a differential diagnosis for female patients with hyperandrogenism and virilization is made It should be emphasized that a significant increase in serum total testosterone is not always associated with ovarian pathology. After surgical treatment and in search of new manifestations of hyperandrogenism， it is suggested to carry out clinical and laboratory follow-up every six months in the first year， and further on， a clinical follow-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Ackerman described it for the first time in the Otorhinolaryngology field in 1948 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Verrucous carcinoma occurs most frequently in the nasal cavity， esophagus， vulva， vagina， anorectal region， penis， and skin. It is very rare in the urinary tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Very few cases of verrucous carcinoma have been reported in the bladder， mainly related to schistosomiasis infection. Renal verrucous carcinoma was first reported in a horseshoe kidney by Sheaff in 1996 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. To our knowledge， only six cases of verrucous carcinoma of the renal pelvis have been published previously； all of them were treated by radical nephrectomy or even nephroureterectomy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>. In contrast， this case presents the first verrucous carcinoma in a renal calyceal diverticulum. Moreover， it was successfully treated by nephron-sparing surgery for the first time.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 60-year-old man with a clinical history of renal lithiasis was referred to our consultation of lithiasis due to small calculus located in the left kidney . He was operated on for small calculilocated in the lower calyceal diverticulum of the left kidney via Retrograde Intrarenal Surgery(RIRS) and micro-percutaneous (PNL). During the surgery， the calyceal diverticulum was accessed and multiple small calculi (2 mm to 3 mm) were removed. Methylene blue showed the existence of communication between the renal pelvis and the diverticulum， but direct endoscopic visualization was not possible. During the follow-up， a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan was performed. A well-defined cystic lesion measuring 4.2 cm x 6 cm x 4.6 cm was observed in the posterior valve. The cystic lesion was mainly intrarenal with small eccentric growth. The MRI report described that the lesion could be a complicated calyceal diverticulum， without ruling out the coexistence of urothelioma or squamous tumor. After all， surgical resection of the lesion was decided. Through a subcostal incision， the left kidney was freed from the upper pole to the lower pole. The cystic tumor was identified at the posterior valve of the interpolar region. The lesion was removed without ischemia time. During the surgery， an opening of the diverticulum to the urinary tract was identified. The opening appeared to be a tubular structure communicating with the lesion with abundant cesium material coming out. The urinary tract was successfully closed. The patient had a favorable evolution at the hospital， presenting febrile peaks with negative cultures during the immediate postoperative period. He was discharged on the fifth postoperative day after a full course of antibiotics was completed.\n\n【4】Thepathological study confirmed the existence ofan exo-endophytic，acantholytic，papillomatous neoplasm composed of keratinizing squamous epithelium with mild atypia and expansive growth. The tumor focally invaded the medullary renal parenchyma in the form of small nests with increased cellular atypia and keratinization. The pelvic-calyceal epithelium was completely replaced. The renal parenchyma adjacent to the tumor shows signs of atrophy. The pathological diagnosis was a verrucous carcinoma with a focus on well-differentiated infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma. The margins were free of tumor.\n\nSince the date of surgery， the patient has been followed up with imaging tests. A new Computed Tomography (CT) scan was performed every 3 months for the first 12 months. Then， a CT scan was done every 6 months and finally， an annual CT scan is being performed free of tumor recurrence in|删除段之间换行|the last 5 years . Adjuvant treatment has not been required.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\nVerrucous carcinoma is a very rare subtype of squamous cell carcinoma. It is used to designate a specific histological appearance of well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It also shows extensive keratinization with exophytic or papillomatous extension into the stroma and the absence of significant cellular atypia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Verrucous carcinoma occurs most frequently in the nasal cavity，|删除段之间换行|esophagus， vulva， vagina， anorectal region， penis， and skin. It is very unusual in the urinary tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Some risk factors include urinary tract infections， especially bilharziasis， or chronic inflammation， due to urinary lithiasis in 40% to 80% of cases； other factors include tobacco， coffee， phenacetin， and organic solvents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. All this leads to chronic irritation that causes squamous metaplasia which may eventually progress to carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The average age of onset of verrucous carcinoma in urinary tract is about fifty-six years old； there is no predominance of men， unlike transitional cell carcinomas通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The clinical symptomatology is non-specific， patients mainly present with hematuria and occasionally lumbar pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Verrucous carcinoma has a good prognosis because of its characterization of local infiltration with a slight tendency to metastasize to regional lymph nodes or distant sites， unlike epidermoid carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A few cases of verrucous carcinoma have been reported in the bladder related to schistosomiasis infection， but only six cases are described in the kidney . Due to verrucous carcinoma may present extensive adjacent squamous metaplasia and coexistence with the squamous variant of carcinoma， a radical treatment was performed in previously reported cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>.\n\n【8】To our knowledge， only six cases of verrucous carcinoma of the renalpelvis have been previously reported in the literature. In all these six cases， lithiasis may have been the cause of chronic inflammation. The average age at diagnosis has been fifty-five years old. Reviewing the cases reported in the literature about verrucous carcinoma in the renal pelvis previously， a higher prevalence in men than women can be found. None of the patients with verrucous carcinoma presented urinary tract anomalies， apart from the first patient who had horseshoe kidney 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition， in all cases published so far in the literature， the tumor was located in the renal pelvis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u> and only one case in pelvis and ureter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The present case is the first one\n\n【9】Table 1： Patients with verrucous carcinoma of the renal.\n\n|  | Age  | Sex  | Anomaly in tract urinary  | Location of lesion  | Treatment received  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sheaff et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>  | 41  | M  | \\+ (horseshoe kidney)  | Renal pelvis  | Heminephrectomy  | 6 months， NED  |\n| Sellami-Boudawara et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>  | 61  | M  |  | Renal pelvis  | Radical nephrectomy  | 5 years， NED  |\n| Sellami-Boudawara et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>  | 56  | M  | 一  | Renal pelvis  | Nephroureterectomy  | Died  |\n| Kansal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>  | 64  | F  |  | Renal pelvis  | Radical nephrectomy  | 2 years， NED  |\n| Basekioglu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>  | 56  | M  | 一  | Renal pelvis  | Radical nephrectomy+RT+CT  | 3 years， Died  |\n| Hung WH et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>  | 53  | M  |  | Renal pelvis and ureter  | Nephroureterectomy +RT  | 3 months， NED  |\n| Present case  | 60  | M  |  | Calyceal diverticulum  | Partial nephrectomy  | 5 years， NED  |\n\n【11】where a verrucous carcinoma was detected in a renal diverticulum. Moreover， the present case is the first one to be successfully treated with nephron-sparing surgery. All previously reported cases of verrucous carcinoma were treated by radical nephrectomy or even nephroureterectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Partial nephrectomy surgery was revealed to be as effective as radical nephrectomy in patients with verrucous carcinoma without poor prognostic data (such as usual epidermoid carcinoma， poorly differentiated tumor， and affected surgical margins). In the cases of the previous studies where the patient died， positive surgical margins or poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma were present. These two features were related to the aggressiveness of the tumor. In spite of a radical nephrectomy being performed， both patients died of metastatic disease in the next few days after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. None of the remaining cases presented any evidence of poor tumor prognosis， and a simple nephrectomy was performed successfully 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. The present study is included in this second group， where characteristics of poor tumor prognosis were notpresent. It shows that a partial nephrectomy can be performed rather than a radical nephrectomy if there is no evidence of verrucous carcinoma aggressiveness characteristics.\n\nIn summary， the present case is the first report of verrucous carcinoma located in a calyceal diverticulum. It is also the first report of nephron-sparing surgery performed on a patient with verrucous|删除段之间换行|carcinoma with no poor prognostic factors. The patient has been free of disease for 5 years. However，there is not enough evidence to affirm that a nephron-sparing surgery treatment can be done in patients with verrucous carcinoma and the absence of poor prognosis factors instead of radical nephrectomy. More experience is needed to affirm that.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The cardiovascular risk factors and cardiotoxicity control remains challenging， since drug interactions may result in significant clinical events.\n\n【2】Methods： This study describes a cardiotoxicevent causedby syncope-related sinus pause，exacerbated or resulting from the use of thalidomide in a patient during multiple myeloma treatment.\n\n【3】Results/Discussion： A 63-year-old male submitted to VAD (vincristine， doxorubicin and dexamethasone) chemotherapy for multiple myeloma. After six months， the patient underwent a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)， first with thalidomide，evolving with successive syncopal episodes(Stokes-Adams syndrome)， one of which resulted in traumatic brain injury， with a fracture in the left temporoparietal region. A 24-h Holter showed 2 pause episodes of more than 2 sec， the longest being 18.5 sec，not associated with symptoms. It is known that patients submitted to chemotherapy are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Preventive measures should be part of clinical management， in order to prevent ventricular damage and the occurrence of other phenomena.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The use of thalidomide requires monitoring bradyarrhythmia's and syncope. Medication with greater tolerability， such as lenalidomide，should beincreasingly prescribed，thereby avoiding undesirable clinical situations that may directly affect patient morbidity and mortality.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】The demographic and epidemiological transition process that occurred in Brazil and the world in the last century changed the profile of the most prevalent diseases. Increased life expectancy and improvement in certain aspects of the health-disease process led to a reduction in infectious and parasitic diseases， with a rise in the incidence of neoplastic diseases. Thus， neoplasm's that accounted for around 3% of overall deaths in 1930， increased proportionally to 12% in the mid-1980s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【7】There have been important advances in the area of medicine， with new drugs and treatments to manage these diseases. On the other hand， new drug interactions may result in a significant clinical event in the follow-up of this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This can be particularly relevant given the need to control cardiovascular comorbidities prevalent in survivors.\n\n【8】One of the concerns with the use of antineoplastic agents is the potential for cardiotoxicity. This clinical entity is defined by confirmation of new clinical cardiovascular alterations during or after antineoplastic treatment and/or change in biomarkers and/or cardiac imaging tests， provided other etiologies have been excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Multiple myeloma， a malignant disease of the hematopoietic system， was one of the neoplasm's whose natural history was modified. Despite still being incurable， the therapeutic arsenal has been broadened.\n\n【10】The aim of this study was to describe a cardiotoxic event caused by syncope-related sinus pause， exacerbated or caused by the use of thalidomide in a patient being treated for multiple myeloma.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\nA 63-year-old male was referred to the cardio-oncology outpatient facility due to hypertension after the onset of VAD (vincristine， doxorubicin and dexamethasone) chemotherapy to treat multiple myeloma. There were no cardiovascular symptoms at that time. The patient was using10 mg/d of amlodipine and 50 mg/d of metoprolol tartrate. Physical examination showed a good overall state， pallor， FC I with BP= 44 mmHg x 86 mmHg， HR= 84 bpm， and RR=22 ipm. CMR|删除段之间换行|at 3T， with 4S， A2 hyperphonesis and mitral regurgitation murmur(+/6+). No systemic or pulmonary congestion or other disorders were detected.\n\n【13】ComplementaryEexaminations atfollow-upshowed an electrocardiogram with siniis rhythm，left-axis deviation， electrically inactive lower wall area， and QTc of 426 msec . Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed grade I diastolic dysfunction， with preserved systolic function (LVEF=69%)， and no change in segmental contraction. Due to the high risk of cardiotoxicity， the anti-hypertensives were replaced by 20 mg/d of enalapril and 6.25mg/d of carvedilol. There was good tolerance to increasing doses of carvedilol up to 50 mg/day.\n\n【14】After six months， the patient was submitted to a Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)， with thalidomide as part of the BMT hematology protocol， evolving with successive syncopal episodes (Stokes-Adams syndrome)， one associated with traumatic brain injury and a fracture in the left temporoparietal region. At this time， the physical examination was similar to that of the first consultation， with controlled blood pressure， no postural hypotension or other disorders， and CMR with 4S. The electrocardiogram exhibited the same pattern as those previously obtained .\n\nThe 24-h Holter showed 2 pause episodes of more than 2 sec， the longest being 18.5 sec， not associated with any symptoms . After joint assessment with an Arrhythmologist， the following|删除段之间换行|diagnostic hypotheses were considered：Thalidomide-induced bradycardia， ventricular arrhythmias caused by cardiotoxicity due to the previous use of doxorubicin or vasovagal syncope resulting from a change in the antihypertensive scheme. The use of 25mcg/d of fludrocortisone was prescribed， associated with non-pharmacological measures， and the beta blocker was discontinued， while complementary diagnosis assessment progressed. Syncopal episodes persisted with similar characteristics to those previously observed.\n\n【16】The electrophysiological study to assess sinus node dysfunction was normal， as was cardiac catheterization， which demonstrated only epicardial coronaries with irregularities. The tilt test was negative.\n\n【17】Thyroidlffunctionandeelectrolyte doses remainednormal throughout follow-up. Due to the persistent syncopal episodes and the impossibility of suspending thalidomide， a definitive atrial-ventricular pacemaker was implanted， with successful episode resolution.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Syncope occurred in the patient due to a confluence of factors， including base pathology， since cancer leads to a proinflammatory state that may culminate in fibrosis and altered cardiac physiology， the side effects of his medication. The use ofthalidomide seems to be the main factor for the origin of syncope.\n\n【20】Thalidomide， an antineoplastic drug， is part of the therapeutic scheme for multiple myeloma. Its most important cardiotoxicity-related side effects are thromboembolicphenomena and arrhythmias， mainly bradyarrhythmia’s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Some studies found that thalidomide 05 could induce mild bradycardia in up to 55% ofpatients， irrespective of an association with corticosteroids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. The most severe bradycardia symptoms occur in only 1% to 3% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Numerous mechanisms are involved in1 the hemodynamic determination of cardiac arrhythmias， such as hypotension and pulmonaryhypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.\n\nFahdi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported topics that deserve attention. More than 90 patients with multiple mveloma treated with thalidomide were compared with the control group. Their concomitant use with negative chronotropic drugs， such as adrenergic beta calcium channel blockers， and antiarrhythmic drugs showed no statistically significant difference in relation to the occurrence of bradyarrhythmia's in the study patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. However， along with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide， these drugs are part of the group that pose a risk for the occurrence of bradycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. An important factor that seems to be associated with greater sinus bradycardia occurrence is the existence of concomitant hypothyroidism， which should be closely monitored 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In the patient in question， all thyroid hormone contents were normal|删除段之间换行|Electrocardiographically， bradycardia is expressedIwith no change in intracardiac conduction intervals， such as the PR， QRS and QT interval. The physiopathological mechanism remains unknown通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Fahdi et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> suggested that the basis for the occurrence of this event is the imbalance caused by thalidomide in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Thalidomide inhibits TNF alpha expression and activity， leading to complete inhibition of the dorsal motor neuron in the vagus nerve nucleus， resulting in parasympathetic hyperactivity and culminating in sinus bradycardia and other conduction disorders， such as third-degree atrioventricular block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，9，12\\]</u>.\n\n【22】It was later suggested that the harmful effect of this chemotherapy drug is dose dependent， as reported by Tamargo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， such that in patients where it could not be reduced or suspended， when severe bradycardia occurs， the typical therapeutic alternative is implanting a definitive pacemaker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，9\\]</u>. This device has increased in patients exhibiting syncopal episodes. Thangaraju et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported the occurrence of sinus bradycardia in young patients being treated for erythema nodosum leprosum， and no association with other drugs. This resulted in regression and return to basal heart rate after the drug was suspended， demonstrating that the effects are associated with higher serum concentration of the drug and suggesting the reversibility of the effects of thalidomide in sinus node function删除4-1:<u>7，9，13-15</u>.\n\n【23】In a study of patients diagnosed with stage 1 multiple myeloma， Rajikumar et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> found that at an average of 400 mg/day of thalidomide (varying from 200 mg/day to 800 mg/day)， around 26%of the patients exhibited bradycardia， showing an association with a lower heart rate. The same phenomenon was observed by Menghui\\[171， where sinus bradycardia was one of the most important side effects of thalidomide in terms of morbidity in the treatment of Crohn's disease， reinforcing the need to monitor cardiotoxicity.\n\n【24】There are now drugs with a more tolerable cardiovascular toxicity profile， including second-generation immune modulators such as lenalidomide， a thalidomide analog 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However， this drug is not available in the Brazilian public health system， since it was not included in the National List of Essential Drugs (RENAME)， last updated in 2022通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\nIt is known that patients submitted to chemotherapy are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Preventive measures should be part of clinical management， in order to prevent ventricular dysfunction and other phenomena. Although not statistically significant， according to the latest Brazilian Cardio-Oncology Guidelines， the use of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and prophylactic beta blockers is indicated， irrespective of symptomatic|删除段之间换行|or asymptomatic cardiac injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In the largest randomized clinical trial conducted to prevent cardiotoxicity using adrenergic beta blockers， specifically carvedilol， Avila et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> found no difference between the control group and placebo in relation to left ventricular ejection fraction and placebo， since there was a decline in troponin levels and diastolic dysfunction in the carvedilol group. It is important to note that in addition to their side effects， these drugs may interact with the chemotherapy drugs themselves.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】The use of thalidomide requires carefulmonitoring of bradyarrhythmia's and syncope， in addition to other cardiotoxicities. Drugs such as lenalidomide exhibit better tolerability and less interaction with therapies to control comorbidities and reduce cardiotoxicity. As such， they should be preferred to lower the risk of undesirable clinical situations and increased morbidity and mortality in this population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It is brought on by car accidents， falls， and assault. The primary insult of TBI occurs at impact， which leads to subsequent damage and a cascade of cellular processes. Other variables that contribute to subsequent TBI insult include excitotoxicity， neuroinflammation， apoptosis， necrosis， mitochondrial malfunction， and lipid peroxidation. Secondary damage during TBI must be treated in order to avoid its development and additional neurodegeneration. However， no specific drug is available to prevent secondary insult in TBI， but alternative medications such as anti-inflammatory， diuretic， and corticosteroids are preferred. There are various diagnostic markers used to confirm the injury stage and its progressions such as HMGB1， Tenascin-c，S100B proteins， ghrelin，UCHL-1，and others.

In India， the bulk of TBI cases (60%) are caused by car accidents， falls (20% to 30%)， and violence (10%)， among other things 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)， 1.7 million individuals in the United States suffer from TBI each year， with an additional 5.3 million living with TBI-related disability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is one of the most common causes of morbidity， death， and medical complications in modern countries； around 70% to 90% of TBI are moderate， and only a tiny fraction of individuals are sent to the hospital as a result， The National Institute of Health (NIH) declared in 1999 that mild TBI is a major health problem because majority of peoples suffers from post- traumatic related disabilities such as retrograde amnesia， migraine， behavioral changes， lack of attention， and neurological problems such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson's disease， the probability of PD occurrence after TBI has been increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The process behind TBI is the transmission of external stresses to brain tissue， which can induce brain damage. The main damage is produced by an impact and contusion，laceration， and diffuse axonal injury as a result of shearing， tearing， or stretching. The severity of injury is determined by the originating forces as well as the location， direction， and amount of the force 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\nAccording on the location of the damage， it can be either diffuse or focal. Focal brain injuries affect a specific part of the brain， but diffuse brain injuries can penetrate deep and impact various parts of the brain depending on the severity. Because they are caused by penetrating foreign bodies that can occasionally be left there and seriously impact the brain， skull， and cranial cavity， focal brain injuries can be acute or blunt. Similarly， diffuse brain injury is classified into two types： Cerebral contusion and diffuse axonal injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Diffuse axonal in jury will penetrate inside the skull， causing the foreign body to remain inside the brain； this is also known as penetrating injury， and it can cause further damage inside the brain and ultimately cause death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Whereas in the case of blunt focal injury， external forces play an important role， when a high acceleration force strikes the head， the brain is accelerated further， moving inside the cranial cavity and impacting on the opposite side of the skull， causing further injury on the opposite side of the skull 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Blunt damage to the rear of the|删除段之间换行|cited.\n\n【8】head， speeding the brain and smashing within the foot’s skull. Whereas diffuse brain damage is further classified into two types： Cerebral contusion and diffuse axonal injury. In the case of cerebral contusion， cerebral refers to the brain， and contusion refers to a bruise. When any tissue is damaged， the small blood vessels are disrupted， causing blood to leak out into the tissue spaces， so a contusion or a bruise is simply bleeding from small blood vessels， resulting in blood in the tissue spaces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However， in the event of diffuse axonal injuries， when an external force is applied to the head， the brain suffers from acceleration and deceleration， causing the brain's top section to move in both directions， but the brain stem part remains constant or fixed in the same position and due to the movement of the upper portion axons present in the brain stem are damaged because these axons are very sensitive to shearing， they got injured that means consciousness might still be generated because consciousness is generated from the brain stem， but when axons are injured TBI injured patient suffered from impaired consciousness and became confused 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\nTBI's pathogenic process comprises both primary and secondary brain damage. The Primary brain injury is also called phase 1 injury occurwithin minutes ofprimary insult which damage meninges， glial-limitans， and parenchyma cells of the brain such as ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate)， HMGB-1. These signals binds with the PAMP(Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern) or DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern)， Inflammation is initiated by PAMP or DAMP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. They induce inflammation to eliminate infection or for healing wounds. An example of DAMP or PAMP is TLR (Toll-Like Receptor)and Purinergicreceptor that induce immediate activation of resident myeloid cells like (Microglial cells and NALP1) that promote the generation of IL-1B and IL-18. NF-KB (Nuclear Factor Kappa B) is also activated which further induce immunological response and translocate to the nuclei of cells and persuade immunological program involving cellular proliferation and release inflammatory marker such as chemokines， cytokines， NO (Nitric Oxide) and ROS(Reactive Oxygen Species) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. NF-KB play important role as anti-|删除段之间换行|apoptotic agent， inhibit the apoptosis in TNF pathway. when TNF-a molecule bind to its TNFR1 receptor and initiate the apoptosis process by increasing the activity of SODD (Silencing of Death Domain)， but if SODD is not activated or TNF-a unable to bind with its receptor then TRAF-2 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor) is recruited on the SODD site due to which apoptosis process is skipped and we will move towards the NF-KB pathway， TRAF (TNF-Receptor Apoptosis Factor) complex further recruits IAP protein (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein) and binds with the TRAF， further TRAF also recruits rip protein(receptor-interacting protein kinases)， this IKK (Inhibitor of nuclear factor Kappa-B subunit alpha) protein has kinase activity. This IKK molecule phosphorylate Inhibitor of Kappa B (IK-BA) due to which NF-KB dislocated from IKBA and NF-KB molecule become free and able to enter inside the nucleus， drives the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and anti-apoptotic genes and cytokines production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\nAswe detect secondarybrain damage， it frequentlyprogresses from hours to months or years. It refers to the full set of phases or stages of cellular，tissue，chemical， orblood vascular alterations in the brain that may exacerbate brain tissue damage. Variables such as excitotoxicity， mitochondrial dysfunction， oxidative stress， neuroinflammation， axon degeneration， apoptotic cell death， and lipid peroxidation will all contribute to the secondary insult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It has been shown that glutamate and aspartate assist to generate cellular alterations during secondary damage. Excess glutamate after TBI is caused by a lack of glutamate re-uptake owing to glutamate transporter malfunction. Furthermore， some studies show a 40% reduction in the expression of astrocytic sodium-dependent glutamate transporters GLAST and GLT-1 within 24 h of TBI， resulting in a considerable decrease in glutamate resorption. These are excitatory amino acids that play a crucial role in the activation of both ionotropic Glutamate Receptors(iGluRs) and metabotropic Glutamate Receptors (mGluRs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor and -Amino-3-hydroxy-5-Methyl-4-isoxazole Propionate (AMPA) receptors are examples of|删除段之间换行|(iGluRs)， which are ligand-gated ion channel receptors that enable the inflow of Na+，k+， and Ca2+ upon binding to glutamate，causing membrane depolarization in neurons. Excess glutamate activates both AMPA and NMDA receptors， affecting ion homeostasis in postsynaptic neurons by increasing calcium and sodium ion influx. Glutamate activation of NMDA receptors increases the formation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Nitric Oxide (NO)， which can trigger secondary brain damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> .\n\n【11】Accumulation of Ca2+ and ROS impairs mitochondrial function， which is one of the defining events of TBI because it causes severe metabolic and physiologic abnormalities， ultimately leading to cell death. Excess calcium andiron influx into the mitochondria cause the formation of ROS， inhibit the synthesis of ATP， and depolarize the mitochondrial membrane，resulting in the breakdown of the electron transport chain and disruption of the oxidative phosphorylation process， affecting the restoration of metabolic reactions for cell survival and calcium cycle regulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. When the inner membrane protein Adenine Nucleotide Translocator (ANT) interacts to cyclophilin D， the conformational shift causes the mPTP to open， increasing the inner membrane permeability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. TBI contains particular proteins that target mitochondrial activity， causing mitochondria to enlarge by spilling apoptotic effectors over the mitochondrial membrane. These proteins are tiny mitochondria-derived activator caspases that are released into the cytosol and attach to the inhibitor of apoptosis protein， preventing apoptosis inhibition. Furthermore， cytochrome C is released from the mitochondria， where it binds to APAF-1 and ATP to form apoptosomes. These apoptosomes then cleave pro-caspase into caspase 3， resulting in cell death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Preclinical TBI Biomarkers\n\nBiomarkers are biological substances present in the blood and other bodily fluids that can play an essential role in providing|删除段之间换行|objective and quantitative information regarding the process behind neurological impairments and the degree of the damage. In the case of TBI， biomarkers such as HMGB1， S100B protein， MMP (Matrix Metalloproteins)， TIMP， LGALS3， ghrelin， UCHL-1， Tenascin-C， and HSP proteins are utilized to aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of the condition.\n\n【14】Role of HMGB1 protein in TBI\n\nHMGB1 (High Mobility Group Box-1) is a ubiquitous nuclear protein that is an architectural chromatin-binding factor that can be involved in the maintenance of nucleosomes as well as the regulation of gene transcription 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. It has two DNA binding domains known as the A and B box domains. A box has a binding site for the HMGB1receptor， but the B box has been identified as a pro-inflammatory domain， suggesting that it might be a functional biomarker of TBI通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. During the primary insult， BOX protein is produced in the form of alarmin signals from the injured meninges and parenchyma cells； these signals then bind to the DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern\\]OI PAMP(Paracrine-AssociatedMolecular Pattern\\] (Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern) TLR (Toll-Like Receptor) is an example of a DAMP. These receptors also trigger or activate microglial cells and NLRP1 (Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain)， which can accelerate the creation of an inflammasome， which initiates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and causes an inflammatory response. HMGB1 has been shown to disrupt the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)， resulting in cognitive impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. It has been observed that TBI is related with neuroinflammation and cognitive abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， and HMGB1 has been shown to increase or begin neuroinflammation. In experimental models of TBI， treatment with an HMGB1 antagonist had a positive impact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. BOX protein is released after 30 min of damage and its expression decreases between one and six hours after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. BOX protein has been linked to increased intracranial pressure in patients and the|删除段之间换行|promotion of cerebral edema following injury， with the hazardous impact of box protein aided by microglial activation. When compared to a normal control， the amount of HMGB1 following trauma increases up to thirty-fold within the first hour of damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Role of Heat Shock Protein (HSPs) in TBI\n\nHSPs are basically chaperones that allow proteins to fold and accelerate the refolding of denatured proteins. They are increased inside cells when they are subjected to extreme stress， such as heat， cold， UV radiation， or damage. In the event that a protein is substantially misfolded， HSP has the capacity to destroy it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Stress on the cells occurs during TBI as a result of a blow to the head and trauma， and at the time of the primary insult， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> these proteins are released in the form of alarmin signals and bind with the DAMP proteins， inducing a cascade of events and allowing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. HSPs are classified based on their molecular mass， and each one performs a unique set of functions. For example， HSP40 is involved in the breakdown of damaged proteins， whereas HSP70 has been shown to enhance neurological outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. It has been observed that HSP70protects brain cells from experimental brain damage during TBI， but HSP70downregulation has different results， and HSP70 activation reduces protein aggregation. HSP induction is mediated by the Heat Shock Factor (HSF)， which binds to all HSP genes. HSF is essentially a transcriptional factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Under normal settings， HSPs are found intracellularly and coupled with HSF1， but when cells are subjected to stress， such as injury or trauma， this causes protein dissociation from HSF， causing these HSPs to linktothe denatured proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.HSP70overexpression decreased the degree of brain bleeding and Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) disruption， which will lessen BBB damage in TBI and suppress MMP production， improving neurological outcomes通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. HSP70 also plays an important role in apoptosis， influencing the recruitment ofprocaspase 9 and Apoptosis protease factor1 (Apaf-1) and so inhibiting the intrinsic apoptotic pathway 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. It has also been discovered that HSP70 suppresses NF-kB activation， which affects the|删除段之间换行|generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Role of MMP (Matrix Metalloproteinases) and TIMP (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase) in TBI\n\n【19】MMPs are extracellular enzymes that can play a significant role in the destruction of extracellular matrix proteins， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u> they have been found in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) of TBI patients in several investigations. MMPs have a role in proper growth， wound healing. and development； they are generally released as latent enzymes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. In the event of TBI， inflammation develops， which increases BBB permeability and， as a result， the number of MMPs greatly increases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. MMP-9 (Gelatinase-B) and MMP-2 (Gelatinase-A) levels rise during injury， which can lead to BBB breakdown， while MMP-3(stromelysin-1) contributes to the degradation of BBB basal lamina and tight junction proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>. However， a larger concentration of MMP-9 has been found in the CSF of TBI patients， indicating the severity of the damage； they are an essential CSF biomarker for predicting the clinical fate of TBI patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. As a result， while a rise in MMP concentration after TBI may be advantageous， a larger concentration might have negative consequences. It has also been claimed that MMPs are implicated in subsequent brain damage. MMP-9 levels are increased in neurological disorders， and its activation causes excitotoxicity， mitochondrial malfunction， and apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. The level of MMP-9 increases on the first day of the primary injury and is increased for seven days following the insult. Its concentration is greater in the TBI patient's cerebral cortex and hippocampus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>， and it has also been observed in blood plasma. It has been suggested that a high level of MMPs leads to the development of Post-Traumatic Epilepsy (PTE)， and that inhibiting MMP-9 may bebeneficial in guarding against PTE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. The molecular mechanism of MMP and its function in TBI are . MMPs contribute to apoptosis， they activate the TNF-a which further activate TRADD and FADD， results in caspase-3 activation which induce apoptosis删除4-1:<u>41</u>.\n\nTissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinase (TIMPs) are balancing|删除段之间换行|proteins that modulate the activity of MMPs. TIMPs are classified into four kinds 通用删除7(英):<u>(1， 2， 3， 4)</u>. They all have diverse mechanisms of action and operate on different MMPs to modulate their activities， such as TIMP-1 controlling MMP-9 or MMP-3 activity and TIMP-2 inhibiting MMP-2 activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. TIMPs are dimers composed of an N-terminal domain and a smaller C-terminal domain that are stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The n-terminal domain of TIMP non-covalently binds to MMPs substrate unit at the zinc-binding site， which can be useful in inhibiting MMP activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>.TIMP-1is an inducible form whose upregulation is dependent on factors such as TGF， IL-1， IL-6， epithelial growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor， oncostatin， retinoids， etc. TIMP-1 is known to induce neuroprotective effects in the CNS by maintaining the BBB， suppressing apoptosis， and inhibiting excitotoxic cell death of neurons， whereas TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 are soluble non-glycosylated proteins that are expressed constitutively，and TIMP-3 is an insoluble protein that will bind to ECM components， and it is the only MMP that will inhibit TNF-a通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Role of ghrelin in TBI\n\nGhrelin is a peptide that is released inside the stomach. Its main function is to control food and metabolism， and it also has some neuroprotective properties. It also stimulates the production of growth hormone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Ghrelin Receptors (GHS-R1a) are situated inside the brain and trigger growth hormone release. It also has certain extra-hypothalamic neuronal activities such as learning， memory， stress， and motivation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Ghrelin has the ability to cross the BBB and has significant beneficial effects in TBI， particularly reducing the poor results of subsequent brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. Following a first injury， numerous proteins are produced，which may contribute to later brain damage such as increased apoptosis and neuronal inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. However， it has been reported that ghrelin has anti-apoptotic activity， and the mechanism behind this is that during the primary insult， proapoptotic BAX protein is stimulated and anti-apoptotic BCL-|删除段之间换行|2 protein is suppressed， causing cytochrome-C to be released from the mitochondria due to the opening of the MPTP and interacting with APAF-1 protein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. This will then interact with procaspase-9， resulting in the activation of the procaspase-9 molecule， which will then activate caspase-3， and apoptosis will begin； however， ghrelin also inhibits the activation of the BAX protein， which plays a crucial role in apoptosis. It will also activate ERK1/2， the protein kinase C pathway， and the protein kinase-A pathway， as well as enhance the production of mitochondrial Uncoupling Protein (UCP-2). Long-term inflammation is also a key source of secondary damage after TBI， although ghrelin will have a favorable impact by regulating inflammation and decreasing the production of TNF-or IL-1，making it appears to be advantageous in TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Role of galectin-3 in TBI\n\nGalectins are a protein family with 15 members， each with a unique function. Galectin-3 is one of the proteins present inside the nucleus or cytoplasm， and it will become the master regulator of inflammatory response in neurodegenerative illness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[52\\]</u>. In general， active microglial cells produce galectin-3； moreover， it is required for resident microglial activation and proliferation in response to damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u>. Galectin-3levels in plasma are linked to the severity and prognosis of severe TBI； it is involved in cell adhesion， proliferation， migration， activation， apoptosis， and phagocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54\\]</u>. Galectin-3plays an important role in the regulation of brain inflammation and neurodegeneration； its level in the CSF is significantly increased within 24 h of injury； microglial cells express this protein in the presence of brain trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>； and it has been observed that during the time of primary insult， the BBB is immediately disrupted， resulting in substantial leakage of Galectin-3 from the parenchyma cell into the CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. It will bind to the Toll-Like Receptors (TLR)， which are DAMP (Damage-Associated Molecular Pattern) that will induce activation of microglial cells， resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1， TNF-， and NF-kB， which|删除段之间换行|can further promote neurodegeneration， so neutralizing antibodies against Galentin-3 provide a beneficial effect， inhibiting the activation of microglial cells and the formation of inflammatory cytokines and promotes neuroprotection in head injury. TLR receptor inhibition has also been shown to be advantageous. According to research， Galactin-3 acts as an alarmin signal in TBI， and a high quantity of Galectin-3 in the CSF suggests a significant degree of damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Role of S100B protein in TBI\n\n【26】S100B protein is a calcium-binding protein present in the cytoplasm that is involved in a variety of activities such as cell differentiation and cell cycle progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>. It is an essential blood biomarker protein that plays a key role in TBI after the primary insult， these proteins are quickly released from the injured glial cell into the circulatory system， and it is an important tool that may be utilized as a proxy of imaging in TBI in contrast to MRI.\n\n【27】The mechanism underlying S100B in TBI is that during the primary insult， the BBB is damaged， causing S100B to be immediately released from the damaged glial cells. Following this， microglial cells are activated， and ROS production begins， which increases the production of proinflammatory cytokines and may lead to cell death and neuronal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>. It also increases RAGE signaling activation in neurons， which can lead to neuronal death. Changes in the expression of this marker have been linked to the severity of the injury and neurological consequences. It has been observed that in patients with severe damage， the concentration of S100B in blood is greater than 1.13 ng/ml， which is associated with an increase in mortality and morbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Role of UCHL-1 in TB\n\n【29】Ubiquitin C-terminal hydroxylase is a blood biomarker protein that is present mostly in neurons throughout the brain after TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>. It can be used to detect the severity of injury because it is a promising TBI biomarker that belongs to the family of deubiquitinating enzymes that recycle ubiquitin monomers and has the ability to promote the aggregation of a-synuclein， during the time of injury neurons are injured and then UCHL-1 are released into the CSF， it can also be detected in the systemic circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u>. UCHL-1 shows some favorable effects， such as mending the axons or neurons after injury by eliminating the aberrant protein via ubiquitin-proteasome pathway， which can keep the axons intact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63\\]</u>. During the time of brain injury， various unpleasant lipid proteins are released， such as cyclopentenone and prostaglandin， which interact with the UCHL-1and hinder its activity. It has been shown that after moderate TBI， only a temporary increase in the level ofUCHL-1 has been seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u>， however in severe TBI， the level of UCHL-1 in CSF is too high， and the level ofthis protein in the CSF or serum may be measured within7 h to 9 h after severe TBI. It can be identified by using the sandwich ELISA technique， and it is an essential biomarker that may be used to distinguish between minor and severe TBI. The half-life time(t1/2) of UCHL-1 in mTBI is around 7 h， but that of severe TBI is approximately 10 h通用删除6(英):<u>\\[64\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Role of Tenascin-C in TBI\n\nTNCs are matricellular proteins that are important inducers of inflammatory cascades in response to various stimuli and tissue injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u>. TNCs， which are MCPs (Multicellular Proteins)， are significantly expressed throughout embryonic development. Theyare triggered by glial cells and astrocytes and play a vital part in brain development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[66\\]</u>， performing a range of activities including as|删除段之间换行|neuronal progenitor cell maturation， cell proliferation， proper CNS development， and maintaining synaptic plasticity， among others.\n\n【32】TNC levels have been significantly increased in brain parenchyma cells such as neurons and astrocytes during TBI， indicating multiple deleterious events such as BBB disruption， apoptosis， activation of the MAPK pathway， and NF-KB pathway activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u>， which can further increase the severity of the injury. It will also raise the likelihood of first injury， which may increase the likelihood of subsequent damage. TNC will activate the TLR-4 receptor， which is basically a DAMP signal， which will further induce the activation of the microglial cells and inflammasomes， which will promote the generation of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-1and NF-KB， which can promote the generation of ROS and enhance the inflammation通用删除6(英):<u>\\[68\\]</u>. TNC will also upregulate the production of MMP-9 by activating the MAPK pathway， resulting in secondary brain damage. Excitotoxicity， mitochondrial malfunction， and apoptosis will follow\\[691. Patients with TBI had increased TNC levels in their CSF and plasma， indicating severe TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[70\\]</u> .\n\n【33】Role of tau protein in TBI\n\n【34】Tau protein is a microtubule-associated protein that is found in the neurons and helps in maintaining the morphology of neurons， they will play important role in signal transduction or vesicular transport 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[71\\]</u>. The normal physiological function of tau protein is to promote the formation of microtubules. It will undergo post-translational changes， such as phosphorylation， which is essential for their proper functioning and is controlled by the balance of kinase and phosphatase activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72\\]</u>. This will affect the affinity of microtubules binding. Tau proteins become hyperphosphorylated during TBI because the microtubule by which tau protein binds is disintegrated during primary injury， resulting in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein， which accumulate inside the brain and increase a cascade of events that show harmful effects such as increased oxidative stress because mitochondria is damaged and ROS formation is increased 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[73\\]</u>. Tau proteins will also boost glutamate activation via the NMDA receptor， resulting in an increase in calcium influx into the cell， which will exacerbate excitotoxicityand neuronal death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[74\\]</u>. It also activates glial cells， which can boost the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-a. These cytokines further exacerbate neuroinflammation， which eventually leads to neuronal death. These variables occur because tau protein hyperphosphorylation ameliorates subsequent damage in TBI while eventually worsening the situation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[75\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Diagnostic techniques for TBI\n\nDiagnosis of TBI is itselfa chalengingtaskbecausein TBI different signs and symptoms have been seen with respect to time and different diagnostic techniques have been implemented， the mildness of injury is difficult to identify. Patients suffering from TBI report complex neurocognitive， neuropsychological， and physical symptoms these symptoms differ with respect to the severity of injury (e.g.， dizziness， motor problem，blurred vision，irritability， sensitivity to noise or light， the problem with memory or concentration， transient neurological abnormalities， sleep disturbance， nausea and behavioral/emotional symptoms (e.g.， depression， anxiety， aggression， impulsivity). whereas in case of severe TBI symptoms have been worsened like loss of consciousness， severe headache， short term memory loss， seizures or convulsions， coma， locked-in syndrome， and brain herniation have been seen. Therefore， clinicians have evaluated the severity of the injury and facilitate the diagnostic management for each patient|删除段之间换行|different diagnostic tool have been employed and practically used for the assessment of TBI \\[761.\n\n【37】Evaluation of Consciousness\n\n【38】Different tools have been used to check the level of consciousness.\n\n【39】Glasgow coma scale\n\n【40】The Glasgow coma scale is a useful instrument for providing an initial evaluation score by monitoring a persons degree of consciousness following a TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[77\\]</u>. GCS evaluates a patient's ability to do the visual movement， motor movement， and verbal test； these three characteristics assist clinicians in determining the severity of the damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[78\\]</u>. GCS scores range from 1 to 15， if the patient score is 1to 3， it indicates that the patient's condition is worsening or that the injury is more severe because the patient is completely unconscious\\[791. If the patient score is 13 to 15， it indicates that the patient has a mild TBI and is not in danger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[80\\]</u>； with the help of this scoring scale， clinicians can determine the severity of the injury.\n\n【41】Evaluation of Cognitive Function\n\n【42】For assessment of cognitive function different tests have been conducted like-\n\n【43】King-Devick test\n\n【44】King-Devick is a concussion screening test used to assess the patient's cognitive health because after TBI， the hippocampus， also known as the memory store， is disrupted， resulting in post-injury cognitive impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[81\\]</u>. If the patient's cognitive function is disrupted， it indicates the severity of the damage because it has been seen that in severe TBI， cognitive or memory function is impaired删除4-1:<u>82</u>.\n\n【45】The doctor analyses the patient’s cognitive performance with the assistance of this KD test， which consists of several cards with numbers printed on them， and the patient reads the number aloud. This test takes less than 2 min to complete， and the clinician scores the patient based on the time required.\n\n【46】Evaluation ofMotorFunction\n\n【47】Balance Error Scoring System (BESS)\n\n【48】BESS is an important tool for evaluating the patient's postural stability and motor function； in this subject， perform some simple activities such as opening the eyes， falling out of the initial position， movement of the hands， lifting the toes， remaining out of the same position for more than 5 sec， simply walking in a straight line， and so on. Clinicians use these functions to assess the patient's motor function and postural stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[83\\]</u>.\n\n【49】Blood biomarker analysis\n\nThese are crucial tools in the diagnosis of a TBI. Using these blood biomarker tests； clinicians may quickly evaluate the degree of the damage and the status of the TBI. Various biomarker analyses， such as levels of S100B， MMPs， HMGB1， TAU protein， and Galentin-3， can be performed. If the level of these protein biomarkers in the bloodstream significantly increases， it indicates the severity of the injury because these protein biomarkers are somehow involved in the injury， some of which are released from the damaged cell and further ameliorate the injury condition， and some of which are involved in worsening the primary injury to secondary injury and at that time通用删除6(英):<u>\\[84\\]</u>. These biomarkers are released into the bloodstream or CSF by blood plasma analysis. These proteins are identified in an excessive|删除段之间换行|amount， indicating the severity of the damage， and are utilized as a diagnostic tool.\n\n【51】Neuroimaging for diagnosis of TBI\n\n【52】Neuroimaging techniques can be used for the diagnosis of brain injury these are of various types and they will provide injury status of the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[85\\]</u>，andtheamount of injury received by the brain generally Computed Tomography (CT)， Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)， Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[86\\]</u>. CT is a widely used neuroimaging technique for the diagnosis of brain injury because it is a fast and highly accurate process in the detection of skull fracture and hemorrhage， it is generally indicated for moderate and severe TBI where GCS score is less than or equals to 12 (GCS ≤ 12) and for the patient who is suffering from persistent headache， seizures， amnesia， loss of consciousness， etc. CT is able to reflect the size， shape， and distribution of the brain tissue， but there is a limitation with the CT that it is unable to detect all types of brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[87\\]</u>\n\n【53】The second widely used neuroimaging technique is MRI， it can provide detailed information of the concussion， tissue injury， and hemodynamics， by the help of MRI clinician is able to detect the minute bleeding， contusion or it is able to detect changes in the brain function. Nowadays PET imaging technique has increased attention clinically in detecting the condition of the brain after TBI in this radiotracer is used to detect the injury generally， Fluorodeoxyglucose(FDG) is the most widely used radiotracer， by the help of (PET) clinicians are able to analyze a single biomarker like TAU protein level in the brain， amyloid-B level， etc.， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[88\\]</u>.\n\n【54】Current drug therapy used in TBI\n\n【55】TBI is a serious problem all over the world. Generally， at the time of impact， primary injury occurs， which is unpreventable； however， if the patient remains untreated or undiagnosed，the condition worsens and leads to secondary brain injury， which is the leading cause of death； various factors are involved in secondary injury， which can exacerbate the injury.\n\n【56】Many drugs that can undergo clinical trials and have the ability to reduce the incidence and disastrous effect of secondary injury， many of them inhibit secondary injury and increase the chance of the patient becoming healthy， these are some drugs that can be used in TBI like N-acetyl cysteine， minocycline，phenserine， progesterone， Erythropoietin， Glibenclamide、 Iminocycline， propranolol， Tranexamic acid， Valproic acid， simvastatin， Cyclosporine.\n\n【57】N-acetyl cysteine\n\n【58】N-acetyl cysteine is a key neuroprotective drug thatTcan increase the level of GSH in the brain because GSH possesses (ROS) scavenging characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[89\\]</u>.NAC will also lower Tau proteins and amyloid-deposition in the brain and serve as an anti-inflammatory agent. NAC will enhance cognitive performance and alleviate mild TBI symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[90\\]</u>.\n\n【59】Minocycline\n\n【60】Minocycline (MINO))isanantibiotic thatwill exhibit neuroprotective activity in TBi. In a TBI rat model，(MINO) will treat the neurological deficits caused by TBI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[91\\]</u>. MINO is also known to decrease microglial activation and IL-1 release， both of which can contribute to an inflammatory response and exacerbate damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[92\\]</u>. It will also diminish TBI-induced locomotor abnormalities， which will enhance long-term results post-TBI. At a dosage of 100 mg BID for 7 days， MINO will drastically lower S100B and NSE levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9331\\]</u>.\n\nCyclosporine A|删除段之间换行|Cyclosporine is a commonly used immunosuppressant medicine with a neuroprotective effect because CsA suppresses apoptosis and the mitochondrial permeability transition pore， preventing mitochondrial damage after TBI， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[94\\]</u> CsA’s neuroprotective impact is dose-dependent， and its therapeutic window lasts up to 24 h after damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[95\\]</u>. When CsA is taken early after a severe TBI， it has an excellent activity and safety profile， and it also reduces lesion volume.

Morbidity results from frequent cutaneous and respiratory pyogenic infections or from an accelerated phase. Most patients undergo a variable period of recurrent infections before going into the accelerated phase. Therefore， primary presentation in the accelerated phase is unusual\\[21.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】Our patient was born at full term to consanguineous parents after normal pregnancy and labor. She was normal at birth and her symptoms began at the age of two years when she started having progressive abdominal distension， associated with fever and loss of appetite for about 1 month before seeking medical advice. Parents and siblings； 2 sisters and 4 brothers are healthy； they have neither fair skin nor blond hair. One sibling with fair skin and silvery hair was died due to similar disease. The onset of his illness was started at 3 months of age with recurrent chest infections， developed accelerated phase and died at the age of 1.5 year.\n\n【6】On examination she had fair skin and blond hair with photophobia and nystagmus. Her weight and height were at 3d percentile. Chest was clear. Abdominal examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly. Ophthalmic examination showed pale retina and papilledema bilaterally. Lab investigations results were anemia (HB=6)， platelet =27， WBC=6 with neutropenia， ESR=40，\n\n【7】cited.\n\n【8】normal RFT， elevated liver enzymes and hypergammaglobulinemia. Microscopic examination of Wright-stained blood and bone marrow films showed giant granules of leukocytes and their precursors respectively whereas large clumped melanosome were seen by hair examination； confirming the diagnosis of CHS. On the basis of the clinical presentation， hematologic， and cytological findings， a diagnosis of accelerated phase of CHS was made. Molecular testing could not be performed due to unavailability. Patient was treated with antibiotics， ascorbic acid and blood transfusion. Currently the patient is under observation with continued symptomatic treatment.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】CHS is a lysosomal disease in which there is aberrant fusion of primary lysosomes with gross enlargement oflysosomes in all tissues. The mutated gene for CHS， lysosomal trafficking regulator is located at chromosome 1q2-q44 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The exact incidence of CHS is unknown， less than 500 cases have been reported worldwide in the past 20 years通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The pathologic hallmark of CHS is the presence of giant lysosomal granules in the myeloblasts and promyelocytes of the bone marrow and in white blood cells of peripheral blood. The inclusions in melanocytes and keratinocytes consist of clumped melanosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【12】CHS can be diagnosed prenatally by examining a sample of hair from a fetal scalp biopsy or testing leukocytes from a fetal blood sample 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Patients with CHS exhibit hypopigmentation of the skin， hair and eyes， possibly secondary a feedback inhibition of melanin synthesis， which results from accumulation and clumping of melanosomes(Destruction of the giant melanosomes may dilute skin color. However， abnormal packing of normal-sized melanosomes into large lysosome-like structures in the epidermal cells may provide a more likely basis for the hypopigmentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Other features include photophobia and nystagmus， easy bruisability and peripheral neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our casehad fair skin andblondhair sincebirth unlikeherrelative parents and siblings but similar to her died brother， bone marrow and peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in leukocyte precursor cells and leukocyte respectively. Hair examination under light microscope showed large clumped melanosome. She had no bleeding history but had photophobia， nystagmus， pale retina and papilledema most probably is due to infiltration of the optic nerve by lymphocytic cells.\n\n【15】Cell-mediated defect including deficient natural killer cell activity， humoral immune response abnormalities as well as impaired neutrophil chemotaxis and neutropenia in CHS leads to increased susceptibility to infections. Infections are most commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus and B-hemolytic streptococci. Approximately85% of patients develop an accelerated phase which is usually fatal. The widespread visceral infiltration of lymphohistiocytic cells gives rise to fever， jaundice， hepatosplenomegaly， lymphadenopathy， pancytopenia， a tendency to bleed and neurologic changes. Viral infections， especially with Epstein-Barr virus， could be the cause of this lymphomatous phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most patients undergo a variable period of recurrent infections before going into the accelerated phase通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Therefore， primary presentation in the accelerated phase in our patient was unuisual.\n\n【16】CHS is considered a fatal disease， death often occurs in the first decade of life as a result of overwhelming infections， hemorrhage or development of the accelerated lymphoma-like phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The treatment of CHS is difficult， and has limited to bone marrow transplantation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> although the accelerated phase may respond to etoposide plus systemic steroids and intrathecal methotrexate but the disease relapses invariably 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】We report a rare case of CHS， to the best of our knowledge， she is the first case reported from Libya. It is unusual case in that the first presentation was in the accelerated phase at 2 years of age. As bone marrow transplantation is the only solution to the disease， early diagnosis is required before the accelerated phase has developed. Genetic counseling and family education about the disease and the recurrence risk in the subsequent pregnancy is needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

SBMA is characterized by bulbar and limb muscle weakness， atrophy and fasciculation， along with endocrine abnormalities leading to gynecomastia and infertility. The incidence of SBMA is 1/30，000 male births. It is caused by the repeated expansion of CAG on the X chromosome. The age of presentation depends on the numbers of CAG repeats， with an average of 43 years and the progression of the disease is slow， an estimated 2% decrease in muscle strength per year. Diagnosis of SBMA is made by NCS and needle EMG， which are a standard part of the evaluation of motor neuron disease. SMBA is often confused with other motor neuron disease， and definitive diagnosis is always required. We present a case of a 53-year-old male who presents with leg weakness and was initially treated as lumbar radiculopathy and was later diagnosed as SBMA.\n\n【2】Keywords： Spinal and bulbar muscle atrophy； Kennedy disease； Gynecomastia\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Spinal and Bulbar Muscle Atrophy (SBMA)， frequentlyknown as Kennedy disease， is an X-linked recessive， adult-onset， progressive degenerative disease of the Lower Motor Neuron Disorders(LMND). SBMA characterized by bulbar and limb muscle weakness， atrophy， and fasciculation. The weakness could be symmetrical or asymmetrical， involving proximal and distal muscles. Also， SBMA is associated with endocrine abnormalities due to resistance to androgen， causing defective spermatogenesis leading to gynecomastia and infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【5】William Kennedy first defined SBMA as a lower motor neuron and bulbar muscle degenerative disease in 1968. The incidence is 1/30，000 male births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is caused by the repeated expansion of CAG on the X chromosome. The age of presentation depends on the numbers of CAG repeats， with an average of 43 years but varying from 18 to 64 years. Weakness in the limbs， cramping， and tremors， as well as dysarthria， dysphagia， tongue fasciculation， and nasal speech， are the most prevalent complaints. The progression of the disease is slow， an estimated 2% decrease in muscle strength per year， measured by quantitative muscle testing (QMT)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

Symptoms such as twitching of the muscle without loss of muscle strength are present in heterozygous females.\n\n【6】Since many of the clinical characteristics of SBMA are comparable to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and late-onset Tay-Sachs disease， a definitive diagnosis is always required 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Initially， he noticed difficulty in walking more than a block due to pain and weakness in his legs. Three months later， he developed pain in his lower back， and he realized that he could not lift his arms above his head at work because of weakness. He felt fatigued quickly with physical activity. His older brother reportedly had a similar weakness for some time.\n\n【9】On examination， he was alert and responsive.

He had bilateral facial weakness， more prominent around the orbicularis oculi， and there were fasciculation and atrophy of the tongue. Other cranial nerves were normal. His motor examination showed wasting of the bilateral triceps， biceps， and deltoid muscles. Fasciculation was noted in the right deltoid， biceps and triceps. The tremor was observed in both hands and chin.

Cerebellar and sensory exam was normal.\n\n【14】Diagnostic workup： MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine was ordered to evaluate possible radiculopathy given the history of back pain with weakness. MRI of the Lumbar Spine reported bilateral L5 pars defects and mild degenerative changes. MRI cervical spine showed mild to moderate degenerative spondylosis of the cervical spine with no significant focal disc herniation. Because of bulbar symptoms and facial weakness， MRI of the brain was also ordered， and it was normal. In addition，comprehensive blood work and Nerve Conduction Study (NCS)/Electromyography (EMG) was performed. Blood work was significant for mildly elevated liver enzymes and CPK. The neuropathy panel was normal， including serum and urine immunoelectrophoresis.\n\n【15】Nerve conduction study ：\n\n【16】normal peak latencies and Conduction Velocities (CVs) in the bilateral median and ulnar nerves； however， normal left radial and bilateral sural sensory responses were noted in the Lower Extremities(LE).\n\n【17】Motor Nerve Conduction Studies in multiple motor nerves in the left upper and lower extremities were normal in distal latencies， amplitudes， and CVs. There was no conduction block noted.\n\n【18】Needle EMG  performed in three limbs， and thoracic paraspinal muscles showed widespread active denervation，including fibrillation， positive waves， and fasciculation potentials. In addition， limb muscles showed large Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAPs) with increase polyphasicunits， consistent with chronicre-innervation. MUAPs recruitment was also reduced in multiple muscles.\n\n【19】In Summary， the electrodiagnostic findings showed diffuse active and chronic denervation in multiple muscles of three limbs and in the thoracic paraspinal muscles， suggested Motor Neuron Disease(MND)； however， low Sensory Nerve Action Potentials (SNAPs) are not typically seen in MNDs such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis(ALS) or its variant， Progressive Muscular Atrophy (PMA).\n\n【20】During his visit for electromyography， additional clinical examination showed gynecomastia and testicular atrophy.

Our patient was initially evaluated and treated for lumbar radiculopathy and essential tremors. His older brother probably also had SBMA； however， the diagnosis was|删除段之间换行|never confirmed. In addition， appropriate initial testing is indicated because of associated conditions in these patients， such as diabetes mellitus， lipid disorders， and other endocrine disorders.\n\n【29】Some following differential diagnoses should be considered while performing diagnostic workup or if gene testing is negative.\n\n【30】1\\.

This report aimed to highlight a rare case of tongue-base angioleiomyoma excised by TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS). A rare case report of angioleiomyoma of the tongue base in a 72-year-old man who presented with hoarseness， muffled voice and stridor. Preoperative endovascular embolization was performed owing to the high vascularity of the lesion， followed by TORS using the da Vinci Robotic System. The tumor was excised completely with minimal complications. There were no signs of local recurrence during the follow-up period. Tongue-base angioleiomyoma poses treatment challenges owing to its vascularity and difficult location. We suggest that the appropriate treatment of tongue-base angioleiomyoma should consist of embolization and tracheostomy， followed by TORS excision. To our knowledge， this is the first use of robotic minimal invasive technique for excision of angioleiomyoma in this location.\n\n【2】Keywords： Angioleiomyoma； Tongue base； Trans Oral Robotic Surgery (TORS)\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Angioleiomyoma (ALM) is a benign soft-tissue tumor originating in the smooth muscle of blood vessels. It usually measures from a few millimeters to 2 cm. As the tumor is painless and slow-growing， diagnosis may be delayed. Median age at diagnosis is 45 years； there is a small male predominance (58%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. ALM appears histologically as a well-circumscribed capsulated tumor； alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) positivity on immunohistochemistry is considered a good diagnostic marker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Treatment is by surgical excision. Recurrence is uncommon， unless the tumor was not removed completely，and prognosis is good. Malignant transformation has not been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】ALM rarely occurs in the oropharynx and oral cavity， especially the tongue base. This report describes a case of tongue-base ALM and the first use of TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) for the treatment of ALM in this location.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 72-year-old man presented with hoarseness， muffled voice， stridor， and mild dyspnea that appeared during minor physical activity， in addition to unintentional weight loss of 4 kg in the last vear. His medical history was remarkable.\n\n【8】Clinical examination revealed an oropharyngeal tongue-base lesion and an offensive smell from the oral cavity. Laryngoscopy exposed a vascular 2.6 cm mass pushing the epiglottis posteriorly and filling the vallecula inferiorly . Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) revealed an oval well-circumscribed space-occupying lesion located between the tongue base and epiglottis，hyperintense throughout and strongly enhanced on T2-weighted scans. The lesion caused partial obstruction of the oropharyngeal airways with slight asymmetry to the left . No metastases were identified.\n\nConsidering the benign appearance of the tumor and its high vascularity， a preoperative biopsy was not taken to avoid the risk of excessive bleeding which could lead to airway obstruction. Accordingly， concerns of intraoperative bleeding prompted the use of preoperative endovascular embolization， which was performed by an invasive neuroradiologist under general anesthesia. Diagnostic catheter angiography demonstrated that the left lingual artery was the sole supply source to the lesion. Therapeutic catheterization was followed by endovascular embolization using a coaxial catheter system. During navigation of the microcatheter， minor bleeding was observed from|删除段之间换行|the artery supplying the tumor and promptly stopped with liquid embolic glue. Total devascularization of the tumor-feeding artery was achieved without complications. The absence of distal obstructions was verified by iniections to the vertebral arteries.\n\nTROS was performed under general anesthesia 3 days later . Surgery was preceded by preventive tracheotomy for intraoperative protection of the airway and safer postoperative management. The|删除段之间换行|tongue base was exposed using a Crowe retractor， and visualization of the oropharynx was achieved with an 8 mm， 30-degree， three-dimensional endoscope that was inserted， facing upward， through the retractor. A 5 mm monopolar cautery and 5 mm Maryland dissector were then inserted and brought into endoscopic view. The tumor was excised en-bloc with 0.5 cm margins using the da Vinci Robotic System \\[Intuitive Surgical Inc.， Sunnyvale CA， USA). The TORS procedure took 110 min. Moderate bleeding events occurring during the procedure were managed with electrocautery， vascular clips， and biological glue； there was no excessive intraoperative bleeding or other perioperative complications.\n\n【11】The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was fed via a nasogastric tube for the first 2 days and then proceeded to soft oral intake. He was treated with antibiotics (cefamezin and metronidazole) and decannulated prior to discharge within 5 days. At the 1-year follow-up， there were no signs of local recurrence， and the stoma was closed.\n\n【12】Postoperative histopathologic examination revealed a well-circumscribed 2.3-cm ALM composed of myocytes and vascular spaces， with no nuclear atypia and low mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry staining was negative for HMB45， S100， and desmin， and positive for SMA. Ki67 proliferation index was 4% to 5%， indicating a benign neoplasm .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】We presented a case of ALM in the tongue base. To our knowledge， a few cases of tongue ALM have been described， and only several specifically in the tongue base 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The clinical differential diagnosis of ALM of the tongue includes hemangioma， lymphangioma， vascular malformation， abscess， lingual thyroid， and other benign mesenchymal tumors such as fibroma， neurofibroma， and granular cell lesion. In our case， the intense enhancement of the lesion on T2-weighted images and T1-weighted images with gadolinium pointed to a hypervascular pattern， narrowing the differential diagnosis to a vascular mass.\n\nSurgical approaches to tongue-base tumors include transoral excision， submandibular approach， suprahyoid OT lateral pharyngotomy， and lip split with mandibulotomy. For small and well-encapsulated lesions， transoral excision is preferred. However， gaining adequate access to the tongue base can be challenging owing|删除段之间换行|to its remote location and the presence of important neurovascular structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.Fan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> used an ultrasonic harmonic scalpel with an advanced hemostasis mode in 12 patients with other tongue-base benign lesions. The technique yielded good outcomes with minimum complications but was limited by lack of depth perception and low visualization ofthe surgical field with inadequate lesion exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【17】More recently， Danic et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> described two cases of tongue-base ALM， in a 76-year-old man and a 2-month-old infant， respectively， who underwent endoscopic surgery with a harmonic scalpel. Additionally， Marden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> managed a tongue-base ALM that bled vigorously during diagnostic biopsy with endovascularembolization followed one daylater byhemiglossectomy with mass resection.\n\n【18】In the present case， the vascularity of the tumor prompted our decision to perform preoperative endovascular embolization of the selective tumor-feeding branch (left lingual artery)， as described by Marden et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， followed by surgical excision. However， unlike the previous cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>， we used a TORS approach. TORS has been reported to overcome the limitations of traditional surgical methods andto improve surgeon dexterity，precision， and depthperception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. By providing three-dimensional visualization， it allows for complete tumor removal with fewer complications while preserving important structures and nerves. We found the procedure to be safe and efficient for excision of a tongue-base ALM. The main disadvantages of TORS are the relatively high operating costs and absence of tactile feedback. However， the advantages seem to outweigh the disadvantages. This report supports the use of a robotic minimal invasive technique for excision and partial glossectomy of benign lesions at the tongue base， especially vascular lesions like ALM.\n\n【19】In conclusion， we report a rare case of a tongue-base ALM that posed treatment challenges owing to its vascularity and difficult location. Treatment consisted of embolization and tracheostomy followed by TORS excision. To our knowledge， this is the first report documenting treatment of tongue-base ALM using TORS. We achieved optimal visual exposure that allowed for safe and complete tumor excision with minimal complications.\n\n【20】Acknowledgment Data availability statement\n\n【21】The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n【22】Ethics statement\n\n【23】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Advances in organ preservation， surgical techniques， and immunosuppressive agents in the past few decades have extended the life expectancy of these patients. However， the shortage of cadaveric donors remains a major concern. A Living Donor Liver Transplant (LDLT) is an option； however， the supply of donated livers is very low relative to the demand. According to the Taiwan Organ Registry and Sharing Center database， although 6，211 liver transplants were performed in Taiwan from 2005 to 2018， the organ shortage led to a long wait， with a cumulative dropout probability within 3 years of up to 24% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In 2021， more than 1，169 patients were awaiting a liver transplant in Taiwan. However， only 107 cadaveric and 436 LDLTs were performed in 2020， with many patients dying on the waiting list 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

His initial Model for End-Stage Liver Disease(MELD) score was 25， and the total bilirubin level was 7.45 mg/dL(normal range： 0.2 mg/dL to 1.2 mg/dL). Serological tests revealed a negative hepatitis B and C status . Imaging tests， including Panendoscopy， colonoscopy， abdominal Computed Tomography(CT)， and liver magnetic resonance imaging， were performed to rule out malignancies and major vascular anomalies. Subsequently， the patient was referred to the waiting list for a liver transplant. However， his liver function deteriorated rapidly after several episodes of bleeding from esophageal varices， with the MELD score escalating to删除4-1:<u>34</u>. On the basis of the MELD score，the estimated 3-month mortality rate was 52.6% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Because of the recent high mortality without liver transplants in time attributing to the cadaveric liver shortage， we discussed the possibility of an LDLT with his family. His younger sister expressed willingness to be a donor； therefore， an LDLT was initiated.\n\n【12】Donor\n\n【13】The living donor was a 39-year-old woman with blood type B. She had a weight of 61 kg and a height of 163 cm； moreover， her BMI was 23.0， BSA was 1.66， and history was noncontributory. Her pretransplant serological test results were normal； however， HCV-RNA was more than 4 log 10， with a sub-genotype of 1b .\n\n【14】Abdominal CT and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed neither vascular variation nor bile duct anomalies. Although the risk of postoperative hepatic insufficiency is influenced by multiple factors， the preoperative Future Liver Remnant (FLR) volume is a key determinant for ensuring adequate functional remnant liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. CT liver volumetry revealed a total liver volume of 1266.1 mL， with 753.4 mL in the right liver lobe without the middle hepatic vein and 512.7 mL in the left liver lobe with the middle hepatic vein. The results suggested an acceptable volume for the recipient and indicated that harvesting the right liver lobe without the middle hepatic vein was safe for the donor. Regardless of HCV infection， the donor’s clinical condition was suitable for right lobe liver donation， with a graft-to-recipient weight ratio of 0.978 and the donor's liver remnant of 39.76%. The estimated FLR， calculated using the Urata formula (SLV=2.4+706.2×BSA)， was 55.48% and 43.57%for the recipient and donor， respectively. The donor was informed of the risks associated with the procedure， and coercion was excluded during an independent， confidential evaluation. Surgical agreement was approved by the medical ethics committee followed by the discussions with hepatologists， hepatobiliary surgeons， and intensive care staff. Informed consent was obtained from the patients.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】We developed a novel protocol for LDLTs from HCV-positive1OVE donors into HCV-negative recipients. According to the Treatment of Hepatitis C 2018 recommendations of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and European Association for the Study of the Liver， treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1b infection and without cirrhosis can be treated with the fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir for 8 weeks (grading B1； moderate evidence quality and strong recommendation) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. We initiated DAA therapy for the donor with a daily fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir (90 mg) and sofosbuvir (400 mg； Harvoni) for 8 weeks通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The presence of HCV-RNA was evaluated at 4， 8， and 12 weeks posttherapy ， and the Rapid Virologic Response (RVR)， SVR12， posttherapy SVR， and posttransplant SVR suggested that the disease was cured. The donor HCV-RNA diminished from4 log 10 to less than 15 IU/mL， which is below the lower limit of quantification. Although the HCV-RNA was not detected post transplantation， anti-HCV seropositivity was detected before and after the transplant. The LDLT was performed after the end of DAA therapy. To ensure donor safety， physicians requested a preoperative liver biopsy that was suggested using the options of laparoscopic or conventional percutaneous procedure because of the latter process-related bleeding risks， as informed by the radiologist. Subsequently， an intraoperative laparoscopic liver wedge biopsy was performed before the liver harvest surgery. The frozen section of the bilateral liver lobes revealed a minimal fatty change of less than 5% and no fibrosis. The laparoscopic liver biopsy was converted to an open donor right hepatectomy， with an uneventful perioperative period. The donor developed transient postoperative hyperbilirubinemia， however， the level decreased to normal range 1 weeklater. The donor was discharged in stable condition on postoperative day删除4:<u> 7</u>. Currently， the donor is undergoing regular follow-ups by the hepatologist and surgeons in the outpatient department. The donor resumed her job3 months post-donation. No other complications have been noted during the 3-year follow-up period.\n\nThe recipient without hepatitis C history was not treated with DAAs all the time during the perioperative period. Transient anti-HCV antibodies were detected at the first serological follow-up|删除段之间换行|2 weeks post transplantation， with the antibodies disappearing2 months later. No HCV-RNA was detected during follow-ups. Postoperative bile leak complicated with intraabdominal biloma formation was noted. The sono-guided Intra-abdominal pigtail drainage and the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-guided biliary stent placement was performed. The recipient was discharged in a stable condition 1.5 months post-operation. The2-year posttransplant liver biopsy revealed Ishak fibrosis stage 0with a modified histology activity index score (neuroinflammatory score) of 2 (of 18) and no rejection. The recipient had a herpes zoster infection of the trigeminal nerve 1 year after the transplant， with the long-term neurological deficits of dizziness and vertigo that disabled him from the job. Currently， the patient is being followed up at our OPD， with no HCV flare-ups over 3 years.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Here， we present an HCV-positive donor treated with DAAs before donating the right liver lobe to her elder brother. Few articles have discussed this topic. Prior to the approval of DAAs， HCV recurrence after liver transplant was the most common cause of graft failure and reduced recipient survival in HCV-positive patients compared with HCV-negative patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Chhatwal et al. demonstrated that HCV-seronegative patients have an increased life expectancy after accepting any liver graft regardless of HCV status if the MELD score is more than or equal to 20 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The survival rates in HCV-positive donors and HCV-negative recipients are similar to those of HCV-negative donors and recipients because of the use of DAAs， with cure rates of nearly 100%. The use of HCV-positive organs in a selected group of recipients with and without HCV infection was reported by Dhaliwal et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Because of the recipient’s high 3-month mortality rate and the involved cost， the DAA therapy duration for the donor was shortened to 8 weeks. Under existing guidelines， most patients are prescribed12-week DAA therapy， a treatment duration resulting in high rates of SVR across various viral and host characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Moreover， the guidelines do not encourage a treatment duration of less than12 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. However， increasing evidence suggests that many patients can achieve an SVR with only 8 weeks of therapy. In clinical practice，an SVR rate of93% to 98% has been observed after treatment withledipasvir and sofosbuvir for 8 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. In Taiwan， the cost of DAA therapy is similar to that in the United States； however， it is not covered by National Health Insurance， making it unaffordable to ordinary people. The wholesale acquisition cost of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir is $1125 per pill，and the cost of a ledipasvir and sofosbuvir course reduces from $94，500 to $63，000 when the treatment duration is shortened from 12 to 8 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>. In Taiwan and neighboring countries， such as Japan and South Korea， routine pretransplant liver biopsies are not performed for living donors if CT and MRI images reveal no fibrosis， fatty change (less than 5%)， or hemosiderosis. However， we performed a pretransplant laparoscopic liver biopsy for donor safety in the setting oftreated HCV infection.\n\nAlthough LDLTs have been performed in patients with fulminant liver failure or advanced liver disease categorized as the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) status 2 A， posttransplant survival rates are low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In a series， 1-year patient survival was57%， with an average stay of 23 days in the intensive care unit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. By comparison， 1-year patient survival was 82% in cadaveric organ transplant recipients， with UNOS status 2 A at the time of the transplant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. With the advent of MELD， decisions on LDLTs are|删除段之间换行|made on a case-by-case basis， and LDLTs are uncommon in patients with MELD scores above删除4:<u> 25</u>. In these patients， short-term mortality without liver transplants approaches 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In regions such as East and South Asia with low cadaveric organ availability， the decreased posttransplant survival rates with LDLT may be superior to the high waiting list mortality， especially when the outcomes of LDLT are improving通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【23】What mortality rate is acceptable when the donor understands the risks， and when coercion has been excluded? Even if the donor is willing to accept a potential mortality risk for the life of a loved one， would the medical community proceed with an LDLT? A balance should be achieved between the risk incurred by the donor and what is acceptable to society， the medical community， and the recipient.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】In the DAA era， a transplant from deceased HCV-positive donors to HCV-negative recipients has become feasible and safe. Our study also revealed the feasibility and safety as well of HCV-seropositive LDLTs to seronegative recipients. However， some issues remain to be debated， and more studies are required to confirm the long-term ouitcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Transvaginal echography shows endometrial thickness with 18.5 mm associated with free fluid in abdominal cavity . Thoracentesis， paracentesis and endometrial office biopsy were done， revealing papillary serous adenocarcinoma.

We consider the relevance to this communication for the concurrent presentation with unilateral pleural effusion without pleural involvement (parietal and visceral) and without lung|删除段之间换行|parenchymal affection， with peritoneal carcinomatosis， in a stage IV endometrial carcinoma with aggressive subtype.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) is the most common malignant tumor of the female tract， and only 2% to 4% are disseminated at the diagnosis (mostly aggressive subtypes， as clear cell and serous papillary). Usually the EC has a lymphatic involvement with pelvic and para-portico nodules affection， and hematogenous spread to distant organs. There are few studies with the full description of pleural and/or lung metastases incidence. Bristow et al. reported 45%of cases with EC and extra-abdominal disease， with pleural cytology positive and previously Bransheid et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> in 414 patients found2.2% of uterine and ovarian primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Several years ago， it was believed that the metastatic carcinoma to the pleura， in more than 50% of the cases were of endobronchial tumoral emboli in the pulmonary artery， suggesting terminal disease， even it was thought that bilateral affection was related to hepatic metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\nThe pleural fluid is produced about 0.26 ml/kg/day body weight， and when there is an imbalance between production and absorption， results in pleural effusion， for example in the cases of metastatic disease， there are carcinosis， with malignant cells on the parietal and visceral pleura， encouraging the abnormal production of pleural fluid， often with lung parenchymal metastases in the elderly stages of the malignant disease with dismal prognosis. It has been estimated the 15% of malignant neoplasm can develop pleural effusion as a resultant pleural and/or pulmonary invasion for cancers of the thorax and extra thoracic sources as colorectal， kidney， gastric， pancreatic， prostate， and genital tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is important to mention， that， it is most common to find lung metastases than only pleural affection， obviously with pleural effusion， so， the malignant cells can reach this location by direct extension or systemic spread or， even through lymphatic channels in the diaphragm， and they have several types of presentation：|删除段之间换行|a. Solitary pulmonary nodule\n\n【15】b. Multiple pulmonary nodules\n\n【16】c. Tumoral emboli\n\n【17】d.Endobronchial metastases\n\n【18】e. Pleural effusion.\n\n【19】These lung metastases are the principal location of extra pelvic dissemination in EC， with 2.3% to 4.6%， or even 25% of the other gynecological cancers， and the parenchymal nodules are the most common finding (30% to 60% by uterine tumors) in the metastatic lung disease， tending to be peripheral， multiple， basal location， in high blood flow areas， or even， there can be cavitation. But the only pleural affection with pleural effusion， nodularity or thickness is an infrequent finding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The peritoneal cavity has a dynamic state of the peritoneal fluid， with circulation thanks to the breathing movements， peristalsis and abdominal pressure fluctuation， and absorption through the lymphatics channels on the right diaphragm； its oncologic relevance data from 961， with Morton et al.， being the first to report malignant cells in peritoneal washings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【21】There is no consensus (respect a que?) in patients with concurrent malignant pleural effusion and malignant ascites in the metastatic settings， however， the management of the present case， is according with the palliative procedures like pleurodesis， pleurectomy， etc. and the use of cytotoxic systemic therapy with chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】EC is the most common gynecological neoplasm and the mostly affected in the metastatic context， the thoracic cavity， with lung and pleural disease， with parenchymal invasion (mainly aggressive subtypes).\n\n【24】The most interesting finding in this case was the absence of pleural and parenchymal lung affection， having only cytologic as thoracic as abdominal metastases confirmation， considering the possibility of spread through lymphatic channels on the left side diaphragm， another important issue， with only one pleural cavity affected. There would be necessary to implement pleural biopsy (parietal and visceral) and cytologic examination to rule out or confirm ser， for its optimal management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Laboratory investigations demonstrated macrocytosis with (mean corpuscular volume (MCV)， 113.2 fL)， and， high concentration of vitamins B1 and B12. Trace mineral elements (Fe， Cu， Zn and Mn) were within normal ranges . Brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography showed normal results. Ophthalmological examination showed that appearance of the optic discs and flicker sensitivity was normal. Visual evoked potential (VEP) testing showed that amplitude of the P100 wave was decreased during pattern stimulation. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed partial compression of the third portion of the duodenum， which passes between the superior mesenteric artery and aorta， and dilatation of the oral side， resulting in SMA syndrome . Clinical history， hair abnormality and macrocytosis were suggestive of selenium deficiency. Serum selenium concentration was below the detection|删除段之间换行|limit of 2.0 ug/dL. Based on these findings， a systemic disorder caused by selenium deficiency was diagnosed. Sodium selenite has not been approved for the treatment of selenium deficiency in Japan.\n\n【17】Written consent was therefore obtained from the patient after a study protocol for sodium selenite administration was approved by Nagoya City University Ethics Committees. Intravenous administration of sodium selenite at 100 ug/day at day 1 and at200 ug/day at day 2-7， was performed， and administration at 200ug/day twice a week thereafter was continued. Six months after starting administration， curly and ulotrichous hair， nail changes and dysarthria gradually resolved ， and MCV rapidly normalized to 88.7 fL. Serum selenium concentrations gradually increased to 10.9 ug/dL (within normal limits) by December删除4:<u> 2016</u>. However， visual abnormalities and sensory abnormalities of thelimbs remained unchanged， and persisted.\n\n【18】Selenium deficiency causes distinct physical manifestations like hair and nails changes， and visual and limb sensory disturbances， but definitive diagnosis is difficult due to the rarity. We have reported here a rare case of selenium deficiency in a patient receiving long-term management with full ED due to repeated abdominal pain from SMA syndrome associated with CD. Continuous administration of sodium selenite resulted in partial improvement.\n\n【19】Elental° comprises amino acids， very little fat， vitamins， trace elements， and a major energy source， dextrin， but， does not include selenium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The therapeutic effects of ED such as Elental reportedly result from reductions in not only immune stimulation in the gut通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and intestinal permeability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>， but also the concentrations of cytokines associated with mucosal inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Thus， based on the usefulness of ED in CD patients， continuous full and/or half ED is frequently used for inducing and maintaining remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，11，12\\]</u>. On the other hand， one report described the risk of decreased concentrations of serum selenium under long-term management with full ED 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In general， selenium deficiency is known to arise among 1 month to 6 years after starting total parenteral nutrition(TPN)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-16\\]</u>. Long-term full ED administration is also supposed to cause selenium deficiency. Clinical knowledge regarding increased risks for selenium deficiency during full ED，and signs and symptoms of selenium deficiency are generally lacking for physicians and gastroenterologists. In addition， sodium selenite has not been approved forthe treatment of selenium deficiency in Japan. Therefore， a long time may pass before a definitive diagnosis of selenium deficiency is reached and treatment is started. In the present case， 13years elapsed before treatment with sodium selenite was started.\n\n【20】Selenium is incorporated in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and selenoprotein P as a key element， and plays an important role in the stability of the plasma membranes of neurons， erythrocytes， muscle and liver cells. GPxs act as reductases eliminating the oxidants and lipid peroxides constitutively produced in cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. Attenuation of GPxs by selenium deficiency cause cardiac andskeletal myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>， liver damage， erythrocyte macrocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>， encephalopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>，neuropathy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>and nailandhair abnormalities通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，22-24\\]</u>. In particular， whitened nail beds in the hands and/or feet represent a well-known sign. In the present case， curly， ulotrichous hair was observed in addition to recurved and flat nails on the hands， but nail beds were not whitened. Based on the fact that nail changes gradually resolved soon after sodium selenite was administered， recurved and flat nails may also represent a symptom associated with selenium deficiency. Moreover， this suggested that changes to nails and hair might support definitive diagnosis of selenium deficiency and monitoring of the effects of therapeutic treatment，as the turnover of nails and hair is rapid.\n\n【21】Visual disturbance is another key symptom observed in selenium deficiency， and other neurological symptoms included dysarthria， spasticity of the extremities， ataxia and sensory disturbance. These manifestations occurred 1-12 years after starting TPN or elemental enteral nutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，21，25\\]</u>. In the present case， visual disturbances and sensory disturbances of the limbs remained unchanged， and persisted. Most cases with neurological disorders receiving sodium selenite have shown no or only slight improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. These unfavourable outcomes may mainly result from irreversible oxidative damage to the brain related to the low levels of GPxs and other selenoproteins due to selenium deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【22】In conclusion， clinical history and manifestations including hair and nail changes， visual disturbances and sensory disturbances of the limbs， and macrocytosis may be useful to make a diagnosis. Since the prognoses of visual and sensory disturbances don’t seem so good， selenium should be administered rapidly before those disturbances emerge if deficiency is suspected.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A discussion that has been gaining attention is the interaction of COVID-19 infection and non-communicable diseases in populations marked by deep patterns of social inequality， whose social and economic disparity further aggravates the effects of each disease separately， in fact configuring a syndemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This adverse scenario amplified and highlighted pre-existing failures and themes to the need for innovative initiatives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Building responses from the same approaches and concepts are possibly replicating the same mistakes， strengthening what is already known， and amplifying the inequalities that reside in the absences and gaps in the action. The impact on health systems was devastating， significantly affecting health care for non-communicable diseases. According to WHO， about42% of the countries have had their health services for cancer treatment partially or completely discontinued 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Both the discontinuation of treatment and the suspension of screening for new cases of cancer， combined with the economic crisis， will result in an increase in mortality rates， particularly the ones which are preventable cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【2】In response to this， the European Cancer Organization prepared the document called 7-Point Plan to Address the Urgency and Build Back Better 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>，among which some topics will be addressed for an innovative proposal to strengthen CCP：\n\n【3】Urgently Address the Cancer Backlog\n\n【4】It is necessary to analyze that the repressed demand has existed even before COVID-19 and increased its magnitude mainly from situations sensitive to the social determinants of health. Understanding and reformulating the lines of cancer care， from primary health care， a fundamental strategy in the case of cervical cancer， using social technologies such as Health Promotion (HP) with sensitive management arrangements planned for vulnerable groups， can transform this scenario of reconstriction.\n\n【5】Restore the Confidence of European Citizens and Patients in Cancer Health Services\n\n【6】In this case， advocacy is essential， evoking the need for more investments in public health services通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， which are being and will be essential not only in treatment， but also in health surveillance and research. This trust must be re-established by strengthening citizenship and ethical commitments guided by science and evidence-based policymaking with a focus on research and communication(anti-fake news) and allocating adequate resources on a sustainable basis for maintaining a national capacity for responding to future pandemics.\n\n【7】Tackle Medicines， Products and Equipment Shortages\n\n【8】In addition to measures such as the urgent reformulation of the manufacturing capacity and development of the economic-industrial health care complex in the country， as in Brazil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Important themes need to be emphasized， such as the commercial determinates of health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>， wherein cancer， the lobby for new treatments without due scientific evidence fiercely compete for incorporation in national health systems， such as high-cost immunobiological drugs.Strengthening Health Technology Assessment mechanisms is essential to maintain the budgetary integrity of the public health sector.\n\n【9】Address Cancer Workforce GapsAcross the European Continent\n\nThere is an urgent need to promote actions to strengthen national and international technical|删除段之间换行|cooperation for the qualification of health professionals， not only in the clinic area of health care but also in the management of health systems. Investing in multidisciplinarystrategies to fortify the capacity and sensitivity of health care from different fields of knowledge is an important action to innovate the ways to reconstruct CCP. In screening strategies， from the perspective of HP， investing in local capacities with field agents， as it is the case in Brazil with community health agents who have a capacity for the dialogue and the generation of bonds between users and health services.\n\nEmploy 7 Innovativvee TechnologiesS 8and Solutions to Strengthen Cancer Systems and Provide Optimal Care to Cancer Patients|删除段之间换行|The criticism presented here is the capture of technologies by a concept of commodity and materiality (hard technology). To overcome the obstacles to innovation in the health and cancer agenda， a movement to humanize technologies is needed. Therefore， HP actions that necessarily depend on a soft relational technology are important to recover the construction of comprehensive health that empowers local actors and responds to the real needs of the territory. We highlight here the important movement of technological innovation (hard) in the screening from the HPV-tests that allied with strategies to maximize the opportunity for early detection such as the combined algorithm (traditional + HPV-test) from Turkey通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and the use of self-collection observed in Argentina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> are cost-effective arrangements for public health systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. However， this arrangement of hard technologies will not be effective if soft technologies that act within the management of care lines are not implemented. They are the ones that guarantee a harmonization of communication between the points of the health care network from primary care level， immunization，secondary and diagnostic tests and tertiary carelevel (oncology，complex surgery) ensuring the continuity of the treatment flow. Therefore， the mutual investment among these technologies constituted a differential for the BBB strategy.\n\n【12】Embed Data Collection and the Rapid Deployment of CancerIntelligenceto Enhance Policy Delivery\n\n【13】In the era of hyper-connectivity， it is essential to build integrated care data collection strategies and clinicalprotocols with granular data and specific information for each level of health action. The presence of the private sector needs to be incorporated into monitoring and evaluation projects， especially when it comes to providing services to the public sector. Telemedicine has made great strides in this scenario and must be effectively incorporated into all public health strategies.\n\nIn conclusion， BBB needs an epistemological leap in the modes of|删除段之间换行|clinical practice/health systems management and also in the aspects of implementing programs and policies.

This infection can be acquired intrauterine when the first infection of pregnant woman occurs and the Toxoplasma gondii reaches the fetus by transplacental via. The damage to the fetus can compromise the pregnancy and life quality of the infected individual. Early diagnosis of infection allows emergency therapeutic intervention with reduction of the transmission rate and also the severity of the sequelae. Different methodologies are available for the diagnosis of acute gestational toxoplasmosis with detection of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies. The methodologies differ mainly by specificity and sensitivity values reached， as well as execution facility and time required.

After ingestion， the external wall of the oocysts or tissue cysts is ruptured by enzymatic degradation and the infective， sporozoite and bradyzoite evolutionary forms (slow-growing forms)， respectively， are released into the intestinal lumen where they rapidly invade the host cells and differentiate in tachyzoites (forms of rapid multiplication) by asexual division 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.

In early pregnancy， the placental barrier reaches a thickness of 50 to 100um and progressively decreases to 2.5-5 um at the end of pregnancy， allowing parasites to more easily invade trophoblasts.\n\n【9】According to the gestational age on the first infection with T. gondii， the damage to the fetus can vary due to the morphogenesis phase when affected by the parasite， therefore， in 80.0% to 90.0%of infections in immunocompetent individuals there is no clinical manifestation； however， when there is the infection in the first trimester of gestation， fetal death is common， and when in the second and third trimesters of gestation it may lead to prematurity and Sabin's tetrad， which associates microcephaly，retinocoriditis，cerebral calcifications and mental deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In 50.0% of congenital infections， fetal alterations such as hydrocephalus and periventricular necrosis with macro or microcephaly are reported.

This increase in the rate of infection according to gestational age is due to the morphological changes of the placenta， because in the first trimester of pregnancy， the placenta has reduced dimensions and the chance of the parasite reaching the fetus is small， in contrast， as in this phase happens the organogenesis， when there is differentiation of the germinative leaflets， ectoderm， mesoderm and endoderm giving rise to the internal organs of the organism， aggravating the infection， that can lead to fetal death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In the second trimester， increased placenta reflects a greater chance of infection， however， in this period， the infection becomes less severe， since almost all organogenesis has already occurred， meantime， it can result in important damages such as Sabin's Tetrad， in which the fetus presents retinocoriditis， cerebral calcifications， mental retardation or neurological disorders and hydrocephalus， with macro or microcephaly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In the third trimester， the placenta presents the largest dimensions of the period， consequently， the chance ofinfection is higher and， in contrast， the chance of developing serious damage at birth is remote， with manifestations of the disease such as fever， body spots， blindness， in a few days， weeks or months after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The reduction in incidence， as well as morbidity and mortality rates associated with congenital toxoplasmosis can be achieved in the presence ofcollaborative efforts among pregnant women， researchers， doctors and health policy managers， on the adoption of primary and secondary health preventive measures in the gestation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\nThe diagnosis of acute T. gondii infection in the gestationalperiod is crucial to define the risk of fetal involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. For this，prenatal care should be carried out continuously from the gestational diagnosis， in order to avoid congenital toxoplasmosis and also the other risks associated with the life of the pregnant woman and the fetus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In Brazil，health professionals who work in the care ofpregnant women who perform prenatal care through the Unified Health System (SUS)， comply with the protocols established by the Ministry of Health，|删除段之间换行|which guide the serological monitoring for primary infection by T. gondii 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Confirmation of toxoplasmosis is based on indirect or immunological methods， since the direct demonstration of the protozoan by culture， inoculation， immunohistochemistry and pathology is in frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The molecular techniques with direct detection of T. gondii tachyzoite is possible during the acute phase of infection and can confirm fetal infection from different body fluids such as blood， amniotic fluid， cerebrospinal fluid， aqueous humor，bronchial lavage fluid alveolar and even urine by PCR technique with a sensitivity of up to 92.0%， which makes this the method of choice in cases of low parasitemic， on the other hand， in the chronic phase of infection， as in cases of cysts in brain or pulmonary tissue， the technique will not be useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Indirect or serological techniques， through the detection of antibodies of the IgM， IgG， IgE and IgA classes， do not require invasive procedures that pose a risk to the fetus such as amniocentesis and can be performed at any time during pregnancy. Several methods are available for the serological diagnosis of gestational toxoplasmosis such as the Sabin-Feldman technique， Immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)， Hemagglutination (HA)， complement fixation (FC)， enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)， immunoblotting and Imunosorbent Agglutination Assay (ISAGA)， with differences between the values of sensitivity and specificity reached 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【16】It is important that the serological tests for specific anti-T.gondii antibodies are performed at the first prenatal visit with serial analysis in the second and third trimester of gestation and the pregnant woman should receive guidance on the preventive measures of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In the serological diagnosis， specific IgM class antibodies are usually the first to be detected， whereas IgG antibodies appear later， with high titers during the acute phase and gradual reduction with persistence of low titers in the majority of cases， throughout the individual's life， both in the latency phase and in the chronic phase. IgM antibodies may be detectable for long periods， months to years after the acute phase of infection only by highly sensitive diagnostic methods. However， when this antibody is not detected by traditional techniques， or inability to observe IgG seroconversion during pregnancy， the expression of increased IgG titers in serial samples obtained at least three weeks apart， and in tests may suggest the diagnosis of the acute phase of T. gondii infection. Among the techniques for identification of recent T. gondii infection in pregnant women is the IgG and IgM capture ELISA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In immunocompetent individuals， serological tests with IgG and IgM screening are sufficient for diagnosis because they are sensitive， specific and easy to perform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Serological screening has several advantages， such as the identification of seronegative pregnant women， which provides the opportunity for health professionals to act in the preventive education of gestational and congenital toxoplasmosis， since eating habits and personal hygiene practices are identified as factors associated with the risk of infection.

This method is considered excellent for the diagnosis of individual toxoplasmosis in the acute or chronic phase and also for epidemiological surveys， on account of its high sensitivity， indicating IgG antibodies in serum dilutions up to 1：16000 and specificity with little cross-reaction with other diseases， however， due to the need to manipulate the parasite in its infecting form， is not used as first option for routine diagnosis. Currently， for biological safety， the technique has been replaced by Indirect Immunofluorescence which also has lower cost and also detects IgG and IgM antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Besides the conventional Sabin-Feldman dye test are the gold stand for human toxoplasmosis， the conventional test using in vivo tachyzoites is the highest percent of toxoplasmosis detection in human serum when compared the results when using cell culture-derived T. gondii tachyzoites and when test indirect immunofluorescent antibody tests (IFAT) using in vivo and in vitro tachyzoites.\n\n【24】The Microparticle Enzymelmmunoassay(MEIA)technique\n\n【25】The MEIA1Imakes quantitative determination of IgG and IgM anti-T. gondii antibodies in human serum or plasma. The immunoassay works on a random and continuous way in an Abbott company machine (AXSYM)， and for the IgM antibodies detection a rheumatoid factor neutralization solution is required to remove no specific antibodies avoiding false positive results. At the end of the reaction， the immune complex bound to the alkaline phosphatase-labeled conjugate reacts with the substrate to generate fluorescence of intensity proportional to the antibody concentration of the analyzed sample 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELFA)\n\n【27】The ELFA is an automated test in the VIDAS system of the company Bio-Mérieux， used for IgG and IgM antibodies anti-T. gondii detection， through the immunoenzymatic method with a final fluorescence detection as the main reaction， named immunocapture， where the IgM antibodies present in the immunocomplexare labeled with alkaline phosphatase. This method， when compared to the ISAGA (Immunosorbent Agglutination Assay)， demonstrated agreement of 98.9%， sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 99.3%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【28】The Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT)\n\n【29】IFAT is indicated for serological surveys and diagnosis ofacquired infection， because it can reach sensitivity up to 95.0%， however， false positive reactions with antinuclear factor (FAN) and false negative in the presence of low IgG titers can occurs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Enzimed Link Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA\n\n【31】The ELISA is an immunoenzymatic assay can reach up to 80.0%\n\n【32】of positivity and identifies early infection， with special importance for the diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis. The technique eliminates the interference of IgG and rheumatoid factor that are present in IFAT and can be standardized for detection of different classes of antibodies. When ELISA is used for IgG detection， a high positivity index has been observed in the Brazilian population， however， it is not possible to predict whether the infection is acute or chronic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【33】In regions were the cost of the kits is expansive for screening proposes， some in-house ELISA for the detection of toxoplasma antibody demonstrated sensitivity and specificity as the commercial kit used in the study with a better cost-effective diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>.To detect recent infection， the research is directed to the identification of IgA， which remain with high titers for at least 24 months and， because they do not cross the placenta and are not eliminated through breast milk， increase the importance to the use of this technique for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis in the newborn 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【34】The ELISA is available as commercialkits andrequires an Analyzer for the detection of specific IgG against T. gondii. Briefly， the serum-specific IgG against the parasite is linked to T. gondii coated antigen on the surface of reagent wells， forming an antigen-antibody complex The goat anti-human IgG labeled with horse radish peroxidase can be used as the secondary antibody to the antigen-antibody complex and after incubation and wash， as a chromogenic substrate is added to each well. The process should be stopped using a stop solution of 1N of H，SO . The Optical Density (OD) is recorded at 450 nm in the analyzer equipment. Calibrator and positive/negative control sera are used in each test set and the immune status ratio value of each sample is calculated by dividing OD of the sample by the cutoff value (cutoff is the mean OD of the calibrators x correction factor). Results were interpreted based on the manufacturer's recommendations as non-reactive， equivocal， or reactive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>.\n\n【35】The ELISA (for the qualitative determination of specific IgM antibodies anti T. gondii in dry blood samples collected on filter paper for in vitro diagnostic use only)， MEIA and ELFA have been used to improve the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， which has demonstrated to be useful for the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis， as they show greater sensitivity and specificity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【36】The lgG avidity test\n\n【37】IgG Avidity concerns on the observation that， in most patients， during acute T. gondii infection， IgG antibodies bind poorly to the antigen that is low avidity， whereas in the chronification of the infection， the bond strength increases and high avidity can develop. These antibodies with high avidity reflect the fact that the primary infection occurred in the distant past， estimated about more than three months， although this method cannot determine if the infection was recent， since eventually low titers can persist for long periods， such as after antiparasitic treatment， which can maintain low avidity for more than four months. Thus， the test is especially indicated for the first trimester of gestation in IgG and IgM reagent women for screening serology， when it was shown to be the best marker ofacute infection in patients with positive IgM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【38】The Immunobloting Test\n\nImmunoblotting is performed by segregation of the protein antigens components through the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The proteins are transferred to a nitrocellulose paper and processed against the serum to be tested， which， in the presence of reaction， can be visualized. The test is used to determine antigens involved in the|删除段之间换行|different stages of infection，however， it is not a routine test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】The serological screening for gestational toxoplasmosis is essential for the identification of susceptible pregnant women and fast detection of IgM seroconversion， with monitoring since the first trimester of pregnancy for the efficient prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis. Among the techniques for detection of anti-T. gondii antibodies in pregnant women， the sensitivity and specificity of antibodies， verified by MEIA， ELFA and ELISA techniques were higher when compared to IFAT detection. The recent infection in the first trimester of gestation should be confirmed by the avidity test.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This case highlights its unusual presentation in an HIV patient with normal CD4+ T counts. A 42-year-old gentleman presented with a week history of left eye diminution of vision. Clinical examination of the right eye was unremarkable while left eye showed anterior chamber and vitreous cells with a yellowish foveal lesion suspicious of toxoplasmic retinitis. He was seropositive for HIV， on therapy for ten years， with CD4+ T count 777 cells/cumm. Laboratory tests confirmed toxoplasmosis. He was started on oral anti-toxoplasma medication with tapering doses of oral and topical steroids. On subsequent follow-up， the patient had good visual and clinical improvement.\n\n【2】Keywords： Toxoplasmic retinitis； Human Immunodeficiency Virus； CD4+T count\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the protozoal organism Toxoplasma gondii， an obligatory parasite of the cat. In an immunocompetent host， it is generally a benign self-limited infection； nevertheless， severe complications such as retinochoroidal involvement，have been known to occur. Ocular and Central nervous system toxoplasmosis is almost always seen in patients who are severely immunocompromised.\n\n【5】This case highlights the possibility of ocular toxoplasmosis in HIV positive individuals at normal CD4+T counts.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 42-year-old gentleman presented with a history of diminution of vision of the left eye for a week. The Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)， recorded on Snellen's chart， was 6/6， N6 in the right eye and 6/36， N24 in the left eye. Clinically， the anterior segment examination of the right eye was normal， and the left eye showed anterior chamber cells of grade 1 (Standardized Uveitis Nomenclature grading： SUN). Posterior segment examination of the right eye was unremarkable， while the left eye revealed vitreous cells of grade 1+ (National eye institute system grading) with a dense yellowish lesion suggestive of retinitis， involving inferior half of fovea， suspicious of ocular toxoplasmosis . Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) of the left eye showed few hyper-reflective dots in the vitreous and loss of foveal contour with hyper-reflective full-thickness foveal lesion . The patient was seropositive for HlV and on HAART medication for ten years with his recent (1 month since the time of presentation) CD4+ T count being 777 cells/cumm. Investigations revealed positive Toxoplasma gondii serology (IgG-453 IU/ml/IgM-9.4IU/ml)， positive Mantoux with induration of 23 mm. Systemic examination was normal. He was started on treatment with Tab. Septra DS (Trimethoprim 160 mg-sulfamethoxazole 800 mg) twice daily， along with Tab. Azithromycin 500 mg twice daily on day 1， followed by 500 mg once daily and topical prednisolone four times daily. On the follow-up visit after 3 days， consolidation of the lesion was noted，and oral wysolone 1 mg/kg body weight was added to the ongoing treatment. The consulting pulmonologist advised an additional INH prophylaxis. On the subsequent follow-ups， one week and one month later， the BCVA of left eye improved to 6/24， N8 and 6/9， N6 respectively. The posterior segment examination and OCT also showed a gross reduction in the size of the lesion in 2visits (Figures 2A，2B and 3A，3B\\]. During the course of disease he was treated with anti-toxoplasma medication for 8 weeks and a tapering dose of oral wysolone， 10 mg weekly taper for 7 weeks. Two months later， on completion of the course of treatment， BCVA of left eye had improved to 6/6，\n\n【8】N6 and the inflammation had subsided completely，leaving behind an atrophic scar without pigmentation inferior to the fovea . OCT showed improvement of foveal contour .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Approximately 70% to 80% of HIV-infected patients are going to be treated for associated eye disorder throughout the course of their disease. In general， the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count has been accustomed to predict the onset ofbound ocular infections in patients who are seropositive. Patients with HIV infection are particularly susceptible to acute and reactive infections with Toxoplasma gondii， particularly when CD4+ T counts fall below 250 cells/cumm.\n\n【11】HIV patients with ocular toxoplasmosis must undergo a neurological evaluation； including imaging and lumbar puncture due to 30% to 50% of these patients have intracranial involvement. Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis presents as areas of necrotizing retinitis， vitreous， and inflammation of the anterior segment， giving a classical picture of headlight in the fog’ which usually resolves spontaneously， but often leaves pigmented chorioretinal scars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The choroid and sclera may become involved secondarily 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In our case， however， the posterior segment manifestation in the left eye was in the form retinitis alone without the involvement of choroid. Following treatment， the lesion resolved to leave behind an atrophic scar without pigmentation.\n\n【12】Ocular toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals frequently demonstrates a relatively fulminant course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Potential presentations include multifocal disease in one eye， bilaterally active inflammation and/or extensive areas of necrotizing retinitis. Diagnostic confusion with viral retinitis may necessitate intraocular fluid analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【13】When the lesion is characteristic， the demonstration of IgG and IgM serum antibody gives a presumptive diagnosis and allows initiation of a specific therapy.

Steroids should be tapered and withdrawn a week prior to the completion of anti-toxoplasma medication.

However， although the BMI is more often clinically used to define nutritional status， it does not differentiate between specific body-composition components. In addition， recent studies analyzed that the Fat Free Mass (FFM) is more strongly associated with lung function in CF compared to the BMI， and an abnormal or excessive accumulation of Fat Mass (FM)， according to World Health Organization(WHO)， places the individual at risk of cardiovascular and chronic lifestyle diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【16】New therapeutic advancements have shown favorable effects on the quality of life and longevity among CF patients (pts). The advent of CFTR modulators， especially the most recent one， i.e.， the Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ETI)， has been demonstrated to reduce sweat chloride levels and risk of pulmonary exacerbations and improve respiratory function and nutritional status. This results in an increase in weight and BMI and，therefore， overweight and obesity， which are becoming areas of interest among clinical care and researchers for the first time in CF history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Currently， CFTR modulators are known to improve nutritional status and increase anthropometric parameters， but very little is known about how they affect body composition over time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Hence， the objective of this study was to assess the body composition of CF pts on ETI during their first year of treatment at Ancona CF center in order to prevent obesity and chronic diseases through adequate dietetic interventions.\n\n【18】At Ancona CF center， the nutritional status of CF pts who started the commercial triple combination ETI was monitored at fixed times (T0， T1， T3， T6， T12). In this study， we analyzed the weight and body composition of F508del/Minimal Function (F/MF) (n=15) and F508del/F508del (F/F)(n=12) pts over 12 years of age who completed the assessment at 12 months (T12). Weight，BMI， and body composition parameters， in particular FM and FFM， were analyzed using a Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA).\n\n【19】What about results? Variations (A)(T0-T6；T12-T6) in weight and bodycomposition parameters of CF pts on ETI were outlined in the following graphs.\n\n【20】Despite the limited number of pts， this monocentric study showed a consistent increase at T6and a moderate increase at T12 in weight， BMl， and FM in pts on ETI. The lowest increment in weight，BMI， and FM and the highest increment in FFM in the second semester are determined by a personalized dietary intervention and increased physical activity.\n\n【21】The results of this study show that pts on ETI appear to have an increased risk of developing overweight or obesity and， consequently， cardiovascular and metabolic diseases， especially if not properly followed by a specialized CF dietitian.\n\n【22】The effects of CFTR modulators on the increasing weight，height， and BMI in individuals with CF are known and highly dependent on therapy formulation (single or combined therapy)， clinical conditions， and targeted CFTR mutation. However， current evidence regarding the impact of CFTR modulation therapy， particularly ETI， on body composition remains undefined.\n\n【23】The advent of CFTR modulation therapy has revolutionized CF care， in terms of less-severe symptoms， higher quality of life，longer survival， lower rates of hospitalization， and better nutritional status in eligible pts. Many studies have shown how these drugs improve the nutritional status of CF pts by increasing weight， height， and BMI， while only a few of them have assessed the impact of CFTR modulators on body composition. Although BMI is commonly used as an indicator of nutritional status in clinical practice， it is not able to provide information regarding body composition parameters. Indeed， a BMI in the normal range can hide a condition of“sarcopenia”or“normal weight obesity\"通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Despite the strong correlation between BMI and lung function in CF， recent studies have demonstrated that a high content of FM is inverselyassociated with pulmonary function and， on the other hand， FFM positively impacts respiratory strength and lung function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【24】As therapeutic advancements have significantly improved， longevity has increased and overweight and obesity have become emerged issues among the CF population. The implications of excessive weight gain and adiposity on CF clinical outcomes are unknown but may produce similar health consequences and chronic diseases as those observed in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，10\\]</u>.\n\n【25】According to the scientific literature， our study showed that pts on ETI increased FM more than FFM， but this increment can be identified through regular body-composition assessment and controlled by individualized dietary intervention， constant physical activity， and correct lifestyle.\n\n【26】Current nutritional guidelines state that individuals with CF may need a higher energy intake than the general population through a high calorie and fat diet. Nevertheless， these recommendations may no longer be appropriate， especially in the era of CFTR modulators. Moreover， it is important to consider that the nutritional status of many CF pts remains suboptimal， even after starting CFTR modulation therapy， and， thus， a more energy-dense diet may be necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【27】In conclusion， the CF nutritional approach should meet each individual's dietetic requirements and focus on diet quality in order to promote optimal health outcomes and prevent other chronic lifestyle diseases.

HLH was first reported by the Scottish pediatricians James Farquhar and Albert Clarieaux in 1952， where two infants presented with cytopenia's， unremitting fever and hepatosplenomegaly. However， both infants died after few weeks of initial presentation. There was evidence of widespread infiltration of benign appearing histiocytes with hemophagocytosis in the lymphoreticular system on autopsy. They defined this syndrome as familial hemophagocytic reticulosis， which is currently known as HLH. The estimated incidence is approximately 1.2 cases per 1，000，000 individuals per year \\[21.\n\n【2】HLH is due to various pathophysiological pathways： 1) Hyperactivation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and macrophages；2) proliferation and infiltration of macrophages into various organs； and 3) elevated levels of various cytokines， resulting in progressive organ dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. More researches have shown down regulation of proapoptotic signals and genes related to innate and adaptive immune responses as well as up regulation of genes coding for proinflammatory cytokines and antiapoptotic factors to be important pathological mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【3】HLH can beprimary (congenital) or secondary (acquired). Mostly， secondary HLH is arbitrarily divided into three groups depending on the diseases. A-HLH denotes autoimmune disease-associated HLH， whereas HLH triggered by malignancy and infection is denoted by M-HLH and I-HLH，respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. HLH associated with miliary tuberculosis is rare with higher mortality rates通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Pathogenetic mechanism of primary HLH is associated with genetic mutations of perforin and vesicle trafficking genes. It is commonly found in children and adults with primary immunodeficiencies like Chediak-Higashi. The clinical outcome of primary HLH is fatal if immunosuppressive chemotherapy not initiated at an early stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Acquired HLH in otherwise healthy persons is also associated with infections like Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)， Herpes Simplex virus and tuberculosis bacterium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Amongst infections， EBV is reported to be most common cause of HLH however； TB-HLH is less commonly reported. Incidence rate of TB is very high in Southeast Asian and developing countries like India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Since， diagnosis of HLH is commonly missed； high degree of suspicion is required for its diagnosis， particularly with conditions like TB which can have varied clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Thus， understanding the prognosis and characteristics of secondary TB-HLH in order to achieve early recognition and treatment is extremely necessary to prevent irreversible tissue damage. Thereby， in this manuscript we describe a patient of tuberculosis complicated with HLH.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 44 years old male was admitted with complaints ofhigh-grade fever， cough with expectoration， worsening breathlessness for one week and tachypnea for last 2 months. Patient also complained of low-grade febrile illness (not documented) with night sweats and weight loss. On examination he was thin built， febrile (oral temperature： 103°F)， had bilateral sub-centimetric cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy， hepatosplenomegaly (liver 2 cm， spleen 4 cm below the costal margin)， bilateral coarse crepitation (anterior and midaxillary lines).

Peripheral smear examined showed leucopenia|删除段之间换行|and thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow aspirate smears were partly diluted with peripheral blood and showed no particle.\n\n【19】Bone marrow imprint showed particle with highly cellular trails. Erythroid series showed normoblastic reaction， myeloid showed normal maturation with increased eosinophilic precursors. Megakaryocytes were adequate. There was slight increase in number of mature plasma cells and histiocytes with some showing hemophagocytosis. No atypical cells/parasite or granuloma was identified on imprint smear .\n\n【20】Bone marrow core measuring 1.3 cm in length was examined by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining showed bony trabeculae enclosing marrow spaces with normally maturing myeloid series cells. Erythroid series showed predominantly normoblastic reaction with adequate number of megakaryocytes. A non-caseating epithelioid cell granuloma was seen， however no Langhans type giant cells seen . Furthermore， there was increased number of histiocytes with some showing evidence of hemophagocytosis. However， Ziehl Neelson staining for acid fast bacilli was negative. Thereafter， further investigations and workup for tuberculosis associated HLH was done.\n\n【21】Plasma fibrinogen was within normal levels (233 mg/dl) whereas lipid profile showed raised serum triglyceride levels (193 mg/dl). Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia were present along with raised urea and creatinine. Hyperferritinemia (>1800 ng/mL)， raised lactate dehydrogenase (920IU/L)and elevated ESR (50 mm in 1h) was also present. The Mantoux test was negative. However，real time PCR test with sputum sample was reported to be positive for tuberculosis.\n\n【22】Thus， as per HLH-2004 Protocol  and after correlating with clinical details， radiological and real time PCR positivity on sputum sample， diagnosis of tuberculosiIsSwith secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was made.\n\n【23】The patient was managed with supportive measures. Later on， he was started on Anti-Tubercular Therapy (ATT) along with steroids. He was discharged in a stable condition but patient did not come for follow up.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】TB-HLHilsSatype of severe tuberculosis， diagnostically challenging for clinicians as its most common clinical presentation is Pyrexia of Unknown Origin (PUO). This condition was first reported in the 1980s but since last few years there are many cases reported in literature on TB-HLH通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Here， we report a rare case of TB associated HLH in an adult male diagnosed using PCR performed on sputum sample and bone marrow examination. The patient was successfully treated with ATT and corticosteroids. In this case， clinical suspicion of miliary TB was made with the help of history and physical examination. TB is widespread in Asian countries， including India， and is one of the important causes of but due to lack of precise diagnosis and non-specificity of clinical manifestations， early detection is quite difficult7，9\\].\n\nMycobacterium TB is an obligate intracellular pathogen which exacerbate macrophage over activity as well as Thl cell mediated|删除段之间换行|cytotoxicity thereby resulting in HLH. It is evidenced by increased serum levels of IFN-y，M CSF， and TNF-a in patients with tuberculosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Therefore， high TNF-a and IFN-y results in hematopoiesis suppression along with apoptosis thus， resulting in cytopenia. Inhibition of lipoprotein lipase results in hypertriglyceridemia and macrophage over activity leading to excess release of ferritin (an acute phase reactant) in response to inflammatory cytokines； tissue infiltration causes organomegaly， and fever is secondary to release of cytokines like IL 1， IL 6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Literature shows that in patients diagnosed with TB complicated with HLH， there is 100% mortality if they did not receive ATT， whereas there is 40% to 60% reduction in mortality rate by combination of ATT and immunotherapy. Suppression of cytokine storm is of utmost importance in patients with HLH for long-term efficacy of ATT and needs to be done by induction of immunotherapy at an early stage of treatment. Thus， it was observed that patients who received immunotherapy alone also experienced significantly higher overall survival rates than patients who did not receive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，10，11\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Highly elevated level of ferritin is an important prognostic marker and is strongly associated with HLH. Lin et al. concluded in a study that a rapid rate of fall in ferritin levels following therapy initiation was directly proportionate to overall survival and thereby associated with decreased mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. However， Park et al. in their23 patients of secondary HLH found that the rate of decline in ferritin was not associated with survival whereas high fibrinogen at the time of diagnosis was significantly associated with decreased mortality通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Similarly， Padhi et al. found that high serum ferritin (>1000 ng/mL) was an important indicator of disease severity and was associated with decreased survival， but the results were statistically insignificant on univariate analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nInour case， patient wwaass clinically suspectedaass miliary tuberculosis， having fever with organomegaly. Evidence of cytopenia and hemophagocytosis on bone marrow examination led to suspicion|删除段之间换行|of TB-HLH which was confirmed by further biochemical results including hyperferritinemia， hypertriglyceridemia and elevated liver enzymes.\n\n【31】In conclusion， this case illustrates early diagnostic challenges of both HLH and miliary tuberculosis. It provides the need for deep understanding of possible triggers of HLH， with more attention on TB-associated HLH since TB is most common infection in developing countries. In patients with tuberculosis who present with cytopenia(s)， coagulopathy， high triglyceride levels， HLH should be considered as a differential diagnosis. Till date literature highlights the fact that TB HLH have an unpredictable and/or poor outcome with or without ATT. Thus， early diagnosis and initiation of ATT， even in the presence of disseminated disease might alter the final outcome towards favorable in such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The relative content of T-lymphocytes and their main subpopulations was determined on a flow cytofluorimeter FACS Calibur (Canada) by phenotyping lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies (BECKMAN COULTER， USA) to surface membrane differentiation antigens (CD)： CD3+19- (pan T-cells)， CD4+-8+-(T-helpers/inducers)，CD4-8+(cytotoxic T lymphocytes)， CD3-16+(natural killers). To identify the imbalance of immunoregulatory subpopulations ofT cells， the immunoregulatory index was calculated - the ratio of the number of CD4+8-Lf and CD4-8+ Lf. To calculate the absolute content in the peripheral blood of individual populations of Lf， leukogram indicators determined on the hematological analyzer ABH-miscros60， France were used.

In severe asthma， an increase in the content of pan-T cells occurred 1.2 times more often than in moderate asthma， but this was not observed in people with concomitant pathology. In this group， the frequency of increasing the content of T-helpers and decreasing the content of cytotoxic T-cells in patients with severe asthma without concomitant diseases was 1.3 times more frequent than in patients with comorbid pathology. No pathological changes in the T-system were detected in patients with controlled asthma. In partially controlled asthma， these changes were registered 1.5 times more often than in controlled asthma， and in its uncontrolled course， the prevalence of pathological changes in the T-system of immunity was much higher than in the two previous groups. In patients with concomitant diseases， these changes， as a rule， had a higher frequency than in patients without comorbid pathology.\n\n【4】Keywords：Comorbid pathology； Immunity； Exacerbation of asthma\n\n【5】Introduction\n\nIn the last two decades， researchers have paid considerable attention to the problem of comorbidity in bronchial asthma BA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Comorbidity is a combination of several chronic diseases in one patient， which mutually affect each other. It has been proven that the interaction of diseases， their pathomorphosis and age significantly changes the course of the main disease， the nature and severity of complications， worsens the patient's quality of life， limits or complicates the treatment and diagnostic process. It is known that patients with comorbid pathology， including the gastrointestinal tract， which is very common among this category of patients，have an increased risk of developing asthma exacerbations and a greater severity of their course. Comorbidity negatively affects the prognosis of the disease and significantly increases the probability of a fatal outcome. The presence of comorbid diseases leads to an increase in the length of hospitalization， causes disability，|删除段之间换行|and prevents the implementation of rehabilitation measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-12\\]</u>. Discrepancies in the data of different authors regarding the prevalence of comorbid pathology in patients with asthma， in particular the digestive organs， and its influence on the course of asthma and the features of immunological changes determined the purpose of the work - to investigate immunological changes in patients with exacerbation of bronchial asthma with different severity and controllability depending on the presence comorbid pathology.\n\n【7】Materials and Methods\n\n【8】The work is based on the analysis of the anamnesis data and comprehensive clinical examination of 337 patients with exacerbation of BA and 255 patients who underwent immunological research in the laboratory of clinical immunology. The distribution of patients with exacerbation of BA with different severity and controllability by gender and age is presented in the . The analysis of these data showed that in all groups the majority of patients were women， which corresponds to the gender characteristics of this disease. Most of the examined patients with moderate and severe asthma were ofworking age (86.3% and 87.2%， respectively)， while with mild BA - only 46.7%(p<0.05).\n\n【9】There was no statistical difference between the fates of patients of different age categories with controlled and partially controlled asthma； however， in the group of patients with an uncontrolled course of the disease， there was a 2.4-fold decrease in the percentage of young and middle-aged patients and a 1.3-fold increase in the number of people elderly (p<0.05)， which corresponds to the well-known features of BA. Concomitant diseases were recorded in 252of 337 (74.8%) people， 144 (42.7%) of them had pathology of the digestive organs， and the absence of comorbidity was observed in85 (25.2%) patients. Among this group， there were 15.4% more men than among the group of patients with concomitant diseases (40.0%and 24.6%， respectively； p<0.05). There was no difference in the age composition between the groups .\n\nTo assess the severity and controllability of asthma， we used criteria based on international recommendations (GINA， 2014) and given in the unified clinical protocol of primary， secondary(specialized) medical care \"Bronchial asthma and adapted clinical guidelines for bronchial asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-15\\]</u>.Average severity of asthma exacerbation was determined in 125 (65.8%) patients， severe - in 65(34.2%).18(9.5%) patients had a controlled course of the disease，|删除段之间换行|131 (68.9%) partially controlled， uncontrolled 41 (21.6%) patients. Comorbid pathology of digestive organs was recorded in 83 (43.7%) patients with exacerbation of BA. The most common diagnosis was cholecysto-cholangitis， which was present in 63 (75.9 %) patients， gastritis， duodenitis and reflux esophagitis were noted in 31 (37.3%)， pancreatitis in 12 (14.5%)， hepatitis in 6 (7.2%)， gastric or duodenal ulcer - in 4 cases (4.8%)， intestinal candidacies was established in 2cases. It should be noted that almost a third of these.\n\n【11】Patients had a combined pathology of the digestive organs. The remaining 107 (56.3%) persons with exacerbation of asthma had no comorbid diseases. They were included in the comparison group.The relative content of T-lymphocytes and their main subpopulations was determined on a flow cytofluorimeter FACSCalibur(Canada) by phenotyping lymphocytes with monoclonal antibodies (BECKMAN COULTER， USA) to surface membrane differentiation antigens(CD)： CD3+19-(pan T-cells)， CD4+8-(T-helpers/inducers)， CD4-8+ (cytotoxic T lymphocytes)， CD3-16+ (natural killers). To identify the imbalance of immunoregulatory subpopulations of T cells， the Immunoregulatory Index (IRI) was calculated - the ratio of the number of CD4+8- Lf and CD4-8+ Lf. To calculate the absolute content in the Peripheral blood (PC) of individual populations of Lf， leukogram indicators determined on the hematological analyzer ABH-micros 60， France were used.

{"seq_id": "6753f1f0-7312-4c80-90d5-7be244c8bd90", "title": null, "text": "【0】Introduction\n\n【1】It has been a long-standing debate whether a brain abscess is a complication of stroke or is a cause ofstroke-like manifestations. Majority of case reports on brain abscess either as a complication of stroke， or as a stroke mimic are in adults. Here， we present a case of a brain abscess in a child who presented with stroke.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】We report the case of a 12-year old boy who was admitted to our institution for sudden onset of right-sided weakness. Four days prior to admission he started to have low to moderate grade intermittent fever associated with occasional non-paroxysmal unproductive cough. He was prescribed with Clarithromycin， antihistamine， and B2-agonist medications， with resolution of symptoms. The fever recurred 1 day prior to admission associated with 2 episodes of non projectile vomiting of previously ingested food， and a throbbing frontal mild to moderate headache. About12 h prior to admission， the patient could no longer move his right upper and lower extremities， prompting transport to the hospital where he had an episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures lasting for 10 sec.\n\n【4】The past medical history revealed that the patient had a bout of fever and cough about 3 weeks prior to admission， for which he was prescribed Amoxicillin-clavulanic and Salbutamol， with subsequent improvement.\n\n【5】In the emergency room， the patient was examined conscious， coherent， oriented to 3 spheres， verbal but unable to move his right upper and lower extremities， and febrile at 38.6C. The systemic physical examination findings were generally normal. However， the neurologicexamination revealed a flattened right nasolabial fold， inability to lift his right shoulder， and deviation of the tongue to the right on protrusion. There was 0/5 motor strength of the right upper and lower extremities. Babinski sign present at the right. Hyporeflexia was noted on the right upper and lower extremities.\n\n【6】The patient was initially admitted as childhood stroke， and was worked up along this impression. There was neutrophilia seen in the complete blood count. This， together with the fever prompted administration of antibiotics. Hyponatremia at 127.5 mEq/L was seen. The prothrombin time was prolonged with an activity of 57.4% while the activated partial thromboplastin time was normal. The lipid profile showed low High Density Lipoproteins (HDL). The urinalysis was normal. The chest radiograph and the 2-dimensional echocardiography were normal.\n\n【7】The initial non-contrast cranial CT scan only showed focal brain atropy at the right frontallobe area without any sign of hemorrhage or infarction .\n\n【8】The fever resolved on the third day of hospitalization while on the antibiotics， but the motor deficits did not improve. Physical therapy was started.\n\n【9】By the sixth day of hospitalization， the patient’s motor strength on the right upper and lower extremity was seen to be 2/5， which further improved to 3/5 the next day. Rehabilitation therapy and the antibiotics were continued.\n\n【10】The patient's condition was progressively improving， when on the 17 hospital day there was note of sudden regression of the motor strength of the affected side to 0/5. Anisocoria was also noted. A re-stroke was considered so a repeat non contrast brain CT scan was performed； this time， multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe were seen with vasogenic edema and mass effect， consistent with a brain abscess .\n\n【11】cited.\n\nA neurosurgery referral was made， and a contrast-enhanced brain CT scan was preceded，|删除段之间换行|revealing multiple enhancing complex masses， with subfalcine herniation to the right . Medical and surgical decompression was done. Antibiotics were shifted to Metronidazole， Amikacin， and Meropenem per brain abscess guidelines. Post-operatively， the patient's pupils became isocoric； the motor strength in the right lower extremity was 1/5 while the motor strength in the right upper extremity was 0/5.\n\n【13】With the medications and rehabilitation， his condition gradually improved. By the 8h post-op day， he was already able to gain full motor strength in the right leg while the right arm strength improved\n\n【14】W13D L：43\n\n【15】to 2/5.\n\n【16】A repeat contrast-enhanced cranial CT scan done on the 37hospital day showed interval enlargement of the rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe， surrounding vasogenic edema and expansile effect， right subfalcine herniation and left frontal craniotomy defect .\n\n【17】Aspiration of the abscess was performed. Culture of the abscess fluid did not yield any growth. Antibiotics were continued.\n\n【18】A repeat cranial CT scan on the 42n hospital day showed interval decrease in size of rim-enhancing fluid density in the left frontal lobe and interval decrease in rightward subfalcine herniation， still with vasogenic edema. Medications were continued and further clinical improvement was noted .\n\n【19】Patient was discharged on the 45h hospital day already isocoric， with full strength in both lower extremities and left upper extremity， and residual weakness in the right upper extremity.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Childhood stroke is defined similarly as adult stroke： an acute onset neurological sign or symptom attributable to a focal brain infarction or hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Just like in adults， childhood stroke can be divided into hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke.\n\n【22】Hemorrhagic stroke may be intra parenchymal or spontaneous non traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Focal brain damage results from hemorrhage through localized mass effect and ischemia of adjacent tissues. Cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke may result from Arterial Ischemic Stroke (AIS)， venous infarction， or Cerebral Sinovenous Thrombosis (CSVT). Focal brain damage from ischemic stroke results when there is a loss of blood flow or oxygenation to an area of brain tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Stroke in children is reported to be common. It affects 1 in 1，600to 4，000 neonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>， and 2.3 to 13 per 100，000 older children annually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for 50% of pediatric stroke， with an annual incidence of approximately 1 to 1.7 in 100，000children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8\\]</u>. The remaining 50% of pediatric stroke is accounted for by ischemic stroke， with a slightly higher annual incidence of 1 to 2 per100，000 children in developed countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. In the Philippines， the registry of childhood diseases of the Philippine Pediatric Society， Inc.， shows that there is a total of 701 reported cases of stroke in children from January 1，2006 to December 315，2019通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In a country with roughly 42，311，222 children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>，the annual incidence rate of stroke is approximately 0.12 per 100，000 Filipino children. This number is much lower than that was reported for developed Western countries. However， this may not be a true reflection of the incidence of stroke among Filipino children as the PPS registry collects data only from their accredited training hospitals.\n\n【24】The most common symptoms of acute stroke in children are similar to those in adults. These include hemiparesis and hemi facial weakness (67% to 90%)， speech or language disturbance (20% to50%)， vision disturbance (10% to 15%)， and ataxia (8% to 10%).Non-localizing symptoms like headache and altered mental status may also be present. Seizures manifest in 15% to 25% of children with stroke通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-15\\]</u>. Seizure serves as a sentinel sign of acute stroke in children， occurring in 31% to 46% of younger children with stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Our patient presented with headache， vomiting， right-sided hemiparesis， and seizures. Clearly， our patient’s clinical manifestations are compatible with acute stroke.\n\n【25】The nature of the stroke-like manifestations of the patient on presentation was a dilemma for a time because aside from the absence of an infarcted area in the brain on the initial cranial CT scan， the search for the more common etiologies like sickle cell disease，cardiac disorders， or prothrombotic conditions were negative. A suspicion for yet undetermined infection was considered based on the presence of fever and neutrophilia in the complete blood count.\n\n【26】Literatures show that only approximately 50% of patients with ischemic stroke will have known risk factors predisposing to stroke at the time of diagnosis. However， after thorough evaluation， 40% of children with ischemic stroke are found to have 1 risk factor， 50%have 2 or more factors， and 10% have no identified risk factor for stroke. These risk factors include arteriopathies， cardiac disorders， infection， acute head and neck disorders， acute systemic conditions， chronic systemic conditions， prothrombic states， chronic head and neck disorders， atherosclerosis-related risk factors， and others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The path physiology of the stroke in our patient was made clearer when a repeat cranial tomography showed multiple defined masses on the left frontal lobe with vasogenic edema and mass effect， which showed enhancement with contrast. This finding was compatible with brain abscess.\n\nBrain abscess is a focal infection in the brain parenchyma|删除段之间换行|consisting of encapsulated d ous andpyogenic bacteria. Less commonly， fungi， mycobacteria or protozoa cause brain abscess通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Brain abscesses are reportedly rare in children， but they can cause significant morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. They occur in 0.4 per100，000 children annually but may range from 0.3 to 1.3 per 100，000children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，17\\]</u>. The registry of childhood diseases of the Philippine Pediatric Society (PPS)， Inc. shows that there are 1，206 cases of intracranial abscess over 14 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This translates to an annual incidence of 0.20 per 100，000 Filipino children. This number is lower than the reported incidence and contrasts with the report by Gaskill and Marlin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> which said that there is a higher incidence of brain abscess in underdeveloped countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. They more common in males in the first two decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Children 4 to 7 years old have the highest incidence of brain abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，22\\]</u>. The locations of abscesses in the brain， in decreasing frequency， are frontotemporal， frontoparietal，parietal，cerebellar， and occipital areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Eighty percent of children with brain abscess have predisposing factors while 20% of cases are cryptogenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Among children with predisposing factors， 30% to 50% result from contiguous focus of infection like otitis media， mastoiditis， sinusitis， orbital cellulitis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， or dental infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Approximately 10% of cases occur in cases where the body's natural barriers are disrupted like in cases of neurosurgical procedures or head trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，25，26\\]</u>. Hematogenous spread associated with上bacteremia andimmunosuppressive conditions accounts for 40% of cases of brain abscess in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Direct spread of the organism from a contiguous focus of infection usually causes solitary brain abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> while bacteremic spread typically causes multiple brain abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Based on the history and the physical exam which did not show evidence of probable contiguous foci of infection， neurosurgical procedure or head trauma， and the multiple abscess lesions seen in the cranial tomogram， the brain abscesses in our patient must have resulted from a bacteremic route. However， despite work-up， there was no underlying condition that was identified. This absence of an underlying condition or a primary site of infection has been reported in 20% to 40% of patients with brain abscess.\n\n【30】The signs and symptoms of brain abscess are initially nonspecific通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28-31\\]</u>. Headache is the most common symptom， occurring in 69%of cases. Fever occurs in 45% to 53% of patients， seizures in 25%，and focal neurologic deficits in up to 50% of children with brain abscess通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32，33\\]</u>.Individually， each of these signs and symptoms is not a reliable basis for the diagnosis of brain abscess. Even the classic triad of fever， headache， and focal neurologic deficits that suggests brain abscess is present in only 20% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Thus， a high index of suspicion is recommended. Our patient presented with fever， headache， and hemiparesis. This should have alerted us to the possibility of brain abscess on admission； however， in the absence of abscess lesions on the initial cranial tomogram， the diagnosis of brain abscess was not considered on admission.\n\n【31】Hemiparesis in cases of brain abscess is reported to be more common in children than in adults. In a review of literatures on brain abscesses in children， the incidence ofhemiparesis ranged from19.2% to 44.06% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35-37\\]</u>. This high incidence was demonstrated to result from the involvement of the eloquent areas of the brain with seeding of metastatic abscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.\n\nThe question that we asked ourselves in the management of this patient was that is this a case of the brain abscess being a stroke mimic or is the brain abscess a complication of stroke. Unfortunately， there|删除段之间换行|is a dearth of literatures related to this topic in pediatrics. However， there have been reports of brain abscess as complication of stroke in adults. To date， there are 20 case reports of brain abscess after stroke that were published 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38-57\\]</u>. All of these are reported in adults. The abscess is reported to develop 12 days to 14 months after the stroke incident 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58，59\\]</u>. Our patient was diagnosed with brain abscess 17days after the stroke.\n\n【33】The pathogenesis of brain abscess after a stroke involves the disruption and loss of integrity of the blood brain barrier around the ischemic area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>， making it vulnerable to microbial seeding when bacteremia occurs during a systemic infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>.\n\n【34】However， brain abscess as a complication of the ischemic stroke could not be explained by the afebrile state of our patient at the time of or immediately before the diagnosis of brain abscess was made. This made us consider an alternative scenario where the developing brain abscess acted as a stroke mimic.\n\n【35】There have also been reports of brain abscesses as stroke mimics通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60-70\\]</u>.Unfortunately again all these reports are in adults. The exact mechanism how a brain abscess presents with stroke-like symptoms is still unclear. One hypothesis is the development of paroxysmal septic emboli that causes embolic infarction which becomes the nidus for the abscess formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>. However， the septic work-up in our patient did not reveal any focus of infection that could have thrown a septic embolus to the brain. The authors hypothesize that the stroke-like manifestations in our patient， not accompanied by an apparent infarct in the cranial tomogram， may be due to the cerebritis stage of abscess formation and its accompanying inflammatory vasculitis or in-situ thrombus formation， and that the brain abscess in our patient could have been cryptogenic in nature. It has been reported that the cranial tomography of the brain may be negative or may show only subtle nonspecific findings during the early stages of evolution of a brain abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[71\\]</u>. It could have been better if a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was done as it is the preferred imaging method in the initial examination. Sadly， our institution lacks this technology for now.\n\n【36】The most important lesson that this patient taught us， regardless of whether the brain abscess is a complication of a stroke or is a stroke mimic， is that a high index of suspicion for the possibility of a brain abscess in a patient with stroke-like manifestations is quite necessary for early diagnosis and treatment to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Cardiac amyloidosis has multiple subtypes， the most frequent forms in our country (Spain) being primary amyloidosis due to light chain deposits (LA-CA) and transthyretin deposit CA (ATTR-CA). The latter has an inherited variant (ATTRh) and a mutant or senile variant (ATTRwt)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【18】We present a curious report of two octogenarian sisters who were independently diagnosed in2019 with ATTR-CA by two different cardiologists； the 87-year-old debuted at this age with a clinical scenario of Heart Failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction and left ventricular hypertrophy通用删除1(英):<u>(interventricular septum： 20 mm， left ventricular ejection fraction-LVEF 64%， left atrium volume35 mL/m²， NT-ProBNP 1737 pg/mL； Figure 1A)</u>， with a pseudoinfarction pattern (Q image) in V1to V3 in the electrocardiogram . An infiltrative deposit disease was suspected， because of this severe degree of ventricular hypertrophy. The younger sister， 82 year-old， had a previous history of syncope with mild conduction disorders in the electrocardiogram (left anterior hemiblock)， and required implant of a pacemaker several years ago because of atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular rate . She subsequently developed congestive HF with reduced ejection fraction (LVEF20%， left atrium volume 39 mL/m’， NT-pro BNP 16，246 pg/mL). Echocardiogram also showed a severe left ventricular hypertrophy， being interventricular septum 21 mm . A diagnosis of transthyretin deposit was made in both sisters， according to Gillmore et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>： Grade 3 uptake of Perugini's classification in bone scan ?mTc-DPD ， and exclusion of AL-CA by demonstrating the absence of a monoclonal peak in the serum and/or urine immunofixation test. Blood samples from the two sisters were sent for genetic study， and conventional sequencing by Sanger's method indicated that the TTR gene sequence was normal in both. This was quite a surprise， as we thought we were facing a clear case of ATTRh， and the absence of genetic alterations in the sequencing of the TTR gene showed two matching cases in the same ATTRwt family.\n\n【19】Reviewing this case， we would like to point out several essential aspects of ATTR-CA：\n\n【20】Variability in clinical presentation ofthe disease： TTR-CAcan presented with severeleft ventricular hypertrophy， HF with preserved ejection fraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， HF with reduced ejection fraction通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， and conduction disorders leading to syncope and need for a pacemaker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Al of them due to the progressive deposit of Amyloid material by transthyretin in the different cardiac structures(myocardium and conduction system).\n\n【21】The false belief that we are facing a low-prevalence disease. This case shows it is necessary to test this diagnostic entity in certain patient profiles， because the prevalence is not low. Even in the same family， several sporadic cases of the disease (ATTRwt) may appear， as occurred in our report. There are already published series where up to 5% to 13% of patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and up to 11% with HF with reduced ejection fraction have Amyloid deposit per transthyretin 5\\].\n\nThe need for a genetic study to sequence the TTR gene for pathogenic variants. As in this case， normal sequencing excludes the possibility of ATTRh， which has diagnostic implications for the family (they would not require a cardiological study or follow-up) and also therapeutic implications， because it excludes the possibility of using treatments thus far only approved for|删除段之间换行|Sistolico pico\n\n【23】Deformacion longitudinal \\[%\\]\n\n【24】ATTRh and not for ATTRwt.\n\n【25】Learning Points\n\n【26】1\\.

Moreover， such co-morbidities have an increasingly poorer outcome when associated with SARS-CoV-2infection.\n\n【2】Case Report： An 85-year-old lady presented with dyspnea a week after being treating for chest infection by general practitioner. Chest X-rays and CTPA showed bilateral airspace opacifications with organizing pattern and SARS-CoV-2 was not detected on three PCR swabs. She was managed with diuretics， antimicrobials， steroids， oxygen and non-invasive ventilation.\n\n【3】Conclusion： An acute exacerbation of ILD， decompensated CCF and CT findings of an organizing pneumonia pattern， raises the possibility of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection being thetrigger for the patient’s presentation.

Furthermore， patients with COVID-19 infection and CCF are particularly vulnerable to hemodynamic decompensation，ensuing additional diagnostic ambiguity.\n\n【12】Moreover， in those with ILD and CCF， it is imperative to recognize that COVID-19 infection has worse outcomes， especially in elderly population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-5\\]</u>.\n\nIn this article， we report a case of an 85 years old lady who presented with dyspnea and features|删除段之间换行|suggestive of COVID-19 infection on a background history of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) associated ILD， asbestosis and congestive cardiac failure to highlight the above-mentioned diagnostic difficulties and the importance of multimodality imaging in patients with dyspnea ofunclear or potentially multifactorial origin.\n\n【14】Case Presentation\n\n【15】An 85 years old lady presented to Emergency Department (ED) with dyspnea on exertion， bipedal edema and facial puffiness for 2weeks. Few weeks prior to her dyspnea， she had some dry cough and was treated for lower respiratory tract infection with oral doxycycline. Her worsening dyspnea prompted her visit to ED. She had a background history of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis associated ILD， hypertension， atrial fibrillation， heart failure with preserved ejection fraction of 50% to 55% and possible asbestosis as per recent Computed Tomography (CT) imaging 4 months ago .\n\n【16】On examination， she was afebrile with a heart rate of 54 beats per minute， respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation of 75% to 80% on room air. She was dyspneic while conversing， had noticeable facial puffiness， digital clubbing and bilateral pedal edema. On auscultation， bilateral widespread coarse crackles were heard. Her oxygenation improved on 8 Littre’s of Oxygen (O2) via high-flow nasal cannula， saturating 96%.\n\nAn arterial blood gas on room air revealed hypoxemic respiratory alkalosis. A Chest X-Ray (CXR)  shows bilateral patchy|删除段之间换行|airspace opacification with Kerley B lines raising the possibility of cardiogenic pulmonary edema and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) secondary to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was contemplated in view of prior dry cough. Initial bloods revealed raised C-Reactive Protein (CRP) of 37.19， white blood cell count 10.9， neutrophil count 9.1 and a lymphocyte count of 1.2. Her hyperinflammatory markers were mildly elevated， Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) -484， D-Dimer 942， IL-6 202.96 and serum Ferritin 138.6.A CT Pulmonary Angiogram(CTPA) was performed  in view of her raised D-dimer revealed multiple differentials.\n\n【18】She was initially treated as a community acquired pneumonia with Intravenous (IV) co-amoxiclav 1.2 g/8h and diuresis for heart failure with IV furosemide 40 mg/12h. Due to risk of prolonged QTC interval， Clarithromycin was withheld. She was isolated pending COVID-19RT-PCRtestsby3and all 3 swabs obtained on consecutive days did not detect SARS-CoV-2. On Day 3， her antimicrobial therapy was escalated to piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g/6h with oral prednisolone 60 mg.\n\n【19】On Day 4， IV meropenem 1 g/8h， oral doxycycline 100 mg once daily and co-trimoxazole 80/400 mg per oral/12h to cover for Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia (PJP) were initiated following microbiology and respiratory specialist advice.\n\n【20】increased warranting escalation to High Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) with Fractional inspired O， (FiO，) of 40% to 60% with a flow rate of30 L/min to 40 L/min. However， she was unable to maintain adequate oxygenation with maximal FiO， setting and repeat portable chest X-ray  revealed disease progression. She declined invasive mechanical ventilation and passed away peacefully after 6 days.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】We report a case where an acute exacerbation of ILD and cardiogenic pulmonary edema could have been triggered by recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our patient had 3 negative nasopharyngeal swabs’ PCR for COVID-19 during her hospital stay. However， we reckon that her viral load may have been low to be detected by RT-PCR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In keeping with hospital policy， we went forward with only specimen collection from nasopharynx and did not opt for sputum or Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL) swabs.\n\n【23】We were unable to do a serum anti- SARS-CoV-2 antibody test due to restricted resources. There have been multiple studies demonstrating the varying degrees of viral shedding on different specimens， especially in elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and organizing pneumonia has also been reported to be a sequala post resolution of COVID pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The patient’s arthritic symptoms were well controlled with Methotrexate 15 mg weekly and Adalimumab 40 mg subcutaneous injection fortnightly. She never had any baseline pulmonary function tests which could have predicted her outcome for any RA-ILD exacerbation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【25】There are many questions that remain unanswered with her complex case. The duration of illness seems very acute to rationalize a single diagnosis based on her CT findings. Diuresis seemed to have a good effect， but the chest X-rays revealed persistent bilateral pulmonary opacities. These opacities could have been secondary to an atypical viral， bacterial， fungal infection or drug induced pneumonitis or exacerbation of ILD.\n\nThis case report demonstrates a potentiality that SARS-CoV-2could have been a trigger for her acute flare of RA-ILD as she first|删除段之间换行|developed dry cough a week ago and was treated as a chest infection in the community. It remains uncertain in terms of her prognosis， whether treatment with Tocilizumab coupled with mechanical ventilation would have led to a successful outcome. Nevertheless， the importance of ameliorating management of those with ILD especialy during the SARS-CoV-2 period awaits more research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

UK government told that it is highly contagious new variant of the virus. Scientist investigated the genetic materials of the coronavirus and found thousands oftiny modifications which proves it hopscotched across the world. UK is the first to detect the new strain and now it is found in Denmark， Belgium， the Netherland， Australia as per the record of WHO通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Coronavirus have genetic material called RNA. When virus infects us， it attaches to cells， get inside and make number of copies of their RNA. If there is a mistake in copying， the RNA becomes changed and called mutation. It happens accidently and by random and a normal process in virus by which they spread and multiply. The new variant B.1.1.7 variant is detected in the UK in the month of December 204 followed by the B.1.351 variant in South Africa， Los Angeles and Ohio. Research proves that B.1.1.7 variant is more deadly and contagious than the previous one. A new variant in the coronavirus is VUI-2020 12/01 or lineage B.1.1.7. 17 different changes have been found in new variant and most of them is due to the alteration in a protein made by the virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) predict that by the March 21， B.1.1.7 will be the dominant strain in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. The genetic changes are seen in large number especially in the spike protein which governs how the virus interacts with a human cell. New variant is 70% more transmissible than the old variant and attack the immune system faster and more severe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The primary symptoms such as cough， fever， chest pains，loss of taste and smell， aches and chills is same as that ofolder. The major concern oftoday's scientist is that the mutation could affecttreatment and prevention. Bollinger said “We deal with mutations every year for flu virus and will keep an eye on this coronavirus and track it\". The new variant spread faster from person to person andleads to more deaths. This new variant infects more number of cases in children and more aggressive new strain needs attention. The biggest problem with the virus is that when it mutates it escape from drugs or the immune system by changing the proteins on its surface. Antibodies are generated by our bodies to fight off infection and it doesn't exist in isolation. In our body， several cells have to work together antibodies， specially neutralizing antibodies， enter the stage. One subset of T cells plays a crucial role in the production of antibodies and another type of T cell kills the viruses infected cells. T cells are a kind of WBC and lymphocytes produced in bone marrow and carry a protein on their cell surface， surveil our bodies for pathogen. Dr. Yewdele， chief of cellular Biological Section explains that there are two paths to alert the immune system of the foreign invader. Once a virus enter into the cell， it goes a series of compartments were enzyme chop and unpack into small peptides and these peptides take away by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II molecule. When a virus infects a cell， it makes viral protein by hijacking the cell's machinery. At the same time some peptides diverting to MHC class I molecules， which direct them to the cell surface and present them to other cell 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Dr. David Mulligan suggested that m-RNA vaccines activate B cells which can able to produce antibodies over 8 months after vaccination. Our immune system produces antibodies to a protein which sits on the surface of the virus called spike in the presence of vaccines. The spike protein opens a passage inside by latching onto the cells. Vaccine helps in the production of antibodies and stick to the tip ofthespike and virus can’t enter inside. Mutation creates the possibility to the change the shape of spike protein； in turn antibodies gain a tight grip on them. The variant B.1.1.7 includes 8 in the spike gene and the antibodies produce by our immune system may be less likely that virus can easily escape their attack. Currently the scientists think that the variant will be able to evade vaccine but at some point， someday，some where the current vaccine may be ineffective(Kristian Andersen， a virologist at Scripps research Institute). The US chief adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said that the possibility of new variant resistance towards vaccines is low but inexistence. The m-RNA vaccine is able to modify to target new variants produced by mutation but definitely new strains could decrease the effectiveness of the virus. The vaccines provide only 21.9% protection|删除段之间换行|against the mild or moderate COVID-19 development and 10.4%against the B.1.1.7 variant. Several scientists explain that vaccines produce wide range of response beyond the spike protein through the immune system so “VARIANTS ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION\". The new virus strain is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape so Transmissibility and Virulence of the variant requires more research. Various scientist of South America working on a booster shot to guard against the new variant. At last it can be concluded that new variant with speedy spreader properties are a concern to everyone. Prof. Stoye said “Spread will almost inevitably occur because of short separation between different countries\". The above letter is not just for new variant but for the future global health security and to manage the threats with pandemic potential. The variant of concern is very much significant to public health and effectiveness of current vaccine. If there is a chance of vaccine failure or reinfection towards new variants then the case can be considered oh high priority. That why new variants is under radar by various health scientist.\n\n【11】1\\. Risk related to the spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in the EU/EEA - first update.

It constitutes the leading cause of medical admission in developed countries (150 million new cases/year worldwide， 3% of which requires hospital admission)， with a significant social and economic burden in this age group. More than half of cases are due to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)， whose transmission is airborne through the contact of nasopharyngeal or conjunctival mucosa with respiratory secretions of infected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 global diffusion and COVID-19 associated Public Health Measures (PHM) have profoundly modified the epidemiology of airborne communicable diseases. With the main purpose of curbing virus spread， from march 2020 governments imposed a broad range of non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs； e.g.， social distancing， school closing， travel and gathering restrictions， mandatory face masks， promotion of hand washing.)， determining radical changes in daily lifestyle and collaterally limiting the circulation of other airborne transmissible pathogens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-8\\]</u>. The major decline in infection rates concerned enveloped viruses (especially RSV and influenza)， instable and easily neutralized by the widespread alcohol-based sanitizers. This did not affect envelope-free viruses (among all， rhinovirus)， transmitted by either aerosol or fomites， which kept circulating and became the leading etiological agents of some clinical entities(e.g.， bronchiolitis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6，9-11\\]</u>. The efficacy of PHM established to contain COVID-19 pandemic is consolidated evidence， nonetheless viral circulation in a certain area is the result of a complex interplay between local microbiology， climatical conditions， population susceptibility and social interactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Recent evidence points out that different pathogens can compete in the single host(viral interference)， affecting each other’s circulation at a population level： for instance，interferon response to rhinovirus is protective against influenza A virus， which may explain their asynchronous circulation in some areas and seasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. Antiviral immunity activation may also explain the coincidence in time between the unexpected decrease of RSV infections and the parallel increase in SARS-CoV-2 Omicron cases recorded in late December 2021 (RSV usual epidemic peak) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nThe seasonality ofviral respiratory diseases is widely recognized. Cold temperatures and humidity foster viral transmission respectively stabilizing the envelope and facilitating the deposition ofheavy droplets， other than encouraging indoor social gatherings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. RSV epidemiology， indeed，varies according to meteorologic conditions： in the Northern Hemisphere， transmissions rate increases from Novemberto March，reaching its peakinJanuary-February，while epidemicpeak in the Southern Hemisphere takes place in May-July 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Data show that is not a contiguous spread rather locally evolved variants that underlie epidemics， because of susceptible reservoirs (e.g.， adults with COPD or immunodeficient children) who guarantee a low-level continuous viral replication， periodically enhanced by favorable meteorological and social conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，18\\]</u>. Climate factors and pathogens mutual interactions do not fully explain the rebound effect we are experiencing after the relaxation of preventive measures， characterized by heavier disease burdens and infection rates peeking out of the conventional epidemic season or age range 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，19-21\\]</u>.COVID-related Non-Pharmacological Interventions (NPIs) had indeed an impact on both， cross-border and local diffusion， generating off-season resurgences and incidence rate fluctuations correlated to the different intensity of containment measures throughout the entire pandemic period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. A matter of actual concern is the detrimental impact of NPIs on immune competence at host and population level. Abundant evidence demonstrates that recurrent antigenic stimulation increases immunity effectiveness. On the contrary， prolonged periods of reduced exposure to pathogens deprive immune system ofantigenic stimulation， resulting in waning herd immunity and producing what is now referred to as “immune debt”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，21\\]</u>. In this perspective， social restrictions and hygiene measures facilitated the selection of a population susceptible to already known infections. With the gradual relaxation of community|删除段之间换行|NPIs， previously disappeared viruses started to circulate again， facing an immunologically“naive”population unable to build up an appropriate neutralizing response. Consequently， the association of relaxed anti-COVID restrictions and decreased protective immunity contributed to a paradoxical， intense and out-of-season resurgence of respiratory illnesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，20-25\\]</u>. This is a particular concern for Respiratory Syncytial virus， for which susceptibility largely depends on age-dependent airway and immune development but mostly on protective immunity arising from repeated antigenic recognition. Transient immunity against reinfection (lasting from 7 to 15 months) is provided initially by vertical transmission and through periodic seasonal exposure thereafter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，20，26\\]</u>. The absence of seasonal viral circulation deprived the pediatric population of passive protection obtained with maternal antibodies and of the infection-related active immunization. The “immune debt generated in such unexposed and therefore susceptible cohort of infants is held accountable for the growing trend in RSV infections observed with social restrictions easing通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【13】It is legitimate to wonder what to expect in next seasons， in view of the likely necessity to employ effective containing measures for incoming SARS-CoV-2 periodic waves. Mathematical models predicted that the intensity and duration of NPIs reducing pathogens’spread are positively correlated with the size of their future epidemics通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. This acquires significant implications in terms of prevention and health planning， since the unpredictability about Public Health burden of unexpected epidemics forces health systems to maintain a prolonged and source-consuming level of vigilance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Preliminary data from both hemispheres report that 2022-2023 bronchiolitis seasons is going to be of high impact (personal data). Should we consider the immunity debt paid off? A better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology - and more specifically of the impact that COVID-19 restrictions collaterally have on microbiological epidemiology and immune competence - is necessary to predict and consequently anticipate the resurgences of seasonal respiratory viruses. Concerning RSV，this would allow governments to timelyand effectively allocate healthcare resources (e.g.， prevention campaigns with monoclonal antibodies)， primarily to preserve most fragile patients (e.g.， under 3 months， premature， with comorbidities)， at greater risk of hospitalization and severe complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，20\\]</u>. With reasonable probability SARS-CoV-2 will become， like others， an endemic virus， and restrictive interventions necessary for its containment will no longer be necessary. Meanwhile， however， we advocate for an implementation of RSV epidemiological surveillance and hope that technological advancement will soon provide new tools(e.g.，vaccines) to cope with unexpected outbreaks， thence balancing the immune debt of a population weakened by the need to face a greater threat.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The participants were selected purposively from different geographical regions across the country. The pre- and post-training scores of staff nurses were captured using Kahoot! platform and statistical significance were determined by paired t-test using STATA software. The Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with staff nurses and the In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with the head consultants and assessors were conducted to explore their experiences and perceptions of the Manyata training program and data was analyzed through thematic analysis.\n\n【3】Results： The statistical analysis of pre- and post-training scores suggests a significant improvement in the knowledge and skills of all the staff nurses from four states (Bihar， Tamil Nadu， Maharashtra， and Punjab). The mean percentage of correct answers (for all questions and states combined) increased from 42.5% before training to 82.9% after training with a mean difference of 40.4%. The qualitative data analysis demonstrates an improved motivation of staff nurses to upgrade themselves and others， their enhanced practical knowledge and skills， an increased sense of recognition and self-worth， respectful maternity care， and overall improved maternal outcomes.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Our study suggests that staff nurses' practical knowledge and skills， their adherence to clinical standards on antenatal care， and their overall professional behavior improved significantly post-Manyata training program. This FOGSI initiative is a promising intervention to build the capacity of healthcare providers， however， continuous and concerted efforts are needed at their workplaces to make the learning process sustainable.\n\n【5】Keywords： FOGSI； Manyata skill transfer training； Frontline healthcare provider； Capacity building； Maternal care； Mixed-method； Kahoot\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Improving the quality of antenatal care will not only reduce the global burden of maternal complications and deaths but also provide all women with a positive pregnancy experience 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Since staff nurses are at the forefront of clinical care and have maximum interaction time with the women at a healthcare facility， it is imperative to strengthen their knowledge and skills to ensure the provision of quality， safe and respectful maternity care.\n\n【8】The Maternal Health Quality of Care(MHQoC) strategy-funded National Program Management Unit of FOGSI has trained the staff nurses and certified facilities on the Manyata safe delivery standards. Though Manyata clinical standards are meant for private facilities， they are aligned with the government's requirements for the delivery of optimum care. The 16 clinical standards targeted for implementation cover： Antenatal care (one standard)，intrapartum care (13 standards)， postpartum care (one standard)， and caesarean section (one standard)， including the standards on identification and management of Postpartum Hemorrhage (PPH) and Pre-Eclampsia/Eclampsia(PE/E)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Bengaluru-based ARTIST (Asian Research and Training Institute for skill Transfer) Skill Gurukool， which is a premier institute for learning， is gearing up to ensure the improvement in capabilities and competencies of Obstetricians & Gynecologists (ObGyn) and healthcare providers in India. Through FOGSI approved Manyata skill development training program， the institute aims to create a lasting impact on the quality of training and scale up of Manyata's reach，taking advantage of both the onsite teaching at Skill Gurukool and blended skill transfer programs through digital platforms and other innovative means.\n\n【10】In our previous study， we documented the impact of Manyata training on the effective management of pregnancy and childbirth-related complications， PPH， and PE/E. Since the staff nurses of private healthcare facilities are the key beneficiaries， their experiences and perceptions of the Manyata training program， along with their head consultants and assessors， were gathered and documented. All the beneficiaries strongly valued the Manyata training program for building their capacity for complications management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.However， this program is not just committed to reducing preventable maternal complications and mortality but also to improving the overall quality of maternal and child health care.\n\n【11】We believe that a comprehensive understanding of the overall development of the clinical skills and professional behaviors of staff nurses will provide a holistic impact of the Manyata training program. Therefore， this study demonstrates how the knowledge and skills of staff nurses have improved from pre- to post-training implementation and how well the beneficiaries have received the Manyata training program as evaluated through their pre- and post-training scores for some of the important standards covered， and their in-depth feedback data analysis.\n\n【12】Methods\n\n【13】Study design\n\n【14】This is a mixed-method study done to achieve greater insight into the impact of the Manyata training program on ensuring quality， safe and respectful maternity care in private healthcare facilities.\n\n【15】Study setting and duration\n\n【16】Bengaluru-based ARTIST institute， through its FOGSI-Manyata skill transfer training initiative， has covered over 200 private healthcare facilities from different states in India. The staff from these facilities was oriented on the 16 Manyata clinical standards through the presentation， practical demonstrations， and role plays on digital platforms . The facilities were then assessed by FOGSI lead assessors and received a quality-of-care seal by FOGSI-Manyata if they had compliance with more than 85% of clinical standards.\n\n【17】Study participants\n\n【18】A cluster of 10 private healthcare facilities from one state in each geographical region， North， West， South， and East (Punjab， Maharashtra，TamilNadu，Bihar)， who enrolled for Manyata training， were included. A group of 4 nurses from each hospital participated in the Kahoot! quiz.\n\n【19】For the qualitative part of the study， 22 to 24 staff nurses， and9 head consultants were selected from these private facilities for focus group discussions and in-depth interviews， respectively. Five assessors were also included for in-depth interviews. The participants were selected using a purposive sampling approach in steps that are described in detail in our previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Data collection and analysis\n\n【21】Kahoot! a game-based learning platform that was launched in2013， was used to assess the proportion of participants with correct answers for questions based on certain clinical care standards. The pre- and post-training responses for four important questions are focused upon in this study. These are Q1： Glucose test in pregnancy has to be done for all women in non-fasting； Q2： AMTSL for all cases； Q3： Diazepam is the choice for eclampsia management； Q4： Plotting of partograph should be started from 4 cm dilatation of the cervix The pre- and post-training responses of participants were recorded electronically. Data appeared as a report on an excel sheet with the collective percentage (%) of scores for that region. The data analysis was done using STATA/SE 15.1 software and Microsoft Excel. The results were analyzed for the mean difference in the percentage of the correct answer before and after training and statistical significance was calculated using paired t-test.\n\n【22】In addition， their overall professional behavior change was explored through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) with them and In-Depth Interviews (IDIs) with their head consultants and assessors. The interview transcripts were analyzed manually using qualitative thematic analysis. The qualitative data collection and analysis are described in detail in our previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Ethical approval\n\n【24】Ethical approval for the study was taken from the Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). All the necessary and relevant documents were submitted to the Ethics Committee. Verbal consent for participation was requested after explaining that participation in the study was entirely voluntary， and confidentiality and anonymity would be strictly maintained. Written consent from the study participants was also obtained through Google forms\n\n【25】Results Quantitative analysis\n\n【26】Improvement in knowledge as highlighted by Kahoot reports：The pre- and post-training scores represent the percentage of correct answers before and after the training， respectively.\n\n【27】As shown in Figures 2， the proportion of participants with correct answers for all questions (representing important clinical standards) has increased post-training in all four states. The pre-training scores of Bihar and Puniab were much lower as compared to the other two states (Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu)， particularly for question related to glucose testing for pregnant women. The proportion of participants with correct answers was as low as 16.7% before training which increased to 89.4% post-training for Q1 in Bihar . The maximum percentage increase was observed in Bihar which was437%， 99%， and 222%， for questions 1， 2 and 4 respectively. Of all the states， Tamil Nadu had reported the highest pre-training scores for most of the standards studied， which further improved to 100%post-training for the standards related to glucose testing and plotting ofpartograph for pregnant women .\n\n【28】As shown in Figure 3， the statistical hypotheses were tested to determine whether the results were statistically significant using paired t-tests.\n\nThe analysis of pre- and post-training results of all participants for all questions revealed a significant improvement in the mean percentage of correct answers from 42.5% before training to 82.9%after training with a mean difference of 40.4% with p<0.001 (Figure|删除段之间换行|3a). Similarly， the difference in the mean percentage of correct answers before and after training was found to be statistically significant with p value <0.05 for each state independently.\n\n【30】These results demonstrate a significant improvement in the knowledge and skills of the participants from all the states in different geographical regions for all standards covered in the Manyata training program.\n\n【31】Qualitative analysis\n\n【32】Positive impact on overall functioning as explored by qualitative data analysis： In alignment with the findings from the pre- and post-test scores of the participant， the qualitative analysis of FGDs with staff nurses， and IDIs with head consultants and assessors also highlighted a strong positive impact of the training program on the beneficiaries.\n\n【33】The themes that have emerged out of our qualitative data demonstrate the most significant effects of training on staff nurses and their clinical practice can be summed up as improved motivation to upgrade themselves and others， enhanced practical knowledge and skills， an increased sense of recognition and self-worth， respectful maternity care， overall improved maternal outcomes .\n\n【34】Motivated to upgrade themselves and other\n\n【35】As perone ofthe assessors， one big challenge influencing maternal outcomes is the motivation of the head of the facility who can， in turn， motivate the staff to learn and improve by taking up training and make the learning a continuous process. The perception of the relevance of training to overcome competency-related challenges is a key motivating factor that can make a difference.\n\n【36】“The motivation of the center head that is he or she has to be really motivated so that they allow these girls， the students to attend the training sessions correctly and then they have to have a recap in their own spare facility so that these girls actually understand the practical aspects of that. And it’s basically not a one-day teaching， it has to be like ongoing(Assessor 2).\n\n【37】Now， they realized the importance of plotting a partogram and were able to keep a check on the progress of labor through it. They felt more competent and alert than before in diagnosing and managing complicated stages at an early stage.\n\n【38】“Partogram has been very useful to us. By plotting partogram， we come to know about the complete situation of the patient and this has helped us a lot. (Nurse 1 FGD1).\n\n【39】Sense of recognition and self-worth\n\n【40】All the staff nurses stated that their sense of involvement and responsibility had increased manifold which helped them in carrying out their roles and duties effectively. They acknowledged the recognition they received as they applied their learnings from the course to their practice. They not only upskilled themselves but also trained their junior/new staff that offered a huge boost to their sense of self-worth.\n\n【41】“Post training， we do whatever we have learnt during the training and after that we inform the madam. We do all the preparations in advance.\"(N3，FGD 1).\n\n【42】Respectful maternity care\n\n【43】Respectful maternity care during pregnancy and childbirth is not only an important component of quality of care but also every woman has a right to receive it. Head consultants have noticed an improvement in the communication skills of their staff nurses and were elated about the fact that their staff now regularly practiced respectful maternity care and engaged in clinical counseling with the patients.\n\n【44】“Sometimes it happens， no， the patient attendant is not very patient， they try to impose “so there they used to get aggressive\". But after this training， most of the time I see that they try to make them understand. They do whatever the attendants are wanting， they dont just blast on them， and the behavior has become very different. When the mother (or a companion) wants to stay with the patient and all those things， they try to console them\". (HC 6).\n\n【45】Improved maternal outcomes\n\n【46】While most of the head consultants reported that the overall upgraded functioning of their health facilities has received more positive responses from the patients， two of them also highlighted a significant improvement in maternal morbidity and mortality， since the inception of Manyata training.\n\n【47】“The morbidity is reduced and undoubtedly you can see the result， the mortality in the whole country and also in our own region， has come down significantly since this Manyata (training) has been rolled in\". (HC 3).\n\n【48】Discussion\n\n【49】Every human has the right to the highest achievable standard of healthcare. In one of the previous studies， Tripathi et al. documented the poor quality of maternal care， particularly in complications management， in private healthcare facilities analyzed for baseline assessments conducted for the Manyata training in three states of India. Nearly half (47.1%) of all staff nurses in maternity care services at these private medical facilities were found to be underqualified in the baseline assessment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， research conducted on the quality of maternal and child care in private medical facilities in India is limited. It becomes imperative to identify and address the quality gaps in maternity care in the private sector as well， in order to significantly improve maternal and perinatal survival and overall health.\n\n【50】Upskilling of healthcare staff， and improving their competence through training is essential for not only strengthening the quality of antenatal care but also improving maternal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO) is an anticonvulsant which is recommended for use to prevent and treat pre-eclampsia/eclampsia， but is being underutilized and not widely adopted in practice， mostly in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). The provider competence and confidence in administering MgSO， is one of the major factors limiting its use for PE/E prevention as well as treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Active Management of the Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL)， which includes administration ofuterotonics (preferred oxytocin) just after delivery， is of utmost importance for the prevention of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. A recent study has reported low skills of healthcare providers as compared to their knowledge on Active Management of Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL) and has recommended continous in-service training for them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\nIn our study， the knowledge and competency of staff nurses|删除段之间换行|around basic aspects of maternal clinical care such as appropriate blood pressure measurement， the glucose test， and plotting of partograph， which are known to be associated with better outcomes， was found to be poor as suggested by their pre-training knowledge assessment scores. Manyata training program has provided one such opportunity for these staff nurses to enhance their knowledge as well as skills on 16 clinical standards， ensuring the provision of quality and safe maternity care services. Based on the pre- and post-training scores captured for four standards from four different geographical areas， the knowledge and skills of staff nurses have improved significantly after the implementation of the Manyata training program. As shown in Figure 2， there is a significant increase in the proportion of participants with correct answers post-training in all four states， however， the impact varied from state to state. The maximum percentage increase was observed in Bihar for questions1， 2， and 4 which are focused on standards related to glucose testing， practicing AMTSL， and plotting partograph for all pregnant cases， respectively. It was observed that the proportion of participants with correct answers was as low as 16.7% before training which increased to 89.4% post-training for one of these standards， which explains the highest percentage increase in Bihar of all the states. On the other hand， Tamil Nadu had the highest proportion of participants giving the correct answers during both pre- and post-training assessments， leading to a 100% result post-training for some of the questions. Our data is aligned with the previous findings which suggest that there is a vast disparity in the key health indicators and the outcomes across the states in India， with Bihar among the worst and Tamil Nadu as one of the best-performing states in terms of maternal and child health indicators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. However， our results demonstrate that the Manyata training program has been a game changer in terms of improving the knowledge and skills of all the participants， irrespective of the states and geographical regions they belong to .\n\n【52】Ourqualitative analysisSalso suggests their strengthened professionalism in overall functioning at the workplace. The impact of the Manyata training program was found to be positively associated with the motivation levels of head consultants and nurses， to upskill themselves and their team members. Their motivation， in turn， led to improved practical knowledge and skills which helped them with in performing their duties effectively. Their enhanced confidence helped them develop a sense of self-worth and belonging at the workplace which also developed a positive outlook and encouraged cooperative behavior with their patients， enabling the provision of respectful and quality maternity care to them，ultimatelyleading to overall improved maternal outcomes .\n\n【53】Conclusion\n\nThe practical knowledge and competency of staff nurses related to basic aspects of antenatal care such as appropriate blood pressure measurement， the glucose test， and plotting of partograph were found to be suboptimal before training. Our study demonstrates that the Manyata training program has led to a significant improvement in the knowledge and skills of all the participants， irrespective of the states and geographical regions they belong to. The collective learning through these interactive sessions on a digital platform that connected nurses from different facilities， not only made it an interesting process but also provided a competitive environment that motivated them further to outperform.

Research in patients with cerebral palsy undergoing cell therapy has shown improvements in the functionality and quality of life of patients. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is an essential tool that may objectively evaluate the morphological changes in the cerebral tracts after this kind of intervention.\n\n【2】Description of Cases： Three children with a medical history of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were presented. These patients were treated with intrathecalautologous bone marrow total nucleated cells. All three patients demonstrated clinical improvements in their neurological functions. Additionally， fMRI was performed 6， 9， and 10 months， respectively， after the intervention. An increase in anisotropy fraction was observed when evaluated by specialized MRI radiologists， which correlated with their improvements.\n\n【3】Discussion： It has been demonstrated that hematopoietic progenitor cells promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis in brain tissue affected by hypoxic-ischemic injury. This report seeks to add the idea of using fMRI to evaluate improvements after interventions where stem cells are used.

They received intrathecal autologous BM-TNCs after three days of Bone Marrow(BM) stimulation with Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF).

Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome was treated with NCPAP and caffeine； ductus arteriosus was hemodynamically significant and treated with ibuprofen and pulmonary hyperinflation.\n\n【15】Transfontanelar Ultrasound (TUS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrate grade 3 intraventricular hemorrhage and multicystic encephalopathy with the right cerebral hemisphere involved. The patient was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for 3 months. Afterward， he was diagnosed with spastic quadriparesis CP. He was not able to achieve cephalic and body trunk support， neither to feed on his own， did not communicate or interact with the environment， and was unable to follow objects with his eyes.\n\n【16】An fMRI was performed before the procedure. BM was stimulated with G-CSF at a subcutaneous dose of 10 ug/kg/day for 3 consecutive days. On the 4h day， a BM collection was performed under sedation in both posterosuperior-superior iliac crests. A volume of 8 ml/kg of weight was aspirated. The BM was centrifuged， and the buffy coat was isolated and administered IT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The number of BM-TNC cells infused was 89.76×10°CD34+ cells， as measured by flow cytometry.\n\n【17】Ten months after the therapy， he has full head and trunk support， crawling with limb support， executes simple orders， takes objects with both hands， with a predominance of the right hand， babbling， socializing， and interacting with their surroundings.\n\n【18】Baseline and control MRI comparison showed characteristics of periventricular leukomalacia secondary to a hypoxic-ischemic event， with no significant changes between the two studies. The first fMRI showed intact corticospinal tracts， with decreased thickness and size at the corona radiata level， without evident changes when comparing both studies. However， an increased anisotropy was documented in the fMRI， which was more evident in the left corona radiata. These findings correlate with the clinical improvements observed in the patient.\n\n【19】Case 2\n\nA 30-month-old female，31 weeks of gestational age， 1，800 grams of weight， Apgar score 5/7 at 1/5 min； neonatal respiratory distress|删除段之间换行|syndrome was treated with CPAP.\n\nTUS and MRI： Cortical and coronal decrease of the corpus callosum， intraventricular hemorrhage， and enlargement of the subarachnoid spacein the frontallobes.

Tractography showed intact corticospinal tracts， with decreased fiber thickness at the corona radiata level without evident differences between studies. In addition， DTI was performed， comparing the anisotropy fraction， demonstrating an increase in the values of the 2nd study， which is more evident at the left posterior limb of the internal capsule level. Like the first patient， these findings correlated with the clinical improvement she presented.\n\n【24】Case 3\n\n【25】A 22-month-old female， born at 41 weeks， 3，850 grams ofweight， Apgar score of 2/4 at 1/5 min， 5/7 at 10/15 min. Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome was treated with mechanical ventilation for seven days and then with CPAP， parenteral nutrition by central venous access， and enteral feeding for 23 days.\n\n【26】TUS and MRI： Multicystic encephalomalacia， diagnosed with HIE with CP spastic quadriparesis and developmental delay. Clinically， without head and trunk support， poor management of respiratory secretions， feed by gastrostomy， absence of communication abilities， neither interaction with the environment， and inability to follow obiects.\n\n【27】Autologous BM TNCs were delivered IT the same way as the patients described above. The total amount of BM TNCs infused was11.76×10° ofCD34+ cells， as measured by flow cytometry.\n\n【28】Six months later， the patient could reduce the anticonvulsant dose per kilo of weight， interact with the environment， and has a social smile.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】TNCs have a minimal capacity for transdifferentiation into neurons compared with other progenitor cells. So， how can we explain the improvement of patients with therapy? Evidence suggests that the benefits obtained through treatments such as this one is due to immunomodulatory effects since they migrate to sites where there is inflammation and cell damage and have a chemotactic impact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， secrete many bioactive molecules that promote cell regeneration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【31】This has been evidenced by the fact that this type of cell has been used successfully in therapies of another nature， where the damaged tissue is not of the hematopoietic lineage， such as neurons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， skeletal muscles， and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Conventional imaging methods have not proved to be useful for objectively measuring improvements in patients with CP. The fMRI is a more sensitive and invaluable tool that can impartially dimension the changes and improvements after stem cell therapy. In addition， this can give us better evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis.\n\n【33】Because CP does not have a conventional or specific treatment owing to its complexity and does not boost regardless of standard treatments， as rehabilitation， stem cell therapy could be a therapeutic option to improve the quality of life of these patients and their families.\n\nWe decided to use the IT route as the route of administration for several reasons. Although the IV route is better in terms of safety，|删除段之间换行|the number of cells administered IV that can cross the blood-brain barrier still needs to be clarified. In addition， it must be considered a loss of cells distributed in other organs (e.g.， liver， lung， etc.) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. When cells are administered IT， more of these cells are concentrated in the hypoxic areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The IT route has proven to be safe and tolerated， with side effects such as fever， headache，nausea， vomiting， and stiffness of the neck， which do not last for more than six days删除4-1:<u>5，12</u>.\n\n【35】fMRI is a tool that can objectively identify changes and improvements after cell therapy， as in the 3 patients mentioned above. Unfortunately， conventional imaging methods have not proven to be very useful since the size of ischemia or edema reduction does not directly correlate with the clinical improvements observed in patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Currently， more sophisticated methods such as fMRI， which， through anisotropy， is more sensitive and allows analysis of the restructuration of the white matter and its fascicles，provide more evidence of neurogenesis and angiogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Although that brain fMRI did not show evidence of morphological changes， an increase in the anisotropy fraction of the cortical tract was found compared to the study performed before treatment . Furthermore， it was also observed an increase in white matter formation.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】CP is a condition that does not improve despite current treatments. The application of BM-TNC can enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis in affected hypoxic-ischemic brain tissue， which could result in an alternative treatment for patients with this condition. This was demonstrated by fMRI in the cases above and can become a powerful tool to obiectively evaluate changes in the central nervous system， specifically in the white matter tracts. However， this must be confirmed in large， comparative， randomized， blinded studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

His past medical history was unremarkable. He had no risk factors for venous thromboembolism and reported no systemic symptoms. He had no drug allergies and took daily tamsulosin. He has a performance status of 0， and lived with his wife， working full time as a site manager. He was a current smoker， with a pack history of 30 years.\n\n【4】Respiratory and abdominal examination was unremarkable. Heart sounds were normal with no additional murmurs. All peripheral pulses were present and equal. Blood pressure was 124/65. There was no chest wall tenderness and his calves were soft and non-tender.\n\n【5】Investigations\n\n【6】Full blood count was normal； renal function was within normal limits， and a Troponin of 4 ng/L(within normal range). Lactate was not elevated. Electrocardiogram on admission showed a left bundlebranch block with no dynamic change on serial studies. Chest radiograph was unremarkable.\n\n【7】CT angiogram did not show any evidence ofaortic aneurysms， filling defect， stricture， narrowing or dissection. All branches of the thoracic and abdominal aorta were well-opacified. However， a 30mm arterially enhancing lesion in the liver located between the falciform ligament and the left lobe of the liver was noted， along with multiple arterially enhancing peritoneal nodules.\n\n【8】Differential diagnosis\n\n【9】The differential for multiple， arterially enhancing lesions witting the abdomen and thorax lies within the spectrum of a malignant aetiology， with a differential lying between a haematological malignancy， such as lymphoma， and disseminated solid organ malignancy.\n\n【10】Outcome and follow up\n\n【11】On review of the images， it was noted that the nodule bore similar enhancement characteristics to the spleen which was it lobulated and small. There were subtle abnormal appearances of the inferior left ribs and right iliac crest. This raised the possibility of primary trauma with nodules described representing intraabdominal and intrahepatic splenosis rather than primary malignancy.\n\n【12】A denatured red blood cell scan was suggested  This demonstrated a small splenic residue lying posteriorly in the left upper quadrant， multiple peritoneal nodules over the diaphragm， surface of the liver and in the anterior abdominal wall， all of which showed high scintigraphic activity. These were felt likely to be splenunculi. On further questioning the patient reported ahistory of abdominal trauma as a teenager when he underwent a partial splenectomy after splenic rupture. No further follow up was required.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Splenosis is defined as heterotopic implantation of splenic fragments following splenectomy or splenic trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It can occur anywhere within the abdomen. The incidence of splenosis has been quoted as between 56% to 67% in patients following a traumatic splenic injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Splenosis， as a relatively asymptomatic condition， often goes undiagnosed， with the majority of cases being diagnosed at a later date； the mean time interval from splenectomy to detection of splenosis being 25 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\nThe pathophysiology is thought to be due to either direct seeding of splenic tissue or haematogenous spread. Radiological assessment is complicated by the fact that on CT， splenosis appears much like malignancy， with arterially enhancing soft tissue deposits. However，|删除段之间换行|the use of denatured red blood cells with Tc-99m labelling utilises the functionally of the reticuloendothelial system in order to localise and characterise ectopic splenic tissue.

Crucially， there needs to be clinical suspicion as to the nature of the lesion in order to allow appropriate investigation to be requested in order to avert the need for exploratory surgery.\n\n【17】Splenosis may be associated with bowel obstruction due to compression or lesion torsion.

There are less than 10 reported cases of orbital myxofibrosarcoma. The authors report a case of a patient with a previous resected low-grade myxofibrosarcoma in the right orbit， who 16-years later presented with the same tumor. This first recurrence was resected， leaving a residual mass. Two years later， the patient presented with an extensive mass in the right orbit， sinuses， and nasal cavities. The histopathological examination showedhigh-grade myxofibrosarcoma. The patient underwent palliative radiotherapy and palliative care. The risk of metastasis ofthis type of tumor depends on the degree ofhistological differentiation. But local recurrence rate is similar for all with an increase of metastasis risk with every recurrence. Due to the few cases reported there are no standardized management guidelines. However， it is recommended wide surgical margins be associated with postoperative radiotherapy in the presence of residual lesions or high-grade tumors.\n\n【2】Keywords： Myxofibrosarcoma； Orbital； Proptosis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is the most common type of fibroblastic sarcoma in elderly patients. It is a slow-growing mesenchymal tumor that usually occurs in the extremities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Its orbital location is extremely rare as there are few cases described in the literature at the moment of this review. Therefore， there are notreatments guidelines available for this disease， thus the authors present this case of a recurrent orbital myxofibrosarcoma in order to collaborate towards future studies and this orbital tumor management.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 73-year-old woman presented with a 5-month painful right proptosis and a same-side Ipro exodeviation. Her past medical history was significant for a right orbital mass resection reported by an external hospital as a low-grade myxofibrosarcoma 16 years earlier. Her other medical background included arterial hypertension， dyslipidemia， fibromyalgia， essential tremor， suspended tobacco use， and she had been treated for a depressive episode. The patient was taking atorvastatin and sertraline， at the moment of presentation.\n\n【7】On the first physical examination， she presented with an obvious right exophthalmos and exotropia . Uncorrected visual acuity was 20/150 in the Right Eye (RE) and 20/20 in the Left Eye (LE). Intraocular pressure was normal in both eyes. Slit-lamp examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination revealed a congested right optic disc.\n\n【8】Computerized Tomography scans (CTs) revealed a thrombosed right orbital vascular malformation and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) revealed an orbital mass with a vascularized component in the internal portion of the right orbit .\n\n【9】Considering the patient's background， a relapse of the original tumor was suspected. Thus， a transcaruncular orbitotomy with excisional biopsy of the lesion was performed. The mass was lobular and solid in appearance， of medial location， and deep extension， almost reaching the orbital apex. Due to the lesion size， it was necessary to widen the surgical field with a vertical division of the upper eyelid at 5 mm from the superior punctum. The resected mass was 50 mmx30mmx19mm .\n\n【10】cited.\n\nHistologic examination revealed fused cells， ofelongated， oval， round nuclei， some pleomorphic and hyperchromatic， eosinophilic cytoplasm， mitotic count of 1 to 3 in 10 fields of higher magnification.Stroma with mild to moderate inflammatoryelements of lymphocyte type， congestive|删除段之间换行|vascularization， hyalinized fibrosis， myxoid areas. No necrosis was found.Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor cells was positive for vimentin， desmin， ki-67 positive in 10% of the nucleuses and CD34 in 80% of the cells negative for S100 and actine. These features were suggestive of low-grade myxofibrosarcoma.\n\n【12】Due to the presence of tumor in the surgical margin of the biopsy a post-surgical CT was done， which confirmed the presence of a residual mass. This case was presented to the oncology committee to evaluate the need for exenteration of coadjuvant therapy. Consensus was not reached. Therefore， no further procedures were done.\n\nThe patient stayed asymptomatic during medical follow-up for two years， after that period， the patient presented with two-week paresthesia of the right orbital region， progressive exophthalmos， and a recurrent nosebleed from the same side. On examination， the patient showed greater proptosis in the right eye. The evaluation by otolaryngology revealed a nasal cavity mass. Resonance revealed an extensive mass centered in the perinasal cavities of about 60 mmx50 mm x 62 mm. The tumor occupied the ethmoid cells， maxillary|删除段之间换行|sinus， and part of the right orbit， with intraconal involvement， and which posteriorly extended to the sphenoid sinus， compressing the cavernous sinus .\n\n【14】Through the nasal passage， a new biopsy was performed. It was diagnosed as high-grade myxofibrosarcoma. The case was presented again to the oncology committee， along the lesion was out of surgical reach. It was decided that palliative care management and palliative radiotherapy was the best option for this patient.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS)， previously called malignant myxoid fibrous histiocytoma， is one of the most common fibroblastic sarcomas in elderlypatients (20%). It is a slow-growing mesenchymal tumor that usually occurs in the extremities， and its orbital location is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the literature there are less than 10 reported cases of orbital myxofibrosarcoma， however， it is likely that there is an underreporting due to the change in its nomenclature in recent years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-10\\]</u>. In 2002， the World Health Organization modified the classification of MFS， so that part of the previously reported orbital Malignant Fibrous Histiocytomas (MFH) could correspond to the same entity， unlike other subtypes of FMH (pleomorphic， giant cell and inflammatory) that did not represent a defined entity通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. Characteristics of the previous studies are summarized in Supplementary Table 1； however it was not possible to find the full article of the work by Imai et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The clinical behavior of myxofibrosarcomas is related to the degree of histological differentiation. Low-grade tumors have a low probability of metastasizing (20%)， however the local recurrence rate is similar for all tumor grades， with rates ranging between 17% and60%， and with each new recurrence the risk of metastasis recurrence increases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，8，13，14\\]</u>. The high rates of local recurrence could be explained by the frequent vascular extension of the tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Recent studies have shown that the only significant predictor of local recurrence risk is the surgical margin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Risk factors associated with disease-specific mortality are size greater than 5 cm， tumor necrosis， and <75% myxoid component on histology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Compared to other soft tissue sarcomas， MFS have better survival， since a 5-year survival rate is estimated at 64% to 77% in high-grade MFS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\nManaging these patients is a real challenge. The described infiltrative character makes it very difficult to define the tumor margins， increasing the probability of residual lesions and therefore of local recurrence.In addition，each recurrence increases the probability of having higher-grade lesions， and therefore of metastasizing. The few cases reported to date do not allow for standardized management|删除段之间换行|guidelines， but in general， resection with wide surgical margins is recommended， associated with postoperative radiotherapy in the presence of residuallesions or high-grade tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Recently， the state of Andhra Pradesh Visakhapatnam saw the largest styrene gas leak into the atmosphere， which LG Polymer India Company Limited caused. The LG Polymers Company produces plastics， polyesters， synthetic rubber，latex paints， and coatings. This paper discusses the risks associated with a styrene gas leak occurrence.\n\n【2】Keywords： MIC； Benzene； Hazards； Styrene； Gas leakage；Polyesters\n\n【3】Introduction Methyl Isocyanate， or MIC\n\n【4】The most significant tragedy in India occurred a few years ago， on December 2， 1984， when workers at the Union Carbide facility in Bhopal， India， were exposed to methyl isocyanate gas. The eyes， respiratory system， and skin were a few of the major organs. Acute irritating effects on the eyes and respiratory system were significant results.\n\n【5】Methyl isocyanate is a white liquid with a strong scent. Its molecular weight is 57.1， soluble in water and methylamine， and it breaks down into carbon dioxide when heated to its boiling point of39°C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

According to the results of several in vitro and in vivo investigations， the MIC gas had a 76% risk of being a genotoxic carcinogen， according to the studys authors. Negative assays in that test showed high specificity and low sensitivity， whereas positive assays had low specificity and high sensitivity. It suggests a mild to moderate carcinogenicity. Finally， the authors concluded that the MIC in this situation was an animal carcinogen due to its low potency. In a different research， an examination of the population-based cancer registry in Bhopal identified a relative risk of lung， buccal cavity， and oropharyngeal cancers. Because of tobacco usage， the ICMR Cancer Institute observed increased lung cancer rates and impacted parts of the tongue， mouth， and esophagus. Finally， the living style and other biological characteristics may lessen the danger of MIC exposure， according to research by the Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital and Research Center (JNCHRC) conducted in Bhopal.

Numerous individuals were affected， and 12 people died. This gas influences thousands of individuals within|删除段之间换行|a 5-kilometer radius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. One of the most significant monomers in the contemporary petrochemical sector is styrene. In the year 1930， it was created. The most significant polymeric compounds made using styrene are polystyrene， styrene-acrylonitrile， and others. Styrene is mainly manufactured in the industry by dehydrogenating the ethylbenzene method. Styrene is a gaseous， liquid substance with no color and a strong smell. Styrene， sometimes referred to as vinyl benzene， is a crucial industrial chemical molecule utilized in producing a wide range of industrial resins， incuding polystyrene and hundreds of copolymers. One of the most significant monomers in the contemporary petrochemical sector is styrene. In the year1930， it was created. Most polymeric compounds produced with styrene include polystyrene，styrene-acrylonitrile，and others. Styrene is mainly manufactured in the industry by the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.\n\n【14】Styrene is a gaseous， liquid substance with no color and a strong smell. Styrene was initially identified in 1831 as a Storax balsam distillation byproduct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Its molecular mass is 104.15， and its chemical formula is CH.CH=CH，. Water， ethanol， Benzene， and petroleum ether have a small amount of solubility in styrene. A substance having a high boiling point is styrene. The organic molecule styrene has the chemical formula C H. It is kept as a liquid in industries， but as it readily evaporates， it must be kept at low temperatures. One of the most significant monomers in the contemporary petrochemical sector is styrene. Polystyrene， styrene-acrylonitrile， and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene are the three most significant polymeric compounds produced primarily from styrene(ABS). Styrene can be found in consumer goods， including drinking cups，insulation forwiring and appliances， fiberglass， plastic pipes，and vehicle parts. Styrene from the Hazards gas was recently discovered to have spilled in Vizag on May 7h，删除4:<u> 2020</u>. Numerous individuals were affected， and 12 people died. This gas influences thousands of people within a 5-kilometer radius 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Preparation of styrene\n\n【16】From Ethvl Benzene： Most styrene monomer is made from ethyl benzene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， and virtually all ethyl benzene generated globally is used to make styrene. Because ofthis， the two processes are frequently quite interwoven. A Friedel-Crafts reaction between Benzene and ethylene produces ethylbenzene. Originally， this process employed aluminum chloride as a catalyst， but in contemporary manufacture， zeolite has taken its place.\n\n【17】Bydehydrogenation： Total styrene producedby the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene is 80%. Using superheated steam and over an iron (III) oxide catalyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Finally， the crude product of ethylbenzene is purified by the distillation method. The differences in the boiling point between the two compounds were only 90°C at ambient pressure use of a series of distillation columns. It is complicated by the tendency of monomers to undergo thermally induced into polystyrene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Synthesis of polystyrene\n\n【20】The polymerization of the styrene monomer creates polystyrene during its production. Styrene can be polymerized via free radical， anionic， and cationic reactions， as well as employing metal catalysts in this process.\n\nIndustrial gas leakage： Aswe consider the LG Polymers|删除段之间换行|accident in Vizag， memories of the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster of 1984immediately emerge. The same disregard for human life， the same disregard for conventional operating protocols， and the same absence of emergency measures. Recently， a gas leak was discovered in Vishakhapatnam， Andhra Pradesh. Numerous hazardous industries are located in the port city of Vizag， also known as Vishakhapatnam， which is found in the state of Andhra Pradesh on the southeast coast of India. The alarming news of a toxic chemical leak from a plant producing polystyrene-based products located about 15 km awayon the outskirts of the city at a private plastic manufacturing plant owned by LG Polymers Pvt. Ltd. rudely awakened five million residents of the Vizag Metropolitan Region on May 7t， 2020， early in the morning. The styrene gas leak in Vishakhapatnam resulted in severe dyspnea. Up to this point， roughly 12 persons and 32 animals have perished from being exposed to deadly styrene vapors that escaped from the factory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Over 800 of the estimated 1000+ victims of injuries who resided in nearby communities within a six-kilometer radius had to be hospitalized. A further 4，000 people were able to leave the area unharmed after being alerted to evacuate in time by a few volunteers. Nearly 10，000 more locals were compelled to flee their houses in a panic删除4:<u> 14</u>.\n\n【22】The death toll might have been far worse if the extremely combustible styrene vapors caught fire and the massive amount of styrene monomer housed in the plant's two giant tanks had been released. Most people living in the Vizag Metropolitan region are fortunate to have escaped the most recent calamity unhurt because， miraculously， that did not occur. Although styrene is much less toxic than MIC (Methyl-Iso-Cyanate)， the chemical that had caused the Bhopal disaster in 1984， the enormous amount of styrene that had been stored at the plant at the time of the disaster (reportedly about7，000 kiloliters compared to the 80 kiloliters of MIC at Bhopal) did have the potential to cause a massive disaster in the Vizag region that would have had much worse (Fortunately， the remaining styrene monomer in the concerned tank has been deactivated， and on May11h，2020， 5，000 kiloliters from the plant's unaffected tanks was sent back to Seoul.) Styrene is invisible， heavier than air， and very combustible. The Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for styrene， as defined by the safety guidelines established by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)， is 20 pp， TWA (Time Tested Average) for an exposure duration of eight hours. The Short-Term Exposure Level (STEL) for styrene for fifteen minutes is 40 ppm\\[by comparison， the TLV of MIC is 0.02 ppm\\] (parts per million). While the Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health (IDLH) dose of styrene is around 700 ppm， according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH)，USA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Styrene mayenter the body of a human by breathing， ingesting food， and skin contact. Styrene takes a few days to degrade into other compounds and pass through urine after entering the human body. Styrene impacts the stomach and eyes when it is introduced to people. Long-term impacts include central nervous system dysfunction， depression， hearing loss， and peripheral neuropathy. If exposed to styrene gas for extended periods， they risk leukemia and headaches. Styrene exposure at work has been the subject of studies， although those results have not been definitive. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has proved styrene to have low to moderate toxicity by inhalation and oral exposure in experiments， including acute exposure of rats and mice. In animal studies， styrene exposure by inhalation has been linked to effects on the neurological system， liver， kidneys， and nose discomfort. Animals exposed to chromium orally affect their liver， blood， kidneys， and stomach.\n\n【23】Exposure to styrene gas\n\n【24】Chronic low-level exposure to styrene may cause cancer. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states that short-term exposure to low levels of styrene in humans can have gastrointestinal symptoms as well as mucous membrane and ocular irritation. On the other hand， prolonged exposure impacts the central nervous system， resulting inheadaches， weakness， exhaustion， hearing loss， nerve damage， and depression. Exposure to it can result in shortness of breath， respiratory issues， eye irritation， indigestion， and nausea， momentary loss of consciousness， unsteady walking， and giddiness. When styrene vapor is inhaled in large amounts， it irritates the skin， eyes， and lungs and makes breathing difficult. However， these disorders may worsen in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients and respiratory illnesses， including asthma. Exposure to styrene gas primarily affects mucosal membranes. Compared to other organic compounds， styrene takes longer to enter the blood from the lungs. According to studies， 86% of styrene that enters the body is eliminated through urine.\n\n【25】The styrene leaked in what way?\n\n【26】Humans can have gastrointestinal symptoms，mucous membrane irritation， and ocular discomfort after short-term exposure to low amounts of styrene. Styrene cannot seep into the air unless high-temperature， such as a fire or an explosion. From an LG Chem Polymers storage tank， styrene gas spilled. The plant opened its doors in 1961. In the beginning， Hindustan Polymers produced polystyrene. In 1978， it amalgamated with McDowell & Co of the UB Group， and in 1997， South Korean company LG Chem acquired and renamed it LG Polymers. Expandable polystyrene， general-purpose polystyrene， high-impact polystyrene， and engineering plastics compounds are all produced at the business. It is situated 15 kilometers outside Visakhapatnam city at RRV Puram in Gopalapatnam. A corporate representative stated that a tank with a capacity of 2，400 tones was holding 1，800 tones of styrene. The gas escaped from this tank when authorities were getting ready to reopen the plant that had been shut down for 44 days owing to the lockout. Before it could be contained， around half of the gas spilled. There are significant environmental and occupational exposures to Benzene since it has been measured in all areas of the environment and is often released in severalindustrial and transportation contexts. The most frequent exposure route is inhalation， although Benzene can contaminate food and water， quickly permeate the skin， and cause cutaneous and gastrointestinal exposures. This incident in Visakhapatnam is connected to elevated levels of Benzene and had a positive outcome.\n\n【27】Styrene monomer applications\n\nOne of the most significant monomers for industrial polymers and co-polymers， which are employed in many applications， is styrene. Plastics， latex paints and coatings， synthetic rubbers， and polyesters are the main uses for styrene monomer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The most common use of resins containing styrene monomer is in foams used as fillers and bolsters. Additionally， pipes， fittings， tanks， lighting fixtures， and corrosion-resistant items have applications in the construction industry. Artificial marble， flooring， throwaway dinnerware， and furniture made of plastic are examples of household items. Applications for transportation materials include car body putty， reinforced plastics， and tires. The vast majority of styrene is transformed into polystyrene resins， which may be easily molded and compatible with various colorants， modifiers， and fillers. The second-largest families of Styrene-Acrylonitrile (SAN) resins， co-|删除段之间换行|polymers， and adducts are used in various moldings for appliances， automobiles， buildings， pipelines， and electronics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Causes of stvrene\n\n【30】Styrene causes include a recent gas leak in Vishakhapatnam， Andhra Pradesh. In the wee hours of July 54， 2020， a leak occurred at a privately held plastic manufacturing facility operated by LG polymers Pvt. Ltd. Styrene or vinyl benzene was used to confirm the gas. It is employed in the manufacture of resins and polymers made of polystyrene. These materials are used in food packaging， rubber， plastic， etc. PVC gas is another name for it. It can enter a person's body by inhaling， eating， or skin-to-skin contact. Styrene takes a few days to degrade into other compounds and pass through urine after entering the human body. Styrene impacts the stomach and eyes when it is introduced to people. Long-term impacts include central nervous system dysfunction， depression， hearing loss， and peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【31】Styrene carcinogenicity： According to the National Toxicology Programs (NTP) to the human studies， which are based on the 2，009exposure of employees to these gases， there is only minimal evidence that styrene monomer causes cancer in people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The likelihood of developing esophageal and pancreatic cancer among these exposed monomers is also elevated； as is mortality from cancer of the lymphohematopoietic system and genetic damage in lymphocytes due to DNA adduct levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Styrene exposure and cancer in humans are linked， however， by the discovery of DNA adducts and chromosomal abnormalities in lymphocytes from the exposed individuals.\n\n【32】Applications of polystyrene\n\n【33】In addition to being used for packing， polystyrene is used to make furniture，refrigerators， and other toys. Furthermore， the co-polymers of ABS and SAN are primarily utilized in transportation， watercraft， and the medical industry. The principal application for polystyrene foam is an insulating material for heat-sensitive goods.\n\n【34】Benzene\n\n【35】Colorless and combustible， Benzene has a lovely smell. When exposed to air， it swiftly evaporates. It serves primarily as a rav material for producing other chemicals， including plastics， rubber， dyes， medicines， lubricants， and insecticides. Additionally， it was frequently employed as an industrial solvent. Along with gasoline， cigarettes， and crude oil， Benzene is a naturally occurring component of all three.\n\n【36】Exposure locations\n\n【37】This viewpoint mentions a few locations， including the rubber industry， oil refineries， chemical factories， and gasoline-related businesses.\n\n【38】Health effects\n\n【39】This substance has the potential to be hazardous. These impacts are listed below if exposure to it can have immediate and long-term adverse health effects.\n\n【40】Short-term consequences\n\nDizziness， headaches， tremors， disorientation， and unconsciousness are short-term side effects. The neurological system can be impacted by benzene inhalation at significant concentrations. High doses of Benzene can make you throw up， make your stomach hurt， make you sleepy， and make your heart beat quickly. However，|删除段之间换行|eating or breathing very high levels of Benzene can be fatal. Benzene usuallyirritates the skin， eyes，and throat when exposed to it. Redness on the skin might happen after exposure to Benzene.\n\n【42】Long-term consequences\n\n【43】The soft inside of bones， called the bone marrow， is where new blood cells are primarily harmed by exposure to Benzene. One possible outcome is anemia (which can cause a person to feel weak and tired.) Low platelet count删除4:<u> 2</u>. (Which can lead to excess bruising and bleeding).删除4:<u> 3</u>. Alow white blood cell count， potentially fatal， might make the body less able to fight infections.\n\n【44】Carcinogenicity of benzene\n\n【45】International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)： Benzene is carcinogenic. It belongs to the WHO. Based on adequate evidence that Benzene causes Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)， Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)， Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(CLL)， and multiple myeloma， the IARC has classified Benzene as carcinogenic to humans.\n\n【46】The National Toxicology Program (NTP) has also designated Benzene as a substance known to cause human cancer.\n\n【47】The Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS)， a database with information on the effects of exposure to numerous environmental contaminants on human health， is maintainedby thLeeUS Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA lists Benzene as a recognized human carcinogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【48】Conclusion\n\n【49】The authors concluded by stating that all of these natural gas exposures have a negative impact on human health and， in some situations， result in fatalities. These chemical compounds were released into indoor air due to cigarette smoking and emissions from various home items. They are highly significant chemicals utilized in manufacturing a wide range of polymers， copolymers， and glass-reinforced plastics. There is also a chance of being exposed to small amounts of food. Many people were sick， and some died due to the toxic gas leak that occurred in Bhopal and Vizag. It might spread across the natural world and contaminate the air， water， animals，and even people. Therefore， we should take care of our future and defend ourselves against such risks of tragedies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Our patient had multiple vascular variants including azygos anterior cerebral artery， hypoplasia of the left A1 segment and， anterior communicating artery， aortic origin and， hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery with left main terminal branch Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA)， old occlusion of the amputated basilar artery at the top with collateral circulation by bilateral Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA) arteries and， via PICAS.\n\n【3】Discussion： The set of brain anatomical variants found in the anterior and posterior circulation and post-infarction changes via bilateral AICA and right PICA is rare in the literature， especially about the clinical presentation of the patient. Following the above， it is important to report this case due to the low prevalence of the set of anatomical variants described and the absence of similar cases described in the literature.\n\n【4】Keywords： Brain anatomical variants； Acigos artery； Brain infarction posterior circulation； Infarction basilar artery\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Anatomical variants in the central nervous system are frequent， especially in the Willis Polygon， which has a classic structure only in 20% to 25% of people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The variants can be classified as fenestrations， duplications， hypoplasia’s， agenesis， infundibular origins and， persistent communicating anomalous anastomosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】These variants are mainly found incidentally but sometimes are associated with ischemic events that tend to differ from the classically described vascular territories， the most clinically relevant variants are： 1) Bilateral infarcts by anterior Azygos and， Percheron artery 2) Infarcts of Choroidal or Heubner's arteries and，3) Stem syndromes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【8】The objective of this article is to present multiple vascular anatomical variants documented in a patient who was admitted to our hospital with a right posterior cerebral artery infarction.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 56-year-old man with a history of migraine， without cardiovascular risk factors， presented with intense holocranial headache， stabbing type， sudden loss of left peripheral vision and， left upper limb paresthesia， subsequently decreased alertness with retrograde amnesia of the event. Neurological examination showed lower left quadrantanopsy and， hypoesthesia of the left upper limb，the initial head Computed Tomography (CT) was normal .\n\n【11】Later he presented an increase of the support polygon and， lateralization in gait to the left， the Contrast-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Image (C-MRI) revealed areas of restricted diffusion in the right thalamus， posterior horns of the lateral ventricle and， right occipital lobe， compatible with acute multiple brain infarction in the right Posterior Cerebral Artery (PCA) territory . Angiotomography was performed revealing a filling defect of the Basilar Artery (AB)， absence offlow within the PCA，hypoplasia of the pre-communicating portion (A1) of the left Anterior Cerebral Artery(ACA) and， in the intracranial portion (V4) of the left Vertebral Artery (VA).\n\nAdditionally， a subsequent pan-angiography confirmed the occlusion at the top of the basilar artery， absence of the Posterior Communicating Arteries (PCoA) without direct cortical irrigation， since this irrigation was given by an extensive network of vascular collateralization to the ischemic territory from the Anteroinferior Cerebellar Arteries (AICAs) and， the right Posterior inferior Cerebellar Artery (PICA). It also noted a hypoplastic left vertebral artery with its origin at the aortic arch， hypoplasia of the left A1|删除段之间换行|segment and， absence of anterior communicating artery， with azygos system from A2 but dependent on the right ACA . Capillary and venous phases with normal characteristics， dural sinuses with flow pattern and normal appearance. Malformations of the brain parenchyma were not observed.\n\n【13】In the controls by clinical neurology at 3， 10， 13 months post-infarction， he did not present subsequent neurological deficit， his return to work (mechanical technician of industrial machinery) and social was without difficulties. The control paraclinical tests at11 months were positive antinuclear antibodies 1：320 fine granular pattern， positive antinuclear antibodies 1：320 centrosome pattern. Control images (pan-angiography， Doppler of renal arteries) and rheumatology evaluation were requested； however， as of the date of this case report， the patient has not had them performed.\n\n【14】In resume， the most relevant findings were right azygos ACA， absence of left A1 and， A2 segments， hypoplastic left VA with an aortic origin， absent ACoPs and， finally AB with distal flow occlusion and， extensive collateralization by AICAs and， PICAs allowing the necessary irrigation to the posterior cerebral circulation. The combination of these anatomical variants is infrequent and， even more so with the clinical findings of the patient， we started dual antiplatelet therapy with a diagnosis of minor cerebrovascular attack. Post-discharge follow-up was performed， without neurological deterioration，left lower quadrantanopsia persisted. Other studies are summarized in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】It is important to know the cerebral vascular anatomical variants； the presences of associated cerebral vascular anatomical infarcts or arterial variants do not usually follow the classically predetermined vascular territories 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We will deepen those variants presented in oiir case.\n\n【17】Anterior circulation\n\nACA asymmetry is present in 80% of people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Azygos ACA is a rare vascular variant (0.3% to 4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>， involves segment A2|删除段之间换行|forming a single trunk in the midline， the result of an embryological persistence of the median artery ofthe corpus callosum，radiologically is classified in 4 types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5\\]</u>， is occasionally associated with aneurysms， holoprosencephaly， neuronal migration abnormalities and， its obstruction generates a bilateral frontal syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Hypoplasia of segment A1 is reported in 10% of autopsies and complete absence in 2% of angiograms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4\\]</u>. The posterior communicating arteries may be of fetal origin， an infundibular residue， hypoplastic or unilateral absence， other types of anomalies are infrequent or have not been described通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Other anomalies of this circulation， absent in our case， include fenestration of ACA (4% of people) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Duplication of the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) (0.2% to 2.9%)， and its fenestration in less than 1% in autopsies and 0.17% in angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，4\\]</u>\n\n【21】Posterior circulation\n\nOf all ischemic strokes， the posterior circulation represents 25%and stems 10% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，9\\]</u>. Vascular variants of the posterior circulation can involve the brainstem， occipital lobes，and cerebellum， the infarcts secondary to variants are rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6\\]</u>. Additionally， 6% to10% of all strokes are initially Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)|删除段之间换行|negative， with a false-negative rate for posterior circulation strokes almost 10 times higher than that of the anterior circulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The most relevant abnormalities of this circulation are those that affect VA with asymmetry (70%)， hypoplasia (26%) and fenestration(0.3% to 2.0%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. PICA is absent unilaterally in 10% and bilateral in 2%. In 10% of people， this artery arises from the BA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The basilar variants more frequent are fenestration (0.3%to 0.6% ofangiograms)， anastomosis with Carotids (0.1%)，hypoplasia， and agenesis which are rare and almost non-existent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，6\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The PCA has an absence of P1 in 10% of people， had identified four variants depending on its origin and， 15% identified fetal PCA from the Carotid Artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Percheron artery infarcts can generate bi-thalamic compromise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This anatomical variant was absent in our presented clinical case.\n\n【25】Finally， It is also important to evaluate possible differential diagnoses with a genetic component such as Fabry， MELAS(Mitochondrial Encephalomyopathy， Lactic Acidosis，and，Stroke-like episodes)， CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and， Leukoencephalopathy) and， similar通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.

Often， these tumors will present as hematuria- which is regarded as benign. Because of this presentation， pediatric patients often are not diagnosed until years after their initial presentation. We present a 4-year-old female patient who presented initially at 6 months with progressive hematuria that ultimately ended up being diagnosed with a bladder teratoma. In conclusion， bladder teratomas should be included in the initial work-up when presenting with hematuria.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Bladder tumors are uncommon in children with an incidence of 0.1% to 0.4% during the first two decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Malignant teratomas， yolk sac tumors， and all germ cell tumors in pediatric patients are exceedingly rare and most often affect females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. There has been no specific genetics identified for bladder teratomas specifically， but there have been familial cases of ovarian teratomas identified in several subsequent generations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Teratomas are the most common germ celltumor and are defined histologically as a combination of ectoderm， mesoderm， and endoderm as well as being grossly heterogeneous with both solid and cystic features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most mature cystic teratomas are composed of ectoderm-derived epidermis， sebaceous glands and hair follicles and mesoderm-derived dermal stromal elements. However，there have been rare cases of teratomas Containing Gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium and an organized GI tract which is true in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The most common teratomas are sacrococcygeal and ovarian in origin， with bladder teratomas being exceptionallyrare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>. Teratomas are primarily asymptomatic and often found incidentally on imaging. When allowed to grow undiscovered， they have been shown to have mass effects in the affecting organ. When localized to the urinary system，teratomas have been shown to emulate bladder and ureteral calculi such as lower urinary tract symptoms， hematuria， and urinary retention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.

Although the surgical management ofthese tumors is well reported， there is no consensus on the surveillance or follow-up of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We report the case of a 4-year-old child presenting with a bladder teratoma and discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of bladder tumors in children.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】cited.\n\nThis is a 4-year-old female child， with no notable pathological history， referred from a regional hospital to our department for gross hematuria with clots. This clinical picture evolved from the age of 6 months with initial intermittent terminal hematuria then progressing to total hematuria associated withhypogastric pain. She had been hospitalized several times in different hospital systems without any definitive etiology being attributed to this hematuria before being referred. On physical examination， the patient presented with pale mucous membranes， hypogastric tenderness， and a soiled diaper with observed blood clots. A biological assessment had demonstrated a microcvtic hypochromic anemia at 4.8 g/dl with a hematocrit of 12%. An Emmel test performed came back positive. The kidney workup was unremarkable. An ultrasound of the urinary tree indicated an irregular peripheral tissue thickening of the bladder wall， vascularized by Doppler， suggesting a bladder tumor. A uroscan was performed and revealed a tumor of the bladder dome associated with right inguinal and external iliac lymph nodes . A cystoscopy under general anesthesia|删除段之间换行|b) Frontal Reconstruction\n\n【9】b) Internal Face\n\nwas performed preoperatively and revealed an ulcerative budding tumor of the dome and of the right anterolateral wall of the bladder. The surgical intervention was performed by a median infra-umbilical laparotomy and revealed a vascular tumor of the dome and of the anterolateral wall of the right bladder . We performed a partial cystectomy up to 1.5 cm of the ureteral meatus. The operative part measured 7cm×5 cm×2 cm . Postoperatively，therewas a disappearance of hematuria and anemia with a hemoglobin level of13.1 g/dl. The post-operative follow-up ultrasound revealed a normal bladder. Anatomopathological examination of the surgical specimens revealed ulceration on the bladder surface. It also revealed edematous dissociation of the bladder chorion including hyperplasia of blood lymphatic vessels and capillaries giving a cavernous appearance； this is typically associated with intestinal metaplasia supporting the|删除段之间换行|diagnosis of a bladder teratoma. At 7 months postoperative， there was a recurrence of hematuria which prompted the performance of a cystoscopy under general anesthesia. The cystoscopy demonstrated localized neovascularization in the bladder without tun0T recurrence. One month later at 8 months postoperative， the patient reports normal urination with disappearance of hematuria as well as satisfactory continence.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The benign nature of hematuria misleads clinicians when approaching a diagnosis of bladder teratoma. However， the most frequent reason for consultation for a bladder tumor is hematuria as seen in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. Teratomas typically have a median age presentation of 30 years old which why this differential not expected通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Contributing to the complexity of this case， teratomas have an insidious nature growing at a slow-rate with an average of 1.8 mm per year subsequently further delaying their diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The first-line examination in children is the ultrasound of the urinary tract， given its accessibility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，12\\]</u>. Cystoscopy allows a definite diagnosis， but is rarely used in children given the need for general anesthesia and the risk of urethral injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Cystoscopy was used in our patient preoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Treatment for bladder tumors includes partial cystectomy versu radical cystectomy. Partial cystectomy has obvious advantages over radical cystectomy. Namely， its bladder-saving approach avoids the need for urinary diversion， maintains erectile function in males， can be done under regional anesthesia， and is associated with lower morbidity and mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our patient， we used the partial cystectomy approach. Several other cases of bladder teratomas also used partial cystectomy approaches with success 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，14\\]</u>. The prognosis for bladder tumors is often favorable as shown by a meta-analysis with a recurrence rate of 3.4% and death rate of 1%\\[141.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Despite the often-benign nature of hematuria in children， it is essential that any practitioner eliminate a bladder tumor. An ultrasound and a cystoscopy will confirm the diagnosis. The evolution is favorable after resection of the tumor. The follow-up must include investigation with serial ultrasounds and cystoscopies in front of any recurrence of the signs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The client came to the LGBRIMH， Tezpur outpatient department with the chief complaint of bedwetting (since childhood)， along with social shyness， poor appetite， and a pessimistic view of the future for 2 years. The mode of onset was insidious，continuous course of illness and deteriorating progress of the illness. The client’s mother as a primary caregiver mentioned that the client always preferred to stay at home in dark rooms， and had deteriorated a lot in studies and other physical activities. He was diagnosed with F41.2 (mixed anxiety and depressive disorder) with R32 (unspecified urinary incontinence)， according to the International Classification of Diseases  .\n\n【25】Family history\n\n【26】According to the informant (mother)， till 16 years of age， she had a history suggestive of nocturnal enuresis. The client's younger brother has a schizophrenia-like illness， with ongoing treatmer from LGBRIMH， Tezpur. The client's two paternal aunts have some non-affective mental illness. The client’s maternal grandmother has a history suggestive of cardiac ailment， diabetes mellitus， and hypertension.\n\n【27】Family dynamics\n\n【28】Based on the assessment scales and cross-sectional psychosocial interview， it was found that both internal and external family boundaries were semi-open. Father was the nominal head of the family， whereas， the mother was the functional head of the family. Decision-making was democratic style， but the father used to take the major decision of the family and tries to brief other members. A dysfunctional pattern of non-verbal communication was presented from children toward their father. The family failed to distribute their roles and responsibilities appropriately among all members. Coping and problem-solving were inadequate in the family.\n\n【29】Psychiatric social work intervention\n\nPsychosocial assessment and intervention were provided to the|删除段之间换行|client and the family (the mother was the primary caregiver) in the psychosocial unit of LGBRIMH， Tezpur. Altogether 14 sessions(seven individual sessions， three family primary caregiver sessions， and three follow-ups) were provided.\n\n【31】At individual level\n\n【32】1\\. Establishing rapport and therapeutic alliance (session1)： In the introductory session， a trustworthy objective relationship was developed between the client and the therapist. The client has explained the nature of the treatment. He has explained the nature of the treatment， the process of the intervention， and the expected outcome.

To increase the degree of recognition of the severe cardiovascular involvement， we selected a PIMS-TS case from the Department of Pediatrics of Marie Curie Children’s Emergency Hospital， Bucharest， Romania.\n\n【15】Case Presentation\n\n【16】A six-year-old male child was admitted to our pediatric department by transfer from another hospital， where he was admitted with a five-day history ofhigh fever (39℃ to 40℃)， headache， apathy， and gastrointestinal symptoms (diffuse abdominal pain and vomit). During the first 24 h，he became drowsy， developed edema ofthehands and feet， and hypotension. Despite fluid resuscitation with normal saline and inotropic agents， the patient’s blood pressure remained low at 63 mmHg/23 mmHg and he was transferred to our pediatric ward for further investigation and treatment. Previously， he was a healthy child with no past medical history. The family also revealed that a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was present in the kindergarten two months ago. The COVID-19 exposure matches the peak incidence of SARS-CoV-2 third wave (middle March 2021) in Romania .\n\n【17】The physical examination on admission showed pale， dry skin， palpebral and palmoplantar edema， red and cracked lips， conjunctival erythema， cervical lymphadenopathy， decreased skin turgor， capillary refill time (CRT<3 sec)， oliguria. He had tachypnea (respiratory rate=50 breaths per minute)， dyspnea and orthopnea， chest retractions， diminished breath sounds in both lung bases， fine crackles， 92%Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) on room air. The cardiovascular assessment showed tachycardia， (heart rate =120 beats per minute)， Blood Pressure (BP) 65/47 mmHg and muffled heart sounds. The liver edge was palpable 3 cm under the ribs. The child was drowsy， Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS=12). His weight on admission was 17.5kg， which represented a 2-kilogram weight gain.\n\n【18】Laboratory findings at the time of admission are shown in Table删除4-1:<u>1</u>.

It was considered PIMS-TS with cardiogenic shock， similar to KDSS.\n\n【23】It was treated with： Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) 500mg/kg for 5 days， Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist 2 mg/kg for 7days， high doses of corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone 4 mg/kg)， antibiotic therapy (Meropenem in association with Vancomycin)， oxygen therapy， anticoagulant (Enoxaparin 100 UI/kg/day)， vasoactive and inotropic support， Adrenaline (initially dosage 0.1ug/kg/min， then in decreasing dosage until minimum 0.02 ug/kg/min) and Dopamine (10 ug/kg/min) for five days， subsequently， he received treatment with combined diuretic therapy， ACE-inhibitor and beta-blocker.\n\n【24】The clinical evolution following the treatment was favorable， with the improvement of general condition and the resolution of heart failure signs and symptoms. The cardiac ultrasound showed an increase of the left ventricular ejection fraction to 60% and normal aspect of the coronary arteries at 10 days from admission in our clinic.\n\n【25】CBC showed a normal number of leukocytes after 10 days of treatment. The inflammatory response slowly decreased with normalization of the values in 5 days .\n\n【26】The patient was discharged after 18 days of hospitalization and received treatment with Aspirin， Bisoprolol， Lisinopril， Spironolactone (cardiac remodeling).

There are three types of syndromes described as clinical phenotypes that can occur at the onset of PIMS： 1) Fever with hyperinflammation，2) Kawasaki|删除段之间换行|disease-like features， and 3) Shock 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. PIMS-related shock is a frequent clinical presentation described either as vasoplegic (warm) shock unresponsive to fluid resuscitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， cardiogenic， or a combination of them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Cardiogenic shock is an acute state with low cardiac output which furthermore leads to hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The pathophysiology of PIMS related cardiogenic shock is not fully understood. In the symptomatic phase， three main|删除段之间换行|immune mechanisms have an impact on cardiovascular involvement：the appearance of a cytokine storm， activation of immune cells(including neutrophils)， and deposits of immune complexes. The cytokine storm is mainly responsible for vasoplegia while IL6， CRP and activation of neutrophils lead to myocardial injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. A similar condition to PIMS related shock state is Kawasaki disease - shock syndrome， first described by Kanegaye et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However， Kawasaki disease was first described in the 1960s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> so during the five decades since it was reported， its pathogeny was better studied. Because of clinical similarities between PIMS and Kawasaki disease， it has been assumed that PIMS might be an immune complex-induced vasculitis and there might be several common pathways between Kawasaki disease and PIMS \\[191.\n\n【30】Myocarditis (described in several degrees， usually subclinical/mild) is aconstantfinding in almost all patients at the onset of Kawasaki disease，before the appearance of coronaryaneurysms. Several studies reveal myocardial inflammation at the microscopic examination as part ofpostmortem examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>，on en domyocardial biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， or cardiac MRI. Moreover， Printz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> indicate an association between the level of systemic inflammatory status in Kawasaki disease and the left ventricle ejection fraction.\n\nThe endomyocardial biopsy cannot be routinely practiced， being|删除段之间换行|an invasive procedure. Due to lack of consensus for the diagnosis of myocarditis， we defined myocarditis based on the criteria mentioned by Dasgupta et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>： Elevated cardiac enzymes， ST segment elevation or depression on ECG， regional/global wall motion abnormalities with impaired LV function on echocardiography.\n\n【32】NT-pro-BNP is a polypeptide produced in atrial and left ventricle myocardiocytes when they are prone to mechanical stretch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Therefore， NT-pro-BNP is a well-known biomarker for heart failure.\n\nWe hypothesize 2 possible theories. Firstly， myocarditis might have been initiated due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. It overlaps the 3rd wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Romania and the child was asymptomatic. Several studies indicate that subclinical myocarditis can occur in pediatric patients during viral infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25，26\\]</u>. Symptoms of heart failure appeared after a 1.5 month delay from the initial infection. Therefore， an underlying mild degree of myocardial edema might persist after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection. It might have been in resolution (activation of myocardial fibroblasts) if PIMS-TS would not have occurred. Due to PIMS-TS， a huge amount of vasoactive cytokines were released，leading to vasoplegic shock and increasing the level of myocardial edema which might explain the pathophysiology of cardiogenic shock in this patient. Troponin level was in the normal range at the moment of admission in contrast to|删除段之间换行|a marked elevated level of NT-pro-BNP. Due to these two processes that overlapped (subclinical myocarditis and the cytokine storm which increased the level of interstitial edema of the heart) the myocardiocytes were increasingly stretched but not injured，leading to extremely high levels of NT-pro-BNP while the levels of troponin were at the upper limit of normal range values.\n\n【34】The second hypothesis refers to a newly developed PIMS-TS intramyocardial edema in a patient without myocardial damage during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，28\\]</u>. Like we mentioned before， three main mechanisms are involved in PIMS-TS development， according to which pathway is more prominent， so it can clinically present as fulminant myocarditis (mostly described in adults)， acute heart failure， or mild/moderate myocardial enzyme elevation \\[291. Acute heart failure manifestation is linked with the over stimulating vasoactive cytokine pathway which furthermore leads to vasoplegic shock. Myocardial cell injury might have happened if the2d pathway would have been more prominent (activation of immune cells， neutrophils included) together with increased levels of IL6 and CRP. In this case， the levels of IL6 are CRP were mildly elevated， not leading to an acute muscular cardiac destruction. Once newly developed intramyocardial edema and distributive shock can lead to low LV ejection fraction and clinical manifestation of shock. So we admit that the shock in our case had two components： Cardiogenic and vasoplegic.\n\n【35】The cardiogenic shock had a favorable outcome in our case using 2 inotropic agents Adrenaline (initially dosage 0.1 ug/kg/min，) and Dopamine (10 ug/kg/min) for five days， then only Dopamine for another five days alongside with cardiac remodeling medication： Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor (Lisinopril)， Spironolactone， Furosemide and Bisoprolol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Clinical condition progressively improved， with resolution of pulmonary stasis， good cerebral perfusion and normalized blood pressure values within 7days， with no mechanical circulatory support required. This clinical presentation matches the information reported by several authors通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，28，29\\]</u>， in which patients with PIMS-TS-cardiogenic shock had a favorable outcome primarily due to immune-mediated damage rather than myocardial injury post SARS-CoV-2 replication. The full recovery in such a short time (with normalized cardiac function by echocardiography in 10 days) using corticosteroids， IVIG， IL-1receptor antagonist and supportive cardiac medication could be an argument for our second hypothesis consisting with PIMS-TS related myocarditis on previously normal myocardium. In conclusion， this case presents a different clinical onset compared with other Covid-19related infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u> or PIMS-TS cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u> in Romanian pediatric population.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】PIMS-TS is a new described pediatric syndrome which can present as several clinical phenotypes， and some of them can be life-threatening. Cardiogenic shock related to PIMS-TS (with underlying immune myocarditis) is an often clinical presentation with favorable outcome if specific treatment against cytokine storm and supportive cardiac medication are promptly administered.

Due to its high morbimortality， its diagnosis should be established without delay and treatment should be started immediately.\n\n【2】Its incidence has progressively decreased in our setting， thanks to the development of vaccines against most of the pathogens involved. Even so， Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumonia continue to be the most frequently detected bacteria in children older than 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>.\n\n【3】The most effective preventive measure for ABM due to S. pneumonia is pneumococcal conjugate vaccination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>， with maximum serotype coverage. Many countries do not include serotypes associated with severe meningoencephalitis and penicillin resistance， such as serotype 19A， since they continue to administer decavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is important to know the vaccination status and the type of pneumococcal vaccine received in children upon arrival to Spain from countries with different immunization schedules.\n\n【4】Abbreviations\n\n【5】MBA： Acute Bacterial Meningitis； PCR： Polymerase Chain Reaction； CSF： Cerebrospinal Fluid； CT： Computed Axial Tomography.\n\n【6】Clinical Case\n\n【7】We present the case of a 20-month-old female infant from Iceland just arrived to Spain in June删除4-1:<u>2022</u>. She had no relevant clinical history， with vaccination up to date according to her country， including pneumococcal conjugate decavalent vaccine.\n\n【8】The patient presented at the emergency room with 48 h evolution of fever and upper respiratory symptoms，being diagnosed with a probable viral infection in a local hospital in Madrid， progressing in the next few hours to vomiting and gait disturbance. Physical examination revealed poor general condition with prolonged capillary refill time， drowsiness and neck stiffness. Given the clinical deterioration and suspicion of septic shock， initial stabilization was performed， requiring volume expansion. Blood tests and blood culture were requested and intravenous cefotaxime was started. Blood analysis showed a leukocyte count of 4，900/microliter， with 40.3% neutrophils， 9.8%lymphocytes and 2% monocytes， hypertransaminasemia (ALT 894 U/L， AST 553 UI/L， alkaline phosphatase 213 UI/L， LDH 961 UI/L). An elevation of acute phase reactants (C-reactive protein23.7 mg/dl and procalcitonin 59 ng/ml) was detected， as well as altered coagulation with INR of 1.68. Blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis with hyperlactatemia.\n\n【9】Due to the lack of improvement， the patient was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)， suspecting meningoencephalitis with associated septic shock. On arrival at the PICU， she was unstable with a neurological examination compatible with intracranial hypertension. A decortication posture with anisocoria was observed， as well as generalized seizures refractory to anticonvulsant therapy. In following blood tests， values were consistent with multiorgan failure maintaining leukopenia (up to 3，300/microliter) with thrombocytopenia (16，000/microliter)， NT-proBNP 15，021 pg/ml and D-dimer of 18，243 ng/ml.\n\nBrain computed axial tomography (CT) was consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalitis. A lumbar puncture was performed in which Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) showed bacterial meningitis(4000 red blood cells/mL， 26 cells/microliter with 52% polymorphonuclear， 628 mg/dl protein and glucose <10 mg/dl). After obtaining microbiological samples， antimicrobial treatment was changed to vancomycin， meropenem and acyclovir. Given the persistence of intracranial hypertension|删除段之间换行|refractory to medical treatment， surgical intervention was decided， in which an external ventricular drainage was placed.\n\n【11】Streptococcus preumonia and Enterovirus B were detected in CSF by molecular biology technique (PCR). Despite high-dose antimicrobial treatment and optimization of supportive care， there was fulminant progression， confirming encephalic death by neurological examination，EEG and CT less than 24 h after admission.\n\n【12】After the patient’s passing， the presence of Streptococcus preuronia was confirmed in CSF culture and blood culture. Serotype determination was performed， being reported as type19A.The antibiogram showed multi-resistance to antibiotics， specifically， high level of resistance to penicillin and cefotaxime (MIC to penicillin 4 micrograms/ml and cefotaxime： 6 micrograms/dl). Immunologic work up showed immunoglobulin values within the normal range (IgG 582 mg/dl； IgA 96 mg/dl and IgM 111 mg/dl)， and a complement study indicated a discrete hypocomplementemia C4 5.1 mg/dl (normal values 11.2 mg/dl to 39.1 mg/dl)， with C3 99.5mg/dl (normal values 98.6 mg/dl to 207.9 mg/dl). A genetic panel for immunodeficiencies and necropsy could not be performed.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Although less and less frequent， pneumococcal meningitis continues to be a major health issue in children in our environment. Both primary care and hospital pediatricians should be familiar with the clinical manifestations in order to establish an early diagnosis that allows treatment to be initiated as quickly as possible.\n\n【15】With respect to invasive pneumococcal disease， its incidence in children is higher in the group under 5 years of age， and the most frequent serotypes are 8，3，9N，19A and 22F (3 and 19A are included in the 13-valent vaccine). Although the incidence of pneumococcal meningitis has decreased over time， it is still associated with a morbidity of around 20% to 25% with a mortality of 5% to 10% at present.\n\n【16】Currently， there are two types of vaccines against S. pneumonia； polysaccharide and conjugated vaccines with a carrier protein. There are two types of conjugated vaccines marketed： tridecavalent and decavalent. Thanks to the high vaccination coverage， and to the improvement of hygienic measures， the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has markedly decreased in Spain. Although in our setting most of the infant population has received the 13-valent conjugate vaccine， in migrant or transient population， other vaccination patterns can be found， as in the case of our patient.\n\n【17】The available polysaccharide vaccine， known as 23-valent. The polysaccharides of the pneumococcal capsule are not bound to proteins， which makes the immune less robust than with the conjugate vaccine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，9\\]</u>. It causes an immune tolerance phenomenon and does not impact on nasopharyngeal colonization. It can be administered from 2 years ofage. In children， it should be reserved always after the conjugate vaccine， for patients at high risk of invasive pneumococcal disease.\n\nThe Fpneumococcal1conjugatevaccineecontainLsScapsular polysaccharides ofthe 13 most prevalent pneumococcal serotypes (1，3， 4，5，6A， 6B，7F，9V， 14， 18C， 19A， 19F and 23F) which， together|删除段之间换行|with a carrier protein， generate an adequate and long-lasting immune response， with long-term protection. This vaccine has been included in the Spanish children's vaccination schedule since 2016， being therefore free of charge， with a 3-dose.\n\n【19】It has proven to be effective in the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (97% for meningitis and sepsis)， preventing infection from 80% of the circulating serotypes. Among them， serotype 19A stands out， which is characterized by its association with mastoiditis and meningitis， as well as by its high prevalence of resistance to penicillin \\[101.\n\n【20】Likewise， it is useful to rule out primary immunodeficiencies in fulminant pneumococcal infections.\n\n【21】The aim of this case is to draw attention on the still present pneumococcal meningitis in a highly immunized population of children that can have a fulminant outcome， particularly with aggressive serotypes like 19A， that may be highly resistant to penicillin and cefotaxime. It is necessary to emphasize the importance of adapting and completing the vaccination schedules of patients born outside Spain and achieving optimal immunization of the infant population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The worldwide incidence of CRC has been rising at a 3.2% yearly rate， starting with 783，000 cases in 1999 and rising to 1.8 million by删除4:<u> 2020</u>. This trend is expected to persist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-6\\]</u>. The improvement of diagnostic procedures and treatment modalities， such as surgery，adjuvant chemotherapies， andpalliative medicines， has resulted in a decline in CRC mortality rates in recent decades. After curative treatment， the metastasis of colorectal cancer is still a big problem， and it is the leading cause of mortality due to CRC. Tumor metastasis remains the most significant barrier to CRC treatment and prognosis. The most prevalent site of distant spread is liver metastasis， and around 15% to 25% of CRC patients will have distant metastases at the time of original diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>. Liver metastasis of CRC may be related to factors such as the presence of the portal vein system， which directly connects the colorectal and liver and is associated with abundant blood supply， the location of the primary tumor and its histological type 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>.\n\nCurative resection and chemotherapy are standard treatment modalities in patients with Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis (CCLM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However， due to factors such as the location and|删除段之间换行|size of the tumor， the presence of extrahepatic disease， unresectable disease， or comorbidities of the patients， the surgical treatment option can be applied only in 10% to 20% of the cases， and the 5-year survival rate is very low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. Those who are unsuitable for surgery also have a worse prognosis. It is， therefore， necessary to find more effective targeted therapies for CCLM. Therefore， understanding the mechanisms underlying CRC and investigating the highly sensitive and specific molecules associated with metastasis， particularly during colorectal liver metastasis， is crucial to improve patient's clinical outcomes and overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In this process， it is very important to understand the molecular mechanisms and to carry out purposeful studies. Although many previous studies have identified various molecules involved in the initiation and development of colorectal liver metastases， the mechanisms still remain unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【9】There is still no holistic understanding of the process of carcinogenesis and metastasis in CRC， and studies for the causes of metastasis have focused on limited molecular markers. Next-generation sequencing， a high-throughput technology， is widely used to detect complex genetic changes to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of diseases and to identify various biomarkers to determine prognosis and treatment efficacy. Thanks to these genomic technologies used， molecular mechanisms related to diseases can be illuminated， and genes，RNAs， etc.， that may be disease-related biomarkers can be detected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Aiming to develop computer algorithms that can be developed with experience， machine learning aims to provide descriptive information to researchers in the analysis of large， complex datasets of computers. When exposed to new data， machine learning learns based on previous data and makes predictions about new data. In the past ten years， thanks to the availability of big datasets and increased processing power， machine learning approaches have achieved outstanding performance in a number ofresearch. Therefore， machine learning is perhaps most useful for analyzing and interpreting large genomic datasets and may be used to describe a wide variety of genomic sequence elements删除4:<u> 17，18</u>.\n\n【11】In this study， in order to identify microRNAs that may be biomarkers for CCLM； by making bioinformatic analyzes from an open-access microRNA dataset belonging to CCLM is aimed to model the data set formed by overexpressed RNAs with XGBoost， which is a machine learning model， and to determine the possible biomarker RNAs with the variable importance values obtained.\n\n【12】Materialand Methods\n\n【13】Data set and variables\n\n【14】This current research was conducted using data from a case-control study published by Qiaoming Zhi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The dataset consists of miRNA data from 10 CRC tissues from patients with liver metastases and 10 CRC tissues from patients without liver metastases. In the current study， this dataset was used to identify miRNAs differentially expressed between the two groups by bioinformatic analysis and to identify miRNAs that could be biomarkers using the machine learning method.\n\n【15】Bioinformatics analysis phase\n\nFor CCLM， which was examined for miRNA expression profiles， differential expression analyses were performed using the limma package available in the R programming language 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Differential expression analysis is known as the statistical analysis of normalized|删除段之间换行|read count data to find the quantitative differences present in expression activities in different group situations. As a result of the analysis， a gene table in order of importance and a volcano plot to visualize differentially expressed genes are obtained. Log2FC>1was used to identify upregulated genes， and log2FC<-1 to identify downregulated genes in the analyzes performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Up-regulated miRNAs are shown in red， down-regulated miRNAs are shown in blue in the volcano plot used to visualize genes with differential regulation， and miRNAs that do not show any change in expression between the 2 groups are shown in black.\n\n【17】Modelling phase\n\n【18】The modeling phase starts with variable selection. In the bioinformatics analysis， LASSO variable selection method was used in the variable selection stage made from differently expressed miRNAs. The variable selection phase is one of the most important steps in any predictive modeling project. Basically， variable selection is the process of deciding which data/variables to include in the study while developing a statistical model. Variable selection is a feature identification process on a data set that has an effect on the dependent variable. The high dimensionality of the explanatory variables that have an effect on the dependent variable can lead to both long computation times and over-learning of the data. For this reason， before performing statistical modeling， the variables with the most important features， that is， the variables that explain the model the most， should be selected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. The datasets obtained by gene expression also have very large volumes. Therefore， variable selection methods are applied before modeling with these datasets. The LASSO variable selection method used in this study imposes a constraint on the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters， and this sum must be less than a fixed value (upper limit). To achieve this， the method uses a throttling (narrowing-regulating) operation that penalizes the coefficients of the regression variables and causes some of them to drop to zero 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Modeling was done with the data set obtained by the variable selection. In the modeling phase， XGBoost， which is a tree-based method from machine learning methods， was used. XGBoost is a machine learning method based on gradient boosting and decision tree methods and has found application in many areas. This method， which has a very high predictive power compared to other algorithms， is 10 times faster than other methods and includes a series of regularizations that can improve the overall performance of the model and reduce overfitting and overlearning通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In order to ensure model validity， the n-fold cross-validation method， one of the resampling methods， was used in this study. In this method；\n\n【20】First， the dataset is divided into n pieces， and the model is applied to n pieces.\n\n【21】In the second step， one of the n parts is used for the testing process， while the other n-1 parts are used in the training process.\n\n【22】In the last stage， the average of the values obtained from the models is evaluated for the cross-validation method.\n\n【23】Accuracy， balanced accuracy， sensitivity， specificity， positive predictive value， negative predictive value，and F1-score metrics were used to evaluate the performance obtained as a result of the modeling. Finally， in order to identify miRNAs that could be biomarkers， variable importance values were calculated， giving information about how much the input variables explain the output variable.\n\n【24】Biostatistical analysis phase\n\n【25】Shapiro Wilk test of normality was employed to determine whether the variables had anormal distribution. Data were summarized as mean ± standard deviation. Independent samples t-test was employed to compare data. p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0 program was used in the analysis.\n\n【26】The process flow diagram\n\n【27】The process flow diagram of the used models is also shown in Figure 1 for a better understanding ofthe system.\n\n【28】Results\n\n【29】There are 9 female and 11 male patients in the current study. The mean age of the patients was 63.4±11.51. While the mean age of patients without liver metastasis is 64.9 ± 5.85， the mean age of patients with metastasis is 61.9±15.50 vears.\n\n【30】When the data obtained as a result of the bioinformatics analysis were examined， 72 microRNAs with down- and 24 up-regulation were found. According to the table in which the microRNAs with the smallest adjacent P. value are listed， 4 of the first 10 microRNAs were downregulated，5 of them were upregulated， while 1 of them did not. The results obtained according to the bioinformatics analysis are tabulated in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【31】The volcano plot， where we can see all differentially expressed genes， is as follows .\n\n【32】According to the results of the biostatistical analysis performed with 23 microRNAs selected by the variable selection method， statistically significant differences were obtained between the groups with and without liver metastasis with CRC. Mentioned 23microRNAs show differences for 2 groups. Biostatistical analysis results are given in Table删除4:<u> 2</u>.\n\n【33】The values of the performance metrics obtained as a result of modeling with the XGBoost method are as follows .\n\n【34】The graphical presentation of the metrics is as follows .\n\n【35】According to the variable significance values obtained as a result of the modeling， the 3 microRNAs were the most differentiated microRNAs among the 2 groups. The graphic showing of these microRNAs according to the obtained variable importance values is given in Figure删除4:<u> 4</u>.\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】CRC is still frequent cancer. Most cancers， including CRC， may have a single clonal origin in the early stages of the disease. Still， a malignant tumor contains multiple populations of cells with distinct characteristics such as growth rate， karyotype， immunogenicity， drug susceptibility， and ability to expand. And develop metastases.\n\n【38】Table 1： The results of the bioinformatics analysis.\n\n| ID  | adj. P. Val  | P.

Of these， microRNA 4708， microRNA 4306，microRNA142， microRNA 4516， microRNA 345， id=42614， microRNA 2681， id=147834， id=148143， microRNA 33b are the microRNAs with the smallest adj p-value values and the most differentiated. When the log2FC values obtained were examined， microRNA 4708 and microRNA 4516 in CCLM had 2.54- and 2.80-fold higher gene\n\n【48】expression than those with CRC， respectively. When the log2FC values obtained were examined， microRNA 4306， microRNA 345， id=42614， microRNA 2681， id=147834， id=148143， microRNA33b microRNAs in CCLM had 2.77， 2.42，2.51，2.51，2.28，2.14 and5.09 fold lower gene expression than those with CRC， respectively. microRNA 4306 had the same expression between the two groups.\n\n【49】Statistically significant differences were obtained between the groups with and without CCLM according to the biostatistical analyzes performed with the remaining 23 microRNAs with the choice of the variable. These selected microRNAs are microRNAs that differentiate between the 2 groups and have a distinctive feature between the 2 groups.

Based on the performance criteria， the suggested XGBoost could correctly categorize two groups of patients using an artificial intelligence technique. When the variable significance values obtained as a result ofthe modeling are examined， it can be said that 3 microRNAs are the determining microRNAs between the 2 groups. These microRNAs are microRNAs called microRNA 4306，microRNA 2115，and microRNA4708 and will be associated with the state of metastasis.\n\nOne study mentioned that MicroRNA (miR)-4306 is associated with tumor growth and cancer， and its relationship with CRC was investigated.

{"seq_id": "13fd6100-1dcf-469c-b834-9cf5be08102b", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】We report a highly unusual case of a patient with nephrotic syndrome due to AHL primary amyloidosis， with a heavy chain fragments in serum and urine after a recent diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. The patient was a 52 year-old male with solitary kidney， after nephrectomy of his left kidney， because of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC). He was admitted to our hospital，8 months after nephrectomy， because of severe nephrotic syndrome (total urine protein (TPU) >8.5 gr/24h) with normal renal function. Biopsy of the remaining kidney showed AHL systemic amyloidosis， while immunofixation identified fragments ofa-heavy chains in urine and serum， as well as A light-chains in urine. The diagnosis ofprimary amyloidosis in which the amyloid deposits are composed of both light and heavy chains， is an extremely unusual occurrence， while only a few cases are presented in the literature. Various studies have showed a rare association of renal cell carcinoma and amyloidosis， but this is related to secondary (AA type) amyloidosis. On the contrary， there are no data where renal carcinomas relate to systemic amyloidosis. Thus this case report is very interesting for two reasons； first for the concurrence between renal carcinoma and systemic amyloidosis and for the heavy chain fragments in serum and urine.\n\n【2】Keywords： Heavy and light-chain amyloidosis； AHL amyloidosis； Nephrotic syndrome； a-heavy chain； Renal cell carcinoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Amyloidosis encompasses a rare group of conditions characterized by extracellular deposition of fibrils， caused by abnormal folding of proteins which exhibits a beta sheet configuration on X-ray diffraction. These amyloid proteins can be histologically confirmed by their characteristic apple green birefringence under polarized light， when stained positively with Congo red dye. There have been identified approximately 15 to 20 precursor proteins of amyloid so far 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-6\\]</u>. The most prevalent type of systemic amyloidosis is immunoglobulin (Ig)-related amyloidosis {referred to as primary amyloidosis) and even if it is difficult to document its incidence， it is considered to affect about 5to 13 per million per year in western countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The most frequent presentation of amyloidosis is renal damage， which is characterized by proteinuria， with or without renal insufficiency. Our knowledge concerning the pathogenesis of primary amyloidosis is scanty， while our data for the infrequent entity of Heavy and Light-chain Amyloidosis (AHL)， in which the amyloid fragments are composed of Ig heavy and light chains are even more limited 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-11\\]</u>. Amyloidosis associated with immunoglobulin a-heavy chain has been reported only in few cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，12，13\\]</u>. Another thing that is unique， in the present patient， is that he was recently operated for clear cell carcinoma of his left kidney. These types of carcinomas had been correlated with paraneoplastic syndrome which is manifested with a variety of atypical symptoms (i.e. fatigue， anorexia， weight loss， or endocrine(i.e.hypercalcemia etc.) or non-endocrine disorders (i.e. amyloidosis)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In these references， it is secondary amyloidosis (type AA amyloidosis) but not primary systemic one that is related to 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. This report concerns a patient with nephrotic syndrome as a result of AHL amyloidosis (with a heavy chain) which appeared after removal of his left kidney for renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\nA 50-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for investigation of nephrotic syndrome (TPU)>8.5 gr/dl， hypoalbuminemia (albumin=2.5 mg/dl) but normal renal function (Cr=0.9 mg/dl， eGFR=100 ml/min/1.73 m’，CKD-EPI，possible due to hyper filtration ofthe remaining kidney). The patient had a solitary right kidney， because eight months prior to his admission to our hospital he|删除段之间换行|had undergone nephrectomy in his left kidney due to clear cell renal carcinoma (Fuhrman Grade III). On physical examination， he had negligible pitting edema in lower extremities and there were no signs of organomegaly， lymphadenopathy， macroglossia or neuropathy. Laboratory data revealed normal serum IgA (161 mg/dl， normal values 72 mg/dl to 400 mg/dl)， decreased IgG (369 mg/dl， normal values 690 mg/dl to 1，618 mg/dl) and highly increased IgM (457 mg/dl， normal values 40 mg/dl to 235mg/dl). Immunofixation detected a band of a-heavy chain in the serum and urine， as well as A-light chains in urine. Urine analysis showed proteinuria with no hematuria， with the amount ofurine protein at 8.5 gr/day.\n\n【7】Because of his recent malignancy， we suspected that the possible cause of his nephritic syndrome might be secondary (membranous) glomerulonephritis. Thus his underwent methodical investigation with CT scanning of lungs， abdomen， as well as colonoscopy and gastroscopy， while he was subjected to ultrasound guided kidney biopsy. Due to the fact that the patient had a-heavy chains in his immunofixation， gastroscopy that was performed also aimed to take biopsies from second， third， and fourth part of the duodenum and upper jejunum， so as to exclude the Possibility of Immunoproliferative Small Intestine Disease (IPSID) which sometimes accompanies a heavy chain findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. The gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed only mild esophagitis while the gastroduodenal mucosal biopsy was negative for amyloid deposition.\n\n【8】The renal biopsy specimen indicated diffuse and global amyloid deposition both on peritubular spaces and the glomeruli， particularly in the mesangial region and the capillaries of glomeruli and Congo red stain positive . In addition， the mesangium of the glomerulus was expanded .\n\nImmunohistological studies for renal amyloid using numeral antibodies (i.e. β-2 macroglobulin， transthyretin etc.) were not fully|删除段之间换行|available in our laboratory. From the available immunohistological studies， the amyloid deposits on immunofluorescence， stained strongly for A and slightly for K， IgM， IgG and IgA . Bone marrow aspiration biopsy showed a plasma cell count 12% to 15%， without amyloid deposition or any dysplasia as well as normal cellularity with trilinear adequate hematopoiesis . Moreover， monoclonal A light chains expressed strongly in plasma cells with scattered aggregates or nodules whereas k light chains expression was weak . The diagnosis of AL/AHL amyloidosis was determined due to immunofixation findings in serum and urine of monoclonal a heavy chain immunoglobulin， together with A light chain immunoglobulins.\n\nNeither electrocardiogram nor echocardiogram revealed any findings suggestive of amyloid heart disease. There was absence of“granular sparkling myocardium and diastolic-systolic dysfunction， while proBnP， a prognostic factor of cardiac amyloidosis， was within the normal range. Chest and abdominal CT scans showed no enlarged lymph nodes|删除段之间换行|was treated with chemotherapy (Bortezomib1， 3 mg/m’ in days 1， 8and 15， Lenalidomide 10 mg in 1-21 days and dexamethasone 40 mg in days 1， 8， 15 and 22). The whole therapy was administered for a28 day-cycle， repeated 6 times. A dramatical decline in proteinuria as well as improvement of hypoalbuminemia and patient's lipidemic profile was observed after the end of chemotherapy， with complete remission ofhis nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【11】It is markedly important to mention that after the results of the kidney biopsy， we examined the tissue of the resected neoplastic left kidney so as to confirm whether amyloidosis was preexisted or not. Congo red staining and immunohistochemical staining were performed in the non-tumor region of his extracted left kidney and were negative for amyloid deposits. Taking into considerations all these findings， our patient was diagnosed with a clear cell carcinoma which was resected and few months later， he was presented with severe nephrotic syndrome due to a rare type of amyloidosis (AHL amyloidosis with a-heavy chain in serum and urine).\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】AHL amyloidosis is considered to be a rather rare disorder compared to AL amvloidosis. There have been five cases of AHL reported up to now 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Light and electron microscopy are not always capable to determine the different types of amyloid. The most potent and sensitive method of distinguishing amyloidogenic fibrils is by Laser Micro Dissection (LMD) or Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomic analysis， a method that can be done in formalin-fixedtissue-embedded paraffin specimens that helps to diagnose amyloidosis easier， even in archival material. However， these techniques have some limitations including the lack of a suitable reagent with the necessary specificity， as well as their unavailability in daily routine. Therefore mentioned methods are indispensable only when the other procedures are not diagnostic and unrevealing. In some problematic cases， where there is absence of immune reactivity for light or heavy chain， the right type of amyloidosis can be indirectly confirm by the demonstration of a monoclonal Ig protein in the blood， urine or in the bone marrow as in the present case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6，13，17，18\\]</u>.\n\nIn summary， the reported case is very interesting due to the concurrentpresence ofrenal cell carcinoma and a raretype of systemic amyloidosis. It is also peculiar how systemic amyloidosis presented after 8 months of his nephrectomy given that the removed kidney was free of deposition of amyloid. To our knowledge， only limited cases of renal cell carcinoma associated with primary amyloidosis have been published and these are referring to the inverse relationship. In other words， there are references in literature where systemic amyloidosis|删除段之间换行|is preceded and RCC appears after a certain period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. On the other hand AA amyloidosis can be manifested as a possible consequence of stimulation by the carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15，19\\]</u>. The exact mechanism of AA amyloid production in RCCs is not well understood but may involve protracted irritation of the immune system as the tumor grows. In any case a thorough histological examination is essential for the definite diagnosis of such entities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15，20\\]</u>.Our patient for the time being and after almost two years remains well and free of proteinuria.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Due to the limitations of physical experiments such as difficulty in observation， rapid occurrence of phenomena， and dangers， as well as the impact of subjective and objective factors such as school funding， teacher constraints， and students weak experimental awareness， many physical experiments are not convenient to conduct in the classroom or laboratory， such as wave optics， fluid mechanics， particle physics， and nuclear physics experiments.

The effect of two-dimensional simulation experiments is not intuitive and visual enough，lacking a sense of immersion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and a sense of restoration， and the teaching effect is limited.

Currently， relevant scholars have developed 3D simulation software， such as Guo Tiezheng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， who implemented cricket system simulation experiments based on Unity3D， Xiong Yanfan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， who discussed the application of VR technology in practical teaching， and Feng Jiao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， who implemented flight simulation systems using the WebGL framework Three.js.

Three.js not only supports Canvas animation and CSS animation， but also supports more advanced physics-based rendering technology based on general 3D engines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. It provides a set of simple solutions and practical built-in objects for creating 3D graphics. At the same time， it can quickly instantiate elements such as Scene， Light， Camera， and Renderer， greatly improving the development efficiency of 3D graphics during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【9】Workflow\n\n【10】The workflow of Three.js mainly includes four parts： creating a scene， configuring a scene， creating model objects， and rendering 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The five main elements of 3D graphics rendering are： Scene， camera， object，light， and renderer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. A scene is a three-dimensional space used to place models， lights， and cameras， which are then rendered using a renderer. Objects need to be presented through a camera to determine the observation position， direction， and angle， and to determine the final scene displayed on the display. Objects are three-dimensional models for display. Simple models can be created through Three.js built-in solutions， while complex models need to be modeled using professional 3D drawing software 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Lights provide illumination for the scene， and different light sources and colors can be selected based on the scene effect. The function of the renderer is to render the created scene and the projections of three-dimensional objects observed by the camera on a two-dimensional plane， and present them to the browser .\n\n【11】Introduction to Saxon Bowl and Its Timing Principle\n\n【12】The Saxon bowl is a bowl with a perforated bottom， which is timed by observing the natural sinking of the bowl in water. In this paper， theoretical analysis of the relationship between the Saxon bowl sinking time and related physical parameters is conducted，and experimental simulation is established.\n\n【13】Assume that a bowl with a mass of m。 a thickness ofd， a height of h。 and a cross-sectional area of S holes at the bottom is placed in a liquid with an infinite width and a density of 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. When t=0， the bottom of the bowl is in contact with the liquid surface； At the time of t=t\\， the bowl mouth is flush with the outer liquid surface， and the physical process of the Saxon bowl sinking within the time period 0≤tsta is analyzed. By establishing a physical model and combining fluid mechanics processes， it is concluded that the settling time of the Saxon bowl in liquid is 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>：\n\n【14】Design of Saxon Bowl3DSimulation Experimental System\n\n【15】System architecture design\n\n【16】The simulation experiment platform adopts a hierarchical model： A presentation layer， an application layer， a business logic layer， a data access layer， and a database five-tier structure . The presentation layer is used to display system interfaces and experimental data， display simulation models， and provide interface services for the application layer. The business logic layer processes the system's business logic (rules， workflow， data integrity， etc.). The data access layer provides data.\n\n【17】3D animation design\n\n【18】The Saxon Bowl simulation experiment designed a series ofthree dimensional animations to simulate the real experimental process， and added interactive details of user operations， achieving human-computer interaction beyond the viewing level to enhance the user experience. For example， when measuring mass with a tray balance， the system will determine whether the user has placed items on the tray， and whether they have moved weights or weights， so as to control the left and right swing and placement position of the objects， in order to prevent model overlap and threading The vernier caliper will be opened and closed according to the user's operation； When measuring the density of a liquid with a densitometer， place it in the liquid to be measured and float up and down until it becomes stable； Liquid surface texture in a water tank simulates fluid flow； The Saxon bowl sinks， equipped with a movable bowl rack to ensure that the bowl is in a static state when it first touches the liquid level， and then sinks according to the sinking path simulated by the fitting curve.\n\n【19】During the process， the small hole in the bottom of the bowl flows liquid， and the liquid level in the bowl will rise accordingly.\n\n【20】Implementation of Saxon Bowl 3D Simulation Svstem\n\n【21】Construction of three-dimensional experimental environment\n\n【22】The experimental environment is an important link that affects the visual effect of virtual simulation experiments. In order to enhance the user's experience in experiments and restore the experimental scene of the laboratory Saxon Bowl experiment， it is necessary to build a 3D high-definition rendered virtual scene during COVID-19pandemic.\n\n【23】First， use the three coordinate axes x， y， and z in the scene created by three.js to form a simple virtual simulation experiment three-dimensional space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， laying the foundation for subsequent3D experimental equipment creation and experimental simulation effects. In order for the 3D model in the scene to also present a 3D\n\n【24】effect in the human eye rather than a simple planar figure， it is also necessary to create a Perspective Camera that can adjust its own observation range， angle， and distance from the 3D model to make the model present different visual effects. The light sources in the scene can not only enhance the 3D feel of the model， but also highlight the material characteristics of the model. For example， applying a point light source to a tray balance can well highlight its metal texture. In order to meet the requirements similar to those of real experiments， the system strictly sets camera parameters to ensure the effectiveness of experimental equipment measurement data during simulation experiments. In addition， arranging scene lights can also give a three-dimensional sense of the environment. The core code is as follows：\n\n【25】Construction of three-dimensional experimental equipment\n\n【26】Modeling of three-dimensional experimental equipment is the foundation for implementing a three-dimensional simulation system for physical experiments， providing necessary materials for the construction of virtual scenes and the implementation of interactive behaviors删除4-1:<u>20</u>.\n\n【27】Firstly， select an appropriate method to construct 3D model components based on real physical equipment data. Components with regular shapes are constructed using a box (THREE. BoxGeometry)， a cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry)， a sphere(THREE. SphereGeometry)， and a cone (THREE. ConeGeometry). Components with irregular shapes need to first obtain data on each vertex of the component， use THREE. Vector3() to store the data， and place it in a vertex array， then， THREE.Face30 stores the triangular faces formed by connecting the vertices of the component， and places them in a triangular face array. Finally， the required components can be constructed using the above two arrays. After all components are built， use the intersection， union， and subtract components in the Three BSP plug-in library to assemble the 3D model. Taking a vernier caliper as an example， the modeling scheme is as follows：\n\n【28】Let scene，camera，ambientLight\n\n【29】scene = new THREE.SceneO；//create a scene\n\n【30】camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(x， width /height， 1，\n\n【31】1000)；//create a Perspective Camera\n\ncamera.position.set通用删除7(英):<u>(-3，1，30)</u>；//position the camera|删除段之间换行|camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3通用删除7(英):<u>(-10， 0， 0)</u>)；//set camera observation point|删除段之间换行|ambientLightt=InewTHREE.AmbientLight(0x606060)；//add light source|删除段之间换行|scene.add(ambientLight)；//Adding Lights to a Scene\n\n【33】The vernier caliper mainly consists of a ruler body， a depth ruler， a master ruler， a vernier ruler， an internal measuring claw， an external measuring claw， and fastening screws. The master ruler， ruler body， and depth ruler are selected as cuboids (THREE. BoxGeometry)，and the coordinates are placed or embedded in appropriate positions. For irregular shaped internal and external measuring claws， it is difficult to restore true vernier calipers using traditional geometric graphics. Now， it is possible to obtain the data of each vertex of this part through an array and store it. Then， use the connection function of THREE.Face3() to connect each vertex in the space， and finally combine the two parts of the space. The shape of the fastening screw is similar to the cylinder (THREE. CylinderGeometry) in the three.js library. We use the cylinder to construct its shape and place the figure in the appropriate position on the vernier caliper. The above process completes the basic construction of the vernier caliper equipment model，and then uses the THREE. TextureLoader texture map to add a scale to the vernier caliper .\n\nOther experimental equipment such as tray scales， densitometers， and Saxon bowls all use the above modeling ideas. The parts with regular shapes use simple geometric graphics from the three.jslibrary， while the irregular parts use arrays to obtain vertex coordinates and|删除段之间换行|construct them in space using aline method. Finally，the two parts are combined during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【35】Implementation of three-dimensional interactive behavior\n\n【36】Experimental simulation effect is an important factor affecting its practical value. In addition to presenting realistic visual effects and realistic experimental processes， rich and detailed interaction behavior is also a major factor affecting experimental simulation effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【37】In the Saxon Bowl simulation experimental platform， the key to achieving interactive behavior is the interaction between a series of behaviors generated during user use and the coordinates of the model in the scene， thereby achieving manipulation of the model behavior. Due to the characteristics of the three.js runtime environment， using a mouse and keyboard is sufficient to change the X， Y，and Z coordinate values of the 3D model， completing all operations such as movingand rotating. By monitoring mouse and keyboard events during use， the model is bound to corresponding events. When the event is monitored and the corresponding event is triggered， the position of the model in three-dimensional space can be changed， achieving corresponding effects. This change in position is not constrained by the movement characteristics on the plane like 2D， and can achieve better 3D effects and experimental simulation effects during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn the process of changing the position of a model， other models in the scene monitor their own coordinates and the model coordinates ofthe changed position in real time. Once the relationship between the two coordinates meets the coordinate relationship of the interaction conditions between the pre designed models， the two models will make the specified interaction behavior in time to achieve the ideal interaction effect. For example， during the process|删除段之间换行|of manipulating experimental equipment to move and place it on a pallet balance tray， the system will calculate the distance between the coordinates of the experimental equipment and the monitoring area above the pallet balance tray in real time. When the monitoring area above the pallet is reached， the interaction condition between the experimental equipment and the balance is reached， and the balance and experimental equipment will tilt in the corresponding direction to achieve interaction during COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【39】In order to present 3D interactive effects and enhance the immersive experience of user experimental operations， the renderer. render() in three.js is used to refresh the position of the models in the scene based on coordinates after a very short period of time， and change the virtual simulation scene in real time. Cooperate with a perspective camera and combine model coordinate changes to present different display effects， giving people a sense of realism and achieving realistic 3D interactive behavior.\n\n【40】Simulation system 3D effects\n\n【41】The Saxon Bowl Physics Experiment System is a software based on the B-S mode 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， and its main interface is shown in Figure删除4:<u> 4</u>. By selecting the \"Experiment Introduction\"， \"Experiment Principle\"， or \"Start Experiment\" buttons， you can jump to the corresponding interface. The user can complete the experiment preview and operation in the measurement and simulation process display area of the four major parameters of mass， radius， density， and time， and fill in the experimental measurement data in a table to save during COVID-19 pandemic .\n\n【42】Conclusion\n\nAiming at the problem that the existing domestic physical experiment simulation software iss two-dimensional and lacks|删除段之间换行|three-dimensional simulation software， this article takes the classic fluid mechanics experiment - Saxon bowl sinking experiment as an example， develops a fluid mechanics experiment simulation system based on Three.js， introduces 3D technology to achieve three-dimensional simulation effects， breaks through the limitations of two-dimensional software planarity， and greatly increases the interest and observability of the experiment.

Since last one year， he is also on nistami powder - a combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium inhalation. Despite cough there was no sense of constriction in chest， neither any spasmodic component he was familiar with. On that particular day， he had not taken any dose of inhaler as he had not felt any necessity for it. During the bout of cough， however， he decided to inhale nistami powder. There was some relief but still the impulse to cough continued. He sucked in some lozenges thereafter. It really had no effect but before lying down， he decided to take in Foracort (formoterol and budesonide) inhaler in apprehension of disturbed sleep. As he inhaled， he coughed out a single piece of gram seed of about5 mm x5 mm.  indicating the real cause of his cough|删除段之间换行|The patient recalled a bout of cough during the dinner on 1.7.2021， when he had eaten a vegetable preparation containing gram seeds.\n\n【14】Patient does not suffer from any neurological disease but has a habit ofeating fast.\n\n【15】In the past history， a similar episode had occurred following ingestion of small garlic of similar size.

Used in Morocco for its cosmetic food and therapeutic properties in particularly anemia and all blood diseases. It can be toxic if it is incorrectly dosed. We report 3 cases of nephrotoxicity collected in the nephrology and hemodialysis service of the IBNROCHD university hospital center in Casablanca： 3 women aged 15， 39 and 47 years， following the ingestion of infusion of this plant at doses indeterminate， presented with acute tubule-interstitial nephritis. These new cases of nephrotoxicity at Rubia tinctorum must challenge the need to know how to evoke the diagnosis， to inform， to fight against the trivialization of its consumption， to encourage research on the traditional pharmacopoeia allowing to identify their therapeutic properties in order to formalize， rationalize and codify their prescriptions.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Rubia tinctorum (El FOUA) is a plant widely used for thousands of years as a source of red color with its variants for dyeing textiles ， in cosmetology， in food as an additive but also as a drug with many therapeutic properties. It is very widespread in the world and particularly in Europe， Asia and North Africa.\n\n【4】In Morocco and in the Mediterranean basin， it is a ubiquitous plant. It is used for dyeing purposes by obtaining a red dye intended for dyeing， painting and even food. Added to this is its medicinal use in many fields. Indeed it is very popular with Moroccan women， as a purgative， after childbirth. A decoction of the whole plant is prescribed in anemia and all diseases of the blood. Its daily intake is recommended to increase blood volume and improve the complexion.\n\n【5】However， Rubia tinctorum is very rich in anthraquinone derivatives. It is considered according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and some other health and food organizations (such as Health Canada or the French Ministry of Agriculture) as involving risks for the consumer. Recent studies have shown a certain toxicity especially on the kidney with a mutagenic or even carcinogenic power of certain anthraquinone derivatives \\[11.\n\n【6】Patients and Methods\n\n【7】We report 3 cases of nephrotoxicity collected in the nephrology and hemodialysis service of the IBNROCHD hospital center in Casablanca： Women aged 15 39 years and 47 years following the ingestion of infusion of this plant in undetermined doses to treat anemia.\n\n【8】Results\n\n【9】Observation 1\n\n【10】HE aged 15， with no particular pathological history， admitted to the nephrology department for a glomerular syndrome with renal insufficiency at 66 mg/L of plasma creatinine and 24-h proteinuria at 1 g/24 h and aseptic leukocyturia after taking Rubia tinctorum for ten days， infused several times a day for iron deficiency anemia.\n\n【11】On examination， the patient is apyretic， normo tensioned to 130/70 mmHg， presence of a protein cross with urinary strips without traces of blood， diuresis is calculated at 300 ml per day.\n\n【12】The assessment revealed an acute renal failure at 66 mg/L of creatinine， 24-h proteinuria at 1g/24 h without impact on the protidogram， sterile ECBU with leukocyturia at 200，000 e/ml. Kidney ultrasound showed good kidneys， well differentiated without dilation of the excretory tract.\n\n【13】Observation 2\n\n【14】LN aged 39， with no pathological history， hospitalized in the nephrology department for glomerular syndrome with 24-h proteinuria at 2 g/24 with severe acute renal failure at 90 mg/l\n\n【15】of plasma creatinine and aseptic leukocyturia without hematuria or hypertension in the context of incoercible vomiting following the taking of\"elfoua\" for 5 days taken in front of a skin-mucous pallor.\n\n【16】On examination， the patient is non-pyretic， normo-tensioned at120/70 mmHg， diuresis is calculated at 500 ml per day， with two urine strips of protein withouthematuria on the urine strip. mg/L creatinine，24-h protein at 2 g/24 h without impact on the protidogram，ECBU sterile with leukocyturia at 120，000 e/ml. The renal ultrasound was without abnormality.\n\n【17】Observation 3\n\n【18】AH aged 47， hospitalized in nephrology for acute renal failure at 73 mg/l of plasma creatinine incidental discovery during a CPA assessment for cholecystectomy with the notion oftaking\"ELFOUA\"a week before admission.\n\n【19】On examination， the patient is apyretic， normo-tense， diuresis is kept at 1000 ml per day， with urine strip a protein cross without hematuria. The assessment revealed an acute renal failure at 73mg/L of creatinine， 24 h protein at 1 g/24 h without impact on the protidogram， ECBU sterile with leukocyturia at 100 000 e/ml. The renal ultrasound was without abnormality， patients underwent renal biopsy punctures which showed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Therapeutically all our patients were put on corticosteroid therapy with a good improvement in creatinine.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】Despite progress in pharmacology， the therapeutic use of plants is very present in certain countries of the world， especially those developing notwithstanding a medical system modern. Morocco by the richness and diversity of its flora constitutes a true phytogenetic reservoir with around 4500 plant species and subspecies， including Rubia Tinctorum  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the literature， the data concerning intoxication in madder are rare and few documented. Use for food， curative or aesthetic purposes of certain plants possibly toxic， or at least a part ， can induce serious poisoning， even fatal.\n\n【22】These poisoning is a frequent accident in most regions of the world\\[21.\n\n【23】Rubia Tinctorum has been used for thousands of years. The properties most cited in the literature for this plant are 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>： Its diuretic activity and especially as a hypotensive， its emmenagogue activity， its activity in obstructions of the spleen， its purgative/laxative activity and its activity cholagogue.\n\n【24】The study of the chemical composition of the roots of Rubia tinctorum has shown its richness in anthraquinones in its two free and combined forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Free anthraquinone forms have no marked pharmacological activity. These free genins present in the drug or formed by the beginning of gastric hydrolysis and which reach the intestine are absorbed at the level of the small intestine， are glucurono-conjugated at the hepatic level and largely eliminated by the urinary route. We also note the existence of an enterohepatic cycle.\n\n【25】The combined forms are neither absorbed nor hydrolyzed in the small intestine. When they reach the colon， they are hydrolyzed by B-glucosidases from the intestinal flora and the anthraquinones released are reduced and will act on intestinal motility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Action on the Na-K-ATPase pump in the cell membrane of enterocytes： By inhibiting the pump， sodium in the colon cells is increased， which leads to a decrease in the reabsorption of water and sodium. This explains the laxative effect. The excessive use of anthraquinones can lead to recto-colic melanoses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， by a cytotoxic effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【26】As part of the assessment of the madder root safety ， used as food coloring， toxicity tests were carried out on mice. An acute toxicity test was carried out by administration for 14 madder root days at doses of 0， 500， 2000， 3500， and 5000 mg/kg of body weight. A male mouse receiving 5000 mg/kg body weight died before the end of the study， indicating that the maximum tolerated dose of GR was between 3500 and 5000 mg/kg body weight. A subacute GR toxicity test was also carried out with 62 mice of each sex， with a diet containing madder root at concentrations of 0.3； 0.6； 1.25； 2.5 and 5% for 90\n\n【27】days. All mice tolerated these doses. None of the mice treated with RG showed clinical signs of toxicity. Histopathological examination showed retention cysts in the kidneys and vaginal epidermal cysts in some of the treated or control mice. No hyperplastic， pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions and no pathological signs of toxicity were found. These results suggest that dietary exposure to GR at these doses has no acute or subacute toxic effects on mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Another study of chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity was carried out. For 90 days repeated doses of 0； 0.6； 1.2； 2.5 and 5.0% of the test substance. The results demonstrate toxic effects of madder root on the liver，kidneys and on the hematopoietic system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Histopathological changes were mainly observed in the proximal renal tubules， such as vacuolar microvesicular degeneration in the cortex and caryomegaly in the external medulla， the lesions being evident even with 0.6%. In the external medulla， the increase in cell proliferation activity， appreciated by the proliferation of nuclear antigen cells， has been observed. The Severity of focal hepatocyte necrosis increased only in females， to 5.0%， while the increase in the relative weight of the liver but also that of conjugated bilirubin was evident in both sexes， at the dose 1.2%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【30】A more recent study of the carcinogenicity was conducted to elucidate the long-term effects of Rubia tinctorum and its target organs. Histologically， the frequency of caryomegaly and atypical hyperplasia of the tubules， as well as adenomas and carcinomas in the renal cells， increased significantly in the groups treated in both sexes. These results show that RG exerts an unequivocal carcinogenic power on the cells of the renal tubules and hepatocytes in rats 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Regarding toxicity in humans， an analysis of 11 studies treating colorectal cancers and the use of laxatives has shown that the use of laxatives has increased risk of colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Other studies have mentioned anthraquinones specifically in evaluating the use of laxatives as a risk factor for cancer. Melanosis coli (discoloration of cells in the colon corresponding to cell death if it is due to excessive use of anthraquinones). In short， anthraquinones should not be used long term and improperly because of the risk of melanosis coli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\nIn the literature， renal toxicity linked to the consumption of elfoua has not been described in humans， but studies done in rats have shown that the administration of this plant can cause tubular necrosis， with nephritis interstitial. These effects have been observed|删除段之间换行|following chronic ingestion of large doses. Cases have been declared and registered according to the pharmacovigilance center of Morocco.\n\n【35】The association of histological lesions and the taking of elfoua in this patient evokes its toxic effect on the kidney that constitutes a limit to the use of this plant despite its therapeutic qualities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Immunotherapy can generate immune-related adverse events involved all organs， in particular checkpoint inhibitors PD1/PDL1 can develop autoimmune type 1 diabetes.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： A 64 years old man affected by metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma， after conventional therapy， was treated with pembrolizumab (a PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor)：After ten weeks， he showed hyperglycemia with ketosis， stable reduced c-peptide， and positive anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies therefore he was treated with insulin injection. The histological image of pancreas appeared like an immune-mediated insulitis.\n\n【3】Conclusion： New guidelines are recently published to inform clinicians and patients about frequent immune adverse events of these new immunotherapies.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Recently new cancer immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and their use is constantlyincreasing. Immune checkpoints are signal pathways that regulate the activation of T-cells in order to protect the tissues from damage triggered by pathogens and to prevent autoimmunity. Immune checkpoint inhibitors act on immune regulation and immune system checkpoint： The most famous are Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CLTLA4) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and Programmed cell Death protein 1 (PD1) and his ligands (PDL1 and PDL2)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The target of these new therapies is to develop specificity and long-term memory of immune adapted response to achieve tumor regression. In comparison with conventional chemotherapies， these molecules play a role by stimulating immune system and not killing cancer cells so they have a longer latent time to start acting on cell mass (about16-20 weeks) but improve long-term overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.

CTL4-targeted immunotherapy is associated with increased susceptibility to hypophysitis and primary thyroid dysfunction， PD1-targeted immunotherapy is associated with primary thyroid dysfunction and type 1 diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】In our medical clinic we visited a patient of 64 years old for hyperglycemia. He had an irrelevant remote history and one first relative affected by type 2 diabetes； the patient and nobody in his family had any autoimmune disease. Nine months earlier he had been diagnosed with non-small cell lung carcinoma with already evidence of repetitive nodal and vertebral disease (L1-L2). Oncologist started with conventional therapy with cisplatin but patient showed poor response and the disease progressed. The patient was candidate for treatment with Pembrolizumab. This therapy was started with absence of mutations for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and with presence of PD L1 expression in 26% of tumoral cell (PD-L1 IHC 28-8 Dako). Ten weeks after the beginning of treatment with PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor compared hyperglycemia (234 mg/dl) with ketosis and mild increase of lipase (333 U/L， normal value 140 U/L-200 U/L) in the absence of suggestive radiological pancreatitis. At the same time basal C-Peptide was severely reduced (0.2 ng/ml， normal value 0.78 ng/ml to 1.89 ng/ml)； anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies were positive (299U/ml， normal value 0 U/ml to 5 U/ml)， anti-insulin antibodies were negative. Anti-IA2 (tyrosine phosphatase)， anti-insulin or anti-ZnT8 antibodies are not performed and HLA haplotype wasn't\n\n【8】tested. Multiple daily insulin treatment was started getting a discreet glycemic control. In the following weeks no recovery of basal beta-cell function (evaluated with C peptide assays) was detected.\n\n【9】Patientdied for cardiacCtamponade frommetastatic hemopericardium， after 36 months from the oncological diagnosis. It followed an autoptic investigation： the pancreatic histology was indicative for typical insulitis and pancreas beta-cells expressed PDL1in 42% of specific endocrine tissue .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The case described is a new form of autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes， which appears rapidly as a consequence of the use of checkpoint inhibitors. Yoneda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> showed with immunohistochemical analyses the number (more than 15 times higher than that of the control group) and the composition(CD8>CD4) of infiltrating CD3-positive T lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and exocrine region in the pancreas of a patient who developed type 1 diabetes after immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Non-obese diabetic mice lacking PD-L1 develop rapid onset of diabetes： In pancreatic islets low expression of PD-L1 is associated with increased B-cell injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In patients affected by autoimmune type 1 diabetes， a decrease PD1 expression is reported also in peripheral CD4+ T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【12】We show a histologic image of a typical insulitis related to use of a checkpoint inhibitor like the insulitis in autoimmune type 1 diabetes. The expression of PD-L1 on beta pancreatic cells may be implicated in immunological tolerance and may induce an autoimmune process.\n\nOther cases of type 1 diabetes related to PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors are described in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. The increasing use of these new drugs stimulates the publication of new guidelines for the|删除段之间换行|identification and treatment of specific side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. These side effects may compare in 7 to 11 weeks after the beginning of therapies with checkpoint inhibitors，but they also may develop after months or years， and may have a long duration. It's important to identify these symptoms because the treatment is completely different from the conventional chemotherapy.\n\n【14】In conclusion， immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-CTLA-4and anti-PDL-1) can induce the development of autoimmune diseases， among which autoimmune endocrinopathies (thyroiditis， adrenalite， hypophysitis， type 1 diabetes)： Therefore， before the beginning of the treatment， it's important to take an accurate personal and familiar history， to control hormones and glycemia before， during and after treatment and， if possible， to evaluate a screening antibodies panel in order to select patients at greater risk of developing an autoimmune diseases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

As reported in different articles， the most common causative microorganism is Streptococcus， particularly those from the Viridans group. We present the case of a postpartum woman with an epidural empyema due to Streptococcus pyogenes， which is manifested with paraesthesia in the upper left limb and headache， so a nuclear magnetic resonance is performed where a right extra-axial frontal-parietal collection suggestive of subdural empyema is described. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and underwent surgical removal， with a resolution of the clinical picture.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Central nervous system infections secondary to epidural or spinal anesthesia are a rare entity(<1/12000 patients)， although it is a severe complication that can cause neurological sequela or even death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，5\\]</u>. The microorganism that most frequently causes infection of the Central Nervous System (CNS) after performing a lumbar puncture is the genus Streptococcus， primarily the Viridans group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Except for in PubMed we have not found any case of subdural empyema after epidural anesthesia in which the isolated microorganism was Streptococcus pyogenes.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】We present the case of a 45-year-old woman with a history of cesarean section 13 days before admission， which received epidural anesthesia during the procedure. She arrives on the Emergency Department with paresthesia in the upper left limb and headache that had lasted for several days. An exploration of the incomplete right-hemispheric syndrome is confirmed， so cranial CT is performed where a right hemispheric subdural collection is observed that causes compression and edema of said cerebral hemisphere . The patient does not report fever or dysthymic sensation， and the blood sample shows leukocytosis (22200/uL with 95% neutrophils) and elevation of acute phase reactants (RCP 41.5 mg/dL， procalcitonin 6.05 ng/mL)， as well as coagulopathy (INR 1.4， PT 62%) and acute non-oliguric renal failure (creatinine 1.28 mg/dL， urea 68 mg/dL). Empiric antibiotic treatment with meropenem and vancomycin is initiated for sepsis coverage. Lumbar puncture is not performed given the presence of significant cerebral edema.\n\n【6】After 24 h of admission， the patient has focal epileptic seizures with left oculocephalic deviation and clones of the upper left limb， without loss of consciousness. Antiepileptic treatment is initiated， and she is admitted to the ICU for surveillance.\n\n【7】Since the clinical evolution worsens with the persistence of seizures and progression of the hemispheric syndrome with paresis ofleft limbs， we decide to perform MRI where right extra-axial frontal to parietal collection suggestive of subdural empyema is described .\n\n【8】Antibiotictreatment is modifiedby replacing vancomycin withlinezolid， and the case is discussed with Neurosurgery who decides on urgent surgical intervention， draining purulent fluid . The surgical samples are sent to Microbiology， and gram-positive cocci growth is reported.\n\nThe patient returns to the ICU where she remains 48 h more， with good evolution， so she is transferred to the Department of Neurosurgery， without presenting new seizure episodes after six days of admission， and not presenting epileptic form electrical activity in EEG since the 9th day of admission. She is discharged after 16 days of admission， with the only hypoesthesia in left-hand|删除段之间换行|that occurred after one week of the epidural puncture. They describe3 cases， which begin with headache， nausea， malaise， or drowsiness24 h to 72 h after the epidural puncture. Although the microorganism involved in 2 of the 3 cases described was of the genus Streptococcus， none of them were Streptococcus pyogenes.\n\n【10】The diagnosis should be made with lumbar puncture whenever possible， as well as an imaging test. Viola et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> described the case of a 5-year-old male with subdural empyema by StreptocoCCUS pyogenes， with normal results on the CT， and was finally diagnosed through nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Younis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> reviewed 39 cases of patients with sinusitis and intracranial complications， observing greater accuracy in the diagnosis with MRI when compared to CT， so they establish that MRI is the best method for the diagnosis of intracranial infections.\n\n【11】fingers.\n\n【12】From an infectious point of view， Microbiology reported the isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes in the subdural collection， so she is discharged with antibiotic treatment with metronidazole and linezolid.\n\n【13】Jim et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> published a case series of patients with complicated community bacterial meningitis with subdural empyema， finding an incidence of 2.7% and a mortality of 18%. The microorganism most frequently associated with this condition was Streptococcus pneumoniae， and 4% of patients had a positive culture for Streptococcus pyogenes. At the time of admission， 85% of the patients had a headache and 80% fever.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】There are several ways in which a microorganism can reach the CNS after an epidural puncture： lumbar puncture during a period of bacteremia， intrathecal administration of contaminated substances or lack of asepsis in the puncture site. However， it is not usually possible to find out what is the mechanism of infection in most cases.\n\n【16】With regard to treatment， all were treated with beta-lactam antibiotics， penicillin/amoxicillin being the most common regimen(36%)， although the use of third-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems in monotherapy or combination was also frequent. Adjuvant corticosteroid therapy was used in 89% of the patients， and surgical evacuation was performed in 18%， the latter being more frequent in those patients who presented midline deviation.\n\n【17】Streptococcus pyogenes is a group A Streptococcus， gram-positive facultative anaerobic.

However， the incidence of puerperal sepsis with positive cultures at the CNS is very low (after more than 8 days of childbirth only one case has been reported)， and the heterogenicity of the signs and symptoms as well as the places where the bacteria have been isolated after this period of time suggest that the infection does not have to do directly with an ascending vaginal infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. However， in the case of our patient， no vaginal exudate culture was performed，|删除段之间换行|so we cannot completely rule out that this was the origin of the sepsis that finally conditioned the subdural empyema.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Infection of the central nervous system after performing an epidural puncture is a rare entity， but with high morbidity and mortality， so it should be suspected in patients who present with symptoms of infection， especially if they have neurological symptoms， after an epidural puncture. The most accurate imaging test to detect them is MRI， and the most indicated treatment would be antibiotic therapy with beta-lactams or lincosamides if resistance to the first ones is known， as well as surgical evacuation mainly if empyema generates mass effect or displacement of the midline.\n\n【21】删除6:<u>1\\.

The mean age of onset is approximately 30 years， with fewer than 15% of cases in the age group above40 years. The diagnosis ofTakayasu’s arteritis can be challenging without a proper clinical suspicion and acumen. We report a case of Takayasu's arteritis diagnosed in a 63-year-old lady who presented with heart failure despite an obvious blood pressure discrepancy in her previous seven pregnancies.\n\n【2】Keywords： Takayasu's arteritis； Blood pressure discrepancy； Computed tomography aortogram\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Takayasu's arteritis is a large vessel vasculitis， involving the aorta and its major branches. It affects mainly the young females， with higher prevalence among Asian populations. Non-specific presentations and lack of specific laboratory markers make the diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis challenging. The presence of characteristic features such as absent or diminished pulse and blood pressure discrepancy in the absence of proper clinical suspicion might result in missed diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent any serious complications of the disease.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 63-year-old lady presented with chest pain and heart failure symptoms of orthopnea and reduced effort tolerance. The chest pain is heavy in nature， central and non-radiating. She has a background history of bronchial asthma diagnosed 40 years ago， in good control with turbuhaler symbicort. She has a history of admission to a district hospital 6 months ago with similar chest pain， treated as unstable angina with 3 days of subcutaneous fondaparinux and discharged home with aspirin and clopidogrel. She was referred to a tertiary centre for further management of ischemic heart disease， however， still awaiting an appointment date.\n\n【7】Upon presentation， she was hypotensive with a blood pressure of 85/50 mmHg and a heart rate of 103 beats per min. Her Glasgow Coma Scale was full and orientated and does not appear to be in respiratory distress with an oxygen saturation of 97% under room air. Her physical examination revealed a displaced heart apex beat to 64h intercostal space at left anterior axillary line with the presence of pansystolic murmur over the apex and early diastolic murmur over the left sternal edge. There were fine crackles heard at the lower thoracic region bilaterally with no pedal edema. Otherwise， her jugular venous pressure was not raised with good peripheral perfusion and other systemic examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【8】Her chest radiograph demonstrated a congested lungs field with bilateral blunted costophrenic angle and cardiomegaly . Her electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left bundle branch block and a bedside echocardiogram revealed a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% with severely dilated left atrium and ventricle and the presence of severe mitral and aortic regurgitation. Otherwise， her serum creatinine kinase and troponin I levels were not raised at 41U/L and 16.8 pg/mL respectively. Other baseline blood investigations including full blood count， renal profile， liver function test， and coagulation profile were normal.\n\nShe was admitted for cardiogenic shock secondary to acute coronary syndrome. She was clinically well in ward with no chest pain or shortness of breath. However， she remained hypotensive|删除段之间换行|CTA： Computed Tomography Aortogram；ECA： External Carotid Artery； ICA：Internal Carotid Artery； IJC： Internal Jugular Vein|删除段之间换行|with unexplainable increasing inotropic support. Further history taking revealed that she has the similar issue in her previous seven pregnancies in which she was noted to be hypotensive and only able to get a normotensive blood pressure by measurement on her lower limbs. Otherwise， her pregnancies were uncomplicated and uneventful. Detailed physical examination subsequently revealed weak bilateral brachial and radial pulses with good bilateral femoral，\n\n【10】CTA： Computed Tomography Aortogram\n\n【11】CTA： Computed Tomography Aortogram\n\n【12】CTA： Computed Tomography Aortogram\n\n【13】popliteal， and dorsalis pedis pulses. Measurement of blood pressure on different limbs showed a significant discrepancy between upper and lower limbs with 91/57 mmHg over right arm， 90/50 mmHg over left arm， 179/69 mmHg over right leg， and 185/62 mmHg over left leg.\n\nA computed tomography aortogram was done and revealed an ectatic ascending aorta and right brachiocephalic trunk with multiple|删除段之间换行|aneurysms over proximal right external carotid artery， dorsal pancreatic artery， and suprarenal and infrarenal abdominal aorta， with thrombosed aneurysm of bilateral subclavian arteries， complete stenosis of left external carotid artery， and thrombosis of bilateral internal iliac arteries . A diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis was made based on 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for Takayasu's arteritis. She was discharged with Cardiprin 1 tablet OD， Bisoprolol 5 mg OD， Perindopril 8 mg OD，and Spironolactone6.25 mg OD， and given outpatient follow-up under the Cardiology， Rheumatology， and Vascular teams.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Takayasu's arteritis has been reported in all parts of the world. However， data on epidemiology of Takayasu’s arteritis is limited， probably due to the rarity of the disorder. It appears to be more prevalence among the Asian populations， affecting mostly young females in 80% to 90% of the cases， with an age of onset between 10to 40 years old通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nThe onset of symptoms in Takayasu’s arteritis tends to be sub acute with a wide range of presentations. In the early phase of Takayasu's arteritis， non-specific constitutional symptoms such as weight loss， low grade fever， night sweat， arthralgia， myalgia， malaise， and fatigue are common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. As the inflammation progresses， leading to permanent vascular injuries， characteristic features become more apparent. One of the common features is hypertension， which can be a result of renal artery stenosis or coarctation of aorta， with the former being the more common cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. More than 80% of cases have diminished or absent pulses associated with limb claudication and blood pressure discrepancies. Vascular bruits present in up to94% of cases， particularly affecting the carotid， subclavian， and abdominal vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Chest pain may occur due to coronary artery ostial narrowing from aortitis or coronary arteritis. Mesenteric artery involvement will result in post-prandial abdominal pain， diarrhea，|删除段之间换行|and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Neurological symptoms such as light-headedness， vertigo， headache， convulsions， strokes， and visual impairment may result from carotid and vertebral arteries stenosis. About 10% to 30% of patients experienced carotidynia， which is tenderness of a carotid artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The diagnosis of Takayasu’s arteritis is often delayed due to the non-specific presentations and lack of specific laboratory markers. Time from onset to diagnosis may take several months up to 11years. Without a proper clinical suspicion， the diagnosis can be missed even with apparent signs such as loss of peripheral pulses. Significant delayed in diagnosis of >12 months may subject patients to angioplasty and surgery， which may be prevented by an increased clinical awareness of Takayasu’s arteritis for earlier diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In the present case， she was asymptomatic with only blood pressure discrepancies noted in multiple pregnancies， however， were unheeded leading to delay diagnosis with complication of heart failure.\n\n【19】There is no unified guideline for the management of Takayasu's arteritis due to the lack of complete placebo-controlled and randomized clinical trials. High dose prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) is the standard initial treatment for Takayasu's arteritis， with conventional immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate and azathioprine to be added as steroid sparing agent while tapering down steroids. Some physicians prefer an initial treatment with the combination of steroids and another immunosuppressive agent. To date， there is no evidence on clinical outcomes of different immunosuppressive agents. Biologic agents such as anti-TNF agents， rituximab and tocilizumab are choices of treatment for patients who are resistant or intolerant to initial therapy. Antiplatelet may help in lower down ischemic events in patient with Takayasu's arteritis. Endovascular interventions including balloon angioplasty and stent graft replacement play an important role in revascularization of the affected organs with arterial stenosis and occlusion， especially in late diagnosis of Takayasu's arteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

He suffers from paranoid schizophrenia since the age of 30 years and he was followed since 2005 in psychiatric department of Sousse. He was admitted in 2005 in psychiatric unity during four months for resistant auditory hallucination. The diagnosis of resistant schizophrenia was retained and the patient was treated with 900 mg/day Clozapine without side effects.\n\n【5】Mr. A.T had a good adherence treatment. Compliance has been verified using questionnaire administrated to the patient and a member of his family and using compliance items (items 9，Aand B) of the Schedule for the Assessment of Insight -Expanded version (SAI-E).\n\n【6】To evaluate efficacy of treatment， we used the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)， the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptom (SANS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS).\n\n【7】Plasma concentrations of Clozapine and the main metabolite Norclozapine were evaluated by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography method (HPLC).\n\n【8】Despite the administration of high doses of Clozapine (900 mg/day)， correct plasma Clozapine concentration and correct plasma Norclozapine concentration (respectively 824 ng/ml and 72 ng/ml)， we have achieved only 22% improvement in the BPRS.\n\n【9】Initially， we associate Amisulpride at a dose of 400 mg/day and diazepam at a dose of 15 mg/day to Clozapine without improving productive symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment.\n\n【10】The second alternative was to combine 4 mg/day Risperidone and 15 mg/day Diazepam at the same dose of Clozapine during 20 weeks.

Clozapine and Haloperidol 10 mg/day was also associated but quickly stopped after development of extrapyramidal syndrome.\n\n【11】Finally， when we choose to associate Clozapine 900 mg/day to Aripiprazole at a dose of 10 mg/day， we noted better improvement in positive symptoms with a marked decrease of anxiety and psychotic symptoms. In this association we found improvement of 48% in the SAPS，42% in SANS and 40% in BPRS.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】The results of this clinical case suggest that the addition of Aripiprazole to Clozapine in treatment ultra resistant schizophrenia could be an effective therapeutic alternative.

The ulcer started as a nodule which ruptured and formed an ulcer. The latter enlarged gradually with mild pain and occasional foul-smelling discharge. We prepared him for excision biopsy and split thickness skin grafting. The histology result showed squamous cell carcinoma. The photomicrograph is shown on figure two.\n\n【2】Aim： To show that skin cancers may be occurring in younger people in recent years.\n\n【3】Keywords： Albino； Skin cancer； Solar damage\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Albinism is an autosomal recessive condition that results in inadequate or absence of melanin in the skin and other tissues. The melanocytes， the cells that produce melanin， though present， fail to produce the pigment because an enzyme， tyrosinase， is either absent or does not produce enough melanin. Therefore， there is variable absence of melanin depending on the degree of activity of the enzyme. Besides， focal failure of the enzyme in different parts of the body gives rise to conditions such as ocular albinism or isolated absence of melanin in the hair or any other part of the body.\n\n【6】The main culprit in the aetiology of skin cancers is ultraviolet radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. On the electromagnetic spectrum the ultraviolet radiation occupies the wave lengths between 400 nm and200 nm， 400 nm to 700 nm being the visible spectrum. Ultraviolet radiation- A， B and C presently have health significance. Ultraviolet radiation A was initially thought to affect mainly the aging process by causing wrinkles but it has recently been implicated as a cofactor to UVB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The latter is known to cause most of the skin cancers because it gets to the earth in significant amounts Ultraviolet radiation C does not get to the earth in significant amounts because the ozone layer filters it out. However， production of fluorocarbons by human activity is making the ozone layer thinner and this will make UVC to steadily increase its appearance on the earth. It has been shown that the shorter the wavelength of ultraviolet radiation， the more the carcinogenic effect on the skin. Therefore UVC， having the shortest wave length among the ultraviolet rays， will cause more skin cancers if it gets to the earth in significant amount. Carcinogenicity of UV radiation is caused by mutation on the DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Photochemical damage by UV radiation is repaired by P gene products and the repair mechanism is impaired with aging giving rise to skin cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Case History\n\n【8】This is the case of a thirteen-year-old male albino who presented to us with a scalp ulcer of one-year duration. The ulcer started as a nodule which continued to increase in size and ruptured spontaneously to discharge a foul-smelling fluid. There was mild continuous pain and occasional fever. Dressing of the ulcer with honey and administration of tablets purchased over the counter did not heal it. Neither the patient nor his parents had education on sun protection for albinos 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\nOn examination the patient was chronically ill looking， mildly pale， anicteric and afebrile. The vital signs were a temperature of 36.8C， pulse rate of 86 beats/minute and respiratory rate of 20cycles/minute. There was extensive solar keratosis over the head， neck and upper limbs. The trunk and lower limbs had fewer solar keratosis. A fungating ulcer that measured 6 cm by 6 cm was located on the scalp，superior and lateral to the right ear. The posterior auricular， occipital， submandibular， submental and cervical lymph nodes were not palpable. The other regions of the body were grossly normal. We made a clinical diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. The investigations done and their|删除段之间换行|results were packed cell volume (32%)， urine analysis was normal. Excision biopsy of the lesion was done and the histology result was squamous cell carcinoma .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Our index patient is 13 years old and presented one year after the lesion started. Therefore， the cancer started at twelve years of age. This is an early age for albinos to develop skin cancer even in our tropical climate where the full impact of the sun is felt. It is believed that although a lot of the damage is done in childhood， skin cancers develop later in life. Indeed， one source quotes fifty percent of skin damage to have occurred at 15 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. There is increase in the global incidence of skin cancers and now we are beginning to see these cancers in younger age groups. Therefore， the question to be answered by research is whether more UV radiation， especially UVC， is reaching the earth due to human activity. A retrospective study of skin cancers in our hospital for the last two decades will show the age profile the patients and younger people may be having skin cancers. However， the records of patients in the last 20 years are unreliable in our hospital. Most of the skin cancers are cause by UVB but UVC is known to be more carcinogenic if significant amount of the latter gets to the earth.\n\nThe finding of squamous cell carcinoma in our patient is not surprising because Asuquo et al. have shown that skin cancers|删除段之间换行|in albinos in our community are more commonly squamous cell carcinoma and not basal cell carcinoma as seen in Caucasians \\[9-111.\n\n【13】The management of skin cancers in our community is a challenge for many reasons namely ignorance， late presentation， and poverty. Ignorance and late presentation can be addressed by education of the people on radio， television and health talk in different institutions. Albino parents and the affected children， when they are old enough to understand， should cover the body with the right color that does not absorb UV radiation (e.g. white)， use a hat with a wide brim or umbrella in the sun， do outdoor activities when UV radiation is least(between 6 am and 10 am and after 4 pm)， use sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 15 and report early to hospital for treatment of solar keratosis and ulcers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>. The government should treat skin lesions in albinos free or give a substantial waiver for the treatment.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Skin lesions in albinos are curable if presentation is early.

Therefore， this study aimed to investigate the impact of physicochemical parameters including nephrotoxic trace elements on CKDu progression in Uva province. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to study the demographic and other lifestyle-related factors of CKDu patients in the identified prevalent areas. Along with that， water samples were collected from the drinking water sources of the relevant patients. Water samples were analyzed for physicochemical parameters i.e.； pH， Electrical Conductivity (EC)， Total Hardness(TH)， Nitrate， Fluoride (F) and heavy metals following standard protocols. Statistical analysis was conducted by IBM SPSS software version删除4:<u> 20</u>. The survey data confirmed that CKDu is prominent within the male population who engage in agricultural activities as an occupation and whose drinking water source is shallow-dug wells. Out of all the DS areas， the highest mean TH andMg+2ion content were recorded in TDS and WDS areas. The highest F content was recorded in the TDS area. Correlation data of F content revealed a significant positive relationship (p<0.05，r²=0.69) with Mgtion content whereas nephrotoxic heavy metals showed a negative correlation with F content in water. The results suggest that the increased hardness along with high F content in drinking water may positively affect the progression of CKDu in Uva province.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Chronic Kidney Disease of unknown etiology/origin (CKDu) is a kind of nephropathy that emerged in the mid-90s in several tropical to sub-tropical regional countries like Nicaragua， Andra Pradesh in India， El Salvador， Egypt， Costa Rica and North Central Province (NCP) in Sri Lanka通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. It has escalated progressively over the past two decades within low socioeconomic paddy farming communities in Sri Lanka. It is demarcated into specific geological areas of the country， especially dry and intermediate zone.

The study describes in this paper investigates the impact of physicochemical parameters including nephrotoxic heavy metals on CKDu in Uva Province， Sri Lanka.\n\n【5】Methodology\n\n【6】Site selection\n\n【7】Three Divisional Secretariats (DS)administrative areas were selected for the study that has been identified with the highest number of CKDu occurrence from both the districts in Uva Province， namely； Mahiyangana DS (MDS)， Rideemaliyadda DS (RDS)， Kandaketiya DS (KDS) from Badulla district and Wellawaya DS (WDS)， Thanamalwila DS (TDS)， Siyambalanduwa DS (SDS) from Monaragala district.\n\n【8】Table 1： Physicochemical properties of water samples in CKDU endemic areas in Uva Province.\n\n| Parameter  | MahiyanganaMean± SD  | RideemaliyaddaMean ±SD  | KandaketiyaMean± SD  | WellawayaMean ± SD  | ThanamalwilaMean ± SD  | SiyamblanduwaMean±SD  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| pH  | 7.43±0.28  | 7.87±0.51a  | 6.94±0.37a  | 7.18±0.63a  | 7.35±0.43a  | 7.38±0.26  |\n| EC (uS/cm)  | 252.18±93.14  | 378.22±177.97a  | 390.77±153.80  | 341.12±184.24a  | 386.72±168.68  | 236.92 ±90.19b  |\n| TH (mg/L)  | 188.04±143.86  | 145.22±79.04  | 156.07±66.16  | 277.32±121.57  | 197.76±107.73  | 79.89±70.49c  |\n| Mg\\(mg/L)  | 11.69±10.25  | 8.74±10.42c  | 12.74±4.29  | 27.21±18.97a  | 30.47±18.54a  | 8.52±7.43c  |\n| F(mg/L)  | 1.34±0.44b  | 0.32±0.23c  | 0.35±0.34c  | 1.14±1.44b  | 2.09±2.35a  | 0.69±0.73c  |\n| Cr (ug/L)  | 0.36±0.88b  | 0.45±0.51b  | 0.48±0.45b  | 0.48±0.29b  | 0.80±0.28  | 0.49±0.425  |\n| Mn (ug/L)  | 125.09±332.46  | 115.33±383.53  | 11.33±21.68c  | 7.55±12.15c  | 1.81±2.64c  | 62.69±89.91b  |\n| Fe (ug/L)  | 39.94±61.286  | 29.63±22.93  | 34.05±27.37b  | 40.07±30.62b  | 41.92±34.31b  | 103.93±256.51a  |\n| Co (ug/L)  | 0.54±1.10a  | 0.27±0.55  | 0.35±0.42a  | 0.20±0.10a  | 0.36±0.23a  | 0.29±0.49#  |\n| Ni(ug/L)  | 1.66±3.63  | 1.30±1.25a  | 1.27±0.74a  | 0.82±0.66a  | 1.52±1.16a  | 0.76±0.80#  |\n| Cu(ug/L)  | 1.63±1.89  | 0.83±0.89c  | 1.98±2.87a  | 1.40±2.08  | 2.83±6.06  | 0.91±0.42c  |\n| Zn (ug/L)  | 42.11±72.38  | 12.47±11.93  | 39.67±67.45  | 12.48±8.62b  | 7.81±9.45b  | 10.56±16.55b  |\n| As(ug/L)  | 0.37±0.30c  | 0.23±0.15c  | 1.12±1.06a  | 0.55±0.70b  | 0.61±1.02b  | 0.27±0.19c  |\n| Cd (pg/L)  | 0.61±0.40  | 0.13±0.13  | 0.65±0.56  | 0.25±0.21b  | 0.07±0.04c  | 0.06±0.07c  |\n| Ba (ug/L)  | 79.60±56.65b  | 40.19±25.37c  | 66.42±33.56  | 116.05±69.47a  | 78.10±36.64b  | 60.32±56.38  |\n| Pb (ug/L)  | 1.55±3.04a  | 0.29±0.24c  | 0.84±0.68  | 0.32±0.18c  | 0.26±0.14c  | 0.36±0.12c  |\n\n【10】All values are means of triplicate determination ± SD\n\n【11】A total of 114 CKDu patients were selected for the survey， who resides in the selected DS areas from both districts in Uva province. The selected patients were above 18 years old and residents in the same area for more than 10 years. Demographic data of households were collected through a questionnaire. Data related to the drinking water sources， previous records of having hypertension， disease conditions like diabetes mellitus， snake bites， use of agrochemicals in day-to-day life， and daily water consumption details were also recorded.\n\n【12】Water sampling and analytical methods\n\n【13】Water samples were collected from 145 water resources that are being used for consumption (either drinking or cooking) and irrigation purpose by respondents including dug wells (n=138)， and tube wells (n=7). Water samples were directly filtered into sterile polyethylene vials using microfiltration (pore size -0.22 um) and followed by acidification with high purity 10% HNO，. Then samples were stored and transferred under cold conditions (<7°C) for analysis of trace elements including As， Cd， and Pb which are known as nephrotoxic heavy metals.\n\n【14】Parameters i.e.； pH， Electrical Conductivity (EC)， and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) were measured on-site using a multi-parameter(HACH， Loveland， Colorado， USA). The Total Hardness (TH) and Fluoride (F) content of water samples were measured by EDTA titrimetric method (APHA -234C) and SPANDS method using a UV visible Spectrophotometer (HACH DR 2700). Trace elements including major heavy metals (As， Cd， and Pb) were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Agilent7900， USA) (APHA， 1998). All the analyses were carried out in triplicated samples and statistical analysis was conducted by IBM SPSS software version删除4:<u> 20</u>.\n\n【15】Results and Discussion\n\nThe study population (n=114) represents 79.67% male and20.33% female respondents and the average age of them was 42.7(range： 23-78) of years. Out of the male respondents， 92.4% of the|删除段之间换行|study population in endemic areas were engaged in farming for more than 10 years and they have engaged in applying agrochemicals for their cultivations without any safety precautions.\n\n【17】Drinking water source of the majority of people in all study areas(MDS-87.09%，RDS-75%， KDS-67%，WDS-82.3%，TDS-78.4%， SDS-81.4%) were groundwater (shallow well water). They had been using the same water source for more than 10 years for drinking purposes and the water had not been subjected to purification. The average daily water consumption of the respondents was 5.4±1.7 L. Interestingly，62% of the endemic area population had used an average amount of1.2 L of water， that was directly consumed by a small pit dug in the paddy field or the small stream flows nearby the farming field when they get thirst during the fieldwork. The current study revealed that the CKDu prevalence among males was predominant in Uva Province and 91.7% of them are farmers by occupation. Shallow-dug wells are used to fetch water for consumption by the majority of the people， due to pipe-borne water or purified water facilities being lacking in the rural agricultural areas of the region.\n\n【18】Hardness in water is one of the important factors for CKDu， which is attributed to the Catand Mgt?ions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Higher mean TH， Mgt?ion content and F values were recorded in MDS，WDS and TDS areas in Uva province . Out of all the DS areas， the highest mean TH and Mg+?ion content were recorded in TDS (TH- 197.76±107.73 mg/L，Mg+2-30.47±18.54mg/L) and WDS (TH- 277.32±121.57 mg/L，Mgt2-27.21±18.97 mg/L) areas whereas the highest F content (2.09±2.35 mg/L) was recorded in TDS area. Interestingly， water samples collected from all DS areas are classified as hard water according to the SLSI standards. Further， recorded F content in TDS， WDS and MDS areas was higher than the SLSI permissible level (1 mg/L). Correlation data of F content revealed a significant positive relationship (p<0.05，r²=0.69) with Mgtion content  in the study samples. A previous study reported the formation of nephrotoxic MgF+ complex in water， due to the high levels of hardness along with the high levels of F ions in water 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【19】However， the measured nephrotoxic heavy metal levels in the water samples were far below the permissiblelevels for drinking water according to SLSI and WHO guidelines. Further， the correlation data of F content with As， Cd and Pb exhibited a negative correlation. The results of the current study aligned with a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， which express the low level of heavy metals in CKDu endemic areas in NCP. Another study reported alow level of heavy metal content in drinking water in Monaragala district 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\nThe prevalence of CKDu in Uva Province is becoming dominant in the area at a rapid rate. High levels of Mgt? ions increased the hardness of drinking well water and the high level of fluoride is|删除段之间换行|shown to be a major threat to the progression of CKDu in residents. Prolonged consumption of high fluoride and Mgt?-containing water along with even minute amounts of heavy metals may adversely affect the scenario. Moreover， further studies need to be carried out with more samples and clinical data to ascertain the cause of the etiology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This case reports reflects upon a healthy 46 year old female who presented with subtype of true neoplasm called a neural fibrolipoma arising from the plantar nerve. The patient was referred by her GP for an evaluation of an unknown painful soft tissue mass present in the right plantar aspect of the mid foot. The mass had been present for approximately 2 to 3 years and had recently increased in size in the last 4 months.

The patient was happy with the overall outcome and discharged. This case report highlights the need to consider the neural fibrolipoma as a rare case of plantar/heel pain and excision of the lesion would provide an excellent outcome.\n\n【4】Keywords： Plantar nerve； Neural fibrolipoma； Neuroma\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】A neuroma can be defined as benign tumour of nerve tissue. Neuromas can be differentiated into 3 categories. Firstly a true neuroma， secondly neuromas associated with trauma and finally neuromas as part of a syndrome such as neurofibromatosis or MEN2b. Neuromas are overlooked as a differential diagnosis for heel pain， and they are diagnosed by a combination of physical examination， history taking， and radiological imaging and by histopathological findings following excision.\n\n【7】A Neural fibrolipoma， also known as a lipofibromatous hamartoma is a benign， soft-tissue neoplasm generated by the proliferation of mature nerve sheet fibroblast and adipocytes leading to the formation of a palpable subcutaneous mass. The exact pathogenesis of a neural fibrolipoma is unknown however chronic irritation and trauma have known to play a precipitating factor. Often seen in nerves with high risk of compression such as the median nerve， it is very rare to present in the plantar nerve.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\nA healthy 46-year-old female who was referred by her GP for an evaluation of a painful soft tissue mass present in the right plantar aspect of the mid foot. The mass had been present for approximately 2 to 3 years and had recently increased in size in the last 4 months. The patient described the feeling as walking on a hard stone. There was no history of trauma or significant familyhistory. Upon inspection there was no apparent infection or skin changes. Upon examination the patient had bilateral planovalgus feet with bilateral hallux valgus worse on the right side. This swelling had led to chronic pain with some sensitivity and numbness over that area. Following|删除段之间换行|the patients' first appointment the patient received an injection of80 mg Depo-medrone and 1 ml of 1% Lignocaine under ultrasound guidance into the second MTP to temporarily provide symptomatic relief for the pain whilst an ultrasound was arranged to rule out plantar fibromatosis. X-rays ruled out any bony injury or obvious bone malignancy.\n\nUSS described this swelling in the plantar aspect of the mid-foot as well defined， hypoechoic tender lesion within the plantar subcutaneous tissue measuring approximately 17 mm x7 mm×11mm. More importantly the lesion extended deep to the plantar fascia|删除段之间换行|not arising from it hence ruling out plantar fibromatosis . In order to rule out any aggressive pathology an MRI with contrast was arranged which revealed a 2 cm by 5 mm tubular oblique lesion in the plantar subcutaneous fat. MR imaging was also able to rule out sinus tarsi syndrome and any internal derangements . She was referred to orthotics for a medial support arch to help with pain. Since the exact characteristics of this lesion were still unknown the case was referred to the Yorkshire Sarcoma MDT. The outcome of this meeting concluded that there were no radiological features of a sarcoma. She still experienced excruciating， sharp stabbing pain in her right foot. Pain score was 10/10. She opted for surgical excision biopsy of the lesion. The post operative period was uneventful with good healing of the wound. She was followed up 2 months and at with the histology findings results revealed a rare soft tissue neural neoplasm in keeping of a neurofibrolipoma. The patient was happy with the overall outcome and discharged. She was reviewed again after 2 years for a further foot and ankle problem in the other foot and at the time of review she was completely pain free in the right foot with an excellent outcome.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】A.true neuroma can come in various sizes andlocations including a vestibular schwannoma， acoustic neuroma， ganglioneuroma， neurothekeoma， nerve sheath myxoma. These neuromas have their own unique characteristics and origin. The true incidence of many these neuromas vary in different literature as often neuromas go undetected until they become symptomatic. In the cases ofan acoustic neuroma or vestibular schwannoma patients can present with tinnitus hearing loss and vertigo. In this case the patient presented with chronic pain in her right foot.\n\n【13】When reviewing such patients， it is imperative to rule out any malignancy before excising the mass which is why referring this patient to a Sarcoma MDT was essential.Other infectious differentials including septic arthritis and osteomyelitis were ruled out early since Blood counts showed CRP - 1.2 mg/L， White cell count - 5.1×10/L， Neutrophils -3.47 10/L.

Given that the pain was focused on the plantar aspect of the heel and not primarily in the posterior heel conditions such as Achilles tendonitis，retroachiles bursitis or retrocalcaneal bursitis were ruled out. Furthermore， given the age of the patient was not an adolescent Severs disease (calcaneal apophysitis) was also excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-6\\]</u>.\n\n【14】It is important to recognize that this true neuroma originated from aperipheral nerve such as the medial plantar nerve and not from the inter-digital nerve as that would make it a Morton's neuroma.\n\n【15】During excision the medial plantar nerve was preserved ensuring the patient preserved motor function of the abductor hallucis， flexor digitorum brevis， the flexor hallucis brevis and the first lumbrical muscle.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】This case report highlights the need to consider the neural fibrolipoma as a rare case of plantar/heel pain and excision of the lesion would provide an excellent outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Incorrect kinase signaling causes cancer， developmental， and metabolic problems. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective in cancer treatment and growth. Drug development is hampered by TKI-induced drug resistance. Understanding how TKs cause sickness and drugs to stop working will boost TKI research. Protein kinases regulate complicated bioprocesses. This involves cell growth， cell death， and cell division. 2% of human genes encode 518 kinases. 90 tyrosine kinases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Since the discovery of v-Src as a protein kinase in 1978， it has been recognized that dysregulated kinase signaling is at the root of many human disorders， including cancers， developmental， and metabolic issues. Since v-identification， Src's been a protein kinase. Protein kinase inhibitors are sought for medical use. Imatinib， a tyrosine kinase ABL inhibitor， was developed to treat CML in 2001. When the BCL-ABL mutation causing CML was found， Imatinib was produced (CML). This therapeutic technique targets mutations that induce oncogene production to stop tumor growth. Clinical trials found many more tyrosine kinase inhibitors beneficial. Sorafenib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2005)</u>， Sunitinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2006)</u>， Pazopanib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2009)</u>， and Axitinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012)</u> all go after mutant EGFRs in NSCLC (NSCLC).\n\n【15】This targeted treatment responds well. Drug resistance reduces response duration. Clinical cancer genome sequencing reveals medication resistance genes. Intrinsic drug resistance alters the drug's target； extrinsic resistance avoids its effects (compensatory signaling through other pathways and pharmacokinetic factors that primarily reduce drug concentration in targeted cells). Amplification， overexpression， epigenetic activation， and missense mutations may render kinase inhibitors ineffective. Mismatch mutations induce intrinsic resistance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Medication therapy induces clonal growth of treatment-resistant cancer cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Proteins involved in drug interactions or kinase activation often have drug-resistant point mutations. These alterations reduce the drug's binding affinity but don't affect the ATP substrate's interaction with the targeted kinase. Different drug-resistant kinases have similar hotspots.\" drug-resistant Commonly， gatekeepers mutate.ABLT315I is associated with CML， PDGFRT674I/M with hypereosinophilic syndrome， EGFRT790M with NSCLC， KITT670I with gastrointestinal stromal tumors， and ALKL1196M with NSCLC. ATP binding affinity， catalytic power， and conformational change are increased by most gatekeeper mutations. Mutant Gatekeeper resistance needs dormant kinases. This compensates for the increased energy required to switch from the disease-driven active to inactive conformation if the inhibitor targets the inactive conformation. increasing molecular weight， lipophilicity， and drug-like characteristics. New chemical entities should target mutant kinase activity.\n\n【16】Dasatinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2006)</u>， nilotinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2007)</u>， bosutinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012)</u>， and ponatinib 通用删除7(英):<u>(2012)</u> are strong ABL kinase inhibitors. Wild-type and mutant ABL kinases are inhibited. Imatinib， nilotinib， and ponatinib support ABL kinase. Trifluoromethyl improves nilotinib's effectiveness against native and mutant ABLs， except ABLT315I. Ponatinib is the only ABL inhibitor that works against ABLT315I. It substitutes the pyrimidinylamino linker with an acetylene group， which enhances interaction with I315. Dasatinib and nilotinib occupy space near the gatekeeper region， so they may alter the ABLT315I mutant's active conformation， lowering its blocking ability. Active conformation ABL inhibitors may help CML patients who relapse after TKI treatment.\n\n【17】Imatinib and second- and third-generation ABL inhibitors pave the path for targeted kinase inhibitors and TKI resistance treatment. In 2011， crizotinib (PF-02341066) was authorized for late-stage NSCLC patients with the EML4-ALK fusion gene. Crizotinib-treated patients develop treatment resistance， similar to imatinib-treated individuals. ALK gene amplification， secondary mutations like EML4-ALKL1196M， and c-KIT/EGFR activation are resistance mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. ALK inhibitors are beneficial for crizotinib-naive and -refractory ALK+ NSCLC patients (NSCLC).\n\n【18】LDK378 and alectinib inhibit natural and mutant ALKproteins better than crizotinib，approved in 2011. ALK inhibitors include crizotinib， LDK378 and alectinib. These ALK inhibitors interact variably with the ALK gatekeeper region， causing varying L1196M sensitivity. LDK378is 3 to 6 times more potent than crizotinib. Crizotinib-relapsed ALK-positive patients showed a 60% response rate and an 8.5-month median PFS. Imatinib and crizotinib are low-cellular-activity kinase inhibitors. In refractory patients， second-generation inhibitors are virtually as effective as the first. Sequential therapy involves following a less effective kinase inhibitor with a second-generation， broad-spectrum inhibitor.\n\n【19】Next-generation EGFR inhibitors for NSCLC patients resistant to gefitinib or erlotinib capture disease-driven kinase conformation. Even though afatinib suppresses EGFR by covalently attaching to the ATP binding site， the drug-resistant T790M mutant favors the active conformation. Like ATP， Afatinib inhibits EGFR. Afatinib cannot connect to T790M mutant EGFR because it is in the incorrect conformation. AZD-9291 and CO-1686 use a pyrimidine scaffold to reduce gatekeeper-related structural features while increasing G-loop interactions. In phase I studies for EGFR TKI-resistant patients， both AZD-9291 and CO-1686 were effective.\n\n【20】Reversible EGFR inhibitors that target EGFRT790M will help EGFR TKI-refractorypatients. Protein kinases are cancer treatments. Protein kinase inhibitors comprise 50% of cancer drug research 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. One or a few TKs seem crucial to the development of many cancers. Mutant TK-targeting TKIs should target cancer cells selectively and improve patient safety. Both the development oftargeted medications and the clinical treatment of advanced malignancies will face obstacles due to intratumor heterogeneity and tumor adaptability. TKIs and TKI combinations should have anti-tumor effects. As resistances molecular rrooiutes are recognized， new strategies are evolving. Inhibitors must target distinct kinase active site topographies to circumvent drug resistance. This effective protease design method may lead to chronic cancer therapy.\n\n【21】Cancer and other disorders include protein kinases. Lahiry et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> showed that 50 kinases form 67 single-gene clinical entities， and half are TKs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Kinase gene mutations cause illness. Mutations induce neurologic，skeletal，craniosynostosis，hematological，vascular， immunological，endocrine， and metabolic disorders. Tofacitinib is the first TKI authorized for inflammatory disorders. Despite 30 kinase inhibitors reaching commercialization and hundreds in clinical research， structural variation and target coverage are restricted. If we knew how protein kinases work and how they malfunction in diseases， we may have discovered unmet medical needs. Current kinase inhibitors may be improved in structural diversity， selectivity， and toxicity. Non-oncology and combination cancer therapies need high-quality TKIs. Effective， selective， and safe TKIs need further structural biology and medicinal chemistry research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The patients were allocated into groups based on the duration of the procedure they underwent： 7 min or 15 min.\n\n【16】The studyprocedure waspermitted by the Institutional Review Board. The inclusion criteria were： 1) axial neck pain； 2) single level； 3) sitting neck pain； 4) single level degenerative disc in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)； 5) positive response to provoking discogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> and 6) neck pain that had not responded to conventional handlings (pharmacotherapy and physical therapy) inside the prior 4 to 6 weeks. The exclusion criteria were as follows： 1) Neck pain induced by pressure on the paraspinal muscles；2) cervical herniated intervertebral disc； 3) cervical spinal stenosis； 4) facet origin pain； 5) myelopathy； 6) pain due to infection； and 7) bleeding tendency.\n\n【17】Data on age， sex and length of pain of each patient was contained. The primary outcome measures were the pain score using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)， and the Oswestry Disability Index(ODI) measured before， at the 2 weeks after and 6-months after the treatment.Degree of achievement was described as a decrease in NRS of 2 50% or an ODI reduction of 2 40%.\n\n【18】Procedure\n\n【19】All patients were intravenously injected with antibiotics in prior to the procedure. The ID-PRF， a single needle placement procedures performed on the patients laying on the fluoroscopy table in the supine position with pillow under their neck. The disc level for the treatment was selected based on the findings ofMR\n\n【20】Betadine was used for the disinfection of the skin entry site. With fluoroscopy， the target disc was found using metal indicator. The skin entry site was infiltrated with 1% lidocaine. With second and third digits of left hand second， the trachea and esophagus medially displaced. On fixed two digits， the PRF needle (NeuroTherm， 20 G，15cm length， 20 mm active tip) was percutaneously progressed and was located on the affected disc with an anteroposterior view . In fluoroscopiclateral view，PRF needle advanced to posterior margin of affected disc . Anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic projections were used to confirm whether the introduced needle was properly placed.\n\n【21】We applied ID-PRF with a frequency of 5 Hz， a pulse width of5 ms， the amplitude of 60V， and a extreme heat of 42°C， for either patients with 7 min or 15 min treatment by means of the NT1100generator (NeuroTherm， Middleton， MA， USA). After the end of the procedure， the PRF needle was removed after procedure and the patients were transferred to the recovery room.\n\n【22】Wilcoxon signed-rank exam was used in assessments of increase in NRS and ODI scores before and after the procedure.

Data on the patient character are presented in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>. It is found that NRS and ODI were significantly reduced in a time-dependent manner in both groups . Mean post-treatment pain scores were found to be significantly lower (P=0.000) in both groups at the follow-up period of 2 weeks and 6 months， respectively， while the variances among the groups were insignificant . The ODI scores were also significantly reduced when compared to that of baseline scores； however， the differences between the groups were insignificant . At the6-months follow-up examination， 12 patients (75.0%) in the 7-min group and 14 patients (77.8%) in the 15-min group were shown to have decrease by more than 50% in their pain score (P=0.17). No|删除段之间换行|significant difference was found between the degree of reduction ODI score in each groups (P=0.24) .\n\n【32】No severe problems， including epidural hemorrhage， dural or neural damages， or pollution， were noted in any group.\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】The outcomes of this report show that significant pain relief can be achieved with either 7-min or 15-min application of ID-PRF. There was little reported to ID-PRF treatment for chronic discogenic neck pain. Only one case ID-PRF had achieved decreased the numeric rating scale at 3-months follow up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Chronic neck pain occurred from severe factors， such as cervical intervertebral， facet join， atlantoaxial joints and neck muscle， etc. Cervical intervertebral disc was innervated sinuvertebral nerve by posterior vertebral plexus， anterior vertebral plexus， and vertebral nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. If degenerative change occurred in the disc， disc innervating nerve potentially extending into the internal third of the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6，26\\]</u>. It was can cause discogenic neck pain.\n\n【36】The mechanism of ID-PRF is not fully understood. It could be possibly suggested that ID-PRF may reduce nociceptive input derived from the intervertebral disc and the induce of a cellular and immune response and inhibit evoked synaptic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27，28\\]</u>. Park et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， reported intradiscal pulsed radiofrequency was effective in patient with chronic discogenic low back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【37】There was difficult to diagnosis discogenic pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. In our study，pre-procedure provocative cervical discogram was performed. Cervical discogram was useful methods for diagnosis cervical discogenic neck pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Inclusion criteria of this study were not guaranteed pure disco-origin pain. It was not easy to distinguish discogenic pain from facet pain，or muscle/ligament pain， etc.\n\n【38】This study is limited in that it has small sample size and the lacks control group. We may also not fully full rule out the pain from facet pain or muscle pain. Evaluation with MRI should be not conducted in follow-up to assess the potential of ID-PRF to prevent or to aggravate disc degeneration.\n\n【39】It is concluded that the application of ID-PRF is efficient for the conduct of discogenic neck pain regardless of ID-PRF application duration (7-min vs. 15-min).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

His diet consists of mangoes， papayas， oranges， cereals in industrial preparation for children， soda water. Clinically， he presented with anorexia， gastrointestinal disturbances in the form of vomiting and diarrhea. There was moderate dyspnea. He then benefited from two successive antibiotic therapies， the first of which consists of a Sulfonamide-Trimethoprim combination for seven days and the second of a synergistic combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid for a week. At the end of the three days of partial remission of the primate， he received therapy based on metronidazole.\n\n【13】Although the patient's condition improved， it was not satisfactory because the diarrhea and vomiting persisted. Then， he received a gastric dressing based on diosmectite and a reconstituting intestinal microbiota. On the day’s death， dyspnea aggravated and the emergency care based on dexamethasone treatment failed to save the patient life. Immediately following the death of this chimpanzee， the Abidjan (Cote dIvoire) zoo administration referred the primate to us in order to investigate the case.\n\n【14】Autopsy Findings\n\n【15】Externally， the subject was in a good condition but moderately dehydrated. Internally， there were interstitial mild hemorrhagic multifocal and moderate emphysematous pneumonia； diffuse congestive and catarrhal colitis with telangiectasia ， diffuse severe catarrhal enteritis； diffuse moderate to severe hepatic steatosis， mild to moderate and focal congestive myocarditis.\n\n【16】Parasitological Examinations\n\n【17】The fecal material of the subject was positive to Strongyloides stercoralis parasite with a parasitic load of 200 eggs per gram. Besides， the dead chimpanzee was positive to Ancylostoma duodenale parasite with a parasitic load of 150 eggs per gram of feces.\n\n【18】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【19】After these findings， halfpart of liver， lung， kidney， heart， spleen， small and large intestine have been fully dissected to check for Strongyloides stercoralis parasites . There were more than7 parasites (3 adult females and 4 larvae) in the large intestine， 6 (2 adult females， 4 larvae) in the small intestine， 7(2 adult females and 4 larvae) in the lung， 5 (2 adult females and 3 larvae) in the liver， and nothing in the heart， kidney or the spleen. After having shaved the skin， there was no lesion that could justify further examination ofthis organ.\n\n【20】Histopathological Examination\n\n【21】Lung\n\n【22】Severe interstitial eosinophilic， multifocal hemorrhagic and moderate emphysematous pneumonia， due to Strongyloides stercoralis . Notwithstanding the negative result to Mycobacteria infection (TB or Non-TB infection) using not only histopathological examination， the lung specimen was also negative to Acid fast Bacilli testing. There was thrombus ， and small larval granuloma in the lung.\n\n【23】Liver\n\ncited.

There was severe granulomatous lymphangitis that explains lymphangiectasia in gross lesions.\n\n【35】Additional Imaging Examination\n\n【36】The MRI examination of the Central nervous system did not show any inflammation or parasite migration evidence.\n\n【37】Pathological Discussion\n\nHostimmunosuppression iiss the maindocumentedrisk factor of Strongyloidiasis hyperinfection and dissemination. This immunosuppression is chiefly caused by long term and high dose of glucocorticoid treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. A few described conditions include inappropriate use of immunosuppressive drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In the current case， none of these etiologies could be valid. It is comprehensive|删除段之间换行|that immunosuppression condition if it is proven， could explain dissemination.Nonetheless， in the current case，there was no evidence of immunosuppression due to absence ofhypoplasia of lymph nodes. Yet， we recognize that the blood values have not been estimated during ante mortem in order to appreciate lasting leukopenia. It is a pathological process that initially affects the digestive function with a significant subsequent impact on the lungs (for the record， the chimpanzee grabbed his chest shortly before death)， liver and whose main etiology is Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection followed by its dissemination. The constitutions of thrombi in the lungs have not yet been described in this pathology. This fact could be explained by hemorrhagic lesions in lung that imply necrotizing vasculitis. But these thrombi that can cause thromboembolism are a serious factor. However， diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection has been substantiated in a recent human clinical hospitalized case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The skin dermis was highly parasitized. In our case，the responsibility of Ancylostoma duodenale in the dissemination of strongyloidiasis remains unknown. This is an unexplained and particular disseminated strongyloidiasis： There was neither evidenced immunosuppression nor lasting glucocorticoid treatment. Another lesson of this rare case is that human alimentary practices could be a major risk factor for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Diseases (NAFLD) in captive Non-Human Primates (NHP).\n\nMany chemicals that cause Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis(NASH) as well in human and animal model such as Paraquat， Atrazine， Simazine， and Arsenic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> are still used as herbicide or|删除段之间换行|crop chemicals. In many under developing countries， agriculture foods such as fruits that are sold before the end of withdrawal time-a delay that has to be observed after a crop chemical treatment in order to permit elimination of residues. Thus， the consumers including captive NHP become exposed for a long time.\n\n【40】In consequence， as far as NASH is becoming a public health concern in termsof its potential complications(cirrhosis， hepatocellular carcinoma， for instances)， its physiopathological relation with strongyloidiasis dissemination deserves to be addressed.\n\n【41】Final Diagnosis\n\n【42】Disseminated strongyloidiasis withNon-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis stage F1 of chimpanzee.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It is characterized by congenital vaginal agenesis， with a prevalence of 1/4000 to 1/5000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients with MRKH typically either have no uterus or only rudimentary uterus. Some of them may also show urologic anomalies and， in rare cases， spinal malformations. They all have a normal female karyotype of 46 XX with normal ovarian functions通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Ovarian cyst pedicle torsion is a common gynecological acute abdomen with pedicle torsion occurring in approximately 10 percent of ovarian cysts.\n\n【2】However， MRKH syndrome with ovarian cyst torsion is rare. This paper summarizes the clinical data of a MRKH syndrome case complicated with pedicle torsion and necrosis of a giant ovarian serous cystadenoma.\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】The patient is a 23-year-old female， who presented with 2-week history of irregular abdominal pain on the right lower quadrant， but no nausea， vomiting， fever， or urinary symptoms. This recurrent symptom initially started over a year ago and had been treated as “pelvic inflammation”with antibiotic in another hospital for multiple episodes. During that period， no ultrasonography was performed. The patient has a known history of MRKH syndrome and underwent vaginoplasty and ultrasonography two years prior. A postoperative follow-up ultrasound scan showed a right ovarian cyst of 4 cm.\n\n【5】Gynecological examination： normal development of vulva， narrow vagina， smooth mucosa， difficulty in accommodating 2 fingers， depth of about 7 cm； absence of cervix and uterine body； a cystic mass of 10 cm ×9 cm× 6 cm next to the right adnexal area with mild tenderness， unclear boundary and not easy to move； no abnormal observations on left adnexa.\n\n【6】Laboratory data： White blood cell count： 8.5×10/L. Neutrophil percentage： 66.9%. Serum amyloid A： 11.5 mg/L. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein： 5.1 mg/L. Fibrinogen： 4.04 g/L. D-dimer：1.15 mg/L FEU. Anti-Mullerian tube hormone： 0.8 ng/mL (normal range 1.52-9.95). Sex hormones and thyroid function were normal. Karyotype was reported as 46 XX.\n\n【7】MRI showed a triangular soft tissue between the giant cyst and the bladder. The structure of vagina was visible， while the boundary was not clear. Multiple cysts were found in the bilateral ovarian areas. The cross section of the right ovarian lesion was about 5.3 cm x2.9 cm， posterior to this lesion there was a nodular signal of obvious enhancement at the size of 2.3 cm ×1.3 cm . The diameter of the largest left ovarian cyst was 1.9 cm. Next to it， there was nodular soft tissue of obvious inhomogeneous enhancement， with the size of 3.1 cm x 1.9 cm . MRI also demonstrated a large irregular tube-shaped cystic in the pelvis， at the size of9.8 cm x4.6 cm×10.1cm， with clear boundary， inhomogeneous wall and no obvious enhancement on contrast-enhanced scan . The kidneys， bladder， intestine， liver， all-bladder and lymph nodes were reported normal.\n\nGiven her medical history of MRKH， the triangular soft tissue above the bladder with bilateral nodules was consistent to an undeveloped primordial uterus. Bilateral ovarian structures were not clearly shown. There were multiple cystic foci in the ovarian region and the right cystic focus showed signs of hemorrhage. The preliminary diagnosis was ovarian cyst. However， because the|删除段之间换行|giant cystic focus of the pelvis extended to the right ovarian region the possibility of it being the pedicle torsion of the right ovarian cyst couldn't be eliminated.\n\nThe operation began with a diagnostic laparoscopy， which revealed a dysplasia-uterine-like muscular tissue of about 3 cm x4 cm x3 cm in the left pelvic cavity near the iliac fossa . Adjacent to it was an oviduct-like tubal structure with part mucosal structure at the umbrella end. Below it was the ovary of about 3 cm x 4 cm x2.5 cm， with no obvious abnormality in appearance nor obvious vegetative growth on the surface. The uterine-like muscular tissue and the left adnexa were stuck together with the left pelvic wall. There was a cystic mass in the right pelvic cavity， partially dark purple and covered with omentum， densely adhered to the right pelvic and anterior abdominal wall. After the separation of the covered omentum and membranous adhesins， a dumbbell-shaped cystic-solid mass emerged. The larger part was about 11 cmx6cm x 8 cm， the other part was about 6 cmx7cm×6 cm . There was no obvious normal ovarian tissue and no obvious fallopian tube-like structure. No abnormal lesions were found in the omentum， stomach， liver， spleen and diaphragmatic roof. A partial resection of the right mass was sent for intraoperative frozen biopsy|删除段之间换行|and was reported as right ovarian serous cystadenoma. Intraoperative diagnosis was pedicle torsion and necrosis of right ovarian serous cystadenoma with bilateral dysplasia uterine. Therefore，laparoscopic right ovariectomy and pelvic adhesion lysis were performed. The surgery went smoothly， and the patient recovered well. Postoperative pathological report was the same as the intraoperative frozen biopsy. On the follow-up， 2 months after operation， the AMH was 1.13 ng/mL， and the sex hormones were still in normal range.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】MRKH syndrome is characterized by congenital absence of the vagina and uterus， which is generally divided into 2 types： Type I， more common， only vagina and uterus are affected； typeII： In addition to no uterus nor vagina， patients also suffer from malformations of renal and skeletal systems. It should be distinguished from hymen atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， vaginal atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (CAIS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Studies suggest vaginal dilatation as the first-line treatment for MRKH syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>， while surgery is also an option. The surgery is called vaginoplasty， including biological patch and peritoneal method. Improved surgical methods are reported constantly to benefit patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9-11\\]</u>. The mental health of postoperative patients is also critical and shouldn't be overlooked通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. For patients with MRKH syndrome， the risk of pelvic complications should not be ignored in clinical practice， and routine gynecological physical examination should also be performed. There are reported cases of MRKH syndrome complicated with uterine leiomyoma通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-15\\]</u>， adenomyosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> and so on， which could have resulted in misdiagnosis.\n\nMRI is an important imaging examination method for diagnosis of MRKH syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>， which helps to determine the presence ofuterus or primordial uterus. A recent retrospective analysis showed that MRI results in determining the degree of reproductive system involvement and multi-system related malformations are highly consistent with the final clinical diagnosis，proving the potential value of MRI in shortening preoperative diagnosis time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Clinically，|删除段之间换行|ultrasound and MRI can be collaboratively used to reach the diagnosis of pelvic complications in patients with MRKH syndrome.\n\n【13】In regards to the choice of surgical methods 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， considering this patient's clinical history， and the fact that the right ovarian cyst had been twisted for too long， resulting in extensive hemorrhage and necrosis which led to the right ovarian functionloss，right ovariectomy was suggested and performed. As for whether the uterus should be retained， given 1) the patient did not have periodic abdominal pain， 2) her uterus was considered as the primordial uterus， and 3) resection might affect the blood supply to the other healthy ovary and eventually lead to the decrease of ovarian reserve function， resection was not recommended for the contralateral (left) uterus. As for the affected side (right) uterus， since it may be complicated with uterine fibroids， adenomyosis and other related complications， we had suggested resection to her family members but the suggestion was rejected. After the surgery we reiterated the relevant risks to the patient and suggested routine follow-up visits.\n\n【14】For this case， due to congenital dysplasia， the distance between the ovarian suspensory ligament and the ovarian proper ligament was relatively short， so the pedicle torsion was more likely to happen anatomically. Given her MRKH history and repeated abdominal pain symptoms， if the imaging examination was performed sooner， a timelier surgery could have been performed to avoid adverse consequences such as cyst necrosis and extensive hemorrhage.\n\n【15】To sum up， MRKH syndrome is rare in clinical practice， yet， there is still a probability of complication of ovarian torsion due to the malformation of the ovarian ligaments. For such cases， physicians should be aware of this syndrome and pay more attention to the timely diagnosis and treatments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Evaluation of pancreatic enzymes did not show a constant trend， and had 3 times microscopic hematuria， an obvious pancreatic inflammation was observed in CT scans. Patient was diagnosed with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. There was no definite cause for patient’s pancreatitis， except for the recent use of herbal drug (containing Ginsengcompounds) for weight gain that taking it 10 days before the onset of symptoms has started and then stopped. Since the patient's symptom gradually decreased by stopping the drug， probably drug-induced pancreatitis is to be present.\n\n【2】Keywords： Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis； Ginseng Compounds； Hematuria\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pancreatitis is a pancreatic inflammation that including two types， acute and chronic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Acute Pancreatitis (AP) includes a wide range of diseases， from its low-risk symptoms to a fulminant process with multiple organ damage and high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The incidence of AP has increased over the past 20 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Common symptoms of AP include nausea and vomiting， and the abdominal pain that mostly spreads to the back. AP has different causes， some of which include： gallstones， alcohol consumption， hypercalcemia， hyperlipidemia， idiopathic， autoimmune， and anatomic (pancreas divisum)， infection， tumors and drug-induced. AP can be recurrent. Multiple and recurrent attacks of AP can lead to chronic pancreatitis， which can ultimatelylead to pancreatic insufficiency. AP has various complications， one of the most severe complications is necrotizing pancreatitis， which is due to tissue ischemic and necrosis and has high mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Here we describe the case of a young woman with acute necrotizing pancreatitis induced by Ginseng compounds administration. Necrotizing pancreatitis has a very poor prognosis and is associated with high mortality (15%)， which， if infected， can reach up to 30% to 39%， which is the major cause of mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Intervention is generally required for infected pancreatic necrosis and less commonly in patients with sterile necrosis who are symptomatic (gastric or duodenal outlet or biliary obstruction). Fever， elevated white blood cell count， and abdominal pain suggest infection of this fluid， and percutaneous aspiration is confirmatory. Percutaneous drainage and IV administration of antibiotics should be instituted if infection is present.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】The patient is a 29-year-old Iranian woman that sent to Sina Hospital， Tehran University for further evaluation and treatment from Ilam. The patient’s problems began with the fever and chills intermittently， and then 2 days later， suddenly suffered abdominal pain in the epigastrium， which was persistent and progressive， gradually spreading to the entire abdomen and not radiating anywhere. The patient’s pain was worse with eating and it was not associated with defecation and2 days later， the patient developed another symptom. The symptoms included： non-bloody watery diarrhea， nausea and vomiting， and anorexia， and during the last 通用删除7(英):<u>(3-9)</u> months weight loss was 15kg. There is no history of this problem in the past.\n\n【8】Her past medical history was otherwise negative and she had no allergies. She denied alcohol intake or tobacco use. She has a two-time history of cesarean section， which was last two years ago.\n\n【9】The only drug used recently was weight gain that contains Ginseng compounds that only consume 10 of them and discontinued with the onset of symptoms.\n\n【10】In the family history， cousin's aunt， he has pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\n【11】On examination she was febrile (T=39.5)， with a heart rate of 140beats/min， blood pressure was 100/70 mmHg and respiratory rate of18/min.\n\n【12】Abdominal examination revealed tenderness and generalized rebound tenderness in epigastrium. There were non-palpable masses and bowel sounds were normal. Lung examination had bilateral rales.\n\n【13】In Ilam， a CT scan is performed for the patient， in which the free fluid in the abdomen was reported， with a suspicion of perforated appendicitis，patient was under laparotomy that there was an obvious as cites and seeding that the drain was embedded and the omentum and the multiple point sampling that has been examined twice by the pathologist， which has not been malignancy， also， the sample was examined once by a pathologist in Tehran， which was not been malignancy .\n\n【14】After surgery， 2 days were treated with Imipenem， the patient's leukocytosis was 25000， and bilateral pleural effusion was found and the respiratory distress was found， so transferred to the ICU， and in consultation with the professor of Surgery in Sina Hospital in Tehran has provided double-sided chest tube and has been sent to Tehran by Intubation.\n\n【15】The patient was admitted to Tehran for about 17 days in ICU， who had 10 days of intubation and had 5 days of C-pap， and was extubated and transferred to the ward after 2 days， during which time she was treated with antibiotics. The patient's leukocytosis was from25000 to 13000， and transferred to the ward.\n\n【16】According to the history and physical examination findings， differential diagnosis was made for the patient， which was done to achieve the final diagnosis of paraclinical measures； including， complete lab tests， abdominopelvic ultrasound， CXR， CT scan， endoscopy， colonoscopy， and EUS were performed.\n\nComplete Blood Count (CBC diff) was at its onset of 24000leukocytosis with 80% PMN， rising progressively in the course of the disease，and the highest level of 25000， which was found to belowered|删除段之间换行|with antibiotic therapy and reached 6160 on the day of discharge.\n\n【18】Patient's differential diagnosis including：Rheumatologic disorders， TB， brucellosis， malaria and in general infectious diseases， lymphoma，Imalignancy， pancreatic dysfunction (necrotizing pancreatitis， pancreatic cancer， andautoimmune P pancreatitis)， thyroid disorders.\n\n【19】For rheumatologic disorders， rheumatology tests were performed completely， all of which were negative. Also， rheumatologic examinations (lymphadenopathy， hair pull test) were performed， which was negative. The patient has no symptoms such as arthritis， arthralgia， oral ulcer and malar rash， hair loss， rash， dry eye， dry mouth， photophobia，psychosis， seizure， and the history of abortion.\n\n【20】PPD test was performed for tuberculosis according to positive ADA 通用删除7(英):<u>(7，4，32)</u>， which was negative and the patient was treated with anti-TB drugs (INH， Ethambutol) for 14 days with an infectious professor's advice， with no change in the patient's symptoms. The patient had no symptoms including： coughing， hemoptysis， night sweats.\n\n【21】Brucellosis tests were negative. For malaria PBS， it was normal. Viral markers were negative.\n\nForlymphoma and malignancy， tumor markers were checked to be negative， did not have lymphadenopathy and night sweats， and also with suspicion of gastrointestinal cancers， inflammatory bowel disease， endoscopy and colonoscopy were performed. Colonoscopy was normal. Endoscopy was highly suggestive for gastric cancer which was taken biopsy， was chronic gastritis and ulceration， and malignancy was rejected， due to in consistency of endoscopic findings with pathological outcomes， endoscopy was performed again， which， as before， was suspected of stomach cancer， and biopsy， showed only|删除段之间换行|a ulceration .\n\n【23】About pancreatic dysfunction， amylase and lipase， liver tests， albumin， and urine analysis were checked several times， the procedure was as follows， and the microscopic hematuria was present in three examinations. Other study performed for the evaluation of the pancreas was CT scan ， which included pancreatic inflammation that CT scan with pancreatic cut was performed for a more accurate evaluation which revealed a pancreatic tail and body inflammation and brief duct dilatation. According to the patient’s CT scan results， EUS was performed， with a normal pancreas reported， and an emphasis on the atypical Crohn’s disease . Thyroid and renal tests were normal.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】The most common causes of AP are gallstones alcohol and hyperlipidemia respectively， however， nearly 20% of cases it is idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The patient described in this report did not drink alcohol and did not have gallstone and had normal liver function test， and normal lipid profile. Thus excluding other etiologies for the AP that in this case was drug-induced (Ginseng compounds).\n\n【26】The diagnosis of AP requires the patient to present with abdominal pain consistent with AP (acute onset of a severe constant epigastric pain which often radiates through to the mid back) and the elevation of serum amylase or lipase (>3 times upper limit of normal). Imaging (usually by contrast enhanced CT scanning) is only required for the diagnosis of AP when these diagnostic criteria are not met 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Recovery from AP is now expected， with mortalityless than 10%， which reflects improvements in the treatment of complications and intensive care management.\n\nA third of patients with AP develop complications and a quarter of these will die of them. Severe acute pancreatitis is associated with|删除段之间换行|fluid collections and tissue necrosis in and around the pancreas. In this case complication of acute pancreatitis was necrosis.\n\n【29】Necrosis increases the morbidity and mortality risk of AP because of its association with organ failure and infectious complications.\n\n【30】As such， patients with necrotizing pancreatitis may need admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)， nutritional support， antibiotics， and radiologic， endoscopic， or surgical interventions.\n\n【31】Nearly 20% of patients with AP develop necrotizing pancreatitis， ofwhich approximately 25% to 70% will develop to infected necrosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Necrotizing pancreatitis is a complication of AP. It may happen when AP is untreated， or treatment is ineffective.\n\n【33】No predisposing factors have been validated to increase the risk of development of pancreatic necrosis， however， the most common etiology of necrotizing pancreatitis is gallstones (40% to 48%)， followed by alcohol consumption (24% to 27%).\n\n【34】Two thirds of necrotic pancreatic collections are sterile and will resolve with conservative management， while the remainder will become infected and will require further intervention.\n\n【35】Initial management of necrotizing pancreatitis is a supportive treatment that includes： fluid resuscitation， pain control， resting the gastrointestinaltract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【36】In the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis， the necrosis most commonly involves both pancreatic and peripancreatic fat tissue(75% to 80%).\n\n【37】An early contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) may fail to reveal necrosis within the first few days； however， a contrast enhanced CT after the first week revealing non enhancing pancreatic parenchyma is considered to be pancreatic necrosis.\n\n【38】Effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic and antifungal therapy， which prevents infected necrosis， has been questionable. Recent studies， conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapy，have， almost， proven its weaknesses. This therapy is no more recommended by the American College of Gastroenterology and the Infectious Diseases Society of America no longer recommends it. In patients with concomitant cholangitis or extra pancreatic infection， this therapy， is the only case that can be is recommended to be given 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【39】If a patient is predicted to have severe pancreatitis or not expected to resume oral intake within 5 to 7 days， early enteral nutrition is recommended. Enteral nutrition most commonly involves bedside or endoscopic placement of a nasojejunal feeding tube and collaboration with a nutritionist to determine protein caloric requirements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【40】However， for patients with higher rates of infection， multi organ dysfunction and failure， and death， total parenteral nutrition is suggested instead of enteral nutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【41】The first-line intervention for acute necrotizing pancreatitis is intravenous hydration with isotonic and pH-balanced crystalloid solution such as Lactated Ringer's 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Having provided no supportive data， recent studies have proven that the use of prophylactic antibiotics in cases of severe AP cannot be an effective solution. For patients with severe AP complications， organ failure， and mortality， early enteral nutrition should be the supplanted medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【43】This case is an atypical presentation of AP with a severe attack leadingtopancreatic necrosis. We experienced a case of AP associated with normal serum enzyme levels. Patient was diagnosed based on clinical and radiological evidence. She was successfully treated with intravenous fluids， antibiotic therapy， and radiologic external percutaneous drainage with clinical and laboratory improvement. The importance of this case report is the unlikely presentation of AP. We believe that more research is needed to determine the exact proportion of AP patients who first present with normal serum lipase， since similar cases have been seen in case reports.\n\n【44】Conclusion\n\nPatients with AP are susceptible to a wide spectrum of diseases：alcoholabuse，cholelithiasis， infection，lesions，tumors，hypercalcemia，|删除段之间换行|hyperlipidemia， and drug-induced. These diseases range from mild self-limiting symptoms to a fulminant process with multiple organ failure and high mortality. The etiologic factors contributing to AP include a wide range with some being rare. Cholelithiasis or sustained alcohol abuse is the factor which attributes to， approximately， 80% of cases删除4-1:<u>12-14</u>.\n\n【46】Having stopped the drugs， the symptoms resolved in this patient； this shows that the drug-induced pancreatitis is probably present in her 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.

Women were asked to fill the Italian version of the Coping Orientation to the Problems Experienced (COPE-NVI). The questionnaire included 5different dimensions： 1) Social support； 2) Avoidance strategies； 3) Positive attitude； 4) Problem solving； 5) Turning to religion. We planned to evaluate COPE-NVI score according to the different maternal or fetal complication. Hundred women met the inclusion criteria， agreed to participate to the study and filled out the questionnaire. Thirty-seven were admitted for preeclampsia， 15for diabetes， 5 for intrahepatic cholestasis， 14 for hyperemesis gravidarum， while 29 had severe intrauterine growth restriction requiring monitoring. The mean COPE-NVI score for social support was 31.5 ± 8.6， for avoidance strategies was 25.1± 6.7， for positive attitude was 31.7 ± 7.3， for problem solving was 30.5±7.5，and for turning to religion was 24.9 ±5.3. No statistically significant differences were found the COPE-NVI score within the different maternal or fetal complications， rather than for turning for religion， where the score was higher for women with preeclampsia and lower for women with intrahepatic cholestasis (P=0.01).

Pregnantwomen may also worry about the health of their future babies， impending childbirth， and motherhood responsibilities.

Studies also showed that hospitalized pregnant patients admitted for inpatient monitoring had higher levels of anxiety compared to non-hospitalized women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. However， why some women have a better psychologic outcome compared to other pregnant women with similar pregnancy features， is still a subject of debate \\[71.\n\n【5】Coping is defined as a changing cognitive and behavioral efforts aimed to dealing with specific situations that may be stressful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.

It is a multi-dimensional inventory developed to assess the different coping strategies people use in response to stress. COPE stands for Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced.

This would further reduce the power of a maybe already underpowered study.\n\n【57】Implication\n\n【58】Pregnancy is a unique health experience. Unlike other health and illness contexts studied by health psychologists， such as cancer or heart disease， pregnancy is not an illness and is commonlyassociated with positive psychological experiences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However， different maternal or fetal conditions， and high risk pregnancies， may have a significant impact on maternal satisfaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，6，12-16\\]</u>.\n\n【59】Many women may be coping with an unintended pregnancy， bothersome physical symptoms， medical risk conditions or other chronic life strains. Pregnancy， which typically spans 40 weeks， is also time-limited in nature. The finite nature may influence how women appraise and cope with at least some pregnancy-specific stressors. By its very nature， pregnancy is also embedded within a broader interpersonal context and therefore， it is particularly important to understand the influence of an expecting mother’s close personal relationships on her coping effectiveness. A recent study by Stapleton et al. examined the maternal relationship with a baby’s father in detail and found that paternal support during pregnancy predicted maternal prepartum and postpartum distress， as did the quality of their relationship 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.

Firm evidence of mediational mechanisms and for relevant moderating factors should be established before implementing interventions that are based on teaching women how to better cope\n\n【61】Table 3： COPE score according to type of high-risk pregnancy.\n\n|  | Preeclampsia  | Diabetes  | IUGR  | Intrahepatic cholestasis  | Hyperemesis gravidarum  | p-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Social support  | 32.8±9.1  | 29.8±8.4  | 31.9±9.3  | 28.2±6.7  | 30.4±6.5  | 0.64  |\n| Avoidance strategies  | 24.9±7.4  | 24.8±5.6  | 25.9±7.6  | 22.4±3.0  | 25.1+5.2  | 0.87  |\n| Positive attitude  | 32.2±8.5  | 34.0±5.9  | 30.3±7.6  | 31.8±4.9  | 30.5±5.5  | 0.55  |\n| Problem solving  | 30.5±8.8  | 32.4±6.7  | 30.1±7.5  | 30.8±5.1  | 29.5±5.2  | 0.86  |\n| Turning to religion  | 26.2±4.7  | 22.7±5.4  | 26.2±4.6  | 19.2±9.1  | 24.9±5.3  | 0.01  |\n\nIUGR： Intrauterine Growth Restriction， Baldface data， statistically significant|删除段之间换行|during pregnancy. Looking ahead， researchers should develop a greater understanding of the particular challenges that women face and must cope with during pregnancy and across the lifespan， use strong and consistent instrumentation， and conduct longitudinal studies in large samples. A more rigorous approach to the study of coping during pregnancy could provide evidence needed to develop empirically-based interventions targeting modifiable risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【64】The solution that expresses COPE-NVI internal structure is the one that combines the basic scales in five factors： Social support； avoidance strategies； positive attitude； problem solving； and turning to religion. Our cohort was associated with high score at coping strategies. By looking at the different type of high-risk pregnancies， only turning to religion was statistically significant with the highest score in IUGR patients， and lowest score in women with intrahepatic cholestasis. We also reported a non-significant higher score for social support in women with preeclampsia and IUGR. This may reflect a tendency for these classes of patients to research\"social support\" more than others， since they are often long-term patients and therefore more exposed to social distancing imposed by prolonged hospitalization and social exclusion induced from the CODIV-19 pandemic.\n\n【65】Conclusion\n\n【66】In summary， women with high risk pregnancies admitted for antenatal inpatient monitoring have a high score at coping strategies.\n\n【67】Ethical Approval\n\n【68】This study was approved by the local IRB of University of Naples Federico II， Naples， Italy (#208/19) on 21/10/2019.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

From her medical history， we highlight a syndrome of generalized congenital lipodystrophy (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome). This consists of an absence of adipose tissue alongside an alteration in the metabolism of fats and carbohydrates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The patient presented a long time， velvety pigmentation on the neck and armpits that had been classified as acanthosis nigricans related to her genetic disease . However， on her annual clinical assessment， she complained about the appearance of new asymptomatic， hyperpigmented， confluent skin lesions with reticulated edges. It develops progressively in a couple of months， starting with the pectoral region and upper back . No response to any topical depigmentation was observed.\n\n【11】Wood's light examination and direct Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) examination were negative. A biopsy of the cervical region was performed， which revealed epidermal papillomatosis with orthokeratosishyperkeratosiswithout acantholysis， associated withbasal melaninhyperpigmentation. After a treatment with topical retinoids and oral Josamycin 500 mg/24 h for 3 months， the lesions showed an evident improvement.\n\n【12】Diagnosis\n\n【13】Confluent and Reticulated Papillomatosis (CRP)\n\n【14】CRP is a not very well-known dermatosis that usually begins in adolescence. It is more frequent in women and in dark-skinned patients， as in our case. Some theories have been proposed to explain its etiopathogenesis： Genetic or acquired keratinization abnormalities， photosensitivity or underlying endocrine disorders such as obesity， diabetes or thyroid dysfunction. These ones would cause an abnormal-epithelialization related to the excess of certain hormones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In our patient， due to the genetic lipodystrophy syndrome， we are led to consider the possible relationship with endocrine disorders.\n\n【15】In order to make a diagnosis， Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> defined three main criteria needed， which include：Hyperpigmented plaques in the centre of the chest or back with a reticulated pattern on the edge. Negativity for fungi in the KOH stain or the absence of hypha in the biopsy.

The non-specific clinical symptoms and radiographic appearance make diagnosis difficult without postoperative pathological results. This report aims at providing a comprehensive overview on all GCP cases reported to date. A comprehensive literature search 通用删除7(英):<u>(1972-2014)</u> was conducted for all reported GCP cases， including one case from our group retrospectively. Keywords searched included gastritis cystica profunda， submucosal cysts of the stomach， and heterotopic submucosal gastric glands. A total of 52 cases was found， including 37 (71.2%) men and 15 (28.8%) women (M/F ratio =2.5). The overall mean age was 59.9 (range 39-91) years. Among them， 58.8%(n=30) were located in the body， 25.5%(n=13) in the fundus， 19.6%(n=9) in the antrum， 3.9%(n=2) in the cardia and occasionally one case in the prepyloric lesion and one case in anastomotic site. 52%(n=26) of cases had prior gastric surgery. The main clinical symptoms included abdominal pain (n=14， 36.8%)and gastrointestinal bleeding (including hematemesis and melena， n=7，18.4%). Among overall 52 cases， only 7.7%通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> were diagnosed before surgery， and the rest were diagnosed during postoperative histopathologic examination. In conclusion， GCP is difficult to be preoperatively correctly diagnosed due to being relatively rare and lack of typical clinical symptoms. The correct diagnosis should depend on histopathological examination. Complete surgical removal of the GCP is widely considered as the best treatment option.\n\n【2】Keywords： Gastritis cystica profunda； Cystic lesion； Submucosal cysts； Heterotopic submucosal gastric\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】GCP， a peculiar hyper plastic cystic lesion， was first described by Scott and Payne in 1947 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>； nevertheless， until 1972 littler and Glibermann 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> coined the term“gastritis cystica polyposa”and suggested that the presence of cystically dilated gastric glands in the sub mucosa was a reactive， postsurgical condition. Subsequently， “gastritis cystica profunda” became a preferred term because it resembled similar condition in the colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Very few GCP cases have been reported over half a century. It is well known that the lesion is related to several factors working in concert： something that predisposes to mucosal defects (e.g. surgery， biopsy， and polypectomy) with chronic ischemia and inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although it was commonly considered as a benign lesion， several studies have reported the correlation between GCP and gastric adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. The differentials for GCP should include GIST (Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumor) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， Menetrier’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>， inverted hyperplastic polyps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and other polypoid lesions. Here， we report a case of GCP in an un-operated stomach and compare its clinical feature， diagnosis and treatment with other 51 published cases.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nA 43-year-old woman， suffered from intermittent epigastric discomfort for almost a year， underwent an Endoscopic Ultra Sonography (EUS)， indicating that there was a huge sub mucosal mass in the anterior wall of gastric antrum and it was diagnosed as antrum deep cyst . Results of her physical examination showed nothing abnormal， andlaboratory findings including blood routine and tumor markers tests were all within the normal range. Also， her past surgical and family history was unremarkable. An abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) showed a 1.3 cmx2.2 cm irregular hypodense mass in the greater curvature of the stomach and enhanced scanning showed mild to moderate enhancement central in the lesion， which was suspicious of GIST (Figure|删除段之间换行|3). To further study the lesion， a Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) of the stomach was performed， revealing the gastric wall on the greater curvature of antrum markedly irregularly thickened， also suggesting of GIST .\n\n【8】Because of highly suspected GIST， the patient underwent a distal gastric resection (Billroth I). Gross pathologic examination revealed that the tumor was 2.5 cm x 1.5 cm in size and had normal mucosal surface. Microscopic pathologic examination showed thickening of the muscular is and cystic down-growth of gastric glands into the submucosa of the stomach with low grade dysplasia， which is compatible with gastritis cystica profunda . The patient was discharged after 12 days hospitalization and after 3-month follow-up the patient was healthy and had no sign of recurrence.\n\n【9】Clinical Features\n\n【10】A total of 57 GCP cases were collected retrospectively， with one case from Shengzhou People’s Hospital and 51 cases from 32 reports during删除4:<u> 1972-2014</u>. The lesion was significantly associated with older age and male gender (71.1%， M：F ratio， 2.5：1). It is known that GCP occurred most commonly in patients who had undergone gastric surgery. However， in our study， we found that there was no much difference in percentage for patients with or without gastric surgery history (52% vs.48%).\n\n【11】Clinicaly， GCP patients have abdominal pain， followed by gastrointestinal bleeding， weight loss， anemia and other rare symptoms such as nausea， epigastric discomfort， vomiting， belching and mild dysphagia， anorexia， fatigue， fullness and hypoalbuminemia. Additionally， it was incidentally found in more than a quarter of cases and sometimes， the lesion could be found in an emergency situation as it could lead to hematemesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Diagnosis\n\nGCP is a rare condition with non-specific symptoms and On-radiographic images， making its diagnosis difficult without definitive surgical resection. Physical examinations and laboratory studies are commonly not significant. Imaging tests included CT and MRI. GCP presents as a polypoid mass， unspecific circumferential thickening of the gastric wall with cystic changes in CT scan and MRI appearance hasn’t been reported before. In current study， a MRI scan was also performed， demonstrating that the gastric wall on the greater curvature of the antrum markedly irregularly thickened， with high signals on Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI)， and without identified perigastric or periesophageal lymph nodes. Both CT and MRI findings were not diagnostic since they mimic other hyper proliferative conditions. But Wu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> once reported a case that the features of GCP were preoperatively evaluated by CT. The differential diagnosis of GCP should include GIST， gastric adenocarcinoma and other submucosal lesions. Compared to gastric adenocarcinoma， GCP rarely presents with weight loss， cachexia and highly enhancement in CT performances. Radio graphically， GIST and GCP all appear as hypo echoic， intramural polypoid masses with cystic changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. EUS examination should be conducted to provide more information to further investigate the mucosal pathology. The most frequent EUS feature of GCP was multiple anechoic cystic spaces/cysts in the sub mucosal of those cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Additionally， the diagnosis can be improved by EUS Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). Chung et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> considered EUS as an effective diagnostic tool to evaluate and differentiate GCP from the protruding and elevated gastric lesion， with 88.9% sensitivity and 100% positive rate. Four|删除段之间换行|patients were preoperatively diagnosed by Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) or Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (ESD) along with the development of endoscopic technique in recent years.\n\n【14】Pathological examination is a monopolistic diagnostic procedure to evaluate GCP. Histologically， GCP is characterized by elongation of the gastric foveolae with hyperplasia and cystic dilatation of the gastric glands， extending in the sub mucosal layer and sometimes mild dysplasia could be discovered， similar to current case.\n\n【15】Treatment and Prognosis\n\n【16】Given the rarity of the lesions and the difficulty in diagnosing them preoperatively， a defined treatment strategy on GCP has not been well described. To date， among the 37 cases providing specific treatment plans， only four patients were without surgical treatment， one with medication with proton pump inhibitor and the other three were in surveillance. Nearly 89.2% patients underwent surgical resection， similar to our current case. The most popular surgical treatment is partial gastrectomy， followed by complete removal of stomach， endoscopic mucosal resection and polypectomy. It is well known that the location of GCP determines surgery approach. In current study， distal gastrectomy with a Billroth I gastrojejunostomy was performed because the lesion was located in the antrum. Currently， since increasing reports tend to approve the potential malignance of GCP， gastrectomy or total gastrectomy is regarded as the most recommended approach to relieve the symptoms and cure the disease. However， the reflux after surgery，foreign bodies (sutures) and gastric mucosa damage may lead to the development of GCP， which requires an appropriate surgical plan and close follow-up. In addition， ESD and EMR have become new options for treatment along with the advantage in minimally invasive approaches. But it is noteworthy that these surgical procedures may facilitate the deep misplacement of gastric glands into the muscular is propria according to a report published in 2011， which found that after three attempts of endoscopic removal of the polyp， GCP recurred within short period and a gastric sleeve resection was performed eventually 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【17】In general， the prognosis of this condition is not bad ifnot coexists with gastric adenocarcinoma， Menetrier disease， gastric lymphoma and other malignant diseases. The possibility of recurrence is not well studied. To date， two cases have been reported of the GCP recurrences after surgical resections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. And a 10-year follow-up for a case with GCP in an unoperated patient revealed low grade dysplasia， and the sizes of both the GCP and the adenoma overlying increased during the follow-up period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Results\n\n【19】Fifty-two cases of GCP have been documented， including the case reported here. Clinical and treatment data are detailed in below.\n\nAmong these 52 patients， 37 were men and 15 were women (M：F ratio， 2.5：1)， with an overall mean age of 59.9 years (range： 39-91years). The ones who were older than 50 years old accounted for 74%. The mean age among women was 60.2 years (range： 39-79 years)， and the mean age among men was 60.3 years (range： 44-91 years). Only 52% of patients had previous stomach surgery history. Among the 38 cases presenting symptoms， GCP was an incidental finding in 28.9% (n=11) of patients， and the main clinical manifestation is abdominal pain (n=14， 36.8%)， followed by gastrointestinal bleeding(n=7， 18.4%)， weight loss (n=4， 10.5%) and anemia (n=4， 10.5%). It is occasional to find the patient with nausea (n=1， 2.6%)， epigastric|删除段之间换行|discomfort (n=2， 5.3%)， vomiting (n=2， 5.3%)， belching and mild dysphagia (n=1， 2.6%)， anorexia (n=2， 5.3%)， fatigue (n=1， 2.6%)， fullness (n=1， 2.6%) and hypoalbuminemia (n=1， 2.6%). The most common anatomic GCP location was the gastric body (n=30， 58.8%)， followed by the fund us (n=13， 25.5%)， antrum (n=9， 19.6%)， and cardia (n=2， 3.9%)； some lesions were located at the anastomotic site， in the prepyloric lesion and junction of body and antrum or fundus. According to the documented cases， 37 cases provided treatment plans， including partial gastrectomy(n=20，54.1%)， complete removal of stomach (n=5， 13.5%)，endoscopic mucosal resection (n=5， 13.5%)， polypectomy (n=2， 5.4%)， medication with proton pump inhibitor(n=1，2.7%)， surveillance (n=3，8.1%) and one case without detailed surgical approach.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\nThe etiology and pathogenesis of GCP are not fully elaborated at present. Chakravorty and Schatzki 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> considered GCP as a congenital disease in 1975 because it was found in some patients without gastric ulcer and previous gastric surgery history. However， more researchers supported that acquired factors played a leading role in the development of GCP. In 1981， by studying a particular case，Franzin and Novelli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> concluded that the presence of cystically dilated gastric glands in the sub mucosa was a reactive， postsurgical condition and was caused by disruption of the integrity of gastric mucosal. Furthermore， Fonde and Rodning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> in 1986 pointed out that GCP developed secondary to ischemia， chronic inflammation and foreign body (surgical suture) stimulation. Kcne2 is short for potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily E member 2， which is one of the important subunits ofapical potassium channels in parietal cells通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.In 2010， Torsten et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> demonstrated a breakthrough finding， i.e. all of the eleven Kcne2 gene knockout mice exhibit a severe gastric preneoplastic phenotype comprising GCP， while none of the five mice|删除段之间换行|in control group developed GCP， suggesting that Kcne2 disruption was associated with the development of GCP and gastric neoplasia. Additionally， a recent study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> showed Kcne2 expression was reduced in human gastric cancer tissues， in line with Torsten finding that Kcne2 expression was negatively correlated with gastric cancer formation. In 2012， Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> reported a case of GCP associated with gastric carcinoma with lymphoid stroma， and the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in situ hybridization revealed positive reaction at the dysplastic area as well as carcinoma area， suggesting that GCP is a precancerous lesion and EBV infection plays an important role in dysplastic change. In addition， a review by Choi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> on 10，728patients with gastric cancer who underwent gastric cancer surgery found that the EBV-positive rate was significantly higher in the GCP group (31.1%) than that in the non-GCP group (5.8%)， suggesting that GCP was strongly associated with EBV-positive gastric cancers， and it was highly suspected as the premalignant lesion. Finally， experiments通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> have shown that animals predisposed to Helicobacter infection develop not only secondary GCP but also subsequent primary gastric carcinoma.\n\n【23】Whether or not GCP is malignant is still controversial.

Late second trimester and early third trimester is the most common period of hepatic decompensation when most of the complications are seen. We hereby describe an unusual case where the diagnosis of cirrhosis was unknown till the time of delivery due to its asymptomatic nature. However， the diagnosis was finally made with high index of suspicion and was further optimally managed to achieve a successful pregnancy outcome. The aspects of optimal management have been discussed.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cirrhosis； Portal Hypertension； Pregnancy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pregnancy associated with cirrhosis is a rare occurrence. Nevertheless， pregnancy in a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension is a unique problem which needs specialized care. Pregnant patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension is at risk of significantly increased foetal loss， oesophageal variceal bleeding， splenic artery aneurysm rupture， hepato-renal syndrome and hepatic decompensation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The complications and hepatic decompensation most commonly occur in the early third trimester (28 to 32 weeks of gestation). The present report describes a rare case with asymptomatic cirrhosis going undetected during pregnancy only to present with hepatic decompensation at the time of delivery and post-partum period.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 5h gravida multiparous 32 year old lady presented to emergency at 36 weeks and 5 days with complains of labour pains. She had been non-compliant with her antenatal visits with only two visits， one at 16h and another at 24th week of gestation. This was a precious pregnancy as she had two intrapartum still births associated with difficult delivery in the past. The patient had only 1 live issue who was 6 year old and was born of a caesarean section at term， done for meconium stained liquor in early labour. There was no history of any chronic medical or surgical illness.\n\n【7】On examination vitals were stable， with mild pallor and no icterus. Per abdomen uterus was term size with mild contractions and normal foetal heart rate. On per vaginal digital examination， cervix was 2 fingers loose and 30% to 40% effaced with intact membranes. The pelvis seemed to be inadequate for the baby. An emergency caesarean section was contemplated in view of anticipation of a difficult delivery. After shifting the patient to the operation theatre， spinal anaesthesia was given. Per operatively large dilated vessels (5 mm to 7 mm in diameter) were encountered subcutaneously and in the preperitoneal space. Some of them had to be secured with suture ties after being accidentally incised during surgery. A live male baby of 2.3 kg was delivered. Mild atonic post-partum haemorrhage occurred which could be controlled by uterine massage and uterotonics. Despite the best efforts， there was a blood loss of approximately 1.3 liters. An abdominal drain was inserted to prevent intra-abdominal collection. As the pre-operative haemoglobin was 7.7 gm %with a platelet count of 99，000/dL and an INR of 1.88， 1 unit of packed red blood cells and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma were transfused.\n\nIn the immediate post-operative period patient was comfortable， afebrile， maintained stable vitals and adequate urine output. However， the abdominal drain continued to produce an output|删除段之间换行|of serosanguineous fluid at approximately 50 to 100 cc/hr. The blood investigations were remarkable in terms of deranged complete blood count (haemoglobin 8.8 gm %， platelet count 81，000/dL， and total leukocyte count 15，100/dL) and deranged liver function tests(total bilirubin 1.8 mg/dL， direct bilirubin 0.9 mg/dL， aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase-327/125IU/L，total protein-4.4 gm % and serum albumin-2.3 gm %). On day 2，peritoneal drain could not be removed in view of persistent high output of 1500ml to 1700 ml per day. Adequate amount of fluids were given keeping in mind the drain output， urine output and in sensible losses and peritoneal fluid became clear gradually. Ascitic fluid investigations revealed a white cell count of 1000/dL with 90% polymorphs， sugar-106 mg % and aprotein level of 0.7 gm %， suggestive of infected transudative fluid. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed lobulated 17.7 cm liver with coarsened echotexture， splenomegaly(17.9 cm)， dilated portal vein (1.2 cm) and splenorenal collaterals， suggestive of cirrhosis with portal hypertension. However， there was no history of hematemesis， melena， recent jaundice or blood transfusion. And there were no stigmata of chronic liver disease that were evident.\n\n【9】Further investigations revealed negative tests for hepatitis B antigen， anti-hepatitis C antibody and autoimmune hepatitis antibody panel. Serum ceruloplasmin was done and Wilson’s disease was ruled out. Iron profile was done and the patient was found to be iron deficient， for which iron replacement was initiated. The blood and the ascitic fluid cultures failed to show any microbiological growth， however the patient was already on antibiotics when the samples were collected. A liver biopsy was planned as per the gastroenterologist's opinion to ascertain aetiology of cirrhosis， but was not done as the patient declined consent. Final diagnosis of liver cirrhosis with portal hypertension and secondary bacterial peritonitis was made. Treatment was started with beta-blocker (propranolol)， spironolactone， furosemide， intravenous albumin， stool softener and higher antibiotics in consultation with the gastroenterologist. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was also done and revealed grade 2oesophageal varices for which endoscopic variceal ligation was done. The peritoneal drain output reduced gradually allowing its removal on day删除4:<u> 12</u>. Stitches were removed on post operative day 20 and was discharged next day.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Pregnancy with portal hypertension secondary to cirrhosis is a scenario which is rarely encountered but commonly associated with serious complications leading to significant morbidity and poor prognosis. Cirrhosis is uncommon in reproductive age group with a reported incidence of less than 45 cases per 100，000 women通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Moreover， metabolic and hormonal derangements associated with cirrhosis lead to anovulation and hence infertility. In more recent times improvements in the treatment of chronic liver disease resulted in higher conception rates， making pregnancy with cirrhosis more common， however the exact incidence remains unknown. The diagnosis of cirrhosis usually surfaces in early pregnancy with routine evaluation or is known beforehand. Thus there is certain level of preparedness for screening and management of complications in the third trimester and peripartum period. Despite all measures， the pregnancy outcomes in cirrhosis remain dismal. The present case is unique in terms that a diagnosis of cirrhosis could be made only at the time of delivery. Even then， with appropriate timely recognition and management， a successful outcome was achieved.\n\n【12】Approximately up to 50% ofthe pregnancies in cirrhotic patients are expected to face complications， the most common being variceal haemorrhage and liver failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>. Refractory ascites， hepatic encephalopathy， hepatorenalsyndrome。spontaneousbacterial peritonitis， post-partum haemorrhage and adverse fetal outcome are other complications which maybeencountered通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The riskofvariceal haemorrhage is 400 times during pregnancy and remains one of the deadliest complications. Up to 80% patients with detectable varices are expected to bleed during the gestational period. The most common occurrence is during the late second and early third trimester， which is the period of maximum vasodilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Although uncommon， splenic artery aneurysms also rupture and bleed around the same time period. The importance of splenic artery aneurysms lie in the requirement of a high index of suspicion to reach a diagnosis and its association with high rates of materno-fetal mortality. Secondary to increased intra-abdominal pressure during pregnancy， extravasation of fluid from splanchnic vessels is hindered， making ascites relatively uncommon as a complication during pregnancy. The rates of fetal wastage are alarming in cirrhosis with estimates reported in the range of 10% to 66%. Even with live births， the risk of prematurity is significantly high. A case series reported a prematurity incidence of 25% amongst live births in pregnancies in cirrhotic patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is important to recognize that the occurrence of complications in cirrhosis is often interlinked with one complication triggering the other. Variceal haemorrhage may precipitate hypotension， acute liver failure and thus hepatic encephalopathy. It also increases the risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis which in turn increases the risk of hepatorenal syndrome significantly. Thus prevention of complications in the first place remains an important goal.\n\n【13】Management of f pregnancy in cirrhosisentailscareful assessment of liver function， esophageal varices and screening of other complications followed by an individualistic approach for each case. The importance of maintaining hydration and avoiding hypotension cannot be overemphasized. Hypotension can precipitate hepatorenal syndrome and is a risk factor of hepatic decompensation and encephalopathy. The risk of hypoglycaemia is real and needs to be addressed on a regular basis with generous supplementation of simple sugars and fruit juices. Renal function should be monitored on a regular basis to pick up any dysfunction early. Regarding management of labour， choice of mode of delivery should be made as per obstetric indications. Underlying coagulopathy in cirrhosis often needs correction to prevent post-partum haemorrhage which is common and has been reported in 7% to 26% of the cases. Risk further increases with a caesarean section and blood products should be readily available during labour of such a patient. Regional anaesthesia should be preferred over general anaesthesia if required during operative delivery. And sedatives should be used minimally as they may precipitate hepatic encephalopathy.\n\n【14】In the present case， dilated pre-peritoneal veins and significant ascites amounting to continuous post-operative abdominal drain output were important markers towards portal hypertension. Since the patient had tolerated the course of gestation well without any symptoms，achronic significant systemic illness was hardly suspected. However， to our surprise， an unexpected diagnosis of cirrhosis uncovered on further evaluation. The patient was successfully managed with beta blockers (propranolol 20 mg thrice daily)， spironolactone (50 mg twice daily)， antibiotics for secondary bacterial peritonitis and ligation of esophageal varices which were picked up before they bled on screening upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy.\n\n【15】It was difficult to maintain fluid balance because of large drain output， but formed an important part of the management. Fortunately in this case， the outcome was good for both the baby and the mother.\n\n【16】To conclude， the possibility of portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis should be borne in mind when significant ascites and dilated pre-peritoneal vessels are noted on caesarean section， irrespective of the course of pregnancy. Further evaluation and management by a multidisciplinary effort from the obstetrician， gastroenterologist and neonatologist holds the key to a successful pregnancy outcome.\n\n【17】删除6:<u>1\\.

Additionally， histopathological examination of terminated pregnancies provides valuable insights into the underlying pathology and helps confirm the ultrasound findings. This integrated approach allows a better assessment of the condition， aiding in counseling and appropriate management strategies.\n\nis properly cited.

Ultimately， improved diagnostic capabilities of spina bifida aperta can lead to enhanced prenatal counseling and better outcomes for affected pregnancies.\n\n【21】Case Presentation\n\n【22】A 27-year-old primigravida woman presented for routine prenatal care at 13 weeks of gestation. The patient had no significant family history related to neural tube defects. Transabdominal ultrasound screening was performed using a high-resolution transducer and three-dimensional ultrasound.\n\n【23】The ultrasound examination revealed a midline defect in the lumbosacral region of the fetus’s spine. A detailed assessment of the defect showed a sac-like protrusion containing cerebrospinal fluid， indicating the presence of spina bifida aperta. The visualization of the defect and the associated findings were consistent with the diagnosis of this neural tube defect.\n\n【24】To further confirm the diagnosis and obtain additional anatomical details， Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was conducted. The MRI findings were in concordance with the ultrasound results， confirming the presence ofthe spinal defect and providing precise delineation of the associated structural abnormalities.\n\n【25】Given the diagnostic findings and after thorough counseling， the patient opted for the termination of the pregnancy. Subsequently， a histopathological examination was performed on the fetus.\n\n【26】Gross examination of the fetus revealed an open defect in the spinal column ， confirming the presence of spina bifida aperta.

But the approaches vary between low and high income countries. What is common to both is the problem of preterm births (gestation week less than 37 weeks and more than 26 weeks)， which still remains a huge public health issue. In addition to this， for low-income countries carrying a pregnancy to term (gestation week over 37weeks) is still a public health issue； whereas this is no longer the case in high-income countries. This is due to the lack of sufficient and quality health structures， adequate technical facilities and available qualified human resources. The problem is even more acute in rural and peri-urban areas. In this context， in order to solve the problem of premature births， high-income countries have initiated research that has led to the recognition of the Electrohysterogram as an effective technique for monitoring pregnancies in pregnant women. Several methods have been developed around it and several parameters have been discovered for its characterization in order to diagnose preterm birth earlier. In the literature， thirty of these parameters have been found to be the most widely used.\n\n【5】In order to address the various deficits mentioned above for low-income countries， we are interested in the prediction of labor in pregnant women with full-term pregnancies.

In the same vein， we wanted to be able to distinguish between physiological contractions related to pregnancy and those leading to labor； the methods for doing so were identified in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As a logical extension of this， in this work we are interested in predicting labor by forecasting the behavior of the EHG signal using a deep learning method. We will start with the principal component analysis， which will allow us to make an objective choice of the main components to be considered in the dataset to be provided to the learning algorithm. In the following sections of this paper we will describe the different methods used， the results obtained after their application，the discussion of these results and the conclusion.\n\n【6】Method\n\n【7】Used data\n\n【8】The Term-Preterm EHG database 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> was used in this work. In our study， we considered the record with the identity 1737 and carried out at 35.6 weeks of gestation with delivery at 39 weeks(full term pregnancy). Then， as data used in this study， we exploited the thirty 通用删除7(英):<u>(30)</u> parameters most used in the literature for the characterization of the EHG signal and uterine contractions .\n\n【9】Empirical mode decomposition\n\n【10】The raw data from PhysioBank was then subjected to Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD).\n\n【11】This is a method used to analyze and decompose non-stationary and non-linear signals. It performs operations that partition a series into N finite \"modes\" (IMFs： Intrinsic Mode Functions) without leaving the time domain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The first extracted IMF contains the fastest oscillations of the signal， the last extracted IMF concerns the slowest ones， while the residual， r(t)， represents the signal trend 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【12】The usefulness of EMD in our work is that it allows us to eliminate unnecessary variations in the original signal.\n\n【13】Principal component analysis\n\nThis is a widely used dimension reduction technique. Given a dataset with n features， the obiective is to have k features with ks n so that the k features retain most of the variation present in all the original variables. Let us assume the following dataset in matrix form to illustrate the technique：|删除段之间换行|with each row representing an observation and each column a Darameter\n\nBy associating to each dataset a， b， c a function f，the average of each column gives：|删除段之间换行|which allows us to obtain the covariance of each parameter fthrough：\n\n【16】Thus， following the rules of covariance we have：\n\n【17】cov(ff) cov(介))cov(f，f)\n\n【18】Considering the square matrix Ae m\\n and aeR an eigenvalue of A， reR\"-{0} is the corresponding eigenvector of A if：\n\n【19】A.=A. (eigenvalue equation)\n\n【20】det(A-A7)= b一A\n\n【21】C3 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>\n\n【22】Solving this equation (using the Sarrus rule)， we have an equation of the form： al+bA2+cA+d=0.\n\n【23】After solving this equation we obtain the eigenvalues： 入，入入， with：\n\n【24】We then obtain， by solving the eigenvalue equation， the different eigenvectors：2 P，\n\n【25】V。\"’\"， represents respectively the eigenvectors ofA，1.\n\n【26】Considering (a)， we can choose k ≤n principal components with k=2 in our case. This giving us the corresponding matrix：\n\n【27】This can still be written by transformation into a new subspace in the form：\n\n【28】It is therefore a technique whose objectives are to： Simplify and reduce data， select variables， classify， model，predict， etc. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It also allows us to identify patterns in the data， and to compress them by reducing the higher dimensions to the lower ones， without causing any effect on the whole data or without losing important information通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In other words， at the end of this analysis， we obtain a given number of Principal Components (PCs) such that this number is less than or equal to the number of initial dimensions of the dataset.\n\n【29】Stationarity and deep learning\n\n【30】The stationarity of the data series to be sent to the forecasting algorithm must be ensured. For this purpose， the method of visual observation of the signal， its mean and its standard deviation， all represented on the same graph， is used. A statistical method is associated with this for increasingly complex data series. In our case， the Augmented Dickey Fuller test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> was used as it is the most widely used statistical method of stationarityanalysis in the literature. It is a mathematical method based on a null hypothesis and an alternative. The non-stationarity of the data is often considered as a null hypothesis. The objective is to eliminate it by obtaining a p-value lower than 0.05.\n\n【31】Once the stationarity of the data series is ensured， the forecasting process can start. For this purpose， the deep learning method N-BEATS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> has been identified. It is a predictive algorithm with a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties， being interpretable， applicable without modification to a wide range of target domains， and fast to train 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. It is a method that has proven itself in the field of time series forecasting in recent years. For its implementation， PyTorch Forecasting was used， itself being a PyTorch-based package with an open source machine learning framework .\n\n【32】Results\n\n【33】The application of the EMD on the EHG signal of our example(woman at 35 weeks of gestation) over a period of 20s centered on the peak characterizing the uterine contraction ， gives 4 IMFs among which we selected the second one in the framework of our study. The choice to focus on the periods of contraction is the one most often made in the literature.\n\n【34】After obtaining the IMFs from the EMD， when we apply the principal component analysis considering the 30 parameters， we obtain Table删除4:<u> 2</u>. Considering the results in Table 2， we have identified the 15 best parameters (RMS， MF， TM5， SM3， MYOP， ApEn， Tr， MAV2，TM3， SE (SampEn)， VCF， MNF，LOG， ZC，MAV1) by taking in order the principal components and the parameters representing them.\n\n【35】Atthe end of this， we notice that the first six principal components\n\n| Table 1： Summary of the most used parameters in the literature.  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Authors  | Title  | Parameters/features  |\n| Garcia-Gonzales et al.，2013  | Characterization of EHG contractions at term labor by nonlinear analysis  | Nonlinear： Sample Entropy (SampEn)  |\n| Alamedine et al.2013a  | Parameters extraction and monitoring in uterine EMG signals.

Thus， in the following， these six principal components will be used to train our deep learning and decision algorithm for predicting the future behavior of our EHG signal. The application of our deep learning method to our dataset leads to Figure删除4:<u> 3</u>.\n\n【38】As we can see from the different graphs， the higher the number of epochs， the less the model learns. The number of cycles refers to learning across the entire training data set. In this case， we will opt for small training cycles.\n\n【39】Discussion\n\nIn the literature， a fixed number of parameters have often been used regardless of the patient； in our work the parameters are selected according to the EHG signal， the characteristics of which depend on the patient， the week of gestation， and external factors that also affect the uterine contraction muscles. Indeed， when applying the method to other examples， the parameters do not appear in the same order from one woman to another and from one week of gestation to|删除段之间换行|another. Furthermore， we find that it is unnecessary to go beyond a certain number of principal components (usually 6). Since often the first six principal components already represent 90% of the signal information if not more. We therefore recommend the analysis of the principal component before any characterization of the EHG\n\n【41】Table 2： Principal components of a patient at 35 weeks of gestation.\n\n| PC  | Parameters  | PC  | Parameters  | PC  | Parameters  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PC1  | RMS  | PC11  | SampEn  | PC21  | TM4  |\n| PC2  | MF  | PC12  | MAV2  | PC22  | EMG  |\n| PC3  | TM5  | PC13  | MF  | PC23  | RMS  |\n| PC4  | SM3  | PC14  | VCF  | PC24  | SM1  |\n| PC5  | MYOP  | PC15  | MNF  | PC25  | WL  |\n| PC6  | ApEn  | PC16  | LOG  | PC26  | EMG  |\n| PC7  | Tr  | PC17  | ZC  | PC27  | TTP  |\n| PC8  | ApEn  | PC18  | RMS  | PC28  | MNP  |\n| PC9  | MAV2  | PC19  | MAV1  | PC29  | SS  |\n| PC10  | TM3  | PC20  | DASDV  | PC30  | WAMP  |\n\n【43】signal and thus of the uterine contractions. So， parameters that do not actually represent a good proportion of the signal information can be discarded，unless one wants to study the signal specifically with respect to these parameters.\n\n【44】In our work， due to the sampling frequency and time interval， we have made forecasts over short periods. This can be remedied by increasing for example the recording time to extend the prediction over an earlier prediction horizon. The physiological signals forecasting and in particular the EHG ones， is still at an immature stage， with few articles on this subject. In our perspectives， we would like to build up larger datasets with longer recording times in order to make predictions over hours.\n\nIt should also be noted that in this work we have not stuck to the standard classification on the basis of parameters or their associated methods. This is generally done in the literature so far to see which parameter(s) better identify or predict the contractions that will lead|删除段之间换行|to labor， or which method(s) achieve this result or the classification between preterm and term birth. Future perspectives would be to consider representative parameters of the principal components for prediction (corresponding to what is done in the literature) and to compare the results with those obtained by proceeding in the way indicated in the present work. But the majorlimitation of our work is the size of our data due to the lack of a more representative database of local populations and more adapted to our needs. We hope to overcome this limitation with the validation of our recording kit.\n\n【46】Conclusion\n\n【47】In this work， we have prioritized the most commonly used parameters in the literature by the proportion of information on the signal they represent， using the principal component analysis method. This allows us to avoid choosing the parameters for characterizing the EHG at random； especially as the order of the main components of the EHG as observed here varies from one patient to another and according to the weeks of recording. Furthermore， this allows us to know that the parameters we consider in our prediction models best represent the signal. Our prediction model here is based on predicting the behavior of the EHG signal by the deep learning method called N-BEATS. This is a recent method that is proving itself in other areas compared to existing methods. It allows a learning process which， in order to last in time， needs a large quantity of data at the beginning which was not possible in our case due to the limits of the exploited database. It would therefore be desirable to have a database of its own for longer predictions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Initial neuroimaging studies including CT and MRI showed dural masses bifrontoparietal and a right-sided tentorial mass in the cerebellopontine angle. Biopsy revealed ECD with a BRAF V600E mutation. The patient underwent initial therapy with vemurafenib. However， treatment was terminated due to adverse effects. Accordingly， dabrafenib therapy at a dose of 75 mg twice daily was started， which was well tolerated.

Laboratory studies revealed leukocytosis and mildly increased C-Reactive Protein(CRP). Neuroimaging studies including CT and MRI showed dural masses bifrontoparietal and a tentorial mass in the right cerebellopontine angle . Pathological examination of the biopsy revealed ECD with a BRAF V600E mutation as previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. After the pathological diagnosis was rendered， additional systemic lesions were detected by 18 F-FDG Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) in the humerus， femur， piriform sinus， ilium， clavicles and mandible . Based on the BRAF V600E mutation， the patient underwent treatment with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib at the dose of 960 milligrams per day. The patient showed clinical improvement of her neurological symptoms as well as general condition within eight weeks with mild to moderate side-effects.\n\nDuring ongoing treatment， symmetric polyarthritis of the shoulder joint， wrist and ankle developed accompanied by joint effusions. The patient also noted generalized malaise， loss of appetite， mood alterations， which triggered poor compliance. At the request of the patient， therapy was discontinued. Subsequently， the patient’s arthritic symptoms completely resolved. Almost two months after the treatment was discontinued， the patient presented with increasing tiredness， fatigue and increasing respiratory distress. The patient’s symptoms correlated with radiographic evidence of progression of the underlying disease. The condition of the patient continued to deteriorate，leading to hospital re-admission. Consequently， Dabrafenib， 75 mg twice daily was started. The therapy was tolerated without further side effects under inpatient supervision. After three months of therapy at a single dose of 75 mg/day， the patient returned for follow-up evaluation. Although the patient complained of limited physical strength， the cranial MRI showed a significant regression of the|删除段之间换行|supratentorial dural tumor， a reduction in brainstem signal alteration and regression ofthe manifestation in the clivus . After eight months ofcontinuous therapy with dabrafenib doses of 75 mg to150 mg daily，another cranial MRI follow-up imaging was performed， whereupon a further regression of the tumor manifestation in terms of a further size reduction of the dural mass and reduced signal enhancement in the brainstem area were confirmed .

The current case describes the favorable toxicity profile and long-term efficacy of dabrafenib therapy in a patient with ECD， exceeding two years. As is the case with vemurafenib， the optimal dose of BRAF inhibitors in ECD is unknown， but might be lower than doses used in melanoma treatment.

Therefore， Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) has become an essential tool to expand the number of lung donors in recent years.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\nA 52-year-old male with a past medical history of depression and atrial fibrillation was offered as a potential Maastricht III donor. The patient had a P/F of 320 mmHg， normal bronchoscopy， and condensation on the Right Lower Lobe (RLL) on the X-ray and CT scan . Grafts were accepted for in situ evaluation. During the assessment， asystole was confirmed 45 min after withdrawal with a warm ischemic time of 30 min. After flushing and macroscopic inspection of the grafts， modest bilateral edema was discovered along with RLL atelectasis. Therefore， an Ex Vivo Evaluation (EVLP) was considered for a reconditioning and further evaluation of the organs. Miscommunication between the harvesting and implanting teams resulted in separate storage and transport of the. Nevertheless， EVLP evaluation was approved， and the organs were brought to|删除段之间换行|the perfusion lab where additional table surgery was required.

The same was done for the airway， a pace of hues with ventilator adapter in a 1/2 end of the y connector. While a silk ligature around the 3/8 end of the connector and the left main bronchus was enough to fitting and secure it ， an extra maneuver was required due to a size discrepancy of the main right bronchus. The short remaining trachea was split， and a supplementary pace of hues was placed over the 3/8 end to adapt the gauge . Thus， securing it with a tie was possible and final reassembly of the airway was accomplished. Extra silk sutures on the edge of the bronchus were placed and tied on the 1/2 end to prevent displacement during ventilation . After table surgery the organs were placed in the perfusion chamber  and modified ex-vivo Lund protocol was followed. During 90 min of perfusion， the lungs showed steady PA pressure， PVR， proper|删除段之间换行|flow， substantial improvement of the atelectasis and edema， and compliance and reduction in peak pressure.

On the chest CTalarge volume of fatty tissue and bowel was seen in the anterior mediastinum. There was no history of trauma. An initial diagnosis of Larrey hernia was made and the patient was operated on. Laparotomy revealed a large defect in the tendinous centre of the diaphragm and pericardium with intrapericardial displacement of the omentum and the transverse colon. The viscera were reduced into the abdominal cavity and the defect was closed using a Teflon patch. The patient was questioned again about any trauma in the past and he remembered a car accident20 years earlier. In the early postoperative course transient atrial fibrillation occurred and next pleural and pericardial effusion was diagnosed， requiring thoracentesis and pericardiocentesis Further course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home. Although this condition is rare， delayed diagnosis of diaphragmatic and pericardial rupture should be taken into consideration in patients with epigastric symptoms， who sustained torso trauma in the past.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Traumatic Intrapericardial Diaphragmatic Hernia (TIPDH) is a rare consequence of blunt torso trauma. Most such injuries are diagnosed in the acute period because of symptoms associated with organ displacement or with concomitant injuries. Rarely， the injury is missed in the immediate period and the diagnosis may be delayed for months or years.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A sixty-nine-year old male presented with epigastric discomfort and pain. Medical history was irrelevant. A physical examination did not show any evident pathology. At the chest X-ray， widening of the lower mediastinum was present， with anterior mediastinal mass seen on the lateral view . Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and abdomen revealed large volume of fatty tissue and bowel in the anterior mediastinum .\n\n【6】An initial diagnosis of Larrey hernia was made and the patient was scheduled for surgery. Transverse laparotomy ~3 cm below the xiphoid process was made. Transverse colon and almost the whole omentum were displaced upwards and through the large defect in the diaphragm. After reduction of the viscera into the peritoneal cavity 通用删除1(英):<u>(Video 1， Figure 3)</u> the defect was exposed， involving the central tendon of the diaphragm and pericardium and penetrating to the pericardial sac 通用删除1(英):<u>(Video 2， Figure 4)</u>.\n\n【7】Because of the size ofthe defect primary repair was not attempted and a Teflon patch was used to close it. Several Ethibond No 2 sutures were put around the defect， placed through the diaphragm and pericardium (and anteriorly through the costal arches). The Teflon patch was tailored to the size of the defect and the parachuting'technique was used to place it in the proper position .\n\nThe abdomen was closed without any drains. The patient was questioned again aboutanytrauma in the past and he remembered a car accident 20 years ago with no serious injuries diagnosed at that time. On the 2nd day after surgery atrial fibrillation occurred with symptomatic hypotonia， and was successfully treated pharmacologically. On the 7th postoperative day， a chest X-ray was performed|删除段之间换行|the outpatient follow-up no recurrence of the herniation or fluid accumulation was seen.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\ndue to fever and revealed fluid accumulation in the left pleural cavity. Thoracentesis was performed with 300 mL serous fluid removed. On the next day the follow-up chest X-ray showed widening of the heart silhouette and ultrasound examination confirmed pericardial fluid. Under the ultrasound guidance， cannula was inserted into the pericardial sac and 500 mL of bloody-stained fluid was removed. During the next 2 days fever subsided，50 ml serous fluid was drained from the pericardium and the cannula was removed. On the 13h postoperative day right-sided thoracentesis was performed and 300mL of serous fluid was removed. Further course was uneventful and the patient was discharged home on the 14 day after surgery. During|删除段之间换行|Diaphragmatic rupture associated with pericardial.rupture resulting from the blunt torso trauma， referred to as TIPDH is a rare condition. One hundred well documented cases were described in the literature， the first two as early as in 1910 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Avast majority of these injuries are diagnosed in the acute period after trauma. On rare occasions this type of injury is missed and the diagnosis is not made until symptoms caused by displacement of viscera occur. To our best knowledge， only 45 cases of delayed presentation of TIPDH were described so far， with the delay ranging from 23 to 23 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We describe a patient who presented with epigastric pain and discomfort20 vears after torso trauma sustained in a motor vehicle accident.\n\n【11】The reason for missing the diagnosis in the acute period may be the small size of the rupture， with no organ displacement. Surgeons focus their activity on clinical priorities， which may include different types of intra-abdominal injuries， requiring immediate repair. Also， its location deep in the upper part of the peritoneal cavity may contribute to missing it， even if laparotomy is performed. Because of constant contractions of the diaphragm a small-size rupture tends to enlarge gradually over a long time. This， together with the pressure gradient between the abdominal cavity and the chest， causes slowly progressing displacement of viscera.\n\n【12】The first review including 17 cases of TIPDH was published by Larrieu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， in 1980 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， followed by 58 cases reviewed in 1986by Van Lohenhout at al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， and 82 cases described in 2001 by Reina et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The literature search has shown 18 more cases described in detail since then 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，5-19\\]</u>.Traumatic intrapericardial diaphragmatic hernias constitute a heterogenic group， depending on the type and location of rupture and the route of visceral displacement. They can be categorized in 4 main types .\n\nReportedly， the most often displaced organs are colon， stomach and omentum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， which was also seen in our patient. What was particularly rare in our patient is the very long time since the initial trauma to the presentation， being as long as 20 years， the second longest interval published to date. Despite a large volume of displaced|删除段之间换行|omentum and colon， the patient’s symptoms were relatively mild， probably due to slowly increasing volume of displaced viscera， over a very long period of time. The patient did not report any complaints that might be associated with the bowel obstruction. It is likely， that the empty space inside the enlarged pericardial sac， resulting from reduction of the bowel and omentum into the abdominal cavity contributed to the accumulation ofexudate in the postoperativecourse. Although this condition is rare， delayed diagnosis of diaphragmatic and pericardial rupture should be taken into consideration in patients with epigastric symptoms， who sustained torso trauma in the past.\n\n【14】Funding Statement\n\n【15】This paper was financially supported by statutory grant of Jagiellonian University.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The scope of this review is to establish the role of various inflammation-based markers as prognostic tools in Colorectal Cancer (CRC).\n\n【2】Methods： A literature search was performed for articles that reported on the prognostic and predictive value of the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)， Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR)，and Glasgow Prognostic Score as well as the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS/mGPS) in relation to CRC.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Further prospective studies may result in better risk stratification in patients eligible for curative surgery， limiting the administration of neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapy to high-risk candidates. In patients with unresectable metastatic disease， inflammation markers can be used as a tool for predicting chemotherapeutic outcomes and monitoring tumor progression.\n\n【4】Introduction and Background\n\n【5】Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a significant public health issue； currently， it is the third most prevalent cancer with 1，931，590 cases diagnosed in 2020 behind breast and lung cancer. In 2020colorectal cancer accounted for 9.4% of the total cancer-related deaths with 935，173 deaths. These numbers are predicted to increase to 3.2 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths per year by 2040通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Despite advancements in surgical methods， adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy dose， and scheduling， the 5-year survival rate for patients with CRC ranges from 90% to 10% with tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Currently，the International Union Against Cancer(UICC-TNM)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> staging categories are used to predict the prognosis of newly diagnosed CRC patients. Several parameters for predicting survival in CRC patients have been identified， including patient characteristics (performance status， age， gender) and tumor characteristics (TNM stage， biomarkers， gene mutations)， but it is well known that survival time can vary even among patients with the same characteristics and disease stage at diagnosis. The host inflammatory response to tumors is currently one of the most intriguing areas of clinical investigation. In many cancer forms， systemic inflammation has been shown to be significantly related to the risk and amount of metastatic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. A series of studies have shown that inflammation may play an important role in cancer growth and metastasis because inflammatory mediators enhance vascular permeability， allowing cancer cells to infiltrate lymphatic and blood arteries. Additionally， these cytokines contribute to tumor angiogenesis and protumoral immune cell recruitment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\nAlthough several cytokines are involved in the systemic inflammatory response， Interleukin-6(IL-6) plays a critical role due to its capacity to boost the synthesis of acute phase proteins， notably C-Reactive Protein (CRP)， while decreasing albumin production in the liver. It also accelerates the development of megakaryocytes into platelets， is implicated in neutrophil recruitment， and can boost thrombopoietin synthesis， resulting in increased platelet numbers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>. Another important cytokine in the antitumoral systemic inflammatory response is TGF-B which polarizes antitumoral neutrophils into protumoral neutrophils. This polarization creates a tumor immune microenvironment conducive to tumoral growth and invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. Numerous studies have evaluated the role of inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment and as a result， an increasing number of inflammatory scores have been proposed for predicting survival in several|删除段之间换行|tumor types. Several of these inflammatory biomarkers have been included in colorectal prognostication models such as Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score(mGPS)， others biomarkers such as Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) and Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) have been extensively researched as independent prognostic factors for survival in patients with colorectal cancer 15-17|.\n\n【7】The aim of the current review is to provide an overview of the role of inflammatory biomarkers in colorectal cancer prognosis.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】A literature search evaluating the prognostic role of Glasgow PrognosisScore(GPS)， modified GPS(mGPS)， Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR)， Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)， and Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) was conducted in the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE)， the Excerpta Medica database(EMBASE)， and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews(CDSR). The inclusion criteria consisted of only English-language research articles that reported on the prognostic value of the aforementioned biomarkers. We examined the title and abstract of each identified study， and the full text of the study was obtained for relevant studies.\n\n【10】Glasgow PrognosticScore (GPS)and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS)\n\n【11】The Glasgow Prognosis Score (GPS)， an inflammation-based cancer-prognostic marker constituted of serum CRP elevation and albumin concentration decrease， is considered to reflect the host systemicinflammatory response as well as his metabolicstress，andhas been demonstrated to be a helpful prognostic factor in the survival of patients with colorectal cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. According to the GPS individuals with both increased CRP (>10 mg/l) and hypoalbuminemia (3.5 g/dL receive a score of 2； individuals with just one parameter or none of these biochemical abnormalities receive a score of 1 or O， respectively. Since hypoalbuminemia alone does not have prognostic value the GPS has been modified as follows： The mGPS score can have a value of 0 for patients with low CRP ≤ 10 mg/L and any value of albumin，1 for patients with CRP>10 mg/L and albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL， and 2 for patients with CRP>10 mg/L and albumin <3.5 g/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Numerous studies have suggested that GPS/mGPS isan important prognostic factor for survival in patients diagnosed with CRC. A retrospective study that included 105 patients diagnosed with stage I-IV CRC showed that patients with elevated GPS/mGPS had a lower rate of survival independently from other common factors that influence survival such as TNM stage and tumor differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Another similar retrospective study which included 271 patients with stage I-IV CRC showed that an elevated mGPS had a lower 5-year survival rate (mGPS 2 vs. mGPS 1 vs. mGPS O； 35.2% vs. 74.9% vs.92.6%，p=0.0001)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\nA high GPS score has been shown to reflect metabolic stress， more precisely malnutrition in patients with CRC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Richards et al. assessed 174 patients with CRC from stage I to III and discovered a tight connection between high mGPS and sarcopenia (p=0.001). However， there was no link between CRP and the total fat index， subcutaneous fat index， or visceral fat index. Albumin had no relationship with the total fat index or the subcutaneous fat index， but it did have a significant positive link with the visceral fat index|删除段之间换行|(p=0.02) and the skeletal muscle index (p=0.001) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Mauricio et al. reported in a prospective study that all patients with a GPS 2 were malnourished according to the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA)， while 80.9% of patients with GPS 0 had no signs of malnutrition. There was a significant correlation between the three SGA categories(A-wel1l1nourished， B-moderately malnourished， C-severely malnourished)and GPS/mGPS score， suggesting inflammation's role in cancer-induced cachexia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Several studies have shown that GPS/mGPS is a useful prognostic model in resectable early-stage CRC， in terms of both postoperative complications as well as survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-26\\]</u>. Moyes et al. reported an association between postoperative complications such as infectious complications， pulmonary embolism， cardiac complications， and a higher GPS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Similarly， Park et al. conducted a comprehensive retrospective analysis to assess the predictive impact of mGPS and its association with other prognostic markers in 1，000 patients with early-stage CRC (stage I to III) undergoing possibly curative surgery. A high mGPS level was linked with aging and emergency presentation(both p<0.001)， primary site， increasing T and TNM stage， poor tumor differentiation， surgical margin involvement， peritoneal involvement， and tumor perforation (all p=0.001). Cancer-Specific Survival (CSS) ranged from 80% in patients with mGPS=0 to 61% in people with mGPS =2. Overall Survival (OS) was also reduced with a5-year OS of 70% for patients with a mGPS=0 to 46% in patients with mGPS=2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\nThe role of adjuvant chemotherapy is uncertain in stage II CRC， so newly validated prognostic models can be useful for better patient selection. A retrospective study done on 99 patients with stage II CRC who underwent curative surgery has shown that patients with a mGPS of O had a 5-year OS of 83.6%， while patients with a mGPS of 1 and 2 had a 5-year OS of 75.9% and 33.3%， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. A retrospective study by Sugimoto et al. reported that after multivariate analysis mGPS was the strongest prognostic factor for CSS in patients with stage II CRC， in stage III CRC therre was no significant correlation between CSS and mGPS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Some studies have reported that a higher GPS score is associated with a higher risk of distant metastasis 31|.\n\n【16】Palliative surgical resections are advised in some patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) to ease symptoms such as blockage， perforation， or bleeding. Kishiki et al. investigated the predictive value of mGPS in 79 mCRC patients who underwent palliative surgical procedures (resection of a main lesion alone， bypass surgery， or colostomy). The presence of lung metastases， peritoneal spread， distant metastases， low hemoglobin， elevated CRP levels， decreased albumin， and prior chemotherapy were all associated with lower overall survival. Tumor excision， adjuvant chemotherapy， and mGPS were all used. When the population was separated into three groups based on mGPS score， significant differences in mean survival time were found： with mGPS=0/1/2， CSS was 24， 18， and 8 months， respectively (95% CI of 19 to 37 months， 7 to 41 months， and 1 to 9months， respectively) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\nA retrospective study by Adachi et al. with a cohort of 65patients with mCRC who received surgical intervention and systemic chemotherapy showed that mGPS is an independent predictor of fatality rate. A greater 3-month death rate was associated with a higher mGPS score (p=0.00001) and multivariate analysis demonstrated that mGPS (0/1，2) was an independent risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Furukawa et al. investigated the role of GPS in 40 patients with unresectable|删除段之间换行|synchronous and metachronous liver metastases from CRC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. The absence of initial tumor resection and systemic treatment，blood CEA>100 ng/ml， serum CA19-9 100 U/ml，and GPS=2 (p=0.0362) were significant predictors of inferior outcome. Recent research has revealed that mGPS can predict outcomes in mCRC patients who have undergone chemotherapy. Ishizuka et al. conducted a retrospective study of a cohort of 112 patients who were taking chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent CRC with regimens such as FOLFIRI (5-Fluorouracil/Leucovorin/Irinotecan hydrochloride) or FOLFOX (5-Fluorouracil/l-Leucovorin/Oxaliplatin) and found that a mGPS=2 predicted a greater risk of mortality than mGPS=0 or 1(p<0.001).Only mGPS was found to be an independent risk factor of death in multivariate analyses that included neutrophil ratio， CA 19-9，CRP，albumin， and mGPS.\n\n【18】Dreanic et al. investigated the predictive effect of GPS in49 patients with mCRC who were receiving 5-fluorouracil with cetuximab and oxaliplatin (60%) or irinotecan (30%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.55%，29%， and 16% of patients had GPS values of 0， 1， and 2， respectively，at the time of diagnosis. In the first group， median Progression-Free Survival (PFS) and median Overall Survival (OS) were considerably longer (p=0.0084 and 0.0093， respectively). GPS was also tested in a group of 80 patients with mCRC who were taking bevacizumab and 5-fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (51%) or irinotecan (34%). At diagnosis，56%，31%，and 13% of patients had GPS values of 0， 1，and2， respectively. The median PFS in these groups was 10.1， 6.5， and5.6 months， respectively (p=0.16). The median OS was 20.1， 11.4， and 6.5 months (p=0.004)， respectively. Sharma et al. investigated 55patients with mCRC undertaking first-line oral capecitabine mono chemotherapy. GPS (p=0.016)， colonic primary (p=0.022)， high CEA (p=0.027)， and hypoalbuminemia (p=0.008) were significant predictors of CSS on univariate analysis； patients with GPS scores equal to 2 had a lower OS compared to those with GPS scores of 0or 1通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Neutrophil-to-Lym phocyte Ratio as a Prognostic Factor in CRC\n\nThe antitumoral inflammatory response is distinguished by an increase in circulating neutrophil levels and a decrease in circulating lymphocyte levels. Because a high concentration of neutrophils is known to promote tumor progression and to suppress the antitumor effect of lymphocytes， the Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) may be regarded as the balance between pro-tumor inflammatory status and antitumor immune status. NLR is calculated by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. Several studies suggested that an imbalance of neutrophils and lymphocytes in peripheral blood is correlated with the imbalance of the same cells in the tumor microenvironment and that this imbalance can be associated with tumor development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37-39\\]</u>. Although the NLR is associated with survival， the GPS/mGPS appears to be a better predictor of survival. In a large cohort study (Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study)， mGPS outperformed the NLR. Although an advantage of NLR is that it can distinguish between good and bad prognostic groups in a range of tumor types， including CRC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. A retrospective study by Inamoto et al. showed that the combination of the NLR and GPS/mGPS into a novel prognostic model for CRC survival was superior to the NLR and GPS/mGPS alone 41\\]. Because of its ease of calculation， the preoperative NLR is gaining popularity as a prognostic marker； its relevance in predicting disease recurrence and postoperative problems has been explored at length|删除段之间换行|in the literature. Interestingly， several studies have revealed that assessing local lymphocyte response， which is defined as a prominent lymphocytic reaction near the invasive boundary， is related to a lower NLR and thus a better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Cook et al. discovered that a high NLR value on the first postoperative day is a good predictor of postoperative complications. In this study， the NLR cut-off was high with a cut-off value of 9.3， one argument for this high cut-off value is its proximity to the surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>.\n\nIn a retrospective investigation of 524 patients with stage II-III CRC who underwent curative laparotomic resection， Kubo et al. developed a novel NLR score based on both preoperative and postoperative neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered according to their risk class，156 individuals with stage III CRC and 38 patients with stage II received the treatment. Patients with R1 and R2 resections and those undergoing emergency intervention， laparoscopic surgery， multiple carcinomas， inflammatory bowel disease， preoperative clinical evidence of infection， or other inflammatory conditions were excluded. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were performed as follows： Before surgery， on the first postoperative day， and on the third or fourth postoperative day. Patients were categorized into two groups： Those with a low perioperative NLR (score of 0 or 1) and those with a high perioperative NLR (score of 2 or 3). NLR score was found to be an independent risk factor for both DFS (HR=1.53，95%CI 1.01-2.37； p=0.02) and CSS (HR=1.71，95% CI 1.03-2.88；p=0.04) in multivariate analyses |43.\n\n【22】In a retrospective study performed by Yasui et al. on 568 stage I-III CRC patients， patients were stratified by inflammation status：Preoperative low NLR (normal group)， preoperatively high NLR but normalized after surgery (normalized group)， and persistently high NLR (elevated group). They reported an OS time superior for the normal and normalized group compared to the elevated group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The function of NLR in resectable CRC liver metastases was explored in a retrospective study of 169 patients who had liver resection after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The previously established NLR cut-off number was 2.5.HigherNLR was linked with both lower OS (HR=1.17； 95% CI， 1.03-132；p=0.011)and increased probability ofextrahepatic/multifocal recurrence (p=0.007)，implying a decreased post-recurrence survival (HR=1.24， 95% CI， 1.02-1.52； p=0.032)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Similarly in another retrospective study of 289 patients with resectable liver metastases， patients with high NLR had significantly lower 5-year survival than patients with lower NLR (22% vs. 43%， p<0.001). On both univariate and multivariate analysis， high NLR was associated with a poorer survival outcome (p<0.001)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Ganhim et al. conducted a prospective study on 52 patients who were candidates for the first excision of CRC pulmonary metastases. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were measured upon admission to the hospital， prior to surgery or any other procedure. The NLR cut-off value was determined to be删除4:<u> 4</u>. Patients were divided into two groups， an inflammatory phenotype group (high NLR and mGPS value)， and a non-inflammatory phenotype group (no signs of systemic inflammation). The inflammatory phenotype group had a shorter median OS time as well as a shorter time to recurrence \\[471.\n\n【25】A series of retrospective studies reported that NLR could have predictive value for liver recurrence after metastasectomy. Giakoustidis et al. reported that patients with an elevated NLR had a higher risk of hepatic recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Verter et al. showed that a high\n\n【26】NLR value after metastasectomy was associated with a higher rate of extrahepatic recurrence \\[481.\n\n【27】Elevated NLR appears to be a strong predictor of poor response to palliative chemotherapy in individuals with unresectable mCRC， regardless of treatment. A retrospective by Chua et al. evaluated the prognostic role of NLR in a study that included 349 patients with unresectable mCRC who were receiving first-line palliative care chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Another retrospective study performed by Kaneko et al. included50 patients with metastatic CRC treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. After ROC curve analysis the NLR cut-off value was set to 4. In univariate analysis， a higher NLR value，hypoalbuminemia， and worse performance status was correlated with a shorter OS and PFS. In multivariate analysis， NLR (HR=4.39， 95% CI 1.82-10.7， p=0.0013) and thrombocytosis (HR=5.02， 95% CI 1.69-13.4； p=0.0066) were the only variables that were significantly associated with OS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u>.\n\n【29】A retrospective analysis of104 patients with CRCwithunresectable liver metastases who were treated with liver radioembolization after failing first and second-line chemotherapy found that NLR could be a valuable biomarker for predicting outcome in these patients. A cutoff value of 5 was determined using ROC analysis. The median survival time for patients with elevated NLR was 5.6 vs. 10.6 months. A high NLR value， a lack of radiographic response after radioembolization， and the presence of extrahepatic illness were all independently correlated with an increased risk of death in a multivariate analysis\\[51J.\n\n【30】Platelet-to-Lym phocyte Ratio (PLR)\n\n【31】Similar to neutrophils platelets are a common blood component with a significant role in the antitumoral inflammatory response. Thrombocytosis is frequently detected in solid tumor patients with persistent inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[52，53\\]</u>. Platelets can stimulate tumor growth by secreting a variety of cytokines and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment that are conducive to tumor growth and invasion. The main cytokines are proangiogenic factors such as Vascular Epidermal Growth Factor (VEGF) and Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGF-B). PLR is a well-known prognostic factor for CRC， an increase in platelet count is usually associated with a decrease in lymphocyte count.\n\n【32】Most studies assessed or compared the Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR) to the NLR. In a retrospective study conducted by Emir et al.， PLR was assessed in three groups of patients： The first with only colorectal polyps (n=100； Group A)， the second with CRC (n=113； Group B)， and the third with solely healthy people (n=124； Group C). Patients in group B had a higher median NLR and PLR value compared to patients in groups A and C. There was no significant difference between groups A and C regarding NLR and PLR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54\\]</u>.\n\nIshizuka et al. assessed the predictive value of an inflammation-based prognostic score which includes platelet count and the NLR in retrospective research on 490 patients with resectable CRC. The COP-NLR (Combination of Platelet count and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio)， was calculated as follows： Patients with elevated NLR (>3) and elevated platelet count (>30×104mm) were allocated 2 points， and patients with only one parameter elevated parameter had a score of 1. Patients with no elevated parameters had a score of 0. In both univariate and multivariate analyses， the COP-NLR score showed a|删除段之间换行|significant correlation with CSS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Patients with stage II CRC and low preoperative PLR who have undergone curative surgery had no high risk of recurrence and did not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy exhibited significantly better CSS and PFS compared to patients with high preoperative PLR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>.\n\n【35】He et al. looked at the prognostic and predictive value of NLR and PLR in 243 patients with newly diagnosed mCRC， excluding those with infection， hematological illness， hyperpyrexia， or intestinal obstruction. While only the NLR was verified as an independent predictive factor for OS in multivariate analysis， elevated levels of both the NLRand PLR were related to a shorter OS time in univariate analysis， showing that the NLR is preferable to the PLR as a prognostic factor for survival in CRC patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Ir.a retrospective study by Erstad et al.， 151 patients with Colorectal Liver Metastases (CRLM) who underwent liver resection a PLR>220 and an NLR>5 were independent variables that decreased OS in both univariate as well as multivariate analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>.\n\n【37】The role of PLR as a predictive factor for patients with resected CRLM was evaluated in a retrospective study by Neofytou et al.； preoperative NLR was high (>2.4) in 53 patients while preoperative PLR was high (>150) in 58 patients. Elevated NLR and PLR were associated with decreased OS and PFS in univariate analysis， while only PLR remained significantly associated with PFS and OS in multivariate analysis 59\\].\n\n【38】Lym phocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR)\n\n【39】Monocytes play a vital role in tumor growth in the tumor microenvironment. Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) are formed when monocytes differentiate into protumoral macrophages as a result of the tumor microenvironment. TAMs can contribute to tumor infiltration and metastasis. Circulating lymphocytes， on the other hand， can transform into Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes(TILs) by migrating into the tumor microenvironment； it has been established that stage III CRC patients with a high number of TILs had a better prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60，61\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Zhang et al. reported in a study done on 270 patients with resected T3N0M0 CRC that an elevated monocyte count(>595/mm) was correlated with poor OS and DFS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u>. Similarly， Sasaki et al. reported that an elevated monocyte count(>300/mm’) was associated with poor CSS in CRC patients with liver metastases who underwent Imetastasectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63\\]</u>.\n\n【41】A study of 372 patients with stage II and III colon cancer found that patients with preoperative LMR>2.83 had significantly better time-to-recurrence and OS than patients with LMR≤2.83 and that the benefit of adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy was limited to patients with LMR>2.83. Increased preoperative LMR was associated with longer time-to-recurrence (HR=0.47， 95% CI： 0.29-0.76， p=0.002) and OS (HR=0.48， 95% CI： 0.29-0.78，p=0.003) in univariate analysis and remained significant in multivariate analysis for both time-to-recurrence and OS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[64\\]</u>.\n\nChang et al. were the first to use SIS as a predictive factor in patients with renal cell carcinoma. SIS is a novelprognostic modelthat uses the serum albumin level and LMR. Patients with albumin >4.0 g/dL and LMR>4.44 were assigned a score of 0， patients with albumin>4.0 g/dL and LMR>4.44 were assigned a score of 2， and everyone else was assigned a score of 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u>. Suzuki et al. examined 727 stages|删除段之间换行|I-IV CRC patients who underwent curative resection and found that higher SIS and higher mGPS scores were both independently related to a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[66\\]</u>. By using a time-dependent ROC curve to assess the prediction abilities of SIS and mGPS， they discovered that SIS was a better prognostic model for OS than mGPS.\n\n【43】CRP-Related Markers\n\n【44】CRP is an excellent biomarker to evaluate the inflammation status of cancer patients. As a prognostic factor in CRC Koike et al. evaluated 300 patients with CRC and showed that a high preoperative value ofCRP (>0.5 mg/dL) wasan independent predictor ofprognosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u>. Another CRP-related prognostic marker is the Lymphocyte-C-Reactive protein ratio (LCR). In a large retrospective study by Suzuki et al.， they evaluated the prognostic value of 16 inflammation-related markers such as NLR， LMR， PLR， Neutrophil-to-Albumin Ratio(NAR)， Monocyte-Albumin (MAR)， Platelet-Albumin Ratio (PAR) and LCR in 1303 patients with stage II-III CRC. The study reported that a low LCR value (≤ 12，980) was associated with a lower OS and DFS median time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[68\\]</u>.\n\n【45】A similar prognostic marker to LCR for CRC survival is CAR(C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio). Several studies have evaluated the role of CAR in postoperative CRC survival， the main consensus is that a higher value is significantly correlated to a shorter OS and CSS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[69-71\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】One of the most important indications of tumor development ISthe cancer-associatedsystemic inflammatory response.The relationship between hematological indicators of the systemic inflammatory response and survival outcomes in cancer patients has been an intensely studied subject. One of the most important indications of tumor development is the cancer-associated systemic inflammatory response. Numerous previous studies have identified serum systemic inflammatory markers that can be used to predict prognoses， such as the Glasgow Prognostic Score and the modified Glasgow Prognostic (GPS/mGPS)， Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio(NLR)， Lymphocyte-Monocyte Ratio (LMR)， Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR)， LCR (Lymphocyte-C-Reactive protein ratio)， SIS(Systemic Inflammation Score). One of the biggest advantages of these markers is their availability by use of routine blood examinations.\n\n【48】Despite these advantages， the majority of studies that evaluated potential inflammatory prognostic markers are retrospective in nature and do not have a shared platform of exclusion criteria regarding patient pathologies or treatments that could skew the blood cell count. Also， the best cut-off value can vary between patient groups and cancer types， which makes any conclusion regarding the clinical utility of these scores difficult. However， the results of the studies presented in this review suggest that inflammatory biomarkers of prognosis have value in patients treated with curative intent， in patients with advanced CRC that receive palliative chemotherapy where inflammation scores have been associated with PFS， and in patients with resectable liver or lung metastases where inflammation scores seem to be associated with a poor DFS.\n\nIn this review， we have analyzed the main inflammatory biomarkers that havebeen developed andvalidated，and accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation-based biomarkers appear to be independent powerful prognostic indicators； thus， combining these criteria with traditional clinicopathological markers may be beneficial. Further prospective research is needed to find the optimal|删除段之间换行|cut-off values.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

We repot six cases of rhino-orbital mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients who presented to the medical emergency of our academic hospital in north India from May 17h through May 24h，删除4:<u> 2021</u>. All the patients in this series were COVID-19 positive with nasopharyngeal swab testing. Five out of six cases had severe COVID-19 pneumonia， for which they were receiving steroid treatment， interleukin-6 inhibitors or other immunomodulatory therapy not used in any patient. The typical predisposing comorbid illness was type-2 DM in all patients， with poor glycemic control indicated by high plasma glucose levels and elevated glycated hemoglobin. Further， diabetic ketoacidosis is seen in two patients at admission and diabetic ketosis in one patient.\n\n【15】The first symptoms of the rhino-orbital syndrome were unilateral facial pain or swelling， periorbital swelling， orbital pain， and blurred vision. Two patients had cerebral involvement at presentation. The interval between the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 and the first symptoms of rhino-orbital mucormycosis ranged from 1 to 14 days. Computed tomography of paranasal sinuses and orbit was obtained in four cases. Severe unilateral thickening of the sinonasal mucosa with or without underlying bone erosions had been the most consistent finding . The intraorbital disease was evident in three patients， two patients had bilateral sinus involvement， and intracerebral invasion was presentin two patients. For a prompt diagnosis， microscopic examination of the specimens (scrapings from the nasal cavity or destructive palatal lesion) using the potassium hydroxide-calcofluor white method was performed， which yielded aseptate broad-branched hypha suggestive of mucor in three patients， and in the rest three， remained inconclusive. All the patients treated with intravenous amphotericin， and one patient underwent surgical debridement. Hyperglycemia managed with insulin infusion to achieve a glycemic target of 140 mg/dL to 180mg/dL. Of the six patients， only two patients improved clinically and discharged successfully. Two patients died， and two left against medical advice.\n\n【16】Poorly controlled DM is a common and significant predisposing condition for both severe COVID-19 and mucormycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. The increased reporting of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis cases from India compared to the rest of the world might reflect a higher prevalence ofDM in India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

These findings support the previous observation that a short course of steroids may predispose to severe fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\nCOVID-19 per se postulated to be independently associated with the occurrence of Mucor infection because of direct epithelial cell damage， widespread micro-thrombosis with subsequent|删除段之间换行|stagnantbloodsupply， dysregulated immune response，and lymphopenia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6\\]</u>. Lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte counts<1000 per uL) noted in all patients， including five having a count<500 per uL.

Serum1ferritinWas available in five cases in our series. All had elevated levels， including a level>1000 ng/ml in four patients. Because the reported incidence of mucormycosis during the current wave is seemingly higher than previously observed， an increased association with the increased circulation of emerging new strains of COVID-19 might also remain possible.\n\nThe predisposition with uncontrolled diabetes and first symptoms of mucormycosis are similar to that occurs without COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>.

We could not determine that prognosis is similar or worse； however， overall， COVID-199 associated mucormycosis is a devastating disease， and the increasing cases are regarded as a parallel pandemic. A comprehensive strategy including awareness about preventive measures is required to reduce the risk of this life-threatening condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Among them are the selection of the agent， dose， treatment schedule， length of therapy and the decision， posterior to the surgical treatment， to continue it or not as adjuvant treatment. Surgery continues to be initially the standard of treatment whenever possible. Results obtained from clinical essays where a single drug immunotherapy was used in the context of neoadjuvant treatment have failed to show a clear benefit with such strategy； however， in the last few years several studies have been developed with combination therapy with promising results通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The NADIM Phase II trial included 46 patients with stage IIIA lung cancer achieved a Major Pathological Response (MPR)， which is defined as <10% residual viable tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy， in 85% of the patients and a Pathological Complete Response (pCR) in 71.4% of patients， using a treatment schedule conformed by Nivolumab+Carboplatin+Nab-Paclitaxel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【8】A trial by Shu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> of only 18 patients with stage IB-IIIA used Atezolizumab+Nab-Paclitaxel+Carboplatin as neoadjuvant therapy achieving a RPM of 50% and a pCR of 21% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， and the NEOSTAR trial which included 44 patients in clinical stage I-IIIA reported RPM of 33.3% and pCR of 29% with the combination of Nivolumab+Ipilimumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>Copyright @ 2020 Rodriguez-Cid Jeronimo Rafael.

Postsurgical result was pT4N0M0 Stage IIIA.\n\n【13】The histopathological study identified a residual tumor with a solid pattern， surrounded by a tumor regression area that corresponds to 20% of the viable residual tumor that is classified as partial pathological response. In the tumor regression area， typical morphological findings were found in response to immunotherapy related to tissue repair (proliferative fibrosis and neovascularization)， celldeath (cholesterol crystals and foamy macrophages) )and activation of the immune system (tertiary lymphoid structures and peri and intratumoral lymphoplasmacytic infiltration).\n\nAfter surgery， the patient only received 1 cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy with Carboplatin， Paclitaxel and Atezolizumab due to the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently the patient is under|删除段之间换行|surveillance， with good performance， last tomography did not show tumor activity with a recurrence-free interval of 9 months .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Considering a previous outlook， there are 2 Phase II clinical trials in which neoadjuvant immunotherapy was used in resectable clinical stages with promising results. The main current challenge in the neoadjuvant treatment is the progression of the disease due to a delay in the surgical treatment. Nonetheless， there are some early studies with Nivolumab as immune， single agent， PD-L1 neoadjuvant therapy that showed that 45% of the patients had a Major Pathological Response (MPR) and that 15% of them had a Complete Pathological Response (pCR). Neoadjuvant therapy with Atezolizumab showed that 19% of patients had a MPR and 5% achieved a pCR7.\n\n【17】In particular， previous studies of neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed that the partial pathological response is more likely to occur in patients with squamous cell lung cancers (26%) than those with adenocarcinomas (12%)， possibly due to an increased response to necrosis in squamous cell carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】We still lack more robust Phase III studies to really assess the impact of partial response versus complete response in the primary tumor， likewise we need to know if negativization of the lymph nodes has an effect on disease free survival and if the neoadiuvant treatment with immune agents has a sustained impact in the elimination of distant micro metastasis and relevance on the Overall Survival (OS) and on Recurrence Free Survival (RFS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\nIn our case， the patient had a MPR of 80% with a residual viable tumor of 20% without any lymphatic or vascular infiltration and without lymph node involvement according to the pathology report and although adenosquamous lung cancers are infrequent the|删除段之间换行|immune activity of the therapy was significant with an 80% fibro-inflammatory stroma reported by pathology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

This phenomenon was named“catastrophic”antiphospholipid syndrome “CAPS” by Asheron， thus the other name “Asheron Syndrome”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The CAPS Registry is an international registry for patients who develop catastrophic APS； it was generated by the European Forum on aPL in the year删除4:<u> 2000</u>. Analysis of the registry showed that the predisposing factor was primary APS in 46% of patients， SLE in 40%，lupus-like disease in 5%， and different autoimmune diseases in 9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is noteworthy to state that 46% of CAPS patients may present de novo without any event of previous thrombosis. However， 53% had precipitating factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

Her past medical history is significant for ulcerative colitis on mesalamine， HTN， DM， and CVA. On postoperative day 2 she developed“Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome”(CAPS) and passed away 10 days after the surgery.\n\n【9】view.\n\n【10】Three months prior to presentation， she had presented to the hospital with a thrombotic stroke in her left middle cerebral artery. Thrombolysis with tPA was attempted and failed. Thrombectomy was performed 10 h after the beginning of her symptoms. During thrombectomy through the femoral approach， the wire failed to pass through her common femoral artery bilaterally but was successfully passed through her right brachial artery. Post-thrombectomy she was started on Enoxaparin 40 mg and Aspirin 100 mg daily.\n\n【11】It is worth stating that 11 days prior to her stroke， the patient presented with a 3-week history of diarrhea and was diagnosed with a flare up ofher ulcerative colitis and was thus started on Enoxaparin40 mg daily. Thus， our patient had her stroke despite being on prophylactic anticoagulation.\n\nAs the wire failed to pass through her femoral artery (bilaterally) during thrombectomy， CT angiography was performed2and|删除段之间换行|demonstrated a complete occlusion of her infrarenal aorta， extending to the common iliac arteries consistent with Leriche syndrome. The inferior mesenteric artery was completely occluded. She had multiple splenic and bilateral renal infarcts. The colon had a tubular lead-pipe appearance . She had an irregular atheromatous plaque within the aortic arch .\n\n【13】Concerningthe hypercoagulability workup， the patient had a negative lipid profile， with HDL cholesterol of 32 mg/dl， LDL cholesterol of 24， and TG of 138. Negative ANA， C3， C4， Homocysteine， Protein C， Protein S， Procalcitonin， Antithrombic activity， Factor VIII， p-ANCA and c-ANCA. She also had negative Cardiolipin Ab IgG and IgM， Phospholipid Ab IgG and IgM. Her Lupus anticoagulant was positive， but she was on Enoxaparin， thus it was interpreted as a false positive result， especially with the negative cardiolipin Ab.\n\n【14】She had a Fecal calprotectin of >2100 (high quantity >200micrograms/g). Ten days after her stroke， she was discharged with right sided hemiplegia and aphasia on Aspirin and Rivaroxaban.\n\n【15】Three months following her CVA， the patient was admitted for an aortobifemoral bypass. Preoperatively， she was switched from Rivaroxabanto enoxaparin. She had Patient Controlled Epidural Anesthesia (PCEA) inserted directly preoperatively for postoperative pain control. Intraoperatively， the right external iliac artery was atherosclerotic. 5000 Units of unfractionated heparin were injected intravenously before clamping of the aorta. An anastomosis was performed between Dacron graft and the aorta， then between the graft and both femoral arteries. At the end of the procedure a positive right and left Common Femoral Artery (CFA) pulse was felt.\n\nPostoperatively， ultrasound showed flow in the SFA and profound a bilaterally. In the ICU， the patient developed altered mental status with worsening ofher aphasia. Brain MRI did not show new changes. Enoxaparin was started 40 mg SC BID 5 h post-operatively. Her|删除段之间换行|post-operative course was complicated by acute occlusion of her aortobifemoral bypass on post-operative day删除4:<u> 1</u>. Subsequently， a bilateral embolectomy was performed using Fogarty catheter . The patient was then started on unfractionated Heparin IVSP25000 IU /24h monitored by PTT level.\n\n【17】Post-embolectomy， the patient developed d rhabdomyolysis complicated by AKI， she also had hypotension unresponsive to IV fluids and became tachypneic but was not able to compensate for her metabolic acidosis. She was intubated， started on norepinephrine and antibiotics and on day 3 post-operatively she was started on hemodialysis. Methylprednisolone 100 cc once was given due to a possible component of adrenal insufficiency and was continued at a rate of 50 cc q 6 h. The skin on her right thigh also showed livedo reticularis， but these were not confirmed by biopsy due to financial reasons. She developed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count reaching 49 000/mm. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT) and Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) were ruled out as she had a D-dimer of 3.06 and a fibrinogen level of 354. Her mental status was disturbed as she was intubated， off sedation， with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of删除4-1:<u>3</u>. Brain CT did not show any changes.\n\n【18】CT angiography showed acute mesenteric ischemia involving the small bowel secondary to a proximal SMA thrombus ， multiple scattered hepatic infarcts， occlusion of both renal arteries distally  with increase of the bilateral renal infarcts. Bilateral lower lobar arterial pulmonary emboli . Her Beta 2 Glycoprotein Abs IgM and IgG were positive， Lupus anticoagulant and Anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were negative. She was continued on methylprednisolone 50 mgq6 h and therapeutic range unfractionated heparin monitored by Anti-factor X a assay. Due to her poor prognosis， her family changed the authorization to comfort care only. She deteriorated and passed away 10 days post-operatively.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Asheron et al. proposed criteria for diagnosing CAPS. Certain features were common between these patients： Multiple organs (>2)\n\n【21】involved， many small vessels obstruction found histologically and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies on serology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> .\n\n【22】These were later validated in the year 2005 by Cervara et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> who found that they are 90.3% sensitive and 99.4% specific 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【23】It is of utmost importance to have the diagnosis early； but， due to multiple reasons， it is challenging. Aside from the fact that CAPS is a rare disease， it might not be thought of in patients without a known APS. Even if considered， not all diagnostic criteria may be met； especially in the acute setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Regarding management of patients with CAPS，early initiation of treatment， within 8 hours of diagnosis， was considered of extreme importance. The first and most important treatment for such patients is therapeutic level anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Steroids， anticoagulants and plasma exchange combined provided the highest recovery rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【25】We present a case of a 52-year-old female， with no previous pregnancy attempts， not known to have APS who was operated on and died after developing probable CAPS. Yet， she is known to have ulcerative colitis. The aim of this case report is to emphasize the importance of identifying CAPS as a differential diagnosis for patients who develop thrombocytopenia with no DIC nor HIT； but， with multiple organ damage and are not known to have APS nor SLE. This is of utmost importance as rapid treatment may save the life of the patient.\n\n【26】We also aim to emphasize the probability of CAPS in the large population of patients with IBD and increase the level of suspicion for CAPS in surgical patients. There is evolving evidence that the pathogenesis of formation of both arterial and venous thrombosis involves antiphospholipid antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.

The Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the main host cell receptor of human pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 and it plays a crucial role in the entry of the virus into the cell to cause and finally COVID-19 infection. We review the possible association of ACE2 gene polymorphisms in COVID-19 along with the risk of cardiovascular disease. From the year 2020 onwards number of researchers reported ACE2 main functional role in simulations has indicated several of these polymorphisms could affect interactions of SARS-CoV-2 and explained the concept of partial explanation for the regional differences and the disease severity. Here， we discuss the potential effect of polymorphisms of the ACE2 gene in the main function of plasma ACE2 activity in myocardial infarction， ischemic heart disease， and hypertension. Furthermore， we speculate on the potential role of ACE2 gene polymorphisms of rs2285666 as a common genetic locus and susceptibility marker for the COVID-19 infection that might be associated with cardiovascular disease risk.\n\n【2】Keywords： ACE2 polymorphism； Cardiovascular risk； COVID-19； Genetic susceptibility\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Critical pathways for hypertension control and kidney functions are attributed to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE). ACE-2 is one of the members of the ACE family protease and is attached to the cell membrane of (mACE2) in the kidney， heart， intestines， testis， and a soluble form in gallbladder (sACE2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.

The Coronaviruses (CoVs) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA， with the capacity to environmentally get rapidly mutated and recombination.COVID-19 is well-known to cause human respiratoryand intestinal infections. The risk of serious illness of COVID-19 is mostly affected by older aged people， cardiovascular disease， diabetes， chronic respiratory disease， and cancer patients. Globally， in May 2021， there have been 51，39，55，910 confirmed cases of COVID-19， including 62，49，700 deaths， as reported by WHO. (WHO， COVID-19 daily reports， April-2022) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.

The review work was planned to investigate the high-risk genetic variants of ACE2gene SNPs in COVID-19 infection and their association with Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD). COVID-19 is discovered in December-2019， however， before the COVID-19 infection，ACE2 gene polymorphisms were identified as susceptibility molecules in CVD. A recently higher number of new genetic variants were identified in the ACE2 gene as the reason for COVID-19 infection. The cured COVID-19 infected persons with ACE2 polymorphisms are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n【5】Methods\n\nAn extensive search was performed for literature collection from the ACE2 gene polymorphisms in COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease utilizing PubMed，and other scholarly searchbibliographic|删除段之间换行|databases with a variety of terms that included， rennin-angiotensin system， pulmonary hypertension， and rs2285666 susceptibility in COVID-19 or cardiovascular disease.\n\n【7】ACE2 Gene Structure and Function\n\n【8】Activation of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) plays an important role in the development and progression of cardiovascular complications. One of the pivotal components of renin-angiotensin system is ACE， which mediates various systemic and local regulations in the cardiovascular system and kidney and blockade of the RAS by Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and Angiotensin(Ang) II receptor blockers have been shown to reduce Blood Pressure(BP) and the cardiac and renal complications of diabetes. The ACE exists in two isoforms， a somatic ACE，and testis-specific ACE (tACE). In 2000， two independent research groups discovered ACE2， one of the ACE family metalloprotease， unlike ACE， ACE2 removes the carboxy-terminal phenylalanine in Ang-II to form the heptapeptide angiotensin-通用删除7(英):<u>(1-7)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. The chromosome location of the ACE2gene is at Xp22 and the size is 39.98 kb， containing 18 exons and 20introns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The ACE2 is identified as a functional receptor for the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，15\\]</u>. Serves as a main entry point in to the cell for coronaviruses such as HCoV-NL63，SARS-CoV，and SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16，17\\]</u>. ACE2 is expressed specifically in heart and kidney and capable of cleaving Ang I and Ang-II into angiotensin 1-7and angiotensin 1-9 respectively and other key vasoactive peptides， thus provides additional possibilities for the development of novel therapeutics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【9】The ACE2 Gene Role in COVID-19\n\n【10】The ACE2 contributes a central role in cardiac pathophysiology. Original SARS-CoV give rise to SARS-CoV-2 which differs from the original by 380 amino acid substitutions， and renders a difference in the receptor-binding domain between the viral spike (S) protein with surface expressed human ACE2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. This viral spike protein is target for therapeutic and vaccine development. The viral spike glycoprotein， synthesized as an inactive protein， is cleaved by the furin protease plasmin at furin cleavage site of spike protein， which is absent in SARS-CoV， thereby enhancing and increasing the cellular uptake of viral particles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> by membrane fusion. Once the virus enter in to the host cell， the viral RNA is released and the host cell's cellular programs are utilized for viral replication of the host. The viral mediators down regulates ACE2 and induce the ADAM Metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM-17) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20，21\\]</u>， latter cleaves ACE2， and directly pointing towards its direct involvement in COVID-19 and the RAAS system. Silhol et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> proposed low ACE2 level and a decrease in angiotensin 1-9 were correlated with a poor prognosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Similarly， COVID-19 viral mediated down regulation of ACE2 and its product can also be correlated with a poor prognosis in COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【11】ACE2 Gene PolymorphismsSasSaRisk in Cardiovascular Disease\n\nCVD is the leading cause of mortality ratio in worldwide， representing 32% and 17.9 million people died in 2019， WHO，June，2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.

Table 1 shows the ACE2 gene polymorphisms that are possibly more vulnerable to COVID-19 and the risk of CVD. Cross-sectional human studies from Sheila et al. reported that the circulating ACE2 gene is a genetic marker of cardiovascular disease.

Earlier evidence reports of the C/C genotype of rs2106809 and the allele A of rs2285666 in ACE2 are risk factors in patients with COVID19.

Systemic sporotrichosis is believed to be transmitted either via inhalation of Sporothrix propagules or via hematogenous spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Cutaneous lesion presents as ulcerated papules or nodules while pulmonary sporotrichosis presents with cough， hemoptysis， anorexia and fever. Clinically， cutaneous sporotrichosis can mimic other diseases such as tuberculosis and non-tuberculous Mycobacterium， nocardiasis， chromomycosis， leishmaniasis， pyoderma gangrenosum and cutaneous tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Skin biopsy is warranted in order to rule out these differentials. Typical histopathological findings are diffuse chronic granulomatous dermatitis with a central abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Pulmonary involvement can display two different patterns on radiology which are diffuse or bibasal reticulonodular infiltrate pattern， or cavities in the upper lobe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. Recommended treatment is amphotericin B， given until a favorable response has been achieved. Thereafter， therapy is changed to oral itraconazole 200 mg BD for at least 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 50-year-old man with underlying non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and ischemic heart disease presented with fever and multiple painful nodules on trunk and upper limbs for 1-month duration. He denied loss of appetite， loss of weight， prolonged cough or history of contact with ill animals or tuberculosis patients. Occasionally， he did some gardening and cleaned feces from stray cats in housing compound. On examination， there were hyperpigmented fluctuant subcutaneous nodules with hemorrhagic crusts on the face， trunk， upper and lower extremities . Otherwise， examination of other organ systems and lymph nodes were unremarkable.\n\n【7】Blood investigations revealed raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 111 mm/h and C reactive protein at 5.79 mg/ml. Full blood count， renal profile， liver function test and hemoglobin A1C were within normal range. Autoimmune disease and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening were also negative. He was initially treated with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam for multiple skin abscesses. However， he remained febrile with formation of more skin nodules. Thus， a skin biopsy was performed to rule out differential diagnoses of infectious panniculitis such as subcutaneous fungal infection， tuberculous and non-tuberculous mycobacterium infection. Histopathology revealed acute suppurative granulomatous inflammation with panniculitis. Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) and Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) stains exhibited budding yeasts of approximately 8 um in size， suggestive of sporotrichosis . Fungal culture of the skin identified Sporothrix schenckii . Culture of bacteria and mycobacterium， as well as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of mycobacterium was negative.\n\n【8】Chest X-ray demonstrated multiple centrilobularlung nodules at right upper lung zone . CT scan of thoracic， abdomen and pelvis showed consolidations over peribronchovascular right upper lobe， irregularity of the apical branch of right upper lobe bronchus and right hilar lymphadenopathy . Otherwise， there was no intra-abdominal collection. Bronchoscopy revealed swollen， irregular and inflamed mucosa over segmental bronchus of right upper lobe. Fungal culture from bronchoalveolar lavage also grew Sporothrix schenckii. Hence， diagnosis of systemic sporotrichosis with cutaneous and pulmonary involvement was made.\n\n【9】He was started on intravenous amphotericin B deoxycholate0.7 mg/kg/day. Unfortunately， he developed acute renal failure and transaminitis， which resolved upon cessation of amphotericin B. Thereafter， he was prescribed with oral itraconazole 200 mg twice daily. He responded well to the treatment with regression of cutaneous nodules after a month of treatment and was planned for one year course of oral itrconazole. Unfortunately， he was lost to follow-up.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Sporotrichosis can be classified clinically into five forms， namely skin， mucous membrane， and systemic， immunoreactive and spontaneous regression. Systemic sporotrichosis is further classified intopulmonary， cutaneousdisseminated， osteoarticular， and neurological 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Systemic sporotrichosis in an immunocompetent individual is rare. It has been reported in literatures， however these cases involved cutaneous disseminated alone， or involved non-pulmonary sites such as osteoarticular， neurological and ocular\n\n【12】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. To our knowledge， this is the first case reported of systemic sporotrichosis with cutaneous and pulmonary involvement in immunocompetent individual. Such systemic presentation more commonly occurs in the setting of immunosuppressive state such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus， immunosuppressant use， HIV infection， malignancy and connective tissue disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Sporotrichosis is caused by thermodimorphic fungi of the genus Sporothrix. Sporothrix comprises of 51 taxons， in which only four taxons are known to be pathogenic in human， namely S. brasiliensis， S. schenckii， S. globose and S. luriei通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. S. schenckii， which is the organism identified in our patient， is the most common causative agent for sporotrichosis in Malaysia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. It is usually found in contaminated plants or in the mouth， nasal cavity， nails and feces of infected cats通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Cutaneous sporotrichosis is usually caused by direct inoculation of organism into the skin by trauma. Unfortunately， only 10% to62% of patients were able to recall this information 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Systemic sporotrichosis is believed to be transmitted either via inhalation of Sporothrix propagules or via hematogenous spread and the latter mode of spread typically occurs in immunosuppressed patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We postulated that our patient may have contracted the infection through a missed trauma during gardening or via inhalation of the fungal propagules during contact with cats’feces.\n\n【14】Cutaneous lesions typically present as papules or nodules which may ulcerate or fistulize draining a purulent discharge. 80%of cutaneous cases present as lymphocutaneous form， in which the lesions were distributed along the lymphatic drainage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However， in disseminated cutaneous sporotrichosis， the lesions may be generalized with no specific distribution as seen in our patient. Pulmonary sporotrichosis typically presents with cough， hemoptysis， anorexia and fever 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. Nevertheless， 14.1% may not have any respiratory symptoms as demonstrated in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\nCutaneous manifestation of sporotrichosis can mimic other infectious diseases namely tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterium， nocardiasis， chromomycosis and leishmaniasis. It may also imitate non-infectious diseases such as pyoderma gangrenosum， primary cutaneous tumors and even cutaneous metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Skin biopsy is warranted to rule out these differential diagnoses. Typical histopathological findings are diffuse chronic granulomatous inflammation with a central abscess. The fungal structures， which are highlighted by PAS and GMS， is seen in 18%to 35.3% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Pulmonary involvement can display two different patterns on radiology， depending on the transmission|删除段之间换行|route. Hematogenous route leads to predominantly diffuse or bibasal reticulonodular infiltrate pattern. On the contrary， inhalation route frequently results in upper lobe involvement. Chronic inflammatory response is then ensued，leading to breakdown of necrotic lung tissue and upper lobe cavity formation. These groups of patients may be asymptomatic initially until large cavities are formed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. These findings further supported the hypothesis that our patient might have contracted the fungal agent through inhalation based on the upper lobe radiological findings and relatively free of pulmonary symptoms. Culture and isolation of S. schenckii from biopsy samples remains the gold standard to diagnose sporotrichosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7\\]</u>. Depending on the species of Sporothrix， it usually takes 4 to 6 days to isolate Sporothrix spp. for samples collected from skin lesions， and 10 days to 19 days from extracutaneous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Treatment of sporotrichosis depends on the clinical presentation. Inlymphocutaneous or osteoarticular manifestation，oral itraconazole200 mg per day is the preferred treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8\\]</u>. However， for systemic sporotrichosis， recommended treatment is amphotericin B， given as a lipid formulation at 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg daily or amphotericin B deoxycholate， administered at 0.7 mg/kg to 1.0 mg/kg daily. Treatment is continued until a favorable response has been achieved， after which the therapy is changed to oral itraconazole 200 mg BD for at least 1 year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Other than the commonly reported side effects such as nephrotoxicity，amphotericin B can also cause hepatotoxicity. The incidence of increased transaminases and bilirubin due to amphotericin B had been reported at approximately 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. We hypothesize that our patient's underlying hepatic disease might have predisposed him to develop raised transaminases upon exposure to amphotericin B.\n\n【17】The response of patients to treatment varies. Uncomplicated skin or mucosal manifestation in immunocompetent patients， usually heal with fibrous scar. However， untreated sporotrichosis can disseminate to other organ systems and may be fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\nThis case report highlights the rare presentation of systemic sporotrichosis with disseminated cutaneous andpulmonary involvement. It emphasizes the importance to have a high index of suspicion of the possibility of subcutaneous fungal infection in a patient who presents with suppurative skin nodules unresponsive to antibiotic therapy despite of their immune status.

According to the witnesses of the accident， she was driving in the left lane in a 110 km/h limited area and was reportedly struck by another light vehicle slaloming between the lanes. The victim's vehicle supposedly caught fire without the witnesses being able to extract her from it.\n\n【17】The dispatched emergency rescue on site did reportedly not perform any resuscitation manoeuvres. A Jane Doe's death certificate has been issued the same day.\n\nPrior to the autopsy， a full body CT scan without injection of contrast agent was carried out|删除段之间换行|crowns of the incisors of the upper dental arch were also observed.\n\n【19】Reconstructions on the hyoid bone showed a bilateral ossification defect between the body and the large horns of this bone without associated traumatic lesion. Similarly， no traumatic damage was found facing the thyroid cartilage.\n\n【20】Thoracic analysis revealed the existence of diffuse ground glass opacity of the entire pulmonary parenchyma combined with rare interlobular cross-linkages， not gravito-dependant， related to a potential pulmonary edema.\n\n【21】with fine bone sections reconstructions for the purposes of the study.\n\n【22】/Postmortem CT scan\n\n【23】Looking at the abdomen， we found a typical postmortem aero-liquid gastric distension and a non-specific effusion blade in the pouch of Douglas.\n\n【24】The CT scan acquisitions were then exported to the PACS(Picture Archiving Communication System) before being interpreted by a radiologist.\n\n【25】The overall analysis indicated a pugilist position and showed an oblique fracture of the distal third of the left radius in relation to a significant loss of subcutaneous substance and a left distal ulnar longitudinal fracture.\n\n【26】Facing the skull was found a bursting of the calvaria associate with the existence of fractures and cortical fissures， a predominant flaking at the vault with bare auras of the dipole and a split dipole sign， all related to fractures of thermal origin .\n\n【27】The patient also exhibited distal phalanges loss and numerous bilateral limb fractures involving metacarpals and phalanges of the upper limbs .\n\n【28】A. decortications site was also observed vis-a-vis of the external face of the right side of the mandible body， with exposure of the spongy tissue， associated with significant loss of tissue substances affecting the right hemiface .\n\nA fine linear scattered hyper density was found at the surface of the brain related to the desiccation and shrinking phenomena of the encephalon. In addition， a sagging burst of the left eyeball and dental|删除段之间换行|In the end， we did not find any traumatic-looking fracture over the entire bone framework. Deep substances losses with exposed bones were predominant in the anterior region of the cephalic end， thorax， abdomen and lower limbs and diffuse in the upper limbs particularly in the forearms， and were associated with thermal skin tears of the lower limbs.\n\n【30】This investigation also revealed the existence of radio-opaque elements such as jewelleries - which could subsequently be used for the victim's identification -the absence of radio-opaque dental care， and the exclusion of the presence of ballistic elements， although this is not the context in this case.\n\n【31】With a perspective of further identification， we pointed out that the morphology of the frontal sinuses remained exploitable despite the bursting of the cranial vault and that comparative odontological analysis was conceivable regardless the bursting of some dental crowns.\n\n【32】Insummary， the radiological examination establishedas immediate cause of death (fatalpathologicallesions) a probable diffuse pulmonary edema which could be part of an inhalation syndrome. On this charred body， Grow-Glassman's score was evaluated at 3(cf. article) based on the bursting of the skull vault， the numerous substances losses and the thermally induced fractures. Eventually， no traumatic fractures were found.\n\n【33】Il/Forensic autopsy\n\n【34】Following the imaging examination， an autopsy was carried out. The corpse in question was female， of average corpulence， 166cm of height and 69 kg of weight. Charred clothing fragments and a partially melted metal belt buckle were identified. A yellow metal necklace with a pendant set with eight translucent stones arranged horizontally and a ring set with one white translucent stone on the finger of the right hand were uncovered.\n\nThe cadaveric phenomena were well established， with the presence of reddish， settled， posteriorly laid-out lividities， which faded when the skin is pressed. No rigor mortis persisted. There were|删除段之间换行|no signs of putrefaction.\n\n【36】There was an almost diffuse state of carbonization of the body sparing part of the lumbar area and the posterior face of both thighs. In connection with the thermal phenomena， a retraction of upper limbs 通用删除1(英):<u>(the so-called pugilist position， cf Figure 6)</u>， an oblique fracture of the left radius also called “bec-de-flute\" and of all the phalanges， extensive areas of skin tears involving the cephalic end， the anterior thoracic wall， upper limbs and both thighs were revealed.\n\n【37】In addition， no recent traumatic tegumentary lesion was identified， subject to the state of carbonization of the body.\n\n【38】The autopsy performed on this corpse revealed a body with almost diffuse carbonization lesions with artifacts in link with thermal processes actions dominated by a burst skull ， an oblique fracture of the left radius and numerous skin tears sites.\n\n【39】We also highlighted an asphyxia syndrome (diffuse visceral congestion， pulmonary edema， pleural petechiae) and a soot inhalation in the subglottic airways testifying to the breathing of the deceased in the fire fumes and reflecting the living status of the victim at the time of the fire .\n\n【40】The carboxyhemoglobin level measured during the autopsy on peripheral blood was 6.2% and therefore discreetly increased in a non-smoker deceased. Cyanides blood concentrations were <0.2 ug mL，which allowed to exclude an intoxication.\n\n【41】No traumatic lesions related to the road accident were observed. We concluded that this autopsy report was consistent with a death resulting from burn injuries and possible smoke intoxication.\n\nRegarding identification， the corpse was a leukodermal subject of|删除段之间换行|female sex， of medium build (measuring approximately 166 cm and weighing 69 kg)， of adult age， with no detectable surgical stigma. The victim was wearing a yellow metal necklace with a pendant set with eight translucent stones and a ring set with a translucent stone on a finger of the right hand. The anatomopathological expertise did not show an immediate microscopic cause of death.\n\n【43】There was diffuse vascular congestion with a bilateral pulmonary edema， accompanied by a hemodynamic state of shock. There was no evidence of soot deposition in the lower respiratory tract.\n\n【44】This unspecific microscopic observation may result from diffuse cutaneous burn lesions in relation with inhalation of toxic fumes. The death occurred on a previous non-pathological subject who may have contributed to the death.\n\n【45】Discussion\n\n【46】The temperatures found in a car in the event of a fire are often high， estimated at 1，000°Cto 1，100°C according to experiments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It has also been proven that the window shattering-during an accident or due to thermal causes -leads to a draught which results to a local increase of temperature from 600°C in an enclosed environment to1，100°C.\n\n【47】In our case of a victim who was trapped in her vehicle， the CT scan carried out prior to the autopsy revealed numerous recent bone lesions throughout the skeleton as well as the presence of pulmonary edema which could be part of an inhalation asphyxiation syndrome. The autopsy showed a state of diffuse charring associated with a pugilist's position， loss of distal phalanges and diffuse skin defects， particularly on the vertex.\n\n【48】An asphyxiation syndrome with diffuse vascular congestion， pulmonaryedema and pleural petechiae was also found， in association with soot inhalation in the subglottic airways in relation to smoke inhalation and therefore with the victim's living status at the time.\n\n【49】Toxicological analysis did not indicate any higher-than-normal levels of CO or cyanides. Lastly， the anatomopathological examination confirmed the presence of diffuse pulmonary vascular congestion， which could also be linked to an asphyxiation syndrome.\n\nThe case of the victim found incarcerated and charred in her vehicle thus raised several questions： was it a polytraumatized victim unable to escape from the vehicle then secondarily burnt， or a victim neutralized by the fire fumes then secondarily burnt. Symes et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> has described diagnostic bone characteristics specific to thermal injuries. Longitudinal fractures are very common， and follow the architecture of haversian tubes. For some authors， they only occur on dry bone. Helical fractures， as seen in this case， represent a variant of longitudinal fractures . Transverse fractures， also very common， perpendicular to the haversian architecture and therefore parallel to the orientation of the Volkmann tubes. They are due to the perpendicular arrival of heat on the bone and can thus be seen just as much as transverse fractures， particularly on the upper limbs when the pugilist's position is set. For some authors， they are especially visible on greenstick fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Oblique fractures have arciform diaphyseal ends associated with beveling between the cortex and the spongy bone； they are also called fractures in “bec-de-flute\". They reflect the evolution of an arciform fracture with detachment of the bone . Decortications or delamination are areas of the cortical bone that are detached under the effect of heat， exposing the dipole of the skull by crumbling of the outer table  or the|删除段之间换行|spongy area opposite an epiphysis. The CT scan analysis can then be used to visualize the fracture lines within the cancellous bone，parallel to the cortical surfaces， known as the “split dipole sign\" in relation to the calvaria . The reticulated fissures are superficial cortical fissures - in a network with more or less tight and regular meshes - most often on wide areas with little thickness of soft tissue such as the skull， which would indicate regions less exposed to the heat.\n\n【51】The topography of the evaluated regions is also important and has specific features to be known.\n\nThe cranial vault can be subject to a “pressure cooker”effect and explode due to the internal pressure of water steam  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. On the skull， the fissures readily appear facing the temporal or frontal regions， as these are the most exposed. These fissures are mainly bilateral， with irregular and jagged edges. They may only concern the external table or both tables. The occurrence of a pseudo extradural hematoma is ordinary but important to know whereas a subdural hematoma will have a perimortem meaning. It important to know that toxins concentrations within these extradural hematomas seer to be particularly reflective of the perimortem toxins concentrations|删除段之间换行|Thermal amputations are frequent in the presence of high temperature or a sustained heat source； they are due to disarticulations or thermal fractures. The upper limbs often appear in major retraction with thermal fractures of the hands and wrists . The thorax and abdominal-pelvic cavity appeared well preserved. Due to the anterior position of the teeth and their thinness， the incisors are the most exposed to alterations. According to Quatrehomme et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， the enamel cracks as early as 150C and fractures around 500°℃， the unexposed dentine cracks around 600°C before disintegrating around 800°C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【53】Based on all of these considerations， we assess that bone lesions found on this corpse were of thermal origins without any obvious traumatic bone lesions.\n\n【54】Conclusion\n\n【55】This case illustrates the importance of differentiating peri-and post-mortem lesions in the context of calcination and particularly the complementarity between autopsy and CT scan data. The analysis of this case shows that most of the bone lesions were of thermal cause without bone lesions of obvious traumatic appearance. Furthermore， the conjunction oflow levels of carboxyhemoglobin and cyanides and pulmonary parenchymal lesions are also in favor of a thermal origin death.\n\n【56】The distinction between these lesions of different origin is especially important in the case of suspicion of death by the action of a third party； it then becomes essential to recognize thermal lesions in order to distinguish them from lesions of another origin. The combination of imaging and autopsy is then particularly effective in this regard.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In this case， we found an azithromycin-induced AKI event in an elderly patient.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 76-year elderly patient came to our hospital because of his history of breathing difficulty with wheezing， tightness of the chest and low grade fever. He had previous history of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases (COPD)， diabetes mellitus， hypothyroidism and systemic hypertension. He was admitted at general intensive care unit (ICU)，immediately. His SpO2 was 88% in room air and was undertaken mechanical ventilation support， immediately. At the time of admission， his body temperature was 101.3°F， blood pressure was 160/90 mmHg， pulse rate was 105 beats/min， heart rate was 115 beats/min，respiration rate was 24 breaths/min，random blood sugar was 7.4 mmol/L， serum creatinine level was 0.8 mg/dL， urea was 66 mg/dL， Serum albumin was 2.5 mg/dL， TCO2was 24 and normal serum electrolyte levels. His leukocytes count was 12.6 K/uL of blood. After intubation，his Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was recorded as E 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>，V(T)and M 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>. His bowel sound was very sluggish and defecation was absent for the last 48 hrs before admission. His urine output was 60 mL/hr.\n\n【10】For this hyperthermia management， he was treated with injection acetaminophen(1 g，intravenously，8-hourly). He also received human albumin (25%/100 mL， intravenously， 12-hourly)， Levosulbutamol/Ipratropium nebulization， Levothyroxin (50 ug， orally， 24-hourly) and amlodipine/atenolol (50 mg+5 mg， orally， 24-hourly). On his second day of admission， there was no significant change in his biochemical test reports. On that day， as a prokinetic agent， he was administered with a single dose of injection azithromycin (1g， intravenously). On the next day， there was no significant change observed in his biochemical test reports but the serum creatinine level was abruptly raised to 2.1 mg/dL. Urine output was reduced to 27mL/hr and AKI was determined. The only newly added azithromycin was suspected for this adverse event and stopped. On the next day， his serum creatinine level was reduced to 1.2 mg/dL and urine output again increased to 45 mL/hr. During the rest of his ICU stay time，he was not experienced with AKI again.

Multifactorial causes are the basis of developing AKI events and additionally， several known and unknown patient-specific factors contribute in developing AKI. Drug-induced AKI is a common phenomenon for some drugs such as， Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAID)， several antimicrobials and different chemotherapeutic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Multiple studies found that a drug becomes nephrotoxic with its one or more pathogenic mechanisms and these mayinclude inflammation，tubular cell toxicity， altered intraglomerular hemodynamics， thrombotic microangiopathy and crystal nephropathy. However， the drug-specific mechanisms are very crucial to recognize and to identify the real facts behind an event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Patient-oriented risk factors sometimes enhance the possibility of developing AKI and these may include age over 60 years； diseases such as， diabetes， heart failure， septic shock， volume depletion and underlying renal insufficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In case of admitted patients， a sudden raise in serum creatinine level within 48hours indicates a predisposition to AKI which is completely justified by its definition.

{"seq_id": "7a705d14-9a8d-4188-8420-0a13f9067a81", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Along with the widely use of anti-angiogenic therapies， recognition of the anti-VEGF related renal injury has increased. However， renal biopsy is rarely available in cancer patients who underwent systemic treatment； therefore， the renal consequences caused by inhibition of VEGF are usually underestimated. In here， we report a case of pancreatic cancer patient who developed proteinuria under the treatment of bevacizumab. The efficacy and side effects of bevacizumab were reported， and the mechanism of proteinuria and the principle of treatment were explored.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】More than 15 years ago， anti-angiogenic therapy firstly entered clinical practice， marking the new edge of anti-cancer treatment. The representative drug is bevacizumab， a VEGF-A targeting monoclonal antibody. Combining with chemotherapies， it has been widely used in oncology therapeutic areas with eight approved indications across different types of solid tumors， including Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)， Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC)， Glioblastoma(GBM)， Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)， Ovarian Cancer (OC) and cervical cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】However， bevacizumab has also shown efficacy in other types of solid tumors， for example， pancreatic cancer， which has very poor prognosis and causes huge disease burden for patients due to the limited options of treatment. Cutting edge researches consistently show that angiogenesis is the prerequisite for invasive tumor growth and distant metastasis. Therefore， anti-angiogenic drugs are valuable options for treatment of pancreatic cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Several clinical trials have shown the efficacy of bevacizumab in patients with pancreatic cancer. In a phase II clinical study， bevacizumab combined with gemcitabine in the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer achieved an obiective effective rate of 21% and a disease control rate of 46%， with median PFS 5.7 months and a median OS 8.8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Similarly， a phase III trial also demonstrates that combining bevacizumab with gemcitabine significantly improved PFS in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (HR， 0.73；95% CI， 0.61 to 0.86；P=0.0002)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Due to the unique mechanism of inhibiting VEGF， bevacizumab has many adverse effects， including hypertension， proteinuria， bleeding， thrombosis， gastrointestinal perforation， and congestive heart failure， etc. Among them， proteinuria and hypertension are the second most common adverse effects after bleeding， and are often considered as dose limiting toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Considering the high incidence of proteinuria and its damage for kidney， it is urgent for clinician to notice this bevacizumab-related proteinuria.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\nA 56-year-old female patient had a medical history of hypertension for more than 18 years， with a maximum blood pressure reading of 185/105 mmHg. Blood pressure was controlled with compound-reserpine-triamterene tablets. In March 2019， the patient underwent duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection due to the discovery of a pancreatic head mass， and postoperative pathology revealed poorly-differentiated adenocarcinoma of the pancreas， invasion of the common bile duct， and no lymph node metastases. After surgery， 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine were performed (March 2019 to September 2019). In March2020， examination showed elevated serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9(CA19-9)>1000 U/mL；PET-CT demonstrated the following： Abnormal increased metabolic signals in the region of the first|删除段之间换行|thoracic vertebra and left acetabulum， which were considered bone metastases； pulmonary nodules with high metabolic activity in both lungs， indicating the possibility of tumor metastases； multiple areas of increased radioactive uptake in the upper abdomen， hypermetabolic activity involving the right mediastinal-hilar lymph nodes， and pleural effusion. Considering the disease progression， erlotinib combined with gemcitabine was initiated then discontinued after7 days (due to systemic pruritic rash). Subsequently， the patient was given 6 cycles of first-line chemotherapy with gemcitabine1.4 mg d1， d8 + carboplatin 300 mg d1 + bevacizumab 600 mg d2(21-day cycles) from March 2020 to August删除4:<u> 2020</u>. After 6 cycles of treatment， disease assessment revealed stable disease. Bevacizumab600 mg d1 (21-day cycle) maintenance therapy was performed for 2cycles from August 2020 to November删除4:<u> 2020</u>. During treatment， the patient had intermittent epitasis and grade I-II myelosuppression. In April 2020， routine urinalysis showed trace urinary protein and erythrocytes 90/uL. The patient reported intermittent foamy urine that became more noticeable over time since July. In October， the patient developed hypertension with a maximum of 205/105 mmHg following bevacizumab administration， and the blood pressure was poorly controlled with compound-reserpine-triamterene tablets and metoprolol. Repeat urinalyses all revealed proteinuria， specific gravity 1.040， pH 6.5， white blood cells 108.3/uL， red blood cells51.7/uL， poikilocytes 100%， and protein >3.5 g/L. 24-h urine protein quantification was 0.96 g to 2.07 g.\n\nDue to persistent proteinuria， renal biopsy was performed under local anesthesia on December删除4:<u> 2020</u>. Pathology under light microscopy showed proliferative glomerulonephritis (moderate) with segmentalglomerulosclerosilsSwhich， wWhen considered together with immunohistochemistry findings， was consistent with IgA nephropathy grade III. Immunofluorescence： IgA+. Electron microscopy： consistent with proliferative glomerulonephritis . Therefore， following the initiation of nifedipine and losartan potassium tablets， the patient's proteinuria gradually turned negative aS St2and the hypertension was stable and well controlled. A repeat bone scan in December 2020 revealed bone metastases， and patients underwent subsequent treatment of second-line chemotherapy with|删除段之间换行|pemetrexed + oxaliplatin. Urinalysis showed no definite proteinuria. The patient died from disease progression in March删除4:<u> 2022</u>.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Advanced pancreatic cancer has the shortest life expectancy among solid tumors. Whether in developing or developed countries， the overall five-year survival rate is about 6% ranging from 2%to 9% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Gemcitabine acts as the backbone of chemotherapy， with a response rate of only 5% and Overall Survival (OS) of 5.7months when used alone. In addition， Gemcitabine combined with capecitabine， irinotecan or oxaliplatin， have also not showed survival advantages compared with single agent gemcitabine. Therefore， great expectations were placed on the combination of gemcitabine with novel drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. With the combination therapy of bevacizumab and gemcitabine， our patient experienced a prolonged PFS of the first-line regimen of 8.3 months， and OS was >24 months， which proved to be a remarkable survival benefit that is rarely seen in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.\n\n【13】Unlike conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies， bevacizumab-related proteinuria and/or hypertension occurred in up to 20% to30% of patients. The VEGF signaling pathway plays an important role in angiogenesis and maintenance of hemodynamic function. VEGF is expressed on glomerular podocytes， while its receptors are present on glomerular endothelial cells； VEGF expression is also important for maintaining glomerular structure and function， and either overexpression or down-regulation of VEGF may cause glomerular disease.\n\n【14】According to previous studies， proteinuria and/or hypertension associated with bevacizumab have the following characteristics：firstly， bevacizumab-induced proteinuria is dose dependent， with higher doses being associated with a higher incidence of proteinuria通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Secondly， the severity of proteinuria does not necessarily reflect the severity of renal pathological damage； many patients with Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) as the only sign of nephropathy may also have grade I-II proteinuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition， animal models have suggested that renal damage caused by bevacizumab is related to high dosages， but there is no definite correlation between the severity of renal pathological changes and the severity of proteinuria associated with bevacizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\nRenal biopsy pathology is the most critical tool for diagnosing bevacizumab-inducedrenal injuryandprognosis. A review of previous studies of VEGF-related renal injury showed that， of 15 cases with renal biopsy pathology findings， 9 revealed TMA， 24-h proteinuria ranged from 0.16 g/24 h to 5.3 g/24 h， and other pathological changes including collapsing-like focal segmental glomerulosclerosis(cFSGS； 2 cases)，proliferativeglomerulonephritis，immune complex glomerulonephritis， IgA nephropathy， and crescenti glomerulonephritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the largest-scale pathological analysis from an 8-year observational study of VEGF antibody-induced renal injury， 100 patients with proteinuria and/or hypertension/renal insufficiency underwent renal biopsy at 6.87 ± 7.18 months after treatment initiation. Anti-VEGF medications included VEGF mAb and VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Seventy-three of these patients presented with renal TMA， and the remaining 27 patients had various glomerulopathies， mainly minimal-change disease (MCN) and/or FSGS. Renal injury caused by bevacizumab was primarily TMA， with only 1 FSGS reported. Both proteinuria and hypertension recovered after bevacizumab discontinuation and initiation of antihypertensive drugs， and there were no patients with severe renal failure requiring|删除段之间换行|dialysis， suggesting that glomerular lesions caused by VEGF-targeted drugs are common with the main pathological changes being TMA and MCN/cFSGS， but with an overall favorable prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Therefore， careful risk assessment at an individual level is helpful to identify renal injury and determine appropriate management. In addition， the severity of proteinuria does not always mirror the severity of renal pathological changes， so it is essential to consider renal biopsy in patients with persistent proteinuria.\n\n【16】In this case report， proteinuria (graded 1 to 2 according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] version5.0 classification) occurred after more than 6 months of bevacizumab treatment and lasted for more than 1 month. The proteinuria did not resolve immediately after bevacizumab discontinuation. Hypertension， which was emergent during bevacizumab treatment， was refractory. Therefore， renal biopsy was performed. Pathology suggested proliferative glomerulonephritis， IgA nephropathy and benign sclerosis， without severe pathological changes such as TMA. After medical intervention with Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)， the patient's hypertension was well controlled and stable， and the proteinuria gradually became negative and did not recur after further chemotherapy. The outcome was consistent with pathological changes of the kidney， avoiding the implementation of overtreatment or delayed anticancer therapy and without affecting the prognosis.\n\n【17】In summary， bevacizumab-related proteinuria is not necessarily a dose-limiting toxicity. It is important to periodically monitor renal function， routine urinalysis， and blood pressure during treatment，and to proactively control blood pressure within the normal range.

According to studies， a caregiver’s daily productivity was assumed to equal the daily minimum wage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The child meningitis had long-term effects on family members'health， particularly affecting the likelihood of family members reporting anxiety and depression. These effects extended beyond a single close family member. These findings suggest that vaccinating against meningitis will bring significant health benefits not just to those that might have contracted the illness but also to their family networks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In comparable to other literature，in this case studythe mother was very concerned about her child's current situation and future health. She also very worried about costs of hospitalization，medication costs and her lost income as she spent more of her time with the children.\n\n【20】The family members experience at least one after-effect from meningitis in the survivor.

This increases burdens on the caregiver， which mayadversely affect their mental health. In contrast， the family's mental health may affect the development or outcomes of the long-term sequels of meningitis.

Because meningitis after Pneurnococcus preurnonae and HIB bacteria were has enormous after effect. Even though several studies recommend holistic approach of nursing care， the psychosocial aspects of the patient care of a patient with meningitis & other acute illness with chronic sequels was not commonly practiced in this set up. Due to this， many patients with meningitis were suffering from psychosocial problems. As a nurse， it important to understand such problems， I have tried to implement psychosocial interventions such as reassurance， counseling about how the patient lives with disease sequels， for the family and managing acute and chronic complication by regular exercise， adherence to medication， preventing infection， promoting positive self-image， helping child and mother to cope with social anxiety and stigmatization. Finally as recommendation， all staff members and caregivers should incorporate psychosocial aspect of meningitis patients on the assessment and care activities in order to improve the wellbeing of the patient.\n\n【29】Reflection\n\n【30】From this case study I was very notable & get new knowledge.

We report， for what we believe to be the first time， an unusual presentation of a perinephric abscess extending through the inguinal canal to the ipsilateral lower limb.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 78-year-old male arrived to the emergency room in a poor clinical state and complaining of right lower limb pain. His medical history included peripheral vascular disease and recurrent urinary tract infections due to benign prostate hyperplasia. His vital signs were within normal limits The physical examination was notable for altered mental status and stupor， right costovertebral angle tenderness， and a warm， red right thigh with subcutaneous emphysema. The blood workup revealed leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein. He was referred to a CT scan based on a clinical impression of deep soft tissues gas gangrene. CT revealed a giant right perinephric abscess spreading into the psoas and continuing caudally to the right lower limb . An urgent multidisciplinary meeting washeld， concludingthat immediate surgery was essential for the patient's survival despite the high risk of perioperative mortality. Broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics were initiated， and an exploratory laparotomy was performed. A large right retroperitoneal abscess involving the kidney and the psoas was identified and drained， and a right total nephrectomy was performed to an ill-appearing kidney. Extensive debridement of thigh muscles and a fasciotomy were carried out as well. The pathology specimens were consistent with necrotizing inflammation and abscess formation ofthe kidney  and the muscles. Blood and pus cultures were positive for extended spectrum beta-lactamases gram negative Klebsiella preumoniae. The intraoperative and microbial findings confirmed the diagnosis. Despite all supportive efforts in the intensive care unit， the patient developed multi-organ failure and died on the second postoperative day.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nPerinephric abscess is uncommon and often misdiagnosed due to its insidious nature.

Adequate nutrition support is important in HD management. Parenteral Nutrition (PN) and Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) is an alternative nutrition support for the HD patient to grow in psycho-familial environment. A female patient weight 3 kg was born with no bowel opening， abdominal distension and bilious aspirate in 2014. Biopsies andlaparoscopic biopsies had confirmed the presence of ganglion cells up to 20 cm distal to the stoma. She was diagnosed with Hirschsprung Disease-Total Colonic Aganglionosis. She underwent laparotomy， adhesiolysis and serial transverse enteroplasty STEP procedures for bowel lengthening initiative. She started with 2-in-1 parenteral nutrition via internal jugular vein in 2015 and discharge with home parenteral nutrition in 2017. Prior to discharge， patient mother has demonstrated competence in HPN management. Her family made the necessary adjustment and renovation of their house to provide a dedicated room for PN administration.

The common manifestation of HD is an absence of parasympathetic ganglion cells in the distal colon. Patients with HD will have bowel obstruction due to lack of peristalsis and loss of relaxation of the anal sphincter. This may lead to severe constipation and life-threatening enterocolitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients with HD are usually diagnosed and undergo surgery during the neonatal period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Surgical intervention with resection ofaganglionic bowel is the principal treatment for Hirschsprung disease， and has evolved since 1950通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Transanal Endorectal Pull-Through (TERPT) has become one of the most common surgical procedures for HD in recent decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Another important aspect in HD management is an adequate nutrition support through oral， enteral or intravenous route 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Intravenous Nutrition (IVN) or Parenteral Nutrition (PN) is an artificial nutrition alternative， for nutrition support when gastrointestinal fails to functions as it should 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It contains amino acids， dextrose， and lipid emulsions as the main nutrients， and electrolytes， vitamins， and trace elements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. As HD has been classified as chronic intestinal failure and require long term PN， Home Parenteral Nutrition (HPN) is the best option for the patient to grow in psycho-familial environment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.

A lower GI contrast study was done and showed a tapering and no contrast beyond ascending colon. She was referred to University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) for suspicion of bowel atresia and further medical management on day three of life.\n\n【8】A laparotomy， appendectomy， multiple bowel biopsies and a jejunostomy were performed on January 01， 2015 that is day five of her life. During the operation， there was no evidence of bowel atresia but had microcolon and a flexure at the transitional zone，45 cm from the Duodenojejunal (DJ-flexure). Results of the biopsies revealed the presence of ganglion cells 20 cm from the distal to the stoma， but absence of ganglion cells 40 cm distal to the stoma. She was diagnosed with Hirschsprung Disease-Total Colonic A Aganglionosis.The repeated laparoscopic biopsies on March 2015 had confirmed that ganglion cells present up to 20 cm distal to the stoma. The stoma was re-sited distally； 78 cm distal to DJ-flexure， due to the exteriorized ileostomy was ganglionic as confirmed by the frozen section biopsy of the stoma edge intraoperatively.\n\n【9】In February 2016， at the age of 14 months， she underwent laparotomy， adhesiolysis and serial transverse enteroplasty STEP procedures for bowel lengthening initiative. Prior to the lengthening procedure， the total length of the proximal small bowel to the ileostomy was 130 cm and the enteroplasty process managed to secure another 31 cm length. The proximal bowel was generally dilated but peristalsis was seen. She was started with 2-in-1 total Parenteral Nutrition (PN) in mid-January 2015 through right internal jugular vein. The central venous catheter was re-inserted in June 2015 to the left internal jugular vein. She has been under close monitoring for her nutritional requirements and intake， fluid and electrolyte status， and catheter care during her hospitalization in UMMC.\n\nFinally， in June 2017， the UMMC team has come to agreement that the nutritional requirements and the PN regimen had been stabilized and optimized. She was discharge from UMMC for home|删除段之间换行|parenteral nutrition. Prior to discharge， her mother has demonstrated competence in performing HPN management； line care and management， setting up enteral and parenteral nutrition under strict aseptic technique and also capable of performing ostomy care. Her family also has made all the necessary adiustment and renovation of their house in Kemaman， Terengganu to provide a dedicated room that is safe and clean for PN administration.\n\n【11】Further discussion and arrangement have been made by UMMC with Hospital Sultanah Nur Zahirah， Kuala Terengganu (HSNZ) for PN supply， with Kemasik Health Clinic， Terengganu (KKK) for home visit and emergency health management， and Hospital Kemaman， Terengganu (HKM) for PN transportation from HSNZ to HKM and routine medical follow-up. All of this arrangement is crucial as the patient will stay 250 km away from UMMC， while HKM， the nearest hospital to patient house， didn’t equipped with the facility deemed suitable for compounding PN. HSNZ on the other hand， is about 103km from HKM.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Pre-discharge preparation\n\n【14】Patient’s mother underwent home PN training， coordinate byUMMC Surgery Department in 2017. Prior to discharge， an assessment was conducted and she was able to perform and competence in hand washing and gloving techniques， setting up the dressing table， handling PN administration and discontinuation， handling the PN infusion pump and central line care.\n\n【15】A series of discussion were conducted with patient family on the technical aspect of the HPN therapy. Although PN was supplied by the hospital， but some of the consumables were self-purchase by the SpO family. There were also equipment and consumable items， sponsored by Department of Social Welfare Malaysia， Terengganu and Islamic religious and Malay Customs Council， Terengganu such as infusion\n\n【16】Table 2： Summary of nutrient required and delivered to patient via parenteral route.\n\n| Macro & Micronutrients  | Start 通用删除7(英):<u>(2017)</u>2 vears old  |  |  | Current 通用删除7(英):<u>(2022)</u>7 vears old  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Macro & Micronutrients  | Requirement  |  | Delivered  | Requirement  |  | Delivered  |\n| Macro & Micronutrients  | per day  | by weight  | Delivered  | per day  | by weight  | Delivered  |\n| Energy (kcal/kg/day)  | 65-75  | 845-975  | 1049 (107%)  | 65-75  | 962-1110  | 1011(91%)  |\n| Amino acids (g/kg/day)  | 2.5  | 32.5  | 39(120%)  | 2.0  | 29.6  | 43(143%)  |\n| Glucose (g/kg/day)  | 4.3-8.6  | 55.9-111.8  | 151(135%)  | 4.3-8.6  | 63.6-127.3  | 95(75%)  |\n| Lipids (g/kg/day)  | 3(max)  | 39  | 36(92%)  | 3  | 44.4  | 44.4(100%)  |\n| #Vitamins and trace elements (daily dose)  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  | Complete  |\n| Fluid (ml)  |  | 1150ml  | 1144 (99%)  | ★  | 1240ml  | 960 ml(77%)  |\n\n【18】#Vitamin and trace elements： SoluvitB and VitalipidB\n\n【19】\\Fluid requirement =(100 mlx 10 kg) +(5 ml x10 kg)+(25 ml x\\[Weight-20 kg\\])\n\n【20】Peptamen Junior； 4 scoops + 120 ml x 3-5/day 464 kcal， 13.7 g Protein， 62.8 g CHO and 17.5 g Fat in 500 ml water.\n\n【21】Table 3： Summary of patient body weight from 2017 until删除4:<u> 2022</u>.\n\n|  |  | May 2017  | Jun-17  | Jun-18  | Jun-19  | Jun-20  | Jun-21  | Jan-22  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | Year  | 2  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |\n| Age  | Month  | 5  | 6  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 门  | 门  |\n| Weight-for-age(kg)\\  |  | 16.3  | 15.8  | 15.3  | 15.3  | 15.3  | 15.5  | 15.8  |\n| Actual body weight (kg)  |  | 13  | 13  | 11.5  | 13  | 14.8  | 14.3  | 15  |\n\n\\The standard growth chart for Malaysia girl age 2-20 years old adapted from National Center for Health Statistics， USA|删除段之间换行|pump and also syringe pump.\n\n【24】As home PN therapy require a lot of preparation， UMMC had organize teams to help patient family on technical aspects especially for the house preparation.

All of the aspect is crucial in reducing the risk for contamination and infection to the patient. Pre-discharge home visit was done on Jun 2017 by Kemaman Hospital team， while the post-discharge home visit was conducted by Kemasik Health Clinic team every 3 to 6 months.\n\n【25】The patient was 2 years old and the body weight was 13 kg at the time she was enrolled into the HPN program. Apart from PN， she also taking oral food and received enteral nutrition support. Macronutrient and micronutrient regimen for nutrition support were developed bythe UMMC Surgery team.

It is known that the presence of these agents inside the organism conditions dysfunctions in the nutritional balance， growth and the children's physical development； and more recently difficulties related with the learning capacity are notified. For fortune， these effects can be reverted by means of treatments simple and not very expensive drugs， among those that anti-parasites of wide spectrum is had had proven effectiveness and security. Is the above-mentioned， necessary above all to wonder why if today we are so well preparations to face these infections， are they still morbidity cause in so many places? In fact， the evidences point out to the chemotherapy like a quick measure of control； however， it is known that among the parasites， the atmosphere and the Hosta balance state exists. When parallelly to the chemotherapy anthelmintic they don't modify the environmental conditions and of human behavior， the prevalence and intensity of these infections they spread to return at very similar levels to those opposing ones before the treatment. It is so it is recognized that for the integral control of these infections it is required of a social focus.\n\n【14】The intestinal parasitism offers new challenges and its control offers an opportunity more for the action from the health and for the health of the scholars， view this last one as part， objective and condition of the necessary development of the towns. These infections are intimately related with attitudes， beliefs， behaviors and habits， in occasions， difficult to eradicate and that they depend on the culture that they have. It will be then useful to observe the epidemic situation， the quantity of resources and available support， at the time that one works from a focus that it involves to the community in fundamental interventions able to interrupt the cycle of transmission of these infections， such as the construction of latrines and readiness of water， among others. For the workers of the health， the prevention has always been a fundamental part of the work， but it should be recognized that the preventive work is not only task of the members of the team of health， it is also patrimony of the community and of all the sectors.\n\n【15】It is indispensable to carry out democratic alliances among the health sector and other sectors implied with the community， so that it feels grateful the right of this last one and their responsibility to participate and that at the same time they receive the support and the attention that it demands. In places where the population is particularly exposed to the parasitosis， it can be easy to find appropriate and desirous people of being involved in the control and they can work as useful resource in the interventions to carry out. In the communities， most of people consent in altering the behaviors that put in risk the personal and family health， but all change begins when they raise the level of information consistently. This way， it is important that this it arrives to all the hands of those who can use it efficiently that it stimulates people to assume the personal responsibility in the adoption of healthier lifestyles and that they facilitate the taking of decisions as regards health， at the same time that it induces to give up noxious behaviors for the health.

We report the PET/CT findings of a systemic lymphoma-like TB， which were initially misdiagnosed as lymphoma with lung infiltration. TB was confirmed by cervical lymph node biopsy. Through a study of this case to further improve our understanding of systemic TB.\n\n【2】Keywords： Tuberculosis；Positron emission tomography； Computed tomography\n\n【3】Key Clinical Message\n\n【4】It is difficult to distinguish systemic tuberculosis from lymphoma on PET/CT， which could involve nasal mucosa，lungs， and systemic lymph nodes， including the muscle space oflower limbs. Finding the characteristic manifestations oftuberculosis， such as pulmonary miliary nodules， would be helpful for diagnosis.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Although coronavirus disease 2019 has caused millions of deaths worldwide， Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most common cause of death 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. TB treatment protocols have not changed for many years， ensuring a cure rate of >90% once diagnosed. However， due to its low detection rate， many patients with TB do not complete standardized treatment， thereby increasing the proportion of Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB) cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As such， the early and accurate diagnosis of TB is important for management.\n\n【7】Typical TB can be diagnosed almost accurately via radiography and Computed Tomography(CT). In contrast， when imaging findings are atypical or the patient has multiple disease conditions， the differential diagnosis can be difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this article， we describe the 'F-Fluorodeoxyglucose(F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography (PET/CT) findings in a patient with TB， who showed thickened mucosa of the nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus， as well as systemic lymph node enlargement and pulmonary TB， which resembled lymphoma. A brief overview of the differential diagnosis and presentation ofrelevant literature is also provided.\n\n【8】Case Report\n\n【9】A 25-year-old male presented with a month-long history of swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes. Chest and abdominal CT scan showed multiple small nodules with increased density in both lungs and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the axilla， subclavian chain， mediastinum， and retroperitoneum. Lymphomatous lung infiltration was initially considered. PET/CT examination revealed mucosal thickening of the nasal cavity and ethmoid sinus， diffuse and unevenly distributed small nodules in both lungs， and multiregional lymphadenopathy in the whole body， with varying degrees of hypermetabolism (SUVmax=10.2-18.6).Lymph node lesions without obvious necrosis were the main manifestations in this case. Furthermore， the metabolism of the respiratory nodules was not as high as that of whole-body lymph nodes. Following cervical lymph node biopsy， our initial assessment of lymphoma with pulmonary involvement was revised to TB .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\nPulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB of the brain， joints， urinary， liver， and gastrointestinal tract， among others， are known|删除段之间换行|manifestations of TB infection. Particularly， localized or systemic TB of the lungs and lymph nodes are the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-14\\]</u>. For the early detection of such cases， IF-FDG-PET-CT has been known to be very sensitive， but its lack of specificity is a major limitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nExtra Nodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma，Nasal Type (ENKTCL-NT)， is another common condition that often manifests as nasal mucosal thickening and increased metabolism；locallymph node enlargement may be associated. PET/CT is the gold standard for the diagnosis and clinical staging of ENKTCL-NT and plays a role in prognostication通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In comparison， although Mycobacterium tuberculosis could|删除段之间换行|adhere to the extracellular matrix in areas of mucosal damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， primary TB of the head and neck mucosa is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Moreover， the localized inflammation is often observed with inflammation in cervical lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The case we described was very similar to lymphoma； however， cervical lymph node biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of TB. In retrospect， nasal lymphoma generally does not|删除段之间换行|present with diffusely enlarged lymph nodes throughout the body and miliary nodules in the lungs. Therefore， the possibility of TB should also be considered when nasal polyps are found.\n\n【13】Most cases of primary pulmonary TB present as consolidations， miliarynnodulesS，小1lymphadenopathies，and pleuiral effusions. Meanwhile， miliary TB may present with acute or chronic lung nodules， and may involve multiple organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Although PET/CT has certain advantages in assessing TB activity and guiding biopsy localization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， malignant lymphoma may mimic miliary TB due to diffuse micronodular radiographic findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However， it should be noted that miliary nodules are still characteristic of pulmonary TB. In this case， bilateral pulmonary nodules were not typical of acute or chronic miliary nodules， systemic diffuse enlargedlymphadenopathy， thickened nasal mucosa， and hypermetabolism. As such， we mistook these findings as lymphoma with pulmonary infiltration. Thus， pulmonary miliary nodules should be the main diagnostic basis of this disease.\n\n【14】Systemic lymph node enlargement is typical of lymphoma and should be distinguished from TB lymphadenitis and necrotizing lymphadenitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>. In addition， imaging findings in TB vary at different stages of the disease. For example， the images of granulomatous formation are mostly solid nodules or masses without obvious necrosis and calcification， which may involve multiple parts. Granulomas may appear hypermetabolic due to the presence of many active macrophages that take up F-FDG， making these lesions indistinguishable from tumors. In this case， lymph nodes showed increased FDG uptake without signs of significant necrosis， representing the acute active phase of TB. Because of these factors， we misdiagnosed the case as lymphoma with pulmonary involvement.\n\n【15】Given these ffindings， radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians should be familiar with the imaging findings of pulmonary TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， especially since the differential diagnosis mainly relies on the morphological features of CT combined with metabolic character assessment and clinical data.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\nImaging findings in TB are variable.ISF-FDG-PET/CT is sensitive for the early detection of TB but lacks specificity in distinguishing TB from lymphoma. However， BF-FDG PET/CT played an important|删除段之间换行|role in assessment of systemic lesions and guiding the treatment of this patient. For similar cases in the future， TB should be included in the differential diagnosis， and the final diagnosis should still be based on pathological examination. For this case， the patient was treated for TB and is now considered cured and TB-free.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Infections with these parasite species are mostly considered extremely serious since they result in significant morbidity， mortality and substantial economic losses in the livestock industry. Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis， cause cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis respectively， and they are the two most prevalent species of interest from the human and veterinary perspective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. When an infection leads to such diseases， the parasite is partially kept under control by the host's immune system： in a case of immunocompetence the normal alveolar echinococcosis or cystic echinococcosis situation， the metacestode grows gradualy which eventually leads to the first visible clinical signs on the host， mostly years after the infection. It has been observed that in a case of impaired immunity， uncontrolled proliferation of the metacestode causes the disease to progress rapidly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【2】Adult cestodes are regarded apathogenic in hosts， while metacestode， the alveolar form， is high pathogenic for intermediate hosts. The alveolar cyst causes malign tumor-like lesions with infiltrative， proliferative， and destructive character. These lesions primarily originate in the liver， which then metastasize to other organs. If it is not treated in intermediate hosts， it can cause irreversible symptoms and death by targeting other vital organs such as lungs and brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【3】6307：\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 36-year-old Turkish male without a chronic disease was admitted to our clinic with a two month history of rightlower quadrant abdominal pain， indigestion， and rapid weight loss. The pain increased in severity over 36 h. Upon arrival， he was febrile and tachycardia.\n\n【6】In the physical examination， no deviations from the normal state were found. In laboratory tests， deviations from the normal state were not observed： BUN： 9 IU/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(8-23)</u>， AST (SGOT)：25 IU/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-31)</u>， ALT (SPGT)： 57 IU/ml 通用删除7(英):<u>(0-65)</u>； HBsAg， Anti-HVC， and Anti-HIV results were negative. Abdominal cavity ultrasound results were also normal.\n\n【7】The CT scans showed that chest organs were normal. The scan ofthe chest， abdominal and pelvic regions was performed after intravenous contrast administration with a slice thickness of 5 mm. A well-circumscribed encapsulated mass lesion，approximately 100 mm x 55 mm in size， was detected in the adipose tissue in the gluteal region . The result of hydatid cyst hemagglutination was negative： 1/80 (<1/160). 45 ml daily dosage of omnipaque and surgery were prescribed.\n\n【8】Under sedoanalgesia， a 10 cmx10 cm mass in the upper gluteal region located in the left lumbar region was reached bypassing the skin under the skin at the prone position. The mass was cystic inconsistency. By opening the cyst， many millimeter-sized cystic lesions were observed .\n\n【9】The inside of the cyst was washed with 3% NaCl， the bladder wall was excised， and a Hemovac drain was placed. The skin was primarily repaired. On the 5h day after the surgery， the patient was discharged from the hospital without complications and in good condition.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Cystic echinococcosis is a complex disease. Even though it is considered to be in principle， preventable and treatable， it continues to be a major public health problem in many countries. There are various unanswered questions and is a clear need for research regarding to the disease and its diagnostics as well as development of prevention and control programs.\n\n【12】Hydatid disease is mostly observed in the right lobe of the liver. Pancreatic localization is described in the literature with a frequency of only 0.2% to 2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Among such cases， lesions are commonly located in the head of the pancreas (50% to 58%). Location in the body and tail of the pancreas is seen only in the 24% to 34% and 19%of such cases respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Most patients (40% to 80% of cases) have a single cysticlesion located in a single organ. Theliver is affected in 70% of the cases， the right lobe more commonly than the left. The lungs are the second most frequently affected organ and are affected in about 20% of the cases. Cysts can localize virtually in any organ and structure， such as abdominal or pleural cavities， kidney， spleen， bone，brain， eye， ovary， testis， and pancreas. Rare immune-mediated reactions such as urticaria， asthma， membranous nephropathy， and anaphylaxis have also been described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. While the Echinococcus cases are more common to develop in the liver or lungs， in our case， it developed in the lumbar region.\n\n【13】In the postsurgical course， medication should be administered for at least 2 years， and in many recurrent or inoperable cases， the complications and intolerance of treatment with Alben dazole should be taken into consideration， which is， fortunately， not a frequent phenomenon.\n\n【14】Based on the exposure， clinical picture， imaging tests， and serological test results， Echinococcosis multilocularis can be diagnosed with the sensitivity of up to 90% to 100% and specificity of up to 95%to 100%. The most effective treatment is surgical treatment combined with Albendazole treatment.\n\n【15】Percutaneous drainage of a pancreatic echinococcal cyst is an alternative to surgical treatment for people with high intrasurgical risk. Surgical treatment can be radical or sparing. Radical procedures are associated with a lower risk of relapse but carry a greater risk of postsurgical complications. Postsurgical recurrence's frequency is around 2% to 5% and is most often caused by incomplete cyst excision， leaving undiagnosed cysts and the lack of protection from Albendazole.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】The importance of early diagnosis in Echinococcosis cases in endemic regions such as Turkey is indisputable. It should be noted that with increasing awareness for early detection of echinococcal infestations in high endemic regions， the recovery rate of patients will be increased and complications will be significantly reduced.\n\n【18】Summary\n\n【19】Echinococcosis is considered to be potentially lethal zoonotic diseases that cause serious damage to hosts.

More benign cases of CRS can present in the adulthood with minor abnormalities， such as chronic constipation and congenital anal stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Incidence of CRS varies between 1：20 000 and 1：100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Both sexes are equally affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. First description of the syndrome was given by Duhamel in to 1961 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. More than half a century later both CRS remains incompletely understood clinical entity.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Here we present the case of CRS which could be additional contribution in deepening our understanding of this serious set of anomalies. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case of CRS which developed after IVF.\n\nFemale patient age 40， who has previously undergone uterine septum resection， was treated for secondary infertility. She suffered from hyperthyroidism and was taking Propylthiouracil (PTU). According to family history there were no previous fetal malformations. Infertility was treated with in vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Embryonic Transfer (ET) into our patient's uterus. At 134h week of pregnancy， cell free DNA test was performed in order to clarify nuchal translucency measurement of 2.9 mm which was detected. The test result was completely normal. At 18h week of pregnancy sonographic examination revealed multiple fetal anomalies affecting mainly caudal body part. Decrease in fetal movement was detected， with preserved upper extremity movements. Continuity of vertebral bodies was interrupted at lower thoracic/upper lumbar level. Lumbar vertebrae were dysplastic and sacral vertebrae were not observed. There was clear asymmetry of pelvic bones. Lower extremities were immobile and close to Buddha or frog position. Clubfoot was|删除段之间换行|present bilaterally. Intestines were hyperechogenic and imperforate anus was suspected. Single Umbilical Artery (SUA) was detected. Head circumference was normal and no ventriculomegaly was observed. Normal， four-chambered heart was observed. Diaphragm and stomach were normally positioned. Kidneys and filled urinary bladder were visualized.\n\n【10】Altogether theseanomalies were consistent with caudalregression syndrome. Finally， parents chose to terminate the pregnancy at 18h week\n\n【11】Discussion/Conclusion\n\n【12】Number of authors have reported cases of CRS without any remarkable family history or parental consanguinity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5\\]</u>. Only maternal diabetes has been proposed as risk factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Some of the well-known consequences of the Assisted Reproductive Technology(ART) are multiple gestations， preterm labor，lower birth weight and chromosomal anomalies. However， it is still debatable if ART causes higher incidence of structural congenital anomalies when compared to general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Our finding could point into direction of potential relationship between IVF and congenital anomalies.\n\n【13】Two main theories regarding pathogenesis have been developed一vascular steal theory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and caudal mesoderm dysfunction. Kozlowski et al. assume possibility CRS could be part of general bone dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It remains debatable if sirenomelia and caudal dysgenesis have two different pathogenic pathways or do they represent different stages of the same disorder. Additional theory suggesting malfunctioning of notochord inductive pathways has been proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Moreover， case of Junctional Neural Tube Defect(JNTD) has been described in which patient presented with stigmata closely related to those seen in CRS， such as sacral agenesis，hypertonic anal sphincter， bilateral clubfeet， urinary incontinence and atrophy of lower extremities muscles. Consequently，authors suggested impaired secondary neurulation， which is proposed basis for JNTD， could be pathogenic origin of the caudal regression syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. We believe that further research of secondary neurulation defects could shed new light on pathogenesis of CRS.\n\nFurthermore， Retinoic Acid (RA) signaling appears to play significant role in the CRS pathogenesis. Retinoic acid， vitamin A derivative， is a signaling molecule that regulates gene transcription， cell cycle and proliferation， differentiation and organogenesis through the interaction with the nuclear receptors， Retinoic Acid Receptor|删除段之间换行|(RAR) and Retinoid X Receptor (RAX) in autocrine， cell autonomous manner and also in non-cell autonomous， paracrine manner by diffusing across cell membranes establishing retinoic acid gradients within and across tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. In placental species， lipophilic RA is manufactured from maternal diet-derived retinol (vitamin A) during embryogenesis. After entering the cell， retinol is reversibly oxidized to retinal by alcohol dehydrogenase and Retinol Dehydrogenase(RDH)， particularly RDH10. Retinal is then irreversibly converted to RA， particularly all-trans Retinoic Acid (atRA)， which is catalyzed by Retinaldehyde Dehydrogenase (RALDH) enzymes， especially RALDH2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. It has a great impact on both axis formation (anterior and caudal truncations) and neural differentiation. Under normal conditions of embryonic development， embryo is protected against fluctuations of maternal dietary RA concentration. This highlights the importance of CYP26 genes， which when mutated aren't able to degrade dietary RA and as a result abnormal phenotype occurs. Null mutations for CYP26a1 in mouse resulted in missing posterior vertebrae (lumbar， sacral and caudal)， thoracic vertebrae were often deformed， 20% of embryos expressed sirenomelia due to hindlimb fusion， while some exhibited malpositioning of hindlimbs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.PTU， as a known hepatotoxic drug， could also interfere with ability of CYP enzymes in the liver to degrade RA and hence expose fetus to higher levels of maternal RA\n\n【15】As far as we know this is the first case of CRS associated with maternal hyperthyroidism and PTU therapy. Question remains whether hyperthyroidism， PTU therapyor iatrogenic hypothyroidism could exert teratogenic effect and lead to CRS development. PTU was shown 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> to decrease RAR and RXR levels in the mice. If the same mechanism is applicable to humans， then it can be assumed that higher concentrations of unbound retinoic acid in the mother's serum could cross the placenta and cause teratogenic effects in the embryo/fetus.\n\nSo far， no serum marker for CRS has been proven as useful， unless it is complicated with open Neural Tube Defect (NTD) in which case higher AFP serum levels can be measured 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Ultrasound is a mainstay of antenatal diagnosis. Alongside ultrasound， MRI has proven useful in diagnosing CRS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In the case of CRS associated with NTD， which was described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， it is of uttermost importance to diagnose the condition as early as possible. In utero myelomeningocele surgery before 26 week of pregnancy was shown to result in better neurologic outcome when compared to standard postnatal procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Same could be true for myelomeningocele associated with CRS. Sonographic evidence of hydrocephalus or specific sonographic signs such as “lemon sign\" and “banana sign”suggest NTD or Chiari malformation is present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. CRS without NTD does not usually involve hydrocephalus as was shown in our case|删除段之间换行|Associations of CRS with different kinds of anomalies has been described， such as annular pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， diastematomyelia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>， cleft lip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> and extrahepatic biliary atresia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. It remains to be elucidated if there is pathogenic common ground for all of these malformations. Hence， we propose every patient diagnosed with CRS should be carefully evaluated in order to define full extent of malformation.\n\nIt seems likely that still unknown noxious factor affects caudal region of embryo/fetus. Namely， from our case report and all other cases described so far it is evident that tissues from all three germinative layers are affected. Our case adds additional evidence that|删除段之间换行|hypoperfusion theory could be true as fetus was shown to have SUA. Findings in our case disprove previously proposed thesis according to which SUA is abnormality commonly associated with sirenomelia instead of CRS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Nomenclature in the literature regarding CRS is confusing. Different authors describe syndrome using different names. Some authors discard name “caudal regression syndrome\"， as they do not believe something that has normally developed regresses but development itself is dysfunctional. Terms “sacrococcygeal agenesis”and“sacral agenesis” have also emerged as possible for naming the syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>. Clear sonographic parameters for diagnosis of CRS would definitely clarify situation.

Her medical history|删除段之间换行|included two previous IVF attempts with autologous oocytes at another clinic. At that time her AMH was 0.7 ng\\\\ml and both treatment cycles were unsuccessful. In her first IVF attempt using donor oocytes， three high quality blastocysts were created. They were transferred in two consecutive cycles and did not result in gestation. Another donor-oocyte cycle followed， in which she received two grade 1 fresh blastocysts. Ten days after transfer， B-HCG test of 355mUI revealed an early gestation. The first ultrasound 26 days post-transfer showed one intrauterine gestational sac and another in the cervix， with both embryos measuring Crown Rump Length (CRL) of 0.5 cm and with active heartbeat . The patient received extensive information and counseling on her condition. After different treatment possibilities were discussed， we decided for a US-guided aspiration of the cervical gestational sac to best preserve the intrauterine gestation. The procedure was performed in a local hospital， under general anesthesia， on day 28 after embryo transfer. The cervical gestational sac was punctured using a 17 G single lumen oocyte aspiration needle under US-guidance. The treatment approach was successful in aspirating the contents of gestational sac. The patient was discharged home after 24 h observation. The histopathological examination confirmed embryonic remains and products ofconception from the aspirate. There was minimal bleeding during and after the procedure. On the second post-operative day， the patient presented with painless vaginal bleeding and was readmitted to the hospital. Trophoblastic tissues of the cervical ectopic conceptus were gently removed using a curette， under ultrasound guidance. Histopathology analysis confirmed the presence of chorionic villi in the gestational tissues. An ultrasound performed four days after the curettage revealed a viable intrauterine gestation. Some residual trophoblast tissue could still be detected into the cervical canal. Serial obstetric US six days later revealed the persistence of a heterogeneous， hypervascular mass measuring 2.7 mm x2.0 mm in the cervical canal near the internal os， corresponding to remains of the cervical gestation chorionic villi. Two weeks after the curettage， the cervical heterogeneous mass persisted and the intrauterine gestation followed normal development. Fortnightly US surveillance revealed a shortened uterine cervix， at 20weeks gestation. A cervical pessary was inserted at 22 weeks gestation to avoid preterm delivery. The patient was prescribed absolute bed rest until 37 weeks gestation， when labor contractions started. The pessary was removed and the cesarean section was schedule for the next day. The patient delivered a healthy baby girl weighting 2960 g and 46 cm.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】The present case report describes the successful treatment of a CHG after IVF， using US-guided aspiration of the ectopic gestational sac， followed by curettage， pessary placement due to cervical shortening and absolute rest. The frequency of different forms of heterotopic gestations is much higher after IVF， than after natural conception 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. The clinical management of a CHG after IVF imposes specific challenges， considering that IVF pregnancies are highly desired and treatment for the termination of an ectopic gestation may also put in danger the viable intrauterine one.\n\n【19】To our best knowledge， this is the first description of a CHG detected at an early gestational age and treated with US-guided aspiration of gestational sac， cervical curettage and pessaryplacement. Although the curettage of the cervical canal was carefully performed， cervical shortening occurred and the placement of a pessary was Iiecessary to avoid preterm delivery.\n\n【20】The patient was 41 years of age and that was her first pregnancy， after four unsuccessful embryo transfers. The early detection of the extra uterine gestational sac at 6 weeks was paramount for the success in the CHG management， without pregnancy loss of the viable intrauterine gestation and fertility preservation. Majority ofthe CHGs are detected after vaginal bleeding， at more advanced gestational age. Thus， particularly after IVF cycles in which more than one embryo is transferred， the first US scan should include a careful evaluation ofthe cervical canal to exclude a heterotopic gestation at the cervix.\n\n【21】Different treatment options are described for the resolution of cervical heterotopic gestations. However， some of the treatments may result in undesired outcomes， such as infertility 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> and intrauterine gestation loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Sonographically guided injection of various agents， into the ectopic gestational sac is effective， but it is also associated with persistent trophoblastic tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. US-guided aspiration of cervical conceptus results in immediate termination of the ectopic gestation and there is a minor risk to cause harm to the intrauterine pregnancy.\n\n【22】In conclusion， considering that there is no consensus on the best treatment for CHG， it is important to report the factors that contributed to the successful resolution of the present case. Early detection and US-guided aspiration performed by an experienced operator， careful follow up of the remaining embryonic tissues， monitoring of cervical canal along the gestation to avoid preterm delivery due to a possible shortening of the cervix after curettage and placement of cervical pessary to ensure a full-term gestation represent a safe and effective management of CHG， with fertility preservation and favorable live birth outcomes for IVF patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The incidence of stent loss ranges widely from0.32% to 8.3%， while the success rate of retrieval varies between 45% and 100%. Advances in stent technology， with enhanced flexibility and deliverability， combined with increased experience in stent utilization， have contributed to a decreased occurrence of stent loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【8】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【9】Various types of equipment， including stents， guidewires， and catheters， can be inadvertently misplaced or trapped within or outside the coronary artery. Device entrapment poses a more severe complication than device loss. Retrieval of a dislodged stent can be achieved surgically or percutaneously， utilizing different devices and techniques such as a small balloon catheter， a snare loop， the two-wire technique， grasping forceps， or basket retrieval devices 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【10】In the present case， we describe a complex scenario involving a patient with significant left main disease who underwent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) with stent placement. Unfortunately， during the procedure， the stent became entrapped within the Left Main artery (LM)， resulting in longitudinal deformation (elongation) and protrusion into the aorta all the way to brachiocephalic trunk during the stent extraction process. To optimize the chances of a successful and safe stent extraction while minimizing potential complications， a comprehensive assessment was conducted using multiple imaging techniques.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 72-year-old patient with a history of myocardial infarction and a previous primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) on the Circumflex artery (Cx) in 2013 was admitted due to lower limb ischemia and significant carotid disease. The patient presented with rest leg pain and had a medical history of diabetes， managed with insulin， hypertension， dyslipidemia， and normal kidney function(estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate， eGFR). Considering the planned major vascular surgery and risk factors， the patient was referred for preoperative coronary angiography which revealed three-vessel disease with LM stenosis .\n\n【13】Due to the severe calcification of the aorta ， surgical intervention was deemed unsuitable， leading to the recommendation of a staged procedure. The initial approach involved PCI of the LM， followed by vascular surgery， and concluding with PCI of the Right Coronary Artery (RCA).\n\n【14】The procedure was performed using right radial access and a 6F extra backup Guiding Catheter (GC). The chosen strategy employed provisional stenting towards the Left Anterior Descending artery(LAD). After a predilation with a Non-Compliant (NC) 2.5 mm×15 mm balloon， a second-generation drug-eluting stent 3.5 mmx18 mm was implanted from the LM towards the LAD . To optimize the proximal area， a NC 4.0 mm x 6 mm balloon was employed， followed by a \"kissing\" inflation technique involving a NC3.5 mm x 15 mm balloon in the LAD and a NC 2.5 mm x 15 mm balloon in the Circumflex artery (Cx).\n\nAfter obtaining an unsatisfactory result in Cx ， we attempted to implant a DES 3.0 mm × 18 mm， but encountered difficulties in crossing it to Cx. Unfortunately， the stent became dislodged from the balloon and got trapped in the LM while the distal third of the stent was in the guiding catheter. To address this issue， we confined the dislodged stent by using a 2.5 mm ×15 mm balloon at the tip of GC， and then removed the entire system along with the wires . During the removal of the system， the stent fracture occurred， so we were able to extract only a small part of the stent that was inside the catheter trapped by the balloon， while with full body fluoroscopy we were unable to find the larger part of the stent. The patient remained stable without any signs or symptoms of embolization， which led us to make the decision to proceed with the PCI procedure. We performed rewiring and modified our approach to a \"culotte\" stenting technique. Following pre-dilatation with an NC2.5 mm × 15 mm balloon， we successfully implanted a DES 3.0 mm|删除段之间换行|x16 mm from the LM to Cx . Although we encountered difficulties in advancing the wire towards LAD， we managed to overcome the issue by using a hydrophilic wire. Subsequently， we performed angioplasty using an NC 3.0 mm×15 mm balloon， followed by post-dilatation using an NC 4.0 mm x 8 mm balloon.\n\n【16】Two days after the initial procedure on routine echocardiography， a hyperechogenic formation was observed in the aorta. A CT scan revealed a linear formation (possibly metal or calcium) extending from the Left Main (LM) in the ascending aorta towards the brachiocephalic trunk， without any signs of dissection . It was concluded that this could be the larger fragment of an un-implanted stent， and a decision was made to extract it percutaneously.\n\n【17】Dual access was obtained from the left radial and right brachial artery to place a 6F GC in the LM and wire the LAD and Cx arteries to prevent abrupt vessel closure. Optical Coherence Tomography(OCT) revealed a dissection at the proximal LAD without a previously implanted stent and only one stent layer in the LM， confirming that the initially implanted stent from the LM to the LAD was pulled out by the entrapped stent .\n\n【18】Using snare device distorted stent was caught in ascending aorta and brought to the right brachial artery ， this maneuver completely extracted all previously implanted stents from left coronary artery. The stent from LCx ended in right carotid artery and were further extracted using snare from left radial artery after\n\n【19】A B\n\n【20】repeated PCI . The “inverted T”stenting was employed with 3.5mmx12 mm stent implanted in Cx， followed by3.5 mm×28mm stent from LM to LAD. POT was done using 4.5 mm x8 mm NC balloon and after rewiring and angioplasty of Cx ostium with NC 3.0mm x 12 mm，“kissing\"inflation was done with 3.5 mm ×12 mm NC balloons in both arteries. The final result was good，  and patient was discharged three days after the procedure.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\nThe dislodgement of a stent can occur due to various factors，|删除段之间换行|such as extreme coronary angulation， highly calcified coronary arteries， inadequate coronary artery predilation， and direct stenting通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Despite the limited number of reports in the literature on the simultaneous removal of a dislodged stent and a previously implanted stent using a snare device， the extraction procedures predominantly targeted stents that were either recently deployed or in the process of being deployed. Conventional balloon expansion tightly secures coronary stents to the vessel wall， making unintentional removal very uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5，7-9\\]</u>. Dislodgement from the delivery system typically happens when the stent-balloon assembly is pulled back into the Guiding Catheter (GC) or when it cannot reach the target lesion due to complex anatomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Percutaneous stent retrieval can be successfully achieved using various techniques， including the small-balloon technique， double-wire technique， or loop snare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The snare technique has demonstrated its effectiveness for this purpose， although its successful implementation relies on technical proficiency and is influenced by factors such as the size， flexibility， rigidity， and compressibility of the stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our particular scenario， we encountered a situation where the stent became entrapped while attempting to navigate through the layer of the previously inserted stent. Now， the pivotal question arises： What measures could we have taken to prevent such an occurrence? We should have initially used imaging techniques to assess the amount of calcium and the true diameters of the Left Main (LM) and its branches. Although we obtained optimal angiographic results by using a 2.5 mm balloon at12 atm (2.7 mm)and implanting a stent measuring 3.5 mm x18 mm from LM to the LAD artery， we should have also utilized Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS) to evaluate stent expansion in the LM， specifically checking for under-deployment or possible strut intraluminal protrusion. When dealing with vessels adjacent to previously stented arteries， operators must exercise utmost caution. In the event of stent advancement difficulties， this issue should raise a red flag， indicating the need to address the problem promptly. Under such circumstances， it is advisable to consider under-expanding the previously implanted stent and， if possible， performing additional balloon dilation. Furthermore， maintaining proper coaxial alignment of the guiding catheter plays a vital role in successfully retrieving a stent that cannot be crossed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Stent extraction carries risks of the stent struts catching onto the endothelial layer， leading to tearing or disruption. Endothelial tearing can result in various adverse outcomes，including acute thrombosis， vessel dissection， or even perforation. Ragosta et al. meticulously documented complications in a comprehensive analysis of seventeen cases involving stent extraction. Among these cases， a total of seven reported complications， with three instances\n\n【23】A B\n\nresulting in acute vessel closure and an additional four cases resulting in vessel dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. To minimize the risk of endothelial tearing during stent extraction， several precautions should be taken. Firstly， a thorough evaluation of the stent's positioning and adherence to the vessel wall should be performed prior to the extraction attempt. This evaluation helps determine the optimal technique and tools required for safe removal. The application of OCT in the extraction of a previously implanted stent provides physicians with detailed information about the stent， the condition of the surrounding tissue，|删除段之间换行|and any potential complications. This allows for precise planning and execution of the extraction procedure， reducing the risk of complications and improving outcomes for the patient. In our case， OCT demonstrated dissection in the LAD prior to stent extraction， but there was no sign of thrombosis or impaired flow. To prevent or quickly resolve unwanted abrupt vessel closure that can occur after endothelial injury， it is important not to lose the position of the distal wire.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\nThe extraction of previously implanted stents represents a rare|删除段之间换行|complication in Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). To mitigate the risk of such events， a crucial preoperative strategy entails meticulous lesion preparation. In our specific case， we showcased the successful implementation of intricate bailout procedures， such as snare extraction of intravascular objects. Nevertheless， it is of paramount importance to exercise extreme caution when executing these procedures in proximity to， or within， previously implanted stents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Lactic acidosis although very rare is a serious complication of metformin use. It can be life-threatening with mortality as high as50% if not recognized and treated early. We report a rare case of fatal metformin poisoning due to severe lactic acidosis following a 40 yr old divorcee with primary infertility secondary to polycystic ovarian syndrome. Treatment of metformin induced lactic acidosis involves the use of renal replacement therapy， sodium bicarbonate infusion and general measures. This case was reported in order to alert physicians on the existence of this rare but life-threatening endocrine emergency. Late presentation was a major limiting factor in the management ofthis patient.\n\n【2】Keywords： Lactic acidosis； Metformin； Coma； Suicide\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Metformin， a dimethyl-biguanide， is a widely used oral anti-hyperglycemic agent used in the long-term treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)， polycystic ovarian syndrome and gestational diabetes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. As a result of its efficacy， safety， lower tendency to Hypoglycemia， cardiovascular and metabolic benefits， it has become the first drug of choice in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. It acts primarily in the liver to reduce blood glucose by decreasing glucose output and， secondarily， in the peripheral tissues mainly in the muscles by increasing glucose uptake 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Although the most common adverse effects of metformin are mainly gastrointestinal (nausea， vomiting， diarrhea and abdominal discomfort)， it also has the potential to cause lactic acidosis. Metformin associated lactic acidosis has been reported even at therapeutic doses in patients with end stage renal disease， heart failure or liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Therefore， caution must be exercised in administering such drugs in those groups of patients.\n\n【6】Studies have not shown any difference between the incidence of lactic acidosis in patients with diabetes taking metformin and those not taking metformin as reported in a meta-analysis of 194studies by Salpeter et al.， it however a recognized complication of metformin use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. We present a fatal case of metformin associated lactic acidosis where interactions with benzodiazepines and nicotine may have potentiated the condition that led to the demise of the patient.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 40-year-old divorcee diagnosed with primary infertility secondary to polycystic ovarian syndrome， being treated with metformin 1000 mg daily. She was also taking Bromazepam 3 mg daily for clinically diagnosed depression. She was referred to the emergency of our hospital after deliberately ingesting about 100 tablets of metformin (100 g) 48 h earlier in a suicide attempt. At presentation， she was deeply unconscious with GCS of 3/15 on 100% oxygen via nasal prong. She had intravenous fluid and later vasopressors. The urethral catheter was in-situ and draining less than50 ml in 12 h and RBS was 122 mg/l. Blood pressure was 70/? mmHg， pulse rate was weak， and all extremities were cold and clammy. Chest findings were wide spread coarse crackles in all lung zones.\n\n【9】No jaundice or bleeding from anybody orifice. She had about three episodes of cardiac arrest and was resuscitated.\n\n【10】Results of laboratory investigations reported a hematocrit of 19.5%， Urea of 2.1 mmol/l， creatinine of 44 mmol/l，potassium of 5.6 mmol/l， bicarbonate of 13 mmol/l， sodium of 141 mmol/l， chloride of 123 mmol/l， whole blood lactate of 16.1 mmol/l normal range (0.5 mmol/1-1mmol/l)， urine toxicology positive for benzodiazepine and cotinine.\n\n【11】Liver function tests was normal (AST 28U/L， ALT 32U/L， GGT41U/L， and ALP 169U/L). After about four hours of resuscitation， the patient was confirmed clinically death as she had unrecordable oxygen saturation， fixed and dilated pupils.\n\n【12】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【13】Lactic acidosis is a rare but life-threatening complication of metformin use and can occur at high doses of administration or at therapeutic doses in the background of end organ damage like， heart liver and kidney failure or in situations of cardiorespiratory compromise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The symptoms of lactic acidosis are non-specific， may include anorexia， nausea， vomiting， abdominal pain， lethargy， hyperventilation，and hypotension. It is clinically characterized bythe presence of pH<7.35， blood lactate levels of >2.0 and a PCO， of <42mmHg.\n\n【14】Although metformin associated lactic acidosis is a rare condition， with an estimated prevalence of one to five cases per 100，000populations， it has a reported mortality of 30% to 50% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Several studies have reported that the prognosis of individuals who develop lactic acidosis from the use of metformin is unrelated to plasma metformin concentration or lactate level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Once ingested， metformin is absorbed in the gut via the enterocytes where it is transported to the liver through the portal circulation， in the liver； it causes an increase in the production of lactate by promoting glycolysis and causing a shift from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. Metformin induced lactic acidosis develops when there is an imbalance between increased lactate production and impaired metabolism and/or reduced lactate clearance.\n\n【17】The mechanism of Metformin induced lactic acidosis is due to the impairment of the clearance of lactate via inhibition of complex1 in the mitochondrial respiratory cycle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Despite the fact that metformin is considered safer than insulin or sulphonylureas due to its lesser tendency to hypoglycemia， the mortality in biguanides(6.1%) overdosing is much higher than overdoses of insulin and sulphonylureas (0.9 and 3.6%) respectively as reported in a study by Von March et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Interactions with other drugs like alcohol， benzodiazepines and barbiturates can potentiate the risk of developing lactic acidosis. Therefore， early diagnosis and initiation of intervention in the form of renal replacement therapy is important in order to restore blood lactate levels to normal. This is largely due to the fact that metformin does not bind to plasma proteins and is excreted mainly unchanged in the urine. The index patient presented late as such she could not benefit from the renal replacement therapy.\n\nThe type of renal replacement therapy to be instituted depends the nature of the metformin intoxication. In metformin overdose， Intermittent or continuous renal replacement therapy with Hemodiafiltration is recommended. This has been attributed to the fact that the reductions in the metformin plasma levels have been found to be correlated with improvement of lactic acidosis. Extracorporeal hemodialysis is preferred provided that the patient is hemodynamically stable. Discontinuation of treatment is indicated when lactate levels are lower than 3 mmol/L and pH is higher than7.35. Hypotension should be treated with intravenous fluids and vasopressors in order to restore the circulatory status to normal. Treatment of acid base disturbances is necessary in order to restore normal cellular function resulting from alterations in the cellular concentrations of Nat and Ca+ levels due the pH disturbances. The mainstay in the treatment of acidosis is to target the underlying|删除段之间换行|cause as the use of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO，-) is controversial. In diseases where there is evidence of NaHCO.-losses， there is clear evidence ofthe benefit of replacement therapy. There are however no validated clinical studies on NaHCO，-replacement involving patients with lactic acidosis and hemodynamic instability.\n\n【19】At a certain point acidosis has a protective effect in anoxic or ischemic cell， this effect is however lost as the level of acidosis becomes severe. The indications for interfering in acidosis include pH<7.2，HCO，-<10 mmol/l， and base deficit >10 mmol/l. Mortality in metformin induced lactic acidosis can be as high as 50%， although that is lower than that of other causes of lactic acidosis (50% vs.74%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. Therefore， metformin induced lactic acidosis has a better prognosis than other causes of lactic acidosis like sepsis and circulatory failure. Benzodiazepines， when ingested alone are rarely associated with a high mortality or morbidity， but the risk of death rises exponentially when ingested with other drugs especially alcohol， opiates or other sedatives. The risk of death with benzodiazepines is largely due to the fact that they can cause apnea， a risk is highest with alprazolam 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，10\\]</u>. One of the limitations of our report is the inability to measure serum metformin levels which is not available in oiir center.\n\n【20】This case was reported in order to alert physicians and care givers on the existence of this rare butlife-threatening endocrine emergency. Early detection and institution of appropriate management measures is essential to survival. A Late presentation was a major limiting factor in the management of this patient. This is in addition to the interaction of metformin with benzodiazepines which by themselves can cause lactic acidosis and increased the risk of death of the patient. The inability to measure the serum levels and exclude sulphonyl urea is a major limitation in this study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Hypercalcemia develops in approximately 10% of the sarcoidosis patients while it has also been described in patients with other granulomatous diseases such as tuberculosis. This abnormality of calcium metabolism is caused by the dysregulated production of calcitriol by activated macrophages in the granulomatous foci of sarcoidosis. Undetected hypercalcemia may have deleterious sequela in sarcoidosis patients， especially without a previous diagnosis， such as nephrocalcinosis and renal failure. This metabolic defect may be exacerbated by sun exposure，phosphorus or vitamin D intake.\n\n【2】We present seven cases of sarcoidosis to define the clinical features of such patients who are prone to develop hypercalcemia induced by vitamin D treatment. While only two of our patients had a previously diagnosed sarcoidosis， it was detected in the others while investigating the cause of hypercalcemia. Given the rarity of hypercalcemia due to sarcoidosis and its crucial consequences， it is an imperative that the clinicians should definitely consider the possibility of sarcoidosis before commencing vitamin D treatment to their patients. The sarcoidosis features of our case series reveal the criteria required for clinicians to suspect a possible sarcoidosis disease antecedently and to determine the diagnosis before iatrogenic hypercalcemia develops.\n\n【3】Keywords： Sarcoidosis； Hypercalcemia； Vitamin D； Iatrogenic hypercalcemia\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Hypercalcemia is a relatively common clinical problem that results when the entry of calcium into the circulation exceeds the excretion of calcium into the urine or deposition in bone.

Hypercalcemia occurs in 4% to 11% of the sarcoidosis patients caused by the increased conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1，25-hydroxyvitamin D by the enzyme 25-hydroxyvitamin-D-1a-hydroxylase in the macrophages of pulmonary alveoli and granulomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5-7，18\\]</u>.\n\n【6】删除5:<u>1173.</u>\n\n【7】We report seven cases of sarcoidosis patients who presented with hypercalcemia due to prior vitamin D treatment. Hypercalcemia is a well-known metabolic feature of sarcoidosis that may lead to serious clinical consequences if undetected. In patients with a previously known or unknown sarcoidosis diagnosis， clinicians should be meticulous for hypercalcemia in regard to its significant challenges before commencing vitamin D treatment to their patients. In this case series， the clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis patients with iatrogenic hypercalcemia are investigated. Our aim is to define the clinical features of sarcoidosis patients who are prone to develop a possible iatrogenic hypercalcemia thereby to predict and prevent the occurrence of high serum calcium levels beforehand in patients with or without a previously known sarcoidosis diagnosis.\n\n【8】Case 1\n\ncited.

BAL culture was negative for infectious organisms including bacteria， fungus or mycobacteria. Histopathology of the cutaneous biopsy demonstrated non-classified granulomas in the dermis with epithelioid histiocytes and CD4+ T lymphocytes. Ophthalmologic examination revealed anterior uveitis. Final diagnosis was stage III sarcoidosis with associated hypercalcemia ocular and cutaneous involvement. Methylprednisolone 32mgwas commenced for sarcoidosis treatment.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Hypercalcemia is an uncommon medical condition that primarily occurs due to primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy associated with bone metastasis or paraneoplastic syndromes. It has also been described in granulomatous disorders such as sarcoidosis， tuberculosis， berylliosis and leprosy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation and the presence of non-classified granulomas in the involved organs， mainly the lungs， lymph nodes and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16-18\\]</u>. Hypercalcemia is detected in approximately 10% of the sarcoidosis patients due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-7\\]</u>. We present seven cases ofiatrogenic hypercalcemia due to vitamin D treatment in patients with or without a previously known sarcoidosis diagnosis.\n\n【24】The most crucial feature of these patients was the presence of sarcoidosis associated hypercalcemia that was exacerbated due to the prior vitamin D treatment commenced for osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency. The second point was the presence of advanced sarcoidosis designated as stage III in all patients. The third hallmark was the existence of three organ sarcoidosis in these cases. Following steroid treatment， the clinical course of sarcoidosis became stable while the calcium levels returning to normal in each patient. The triangulation point of these cases was the necessityto undergoa thorough evaluation in terms sarcoidosis， that may lead to iatrogenichypercalcemia， for all patients who are be treated with vitamin D since it is well-known that unnoticed or in discriminable hypercalcemia may lead to deleterious effects. As the results of our study indicate， some clinical features of sarcoidosis appear to be useful in predetermining the probability of iatrogenic hypercalcemia that may develop following vitamin D treatment in sarcoidosis patients with or without a previous known diagnosis.\n\n【25】hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Albright et al. have shown that hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria in sarcoidosis was due to the elevated levels of vitamin D 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Bell et al. have revealed that levels of 1，25-dihyroxy vitamin D was the cause for abnormal calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Since vitamin D production is substrate-dependent， the development of hypercalcemia due to vitamin Dtreatment in patients with sarcoidosis is a great possibility. It is well-known that special care is required in sarcoidosis patients who are to be supplemented with vitamin D or calcium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> and thereby close monitoring of serum calcium levels is required to prevent the occurrence ofhypercalcemia in these patients. Seven cases developed hypercalcemia due to the vitamin D treatment while only one of these had a previously diagnosed sarcoidosis in our case series. Presence of unidentified sarcoidosis in patients to be treated with vitamin D appears to be a crucial risk for iatrogenic hypercalcemia. Such a possibility should always be considered by clinicians.\n\n【26】In patients with a medical history of sarcoidosis in their background， the effects of vitamin D treatment can be easily monitored. The problem arises inpatients with a previously undiagnosed sarcoidosis when exogenous vitamin D supplementation is commenced. The deleterious outcome of high serum calcium may occur through organs such as the heart. Drawback becomes extremely crucial especially if patients are in an asymptomatic clinical profile for sarcoidosis that may lead to severe consequences if unnoticed or if a delay occurs for diagnosis. In our case series of seven patients， the greatest problem was that only two of the patients had a previously identified sarcoidosis while all of the patients were completely asymptomatic and did not even show the slightest clue relevant to sarcoidosis. The hallmark of these cases is that it may be necessary to evaluate patients for sarcoidosis before starting vitamin D treatment to avoid the serious clinical side effects of iatrogenic hypercalcemia.\n\n【27】There are some points associated with the weakness of our case series size. The first is the small sample size consisting of only seven patients. This is probably related tothelow incidence ofhypercalcemia in sarcoidosis patients. The other point is that all patients in our series were of Caucasian origin. It is well-known that sarcoidosis may exhibit many different manifestations according to race or genetic differences in terms of the clinical profile， involved organs，treatment response and disease course. Consequently， studies including a large number of patients from different races with distinct genetic characteristics are required to achieve more precise and explicit results. Whether the patients had a previous diagnosis of sarcoidosis or not， it would be extremely useful to define the clinical criteria to predict the probability of iatrogenic hypercalcemia in such cases， as only two ofthe patients had a previously identified sarcoidosis.\n\nThe important hallmark of our case series is the common features and the mutual clinical profle shared by all ofour sarcoidosis patients who developed hypercalcemia due to vitamin Dtreatment. The first is that they had advanced sarcoidosis compatible with stage III disease. Second， each subject had a chronic and persistent sarcoidosis profile that required steroid treatment. The third point was that the patients had three organ involvement including lung， eye， skin or lymph node. The fourth and perhaps the most interesting aspect of our cases was that the patients presented with atypical symptoms or with a bizarre clinical profile that were not easily to be attributed to sarcoidosis although they had stage III disease. Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis is caused by the abnormality of the calcium metabolism induced by the increased synthesis of calcitriol or vitamin D by macrophages|删除段之间换行|of the granulomatous lesions. High levels of active vitamin D due to hydroxylase activity in macrophages is the most probable cause of hypercalcemia but overproduction of bone resorbing cytokines and parathyroid-related peptide may also play a role 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-25\\]</u>. As hypercalcemia is due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages that are abundant in granulomas， patients with multiple organ involvement appear to carry a more significant risk of hypercalcemia due to the high load of granulomatous tissue. As clearly seen from our cases， the risk of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis may have arisen due to the high granuloma load due to three organ involvement. The hazard of may also be associated advanced sarcoidosis stage. The presence of these two aforementioned criteria appears to be extremely helpful to anticipate hypercalcemia in such patients. Sarcoidosis associated hypercalcemia can present with an insidious clinical picture that may cause a diagnostic challenge for the clinician and thereby requires a great suspicion for its identification. Existence of previously undiagnosed sarcoidosis should always be considered for patients for whom vitamin D treatment is to be commenced.Common clinical features of sarcoidosis patients in our case series appear to be useful in predicting or identifying the patients who carry a risk of iatrogenic hypercalcemia.\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Sarcoidosis may occur unnoticed due to its asymptomatic and insidious clinical nature. In patients with a previously diagnosed or undiagnosed sarcoidosis， clinicians should bear in mind the possibility for the existence of this disorder because vitamin D treatment may lead to significantly high serum calcium levels that may cause deleterious effects. Hypercalcemia of sarcoidosis is due to the abnormal calcium metabolism secondary to increased synthesis of calcitriol by macrophages that are abundant in granulomatous lesions or tissues. Consequently， advanced disease and triple organ involvement in sarcoidosis patients appears to carry a significant hazard for vitamin D induced hypercalcemia due to the higher burden of granulomas comprising numerous macrophages that lead to increased synthesis of calcitriol. Clinical features of sarcoidosis identified among our sarcoidosis case series can be useful to identify patients that carry a high risk of developing iatrogenic hypercalcemia who are to be treated with calcitriol whether or not they present with a prior diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Clinicians should also bear in mind that patients may be completely asymptomatic， may appear with symptoms or a clinical profile that cannot be easily predicated to sarcoidosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Cardiac anomalies are common with congenital absence ofpericardium which includes Atrial septal defect， Patent ductus arteriosus， Mitral valve disease， Tetralogy of Fallot and Sinus venosus defect. We report two cases of retrospective diagnosis of congenital absence of pericardium after Atrial septal defect device closure which masqueraded as device embolization.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Congenitalpericardial defects are rare with reported incidence of<1 in 10，000andunderestimated true prevalence due to asymptomatic and incidental diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common variant is partial absence ofpericardium mainly left sided defects (70%) followed by right sided defects (17%) and least common complete bilateral absence of pericardium (9%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Majority of the patients are asymptomatic and are diagnosed incidentally on chest radiographs or while undergoing cardiac surgery. Symptoms are often vague with chest pain， shortness of breath or palpitations and may also arise from associated cardiac anomalies. Atrial Septal Defects (ASD) are common cardiac anomaly found in congenital absence of pericardium. Transcatheter device closure of the atrial septal defect is a feasible option but may pose a dilemma regarding the position of the device post procedure due to leftward and posterior shift of the cardiac silhouette in congenital absence of the pericardium. We report two cases of ASD device closure which presented as device embolization and on further evaluation both the cases were found to have congenital absence of the pericardium.\n\n【4】Case Series\n\n【5】Case 1\n\n【6】A 4 years female came to our center with chief complaints of difficulty in breathing in the past3 years of age. She was first in birth order born out of nonconsanguineous marriage at term with normal vaginal delivery and had no postnatal complications. She had history of recurrent episodes of lower respiratory tract infections requiring hospitalizations for which cardiac consultation was advised.On examination，the patient was hemodynamically stable with systemic pressures of 111/64mmHg， respiratory rate of 30 beats per minute and SpO， of 100% on room air. On cardiovascular examination first heart sound was normal with wide and fixed splitting of second heart sound and soft mid diastolic murmur at left lower parasternal area. Chest radiograph revealed dilated right atrium and right ventricle with increased pulmonary blood flow. A 12 lead ECG showed sinus rhythm with evidence of right atrium and right ventricular volume and pressure overload.\n\nEchocardiography demonstrated large malaligned ostium secundum ASD measuring 16mm with adequate rims， enlarged Eustachian valve， dilated right atrium and right ventricle and ventricular function was normal. Transcatheter closure ofthe ASD was done with 18 mm Amplatzer Septal Occluder without any complications. Post-procedure TEE showed device in position with no residual shunt. On the next day transthoracic echocardiography showed ASD device to be embolized in Left atrium with loss of atrioventricular rim. The child was taken for surgical ASD device retrieval and defect closure. During surgery it was found that there was absence of left posterior and mediastinal pericardium with ASD device attached to the septum. On retrospective analysis of chest X-ray revealed leftward and posterior rotation of cardiac silhouette with straightening and|删除段之间换行|elongated left heart border and the space between aorta and the main pulmonary artery appeared widened Snoopy Sign. It was concluded that false presentation of device embolization was due to congenital absence of left posterior and mediastinal pericardium.\n\n【8】Case 2\n\n【9】An 8 years male child， second in birth order， full-term with no ppostnatal complications was coincidentally found to have ostium secundum atrial septal defect while evaluating for increased precordial activity. On cardiac examination first heart sound was normal， second heart sound was wide and fixed split and a short eiection systolic murmur was heard at left lower sternal border. Chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly with prominent pulmonary arteries and increased vascularity. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed moderate sized ostium secundum ASD with adequate rims and dilated right atrium and right ventricle. Child was taken for transcatheter closure of ASD which was done with 16 mm Amplatzer Septal Occluder. There were no procedural complications and child was discharged on oral antiplatelet. However， on follow-up child had complained of chest discomfort and on evaluation with ECG was normal and Echo showed stable device position with noresidual shunt and no evidence of erosion/effusion. Child was kept on follow-up. On 10 months of follow-up in view of persistent chest discomfort CT pulmonary angiography with coronary evaluation was done which showed levorotation of heart with air interposition between PA and aorta and below the heart with prominent left atrial and normal device position and normal coronaries giving the diagnosis of congenital absence of the pericardium. Retrospective evaluation of the chest X-ray showed levorotation of the heart with obscured right heart border and poor visualization of device due to its superimposition on spine and prominent LA with air seen in aortopulmonary window area in left border suggestive of absent pericardium.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\nCongenital Absence of Pericardium (CAP) is exceedingly rare cardiac anomaly which occurs due to failure of pleuropericardial membranes to fuse completely on one or both sides. Ellis classified pericardial agenesis into various subtypes namely complete or partial left sided defect， complete or partial right sided defects and diaphragmatic pericardium defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Left sided defects are the most common accounting for 70% of all the defects. Diagnosis of CAP is challenging due to asymptomatic presentation or nonspecific symptoms like atypical chest pain， palpitations， dizziness， dyspnea and trepopnea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Majority of the cases are diagnosed incidentally on chest X-ray due to levoposition of the heart and during surgery for other associated cardiac anomalies. About 30% of the CAP have associated cardiac anomalies namely atrial septal defects， patent ductus arteriosus， mitral valve disease， Tetralogy of Fallot and sinus venosus defect. Chest X-ray shows leftward shifted cardiac silhouette， elongated left heart border， cardiomegaly， radiolucency between aorta and pulmonary artery due to lung tissue also known as Snoopy heart sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. ECG demonstrates right axis deviation， right bundle branch block in V1 and poor R wave progression. Echocardiography may show right ventricular dilatation， hypermobility of heart， posterior orientation of the apex， elongated atria with widened ventricles give tear drop appearance of the heart. Echocardiography may not be diagnostic but the above finding should make clinicians aware about congenital absence of pericardium. Meanwhile cardiac|删除段之间换行|MRI remains gold standard for diagnosis of CAP with high sensitivity demonstrating the absence of preaortic pericardial recess which is present in normal hearts. Despite these advancing modalities majority of the cases often goes undiagnosed and has been diagnosed incidentally during surgery or CT angiography which was seen in our cases too. Though complete defect of the pericardium have excellent prognosis but partial absence of pericardium can lead to tricuspid regurgitation by traction of chordal structures， fatal myocardial strangulation， ischemia and sudden death requiring surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. There are literatures which mentions about the rarity of this congenital anomaly and challenges during diagnosis of this entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-5，8\\]</u>. Our cases were much different from the described case reports because none of the literatures mentions about the ASD device orientation which masqueraded as embolization due to levorotation of the heart. Surgical intervention could have been avoided in our first case as false presentation of device embolization was due to levorotation of the heart seen in congenital absence of pericardium. Similarly in the second case persistent chest discomfort and device orientation in chest X-ray and echocardiography could unnecessarily lead to surgical intervention in the child for device retrieval and defect closure if diagnosis of CAP was not made. In both the cases suspicion of device embolization led to further workup and diagnosis of congenital absence of pericardium was made which would have been missed otherwise.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】This case emphasizes that clinicians should be aware that ASD device embolization can sometimes be a false presentation due to levorotation of the heart. These features may clinch diagnosis for congenital absence of pericardium and clinicians should retrospectively analyze imaging modalities for presence of congenital absence of pericardium.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Despite treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam he developed signs of sepsis accompanied by chest pain and orthopnea. The echocardiogram revealed a significant pericardial effusion (end-diastolic echo free space： 2.2 cm) ， located mainly at the posterior and lateral wall of the left and at the free wall of the right ventricle， so colchicine and intravenous methylprednisolone were initiated. Because of deterioration in his clinical status and incipient tamponade signs an echo-guided pericardiocentesis was attempted. The fluid had high viscosity， a yellow-brown color and a curd-like appearance， resembling pus . A pig-tail catheter was inserted into the pericardium and used for drainage of the fluid； however there was no free flow， so aspiration was only possible with the use ofsyringes. Thorax and abdomen CT scans were performed to verify catheter’s correct intrapericardiac position and to exclude an extracardiac site of infection， (Supplementary Video of the CT scan). The analysis of the fluid confirmed it as pus and both blood and fluid cultures were positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiogram-guided， treatment with oxacillin resulted in severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia thus substituted by ceftriaxone.

{"seq_id": "04d79bcf-eccf-41b4-a683-e4abbf1c8f98", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Telemedicine can provide adequate medical assistance for physically distant patients utilizing the joint adoption of Information and Communication Technologies. Telemedicine is the set of techniques and tools for health monitoring and cares implemented through systems providing rapid access to both specialists and patients， regardless of where they are located respectively. We live in the age of communication， and we have long had the problem of how to improve health in health systems. Telemedicine seems to be a viable alternative in order to eliminate the gap between human and economic resources. Due to its characteristics， it can contribute to improving access to specialized healthcare and the quality of life of people， especially in populations lacking qualified personnel， in remote or difficult access areas or patients with chronic diseases， by reducing long waiting lists and high costs for the health systems. While the telemedicine projects between different countries are developing more and more， the inherent ethical and legal problems are emerging at the same time. This article refers to telemedicine as a broad concept， including several types of distance medicine， thus identifying its strengths and weaknesses that will be the primary purpose of the medical-legal aspects. We will also describe its application in the ophthalmological field and the main issues raised by its implementation.\n\n【2】Keywords： Telemedicine； Ophthalmology； Medical Ethics； E-Health； Telecare\n\n【3】Telemedicine\n\nTelemedicine is， according to the Commission of the European Communities， the provision of welfare services by using Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in situations where the health professional and the patient (or two professionals) are not in the same location. It involves the reliable transmission of medical information and data thanks to texts， sounds， and images necessary for the prevention， diagnosis， treatment， and subsequent monitoring of patients通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Telemedicine has numerous benefits for doctors， medical institutions， and patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In this way， it plays a pivotal role in the development of medicine and the provision of health care in the world. Telemedicine allows remote group collaboration between health professionals in different places， even from different countries. It is useful for real-time interaction among the participants without a time interval between interventions. Professionals in distant positions can communicate， thus improving the quality of health services. The continuous flow of communication among health professionals is necessary due to the increasing complexity of medicine that prompts the doctors to consult with colleagues or experts in a particular issue or to need a second opinion. All thesebehaviors are considered good medical practice (considering that they will not delay an urgent procedure nor constitute a defensive medicine)， and the absence of such contacts may be considered as lack of interest and attention by the doctor. On the otherhand， today patients， who are aware of their rights and attentive to the risk of medical errors， also seek a second opinion， sometimes from doctors who have never really met， by using the telephone， the mail or even a website. In the perspective ofhealth institutions， telemedicine opens up the possibility of expanding the spectrum of available medical services， thus increasing the chances of earning and saving. Furthermore， it can be quite convenient for the patients themselves. Telemedicine facilitates direct patient access to a distant doctor， without requiring the movement of any of the participants and allowing access to some forms of medical care that would otherwise not be available. Telemedicine can be an important tool in cases where geographical distance hinders access to health care， in particular， specialized healthcare， such as in many rural areas or in developing countries with the lack of health infrastructures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-6\\]</u>. Medical treatment in these scenarios would require long journeys， not always possible and usually rather|删除段之间换行|expensive， time-consuming and exhausting both for doctors and patients. Therefore，patients in this situation do not access to adequate health care. Telemedicine can also be a potentially very useful tool in preventive medicine， providing patients with useful information on their health conditions. It can be used for the monitoring of chronic conditions such as diabetic retinopathy， glaucoma， age-related macular degeneration， etc. that are growing public health problems due to the increasing life expectancy and elderly population. These diseases are also increasing in the young population. By means of telemedicine， we do not need to visit the patient in the hospital setting， but we use a telemonitoring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> thus avoiding long waiting lists. Moreover， it is convenient to reduce hospitalization and health care costs. Telemedicine also has enormous potential as regards the electronic prescription in order to avoid errors， such as mistakes in the tax code， the patient's age or the dosage， consequently to incomprehensible calligraphy of the doctor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The improvement of healthcare is the advantage of telemedicine. This goal materializes by means of the patient health education， the technical education of health workers by using the new e-learning technologies， and the ease of accessing a second opinion from a specialist， particularly important for people in rural areas or those who suffer from rare diseases. Notwithstanding all these advantages， telemedicine is not present in Europe. The difficulties of application are the huge costs of a telemedicine service， the difficult interoperability of technical infrastructures across countries， the privacy of health data， the lack of specific ethical standards and regulations for telemedicine， the doubts for healthcare professionals about their responsibility， and the uncertainties of the legal framework all over the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Telemedicine and Ophthalm ology\n\n【6】Telemedicinehas multipleapplications in ophthalmology because it needs visual images for the screening， diagnosis， therapy， and monitoring of the diseases. It is not surprising that ophthalmology has been so quickly adapted to changes in the cybernetic world and that it uses the telemedicine technologic system in order to access to advanced healthcare. Its practical use has shown clinical， economic， and public health benefits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，11\\]</u>. For example， its use in two important pathologies， such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP)， shows how telemedicine can improve access to high-quality health care in these and other ophthalmological diseases. Although effective treatments for high-risk DR exist for over four decades， DR remains a major cause of blindness among adults of working age. The telemonitoring of DR is now one of the helpful specific applications of the telemedicine.\n\n【7】On the other hand， the inability of half of the population to timely access the exams has contributed to the increase of diabetes. The telemedicine programs provide access to the annual screening of DR patients through patient imaging in a setting of primary assistance. These programs have improved clinical outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12，13\\]</u>.\n\nConsequently， the spreading of the ophthalmological programs into the medical system would probably result in a suitable timing in eye care in the proportion of patients who did not access to retinal screening or eye tests with the appropriate frequency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Image-based diagnosis and telemedicine have proven to be reliable， accurate， and cost-effective for ROP and improve access to eye care for premature babies at high risk for ROP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>. The diagnosis and treatment ofROP are essential for successful results. There are doctors experienced in indirect ophthalmoscopy and trained in screening for ROP that can provide care for low birth weight infants. Telemedicine|删除段之间换行|offers an interesting alternative， especially in the most remote areas.\n\n【9】Furthermore， imaging could improve the documentation of the retinal fundus. In this sense， telemedicine can successfully improve and extend ophthalmologic care using imaging technology. Other areas of telemedicine in ophthalmology are intraocular pressure monitoring， optic nerve analysis， macular disease monitoring， visual field analysis， and anterior segment diagnosis. Furthermore， the ability to perform remote consultations and examinations， instead of face-to-face， is gaining ground thanks to improved two-way communication technologies in emerging clinical institutions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【10】The Legal Framework of Telemedicine\n\n【11】As a health service， telemedicine is included in the scope of articles 56 and 57 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)； therefore， it is a service， and it is subject to the general freedom concerning the free movement of services. Nonetheless， this is not the only set of rules applicable to telemedicine within the European legal system. In fact， within the framework of European law， telemedicine is both a health service and an information service(a service normally provided for a fee， at a distance and electronically at individual request). Therefore， both regulations are applicable：those relating to health care and those relating to information society services 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\nAs far as information and telecommunications are concerned， we must take into consideration the following documents： Directive95/46/EU 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， the Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>， Directive 98/34/EC， the Information Society Services Directive通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>， Directive 2000/31/EC， directive on electronic commerce 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>， Directive 2002/58/EC and the directive on privacy and electronic communication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. About health services， the most relevant result for regulating this sector is Directive 2011/24/EU on the so-called cross-border directive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Furthermore， the European Union (EU) has developed an important series of initiatives over the years in order to increase the use of telemedicine in Europe. These initiatives aim to transform telemedicine into a standard medical service， accessible to all European patients and fully covered bythe respective social security system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. The EU's efforts are also quite economically significant， as the EU has invested over E 500 million in research funding on the development of eHealth instruments. However， the undeniable value of telemedicine should not hide its many difficulties， some of which are also present in traditional medicine， but which assume a new complexity within telemedicine. For example， when health workers from different countries and different languages collaborate， there is no consensus on language to use for data recording in the patient's medical record or who is responsible for providing technical training (the so-called e-literacy) to health professionals using new communication technologies. All electronic health records (EHRs) need to integrate into a global eHealth infrastructure that is accessible from every point in the EU. Despite several working documents and position papers issued by the European institutions， we still lack a uniform set of rules to regulate telemedicine in Europe. Most of the regulatory competences in these areas still depend on the Member States， retaining the best skills in health care and medicine. However， the problem is that the approach to telemedicine varies immensely among European countries， including the perspective chosen to regulate telemedicine： some states have approached telemedicine from the point of view of the laws in the field of ICT technologies， while other laws regard the health care domain or even the social security field. Therefore， even at the national level， there are legal|删除段之间换行|voids that threaten the practice of telemedicine，leaving unprotected patients and health workers删除4:<u> 271</u>.\n\n【13】The General Data Protection Regulation(GDPR)：Privacy in Health\n\nPublished in the European Official Journal on 4 May 2016， it entered into force on 24 May 2016， but its implementation took place after two years， therefore starting from 25 May删除4:<u> 2018</u>. Regulation2016/679 is European legislation about data protection. Since it is a regulation， it does not need for transposition by the Member States of the Union and will spread in the same way in all the States of the Union without margins of freedom in adaptation. Its purpose is the definitive harmonization of the regulation on the protection of personal data within the EU. With the Lisbon treaty， the protection of personal data has become a fundamental right of citizens， and therefore to be guaranteed in the same way throughout the territory of the union. By increasing citizens trust in the digital society， thanks to the more stringent protection， the regulation is functional to the digital development of the EU and safeguards the free movement of personal data. With the European regulation， we move from a proprietary vision of the datum (not treatable without consent) to a vision of control of the data that favors the free circulation， at the same time strengthening the rights of the interested party. There is a fundamental right of patients to the confidentiality of their information and medical records. Patient privacy should be observed unless it is revoked (i.e.， informed， non-coercive) in rare cases in which it neutralizes the public interest. The information disclosed should be limited to such information or part of the medical record. Telemedicine creates specialproblems due to the involvement ofnon-clinical staff in teleconsultations，and the vulnerability oftransmission lines to security breaches. Legislation and guidelines do not apply to anonymous information stripped of all attributes that can identify the owner. This simple distinction between the two types of information apparently is not so clear in practice. The processing of health data is subject to a specific discipline. It is carried out by healthcare professionals (excluding orthopedists， dental hygienists， nurses， obstetricians， physiotherapists， and speech therapists)， and public health organizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The confidentiality needs to guarantee for citizens in health facilities， and the health data relating to them. Health data are data subject to special treatment， as it can reveal very intimate details ofthe person，and，for this reason，there is a generalprohibition of dissemination， as well as enhanced protection， of such data (Article4 GDPR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Health data is all that personal information suitable to reveal a person's state of health and body and mental conditions. Genetic data and photographs taken for surgical interventions or controls are also health data. Furthermore， as established by the Court of Cassation (Civil Cassation， United Sections， judgment 12.27.2017， number 30981)， sensitive data suitable to reveal the state of health must be treated with organizational methods to protect them， such as encryption thus making the data subject unidentifiable. The European regulation provides that health data can be used only for purposes related to health (treatment purposes)， for the supervision of the National Health System and research in the public interest. These purposes allow the possibility to introduce special conditions or additional limits for treatment. In this sense， the Italian legislator has provided， with the new Privacy Code， further measures to protect health dataset by the national control authority and reviewed every two years. The article 9 (letter h) of the GDPR does not provide the consent of data processing for purposes of preventive medicine or occupational medicine， such as assessment of the employees ability|删除段之间换行|to work， diagnosis， assistance， management of health， on the basis of Union or Member State law or in accordance with the health professional contract. However， the rule allows the Member States to maintain or introduce additional conditions， including limitations concerning the processing of genetic data， biometric data， or health data. The Italian legislator， with the decree to update the Privacy Code， has introduced the possibility that the Guarantor imposes specific guarantee measures (additional to the normal security measures) for the treatment of health data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. The directive 680of 2016 is similar to the GDPR. Many of the rules contained are similar or equivalent to those of the new European regulation on privacy and personal data. They have a specific scope of application and concern the processing carried out by the competent authorities for prevention， investigation，detection，and prosecution of offenses， execution of criminal penalties， safeguarding and preventing threats to public security. This directive expresses the need to keep the data for the time necessary to achieve the purposes and to review the data to verify the need for storage or deletion after the deadline. About the safety of the treatment， the appointment of the data protection officer is also obligatory for the judicial authority thanks to the assistance that this figure can provide in the management of complex treatments and sensitive data. As regards the violation of the new rules， the text provides for administrative sanctions against violations concerning the methods of processing and introduces penal sanctions for the treatment operated with illegitimate purposes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【15】The Informed Consent\n\nBefore proceeding with data collection， it is necessary to provide the information to the patient (if necessary， it is possible to provide orally even if it is preferably written). The document indicates the subject collecting data， the purposes of the treatment， the methods of treatment， the mandatory or optional nature of the provision of data， the subjects or the categories of subjects to whom the data can be communicated， the identification details of the holder， and the methods for exercising the rights to protect your data. The Italian Ophthalmological Society has elaborated， in addition to the Guidelines， the Informed Consent Forms that regulate and define the criteria for the development of the main activities of the ophthalmologist. Informed consent is the tool through which information is disposable for the patient about the intervention and is gathered his consent to proceed. Therefore，it presupposes two distinct moments： information and then the actual consent. The Informed Consent consists of documentation： the specific information sheet of the intervention about the execution procedure， the post-treatment， advantages， disadvantages， risks， and complications. The Act of Consent remains the same for all the information sheets and does not need any specificity linked to the treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The article 1， in compliance with the principles， set out in articles 2， 13 and 32 of the Law 219/2017 of the Constitution， states that no medical treatment starts or continues without the free and informed consent of the interested person， except in cases expressly provided by law 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. However， the possibility of carrying out the treatment according to the public interest remains (for example， data processed to allow the study of a disease in order to treat other people). The Italian legal system provides for the freedom of choice of the place of care (article32 ofthe Constitution and Legislative Decree 502/92) and the freedom to undergo treatment or not (Article 1 of Law 219/2017). According to the GDPR， once the city has decided to undergo treatment， they cannot refuse consent to the processing of data for treatment and diagnosis purposes. The digital preservation process aims to make|删除段之间换行|a document usable over time in all its integrity and authenticity， in its \"digital essence\" and in full compliance with the new privacy regulation (European Regulation 679 on protecting personal data)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The Digital Administration Code asserts that the Information Technology (IT) document and its processing are valid and relevant for the law and recognizes the equivalence between a computerized and paper document. Decree of the President of the Council of Ministers of the Italian Republic (DPCM) of 13 November 2014 sets the technical rules for the formation of the IT document. DPCM of 3 December 2013 preceded it， published in the Official Gazette number 59 of 12 March 2014 and related to managing IT documents and their preservation. The technical rules on preservation introduce adaptation to international standards and national standards 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31，32\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The Electronic Sanitary File (ESF)\n\n【18】The ESF， provided by article 12 oflegislative decree 179/2012， is an IT tool that combines data and documents (digital or digitized) of health and social-health type related to the patients. Its function is to share such data and the patient's medical history among various doctors or health organizations. In addition to the patient (with safe modes， e.g.， smart card)， the ESF can access doctors and authorized healthcare personnel. Since the article 12 of Decree-Law 179/2012 is active， the inclusion of data within the ESF depends on the consent of the patient (article 3 bis). In this regard， you know about who has access to your data and how these data are used. The consent to the formation of the ESF is of course， quite distinct from the treatment. The lack of consent to the establishment of the ESF or the insertion of some data in the file cannot preclude the possibility of using the treatment. The patient has the right to revoke the consent and to obscure some specific data from the ESF. Although mobile electronic medical records are beneficial， several factors contribute to their not full potential use. Training in functionality and reliable infrastructures might foster tablet implementation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. The European Union of Medical Specialists (EUMS) has published a document that contains the \"European Definition of Medical Act.\" This definition， adopted for the first time in 2005， was later amended in 2006 and finally in the Brussels meeting of 25 April删除4:<u> 2009</u>. This is the approved version： \"The medical act covers all professional activities， for example of scientific， teaching， training， educational， organizational， clinical and medical technology，carried out in order to promote health， prevent diseases， make diagnoses and prescribe therapeutic treatments or rehabilitative treatments for patients， individuals， groups or communities， in the framework of ethical and deontological rules. The medical act is a responsibility of the qualified physician； it must be performed by the doctor or under his direct supervision andprescription.\" Patients who disclosepersonal information to their physicians must be able to trust them in order to protect the same information against other incidents to the treatment process. In this sense， there is no distinction between traditional medicine and telemedicine. The duty of confidentiality applies to all information provided to a tele-consulting doctor by a third party that may be a healthcare professional， aware ofthe patient-doctor relationship and under the same obligation of confidentiality\\[34.\n\n【19】The Information Disclosure Consent\n\nMost patients understand that the primary physician responsible for their case will need to ensure that all team members have the information to fulfill their professional roles in the care process. When patients consent to the disclosure of information about them， it is necessary to ensure that they understand the reasons for|删除段之间换行|disclosure. It is necessary to ensure that the patients are informed whenever information about them is likely to be disclosed to others involved in their health care and that they have the opportunity to retain information. If the doctor decides to divulge confidential information， he must be ready to explain and justify his decision. Because of the need to inform members of the support team， the law assumes the patient's implicit consent to disclose information to them. A final point concerns the circumstances in which the doctor or other authorities can cancel the patient's refusal to disclose. These circumstances arise when medical conditions ofa patient pose a severe threat to the community in general. Health status data are visible to third parties， such as relatives， family members， voluntary personnel， after the patient， if conscious， has been informed and allowed. In any case， it is necessary to respect the request of the person hospitalized to not make known even to the legitimate third parties his presence in the health facility or information on his health conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. The issue of the access right to the patient's medical record obviously binds to the more general right of access to administrative documents(governed by the article 22 and following Law 241/1990) and to the treatment of personal health data according to the code about personal data protection referred to legislative decree number 196/2003. The public medical record is subject to the productivity of incident effects on subjective legal situations of public relevance . Theprevailing doctrine attributes juridical relevance to the medical record， as it is the only instrument capable of processing patient care information to allow communication between the various health care workers. The doctor， in charge of compilation， is a public official pursuant to article357 of the penal code， while the person responsible for the storage and good keeping is always the head of the department where the patient is undergoing treatment. The doctor has required a particular accuracy in writing all elements in the medical record： diagnosis， therapy，outcomes， etc. according to the article 24 of the Decree of the Minister of Health of 5 August 1977 and arranged according to the procedures set forth in article 26 ofthe Code of Medical Deontology. The medical record together with the related reports needs indefinite preservation， as it is an official act essential to ensure the certainty of clinical data， as well as being a valuable source of documentation for research of historical health data. In this panorama， the question of limits on access to third parties to the information contained in the medical record belonging to another subject has legal importance通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The Network and Inform ation Security(NIS) Directive for Health Data Protection\n\nSeveral devices are useful for remote communication， such as video conferencing unit， e-mail， webcam， Smartphone， etc. The channel to allow communication is variable (broadband， network， wireless). The legal perspective of confidentiality focuses on the relationship between the subjects involved rather than on the systems by which they communicate， but we must pay attention to this last aspect. We consider the NIS directive as the first step in the European cyber security strategy. Approved by the EU Parliament on 6 July 2016， the directive aims to reinforce the security and IT resilience within the Old Continent. The need for NIS directive starts from a consideration： networks， systems， and information services play a vital role in today society. Without them， the internal market could not work， so it is essential for their reliability and security for economic and social activities. The NIS applies to two categories： the operators of essential services that are necessary to the maintenance|删除段之间换行|of basic social and economic activities (such as health， transport and energy companies)， and the digital service operators such as search engines， e-commerce platforms， etc. Both of them need to adopt appropriate technical and organizational measures to manage risks and prevent IT incidents. In the event of default， very severe penalties will be present， ranging from a minimum of 12 thousand up to 150thousand Euros. In this regard， it is necessary， at the national level，the designation of an intervention group for cyber security in the event of an accident and national authority responsible for the security of networks and information systems. Furthermore， the NIS establishes the cooperation group composed of representatives of the Member States， the Commission and the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)， a team to promote collaboration between the countries of the Union in relation to the security of networks and information systems in order to facilitate the information exchange. The two regulations， i.e.， the GDPR and the NIS directive， overlap when an IT security incident involves violation of personal data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.\n\n【23】ElectronicIdentification Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS)\n\n【24】The eIDAS is the European regulation governing electronic signatures， moneyytransfers，andotherrtypes of electronic transactions in the European single market. It has allowed the creation of standards for electronic signatures， digital certificates and other forms of electronic authentication， thus allowing for the replacement of paper documents with digital equivalents that have the same legal value and official recognition in all EU countries. The member countries of the EU are required to recognize electronic signatures that meet the standards set by eIDAS. In particular， it distinguishes three types of signatures inherent sensitive data. The director adheres with local， state， federal and international guidelines for the acquisition of health information， transmission and storage of data by interfacing with electronic medical records and widely available archiving and communication systems， preferably using standards-based interoperability protocols. Imaging performance and diagnostic acquisition devices in ophthalmology should follow periodic manufacturer's recommendations. Diagnostic displays need for periodic checking and recalibration for normal function. The security， integrity， and availability of data (including backup and archiving) are the tasks ofthe IT staff. The setting， i.e.， a medical office， urgent care， emergency or community health care center， should be able to monitor the vital parameters of the test， to make a detailed medical history review， to conduct and transmit telemedicine for ophthalmological examination and to organize appropriate follow-up and care. Telemedicine exams will have different space requirements based on their use of synchronous technology or asynchronous technology. Synchronous visits require space for the patient， the local provider， and the remote provider to conduct the exam in private and discuss the results. Synchronous visits typically require audio and video equipment， a computer to transmit the necessary information about the exam and the devices and technologies to conduct a remote eye examination. Asynchronous visits require space for the necessary imaging equipment， other devices used， and space for the preparation and presentation of images and data. Generally， a small space within an existing clinical space is adequate for telemedicine examinations and consultations. There are few normative indications concerning the personnel who acquire， transmit， and interpret the data of telemedicine.\n\nEach member of the team has the necessary qualifications|删除段之间换行|established by the program. An activity-based (or \"function-based\") assessment of staff requirements is necessary. The reading method for image analysis should be transparent to the applicant. The reading center is responsible for reading errors. The basic requirements for staff involved in ophthalmology telemedicine in a remote imaging site are diagnostic equipment， the awareness of the risks and the clinical estimation of ocular complications due to pupillary dilatation(if imaging is under the mydriatic eyewash)， universal precautions， antiseptic technique， and informed consent. Training for safe and correct contact with patients in a clinical setting， as indicated by applicable hospital and facility standards， is necessary. They are training on specific devices and equipment to obtain the necessary certifications and adherenceto the quality control for the instruments are essential. The ophthalmologists who work as a distant doctor should receive initial training and periodic re-evaluation to meet quality standards for the activities performed. The doctor who reads the test must confirm the coverage of responsibility for medical negligence for this activity by the insurer. An expert reader， under the supervision of the physician， bases the current ophthalmology telemedicine on a store-and-forward model with image acquisition for subsequent evaluation. The most recent applications may involve home-based tests with transmission and web-based interactions by the patient 37\\].\n\n【26】删除3:<u>Network Access，Data Transmission，Health Internet (Hi)-Ethics in Telemedicine</u>\n\n【27】Telemedicine relies heavily on the video and audio transmission of data through telecommunications networks. Secure accesses to the network and data transmission are essential for the confidentiality of personal and medical data. The promise of this network is that patient information will be electronically available to authorized personnel wherever the patient is， or information is necessary. The access needs of at least one authentication check (password). The checks ensure that access is available only for authorized users. An appointed individual is responsible for the security of a connected system. All network workers are aware of their responsibilities. All the incidents threating the security are under control. The most obvious way to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to computer data on the Internet is to control traffic through the interface between the local network and the external Internet. This is a function of a firewall. It is important to know that they cannot protect themselves from the traffic that does not cross them. There are different types of firewalls such as the network-wide firewall using a router to make decisions， i.e. what to pass or block based on network protocols， usually Internet Protocol (IP) addresses， an application layer that is a system including a Personal Computer (PC) with two ports (one for entry and the other one for outgoing traffic). A firewall is a mean of ensuring that only the right traffic passes through.\n\n【28】Telemedicine includes four main areas：\n\n【29】Live Drsynchronous aaudio-video telemedicine，一i.e bi-directional real time communication between a patient and a healthcareproviderusinggaudiovisual telecommunication technologies and data collection.\n\nStore-and-forward or asynchronous telemedicine (freely translatable as \"store and return\")， i.e. electronic transmission of health data (images， text or other digital data) to a healthcare provider for the evaluation and provision of the service using methods other than real-time interaction with the patient； it is a technique in which|删除段之间换行|an information， subdivided into packets in its path between the single stations (or nodes) of the network， must be totally received， before it can be retransmitted.\n\n【31】Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM)， i.e. collection of health data directly from the patient， usually during the normal activities of daily life， transmitted to a healthcare provider for analysis and possible actions.\n\n【32】Mobile Health： health care， patient communication and training based on mobile communication platforms， e.g. mobile phones， tablets， PCs，etc.\n\n【33】Encryption is， therefore， a great help to protect telemedicine transmission. There are two types of encryption algorithms. With secret key encryption， the sender and recipient both use the same key to lock and unlock the message. On the contrary， with public-key cryptography， each user has two unique keys， i.e.， a public key and a private key. In private， the key is useful to encrypt any message sent as a digital signature. The recipient can decrypt the signature with the public key to verify the identity and authenticity of the message. The power of digital signatures is that they also detect very slight changes in a message. Informed users naturally expect that the clinical information on the internet is high quality， accurate， timely， and evidence-based. Digital native users have less critical faculties. They are readily aware of the validity of what they read on the internet. Several organizations have tried to establish these principles in guidelines or codes of ethical practice for the construction of Internet sites. The Hi-Ethics consortium is a voluntary group aiming to join the websites and the most used health information providers whose goal is to gain consumer confidence in internet health services. The goals of Hi-Ethics are to offer internet services that reflect ethical and high-quality standards， to provide reliable and up-to-date health information， to keep private and secure personal information and to take special precautions for personal health information. The Hi-Ethics allows consumers to distinguish online health services following these principles from those that do not 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>.\n\n【34】TelemedicalEquipmentand Operational Risks\n\nThere are two broad categories of equipment used in telemedicine for the ophthalmology program： information acquisition devices(camera，coherent optical tomography，tonometer，auto refractometer， campimeter， etc.)， image communication devices (computers， servers， network devices， etc.) to send data. The remarkable technological development of biomedical equipment for therapeutic， rehabilitative and diagnostic use has certainly brought great benefits， but it has created， in the health structures， particular problems for the protection ofpersonnel， patients and health workers， mostly from electronic risks. Before using any biomedical equipment， make sure it has undergone regular acceptance testing and that the operators have received adequate and specific training on its correct use. For a long time， the CEI EN 60601-1 standard has been the reference for manufacturers and users of electro-medical devices for the diagnosis and treatment of patients. The international work of adaptation of the norm in these last years， after some modifications published in1991 and 1995， has led to the publication of the third edition in 2006in which the concept of safety has been expanded to include the aspect of the essential performance of electromedical equipment. The experience also extends to the legal aspects of telemedical equipment. The basis of this legislative framework is the Consumer Protection|删除段之间换行|Act of 1987 dealing with the general responsibility for artisanal products and applied to the teleconsultations equipment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. The regulations apply to Computed Tomography (CT) scanners， X-rays， ultrasounds， etc. All these devices (including new videoconferences and related equipment) must show the European Conformity (CE) mark indicating that they comply with the appropriate safety， quality， and performance standards. The Medical Devices Agency (MDA) is also responsible for registering the manufacturer and reporting incidents， as well as for the general implementation and promotion of European directives. MDA has identified the repeated causes of adverse incidents with medical devices such as poor quality， outdated or worn-out devices， and incompatibility with auxiliary equipment， poor documentation， inappropriate use， inadequate training， maintenance errors or lack of assistance. These comments mainly refer to the malfunctions of the operational equipment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Several devices are useful to communicate remotely， such as a video conferencing unit， e-mail， webcam， or Smartphone. The channel allowing communication can be broadband， network， or wireless. The operational risks are those identified by the MDA as the main causes of adverse accidents. The analysis of these cases shows that they fall into two categories： inadequacies due to technology and those due to insufficient staff. We can distinguish four main technological risks involving：\n\n【36】The image quality： a patient has the right to expect that a consultant can draw the same correct conclusions from an image on a telemedicine screen as from a conventional face-to-face visit， particularly important for Ophthalmology surveys.\n\n【37】The lack of suitable equipment for a health service.\n\n【38】Malfunctioning equipment：thebreakdown of the computer or video equipment is unfortunately one of the most common features of telemedicine.\n\n【39】Inadequate guidelines： Guidelines are as a bridge between technology and participants in teleconsulting. The guidelines determine the teleconsultation process and the documentation provides an archive of therapy， prescriptions， dosages of drugs， plans，etc. This combination of protocol and recording of the action provides a powerful audit trail that can have considerable value in any legal dispute.\n\n【40】In Italy， the Directorate General for Medical Devices and the Pharmaceutical Service is responsible for the completion and implementation of the regulation of medical devices， including tasks related to market surveillance， accident monitoring， clinical investigations， and evaluation of technologies and address of Health Technology Assessment (HTA) activities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. As regards the operational risks due to the staff， the Commission refers to the definition of \"healthcare professionals\" as defined in the article 3/f of the Directive 2011/24/EU 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Healthcare professional is the doctor， the nurse responsible for the general care， the dentist， the midwife， or the pharmacist according to the Directive 2005/36/EC. We have principles to ensure that each team member is aware of his responsibilities and those of the other members. The patient should alsoknow who is responsible forhis care. These are simpleprecautions to avoid complaints of negligence. Telemedicine has sensitizedpeople on issues that underline legislative discrepancy about the problem of accreditation and qualifications of health staff to protect the patient from incompetent professionals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41，42\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Discussion\n\n【42】The benefits of telemedicine are promising and， mainly， in ophthalmology， that is a specialization based on diagnostic imaging. The application of telemedicine is useful for patients， for ophthalmologists and health institutions as it allows access to medical care，it avoids unnecessarylong movements，and it increasestheprofits by reaching patients， by expanding the spectrum of available services and by reducing health care costs and waiting lists. Telemedicine in ophthalmology allows collaboration between professionals from different locations， sometimes even from different countries. It simplifies， through different telecommunications channels and mobile technologies， direct patient access to ophthalmologists who practice in another city or country without requiring any of the participants to travel. However， some characteristics of telemedicine can become problematic， such as the violation of privacy， the physical distance， the inclusion of new technological methods， the purchase of expensive equipment， the weakening of the doctor/patient relationship， the involuntary increase in opportunities for incorrect behavior， the delegation of functions due to the remote nature of the treatment process， etc. Health professionals should consider that telemedicine could lead them to face further potential medical errors within a substantially more challenging standard of care. The EU has not yet issued specific rules on medical liability， despite its specific features， and this gap can jeopardize the development of telemedicine inEurope， thus denying all its benefits to European patients. However， the EU will not be able to create a uniform regulation covering all aspects of telemedicine， but it has already taken a step forward in terms of technology and privacy， which are already well-defined topics under European law. As regards the rights of patients in the field of telemedicine， the EU will be able to create some basic guidelines in the context of cross-border healthcare patients rights. The rights of European patients still lack a set of uniform rules and the standardization in such a complex area as telemedicine； perhaps it would not be the best choice. We cannot expect harmonized rules for the medical responsibility deriving from telemedicine. Member States have very different national laws to address these issues because the EU brings together models of continental law and common law models. Because of this intrinsic difference， the attempt to harmonize civil liability， especially criminal liability， will be doomed to fail. It would be the scope for each Member State to provide a legal framework for telemedicine， while the role of the EU would be limited to requiring the Member States to regulate it. Most of the legal issues we have considered so fartend to fall into two well-defined categories：problems that have a frequent basis with conventional medicine and those that are specific to telemedicine.\n\nWhen telemedicine takes place across national borders， or in Europe， there is likely to be even more opportunity for legal discord on which laws to apply； i.e.， the laws of the country where the telepatient is present or of the country where the teleconsultation took place. What happens if telemedicine is legal to practice in one country but is not in another? We need to confirm a telemedicine task force in ophthalmology involving the academic and research world by using excellent resources， and collaboration between the Italian Ophthalmology Society， the Italian Association of Doctors Ophthalmologists and the Society of Legal Medicine in Ophthalmology to establish the legislation and guidelines of the telemedicine. Thehealth manager or health director oftelemedicine is necessary to avoid the delegation of care to less qualified subordinates and to establish their competences and responsibilities. Telemedicine|删除段之间换行|is not a defined discipline to justify the professional accreditation of \"Ophthalmologist Specialist in Telemedicine.\" Tele-education or eLearning should become a standardized process with certification requirement as well as continuous courses are necessary to spread the current European legislation in telemedicine both at the Ministry of Health and Medical Orders levels in all Italian regions.

He had a history of thymoma with thymectomy (histology：minimally invasive thymoma) two years ago， and had been stable without recurrence. Upon arrival to the medical ward， he developed two episodes of generalized tonic clonic seizures. His urgent plain CT brain showed a 2.5 cm right parietal lobe round lesion with perilesional edema， which was rim enhancing on contrast scan. Urgent MRI brain favored cerebral abscess. Patient was started on phenytoin， intravenous ampicillin， metronidazole and ceftriaxone. Emergency craniotomy was performed. Brain biopsy confirmed herpes encephalitis. CSF was positive for herpes simplex virus2 PCR. He was given 5 weeks of intravenous acyclovir， guided by CSF viral PCR， white cell and protein level .\n\n【17】Why is Underlying Immunodeficiency Suspected?\n\n【18】As HSV2 is a rare cause of adult-onset herpes encephalitis (over 90% being HSV1 infection通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>)， it raised suspicion on the patient’s immunity. In addition， he was found to have multiple pathogens in current admission as well as a past history ofrecurrent infections .\n\n【19】Features of Good Syndrome\n\n【20】Based on the compatible immunological profile and history of thymoma， the diagnosis of Good Syndrome， i.e. thymoma with immunodeficiency， was established. It is a rare condition and is associated with poor prognosis (one study found mortality of 41% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>). It is characterized by a combined B cell and T cell deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. The classical immunological features compose of hypogammaglobulinemia， reduced B cells， reduced CD4 T cell， abnormal CD4 to CD8 ratio 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. The most common cause of infection is sinopulmonary infection with encapsulated bacteria， e.g.， Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Management and Outcome\n\n【22】Patient was started on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin； he was vaccinated against pneumococcus， haemophilus， meningococcus and influenzae. His repeated CT thorax did not show CUS recurrence ofthymoma. He enjoyed good neurological recovery and was discharged. Unfortunately， he returned two months later with bilateral eye blindness， his vitreous aspirate was positive for HSV2 PCR. He suffered from bilateral acute necrotizing retinitis from HSV2 infection and was permanently blind. He was put on lifelong oral acyclovir since then. Upon his follow up two years from the first admission， he had been well without significant infective episodes.\n\n【23】Neurology and Good Syndrome\n\n【24】Rare CNS infections can occur in immunodeficiency.

These editorial highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve and breed endangered species， focusing on captive breeding programs， artificial insemination， embryo transfer， and their role in conservation. Captive breeding programs have proven crucial in recovering declining populations and providing genetic reserves for future reintroduction into the wild. Additionally，advanced reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer have enhanced reproduction rates and genetic diversity. However， it is important to acknowledge that these approaches should be complemented by in-situ conservation efforts aimed at protecting natural habitats and addressing underlying causes of population decline. Successful reintroduction of captive-bred animals requires ongoing research， careful monitoring， and collaboration among scientists， conservationists， and local communities. Public awareness and education play a pivotal role in promoting conservation and garnering support. Byadopting an integrated and collaborative approach， we can strive for a future where endangered species thrive in harmony with their natural environments，ensuring the preservation of biodiversity for generations to come.\n\nPreserving biodiversity has become an increasingly urgent concern as the world faces a rising rate of species extinction. To protect and save endangered animals from disappearing forever， scientists and conservationists have been making significant efforts in the field of reproduction and conservation of endangered species. One of the most prominent approaches is the establishment of captive breeding programs， also known as ex-situ breeding programs. These programs have played a crucial role in attempting to recover declining populations and preserve endangered species from extinction. By maintaining animals in controlled environments such as zoos and specialized breeding centers， these programs can ensure the survival of species and provide a genetic reservoir for future reintroduction efforts into the wild. Furthermore， technological advancements have enabled the use of assisted reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer to enhance reproduction rates and the reproductive success of endangered species. Artificial insemination allows for the collection of sperm from endangered males， which can be used to fertilize females that would otherwise be unable to reproduce naturally. Embryo transfer， on the other hand， enables the transportation of healthy embryos from endangered species to recipient females， thereby increasing the chances of successful reproduction. These advanced reproductive techniques not only help overcome reproductive challenges faced by endangered species but also contribute to genetic diversity and the long-term survival of these populations. By preserving genetic variability， these approaches assist in the adaptation and resilience of species in the face of environmental threats and climate change. However， it is important to emphasize that assisted reproduction and captive breeding programs should not be considered definitive solutions for biodiversity preservation. These strategies should complement in-situ conservation efforts， which aim to protect natural habitats and address the underlying causes of declining wild populations. The reintroduction of captive-bred animals to their natural habitats is a crucial step towards the long-term success of conservation. After all， the ultimate goal is to ensure that species can thrive and reproduce in their natural environments， contributing to the health of ecosystems as a whole. However，the challenges faced in reintroducing captive-bred animals should not be underestimated. Adaptation to new environments， competition with other species，and overcoming obstacles such as|删除段之间换行|illegal hunting and habitat destruction are just some of the challenges reintroduced species may encounter. It is crucial， therefore， that reproductive and conservation programs be supported by ongoing scientific research， careful monitoring， and collaboration among scientists， conservationists， and local communities. Understanding the ecological requirements of species and implementing adequate protection measures in their natural habitats are essential elements for successful reintroduction. Additionally， public awareness and education play a vital role in promoting conservation and adopting behaviors that support wildlife preservation. By sharing the efforts of reproduction and conservation， along with the ecological and cultural significance of endangered species， we can generate interest and support from society at large. The reproduction and conservation of endangered species require a collective and comprehensive effort that|删除段之间换行|includes not only actions directed at captive populations but also the protection of natural habitats， combating illegal hunting， controlling environmental degradation， and raising public awareness. Only through an integrated and collaborative approach can we effectively preserve endangered species and ensure the health and resilience of the ecosystems they inhabit. In summary， current efforts in the reproduction and conservation of endangered species， including captive breeding programs， assisted reproductive techniques， and careful reintroduction， play a vital role in biodiversity preservation. By combining scientific knowledge， active conservationism， and public engagement， we can work towards a future where threatened species can thrive and coexist harmoniously with their natural environments. It is our duty to protect and ensure the survival of species for future generations，ensuring a richer and more diverse world for all.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "b4f9b622-41f6-4fd5-b061-3fd0396ba7bb", "title": null, "text": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Gallbladder cancer is reported very high in northern India. One-fifth of all gallbladder cancer cases are reported only from northern part of India. The cases are more prominent in females than males. There were many risk factors associated with gallbladder cancer， but the heavy metals are play crucial roles in induction of gallbladder cancer. Heavy metal may interfere with molecular mechanism and activate mTOR，MAPK，and transcription factor. Hyper activation of cysteine due to arsenic exposure interfere with the function of the mTOR signaling pathway and taurine pathway that causes activation of c-fos，c-myc， and ELK-1leading to enhance cell division causing gallbladder cancer. Lead， Nickel， Zinc， and chromium activate cholic acid which causes formation of gallstones through activated taurine pathway leading to inflammatory gallbladder disease and formation of gall stones. Prolonged inflammation and stones formation in gall bladder may cause loss of contact inhibition in gall bladder cells leading to gall bladder cancer. The combined mechanism of heavy metals activates different pathway leading to gallbladder cancer through activating cell cycle and angiogenesis， it also inhibits tumor- suppressing genes. It was evident that gallbladder cancer is associated with high levels of heavy metal exposure. Differential mechanism associated with different heavy metal leads to gall bladder cancer.\n\n【2】Keywords： mTOR； MAPK； Taurine； Gall stone； Inflammation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】GBC (Gallbladder Cancer) is the sixth most frequent cancer among all gastrointestinal tract malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. GBC have high mortality rate； it accounts for 20h position for death rate among all type of cancers. Mortality rate are very high for gall bladder cancer. In 2020， 115，949 new cases of GBC were reported worldwide， which was 0.6% of overall cancer incidence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Differences in GBC incidence rate have been observed in different geographical areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Asia represents 70.8% of the total gallbladder cancer incidence followed by Europe 10.8%， Latin America and the Caribbean8.6%， Africa 4.7%， and Northern America 4.5% from. 10% of the global burden of GBC contributed by only India 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The 10% to 22% of India’s total GBC burden has been contributed by north-east region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In 2020 because of GBC total of 84，695 deaths were reported worldwide including73.6% of the total mortality from Asia， 10.3% from Europe， 7.6% from Latin America and 5% from Caribbean， and 3.1% from Northern America 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. These variations observed due to dissimilarity in genetic propensity and environmental exposure as well as other conditions such as gallstones， obesity， gender， bacterial infection associated with chronic inflammation that increase the potential for carcinogenesis， as known risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Heavy metal and gallbladder cancer incidence\n\n【6】Heavy metal as well as trace metal was observed in bile of gall bladder cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The amount of some heavy metals like Lead (Pb)， Chromium (Cr)， and Cadmium (Cd) was found significantlyhigher in patients diagnosed with GBC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The study conducted in the Gangetic plains of Bihar by Kumar et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> found a remarkably high concentration of arsenic (>15 ugL) in the blood of 53.6% of patients with gallbladder cancer. High concentration of Copper (Cu) and Nickel(Ni) were found in serum， Cd and Ni were found in bile and high concentration of Cr was found in gallbladder tissues. While Zinc (Zn) and Selenium (Se) have also been detected in low concentration in gall bladder tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Role of heavy metal in induction of biological pathways were shown in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. It gives detailed idea about tumorigenesis in gall bladder and heavy metal incidence.\n\n【7】Molecular mechanism involved in gallbladder cancer due to heavy metals\n\n【8】Mondal et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> conducted a study that provides concrete pieces of evidence in support of heavy metals-induced premalignant and malignant development in gallbladder. It has been reported that the deregulation in antioxidant system plays a major role in carcinogenesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Heavy metals induce cancer through the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)， which leads to DNA damage through redox imbalance and by interrupting the repair pathway of damaged DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The strong affinity of heavy metals for free sulfhydryl group makes it capable to disturb the metabolism and physiological function of several proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Heavy metal exposure such as As， Hg， Cd and Pb compromises with cysteine status， which significantly took a part in the inducible endogenous detoxification system of body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and heavy metal also associated with alteration in function of enzyme involved in antioxidant system， lead to malignancy by DNA damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Heavy metal binding with cysteine & its metabolites leading to gallbladder cancer： The semi-essential sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine is carried from extracellular space by a catalytic subunit of the transport system called xCT in exchange for glutamate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In the liver， cysteine decomposed into GSH (glutathione)by hepatic enzyme Y-Glutamyl Cysteine Synthetase (GCS) and disintegrates to cysteine sulfate by another hepatic enzyme Cysteine Dioxygenase (CDO)， cysteine sulfate further catabolized to hypo taurine by the action of enzyme Cysteine Sulfinate Decarboxylase (CSDC)， which later on oxidized to taurine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The free sulfhydryl group of Cysteine binds with heavy metal such as arenite resulting in metabolic alteration and decrease cysteine concentration in intercellular space 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Cysteine transportation could also limit by phosphorylation of serine26 present on the cytosolic N terminus of the cystine-glutamate antiporter xCT by mTOR signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Decreased level of cysteine leads to disturbance in its physiological role such as protection against inflammatory response and oxidative stress by deregulating GSH synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. According to Lewerenz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>， the SLC7A11transporter is expressed in the number of malignancies where transporter-assisteddglutathione production decreases oxidative damage and protect cancer cell from death .\n\n【10】Role of GSH and its contribution to GBC due to heavy metal exposure： GSH protects the intracellular environment from oxidative stress and detoxifies cells by acting as a scavenger 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. GSH reduces the oxidative level through binding its thiol group directly with free radicals， it also functions as a cofactor for enzyme peroxidase， which metabolized H，O， and lipid peroxide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The high affinity of heavy metal for GSH leads to a reduction in intracellular concentration of glutathione by suppressing the action of essential enzyme Y-glutamyl cysteine synthetase required for GSH synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Decreased levels of glutathione lead to elevation in redox imbalance which increases the frequency of damaged DNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> by modifying methylation of DNA or by interfering in the mechanism of DNA repair . Mutated DNA gets accumulated and eventually causes cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. It has been observed that when ROS generation is high， the antioxidant system loses its ability to maintain equilibrium and results in oxidative stress 27\\].\n\nEffect of heavy metal induced oxidative tension on DNA：High oxidative stress could induce either through mitochondrial dysfunction or malfunctioning of the ROS elimination system，heavy metal limits the function of MRCC1 and MRCC2 mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes which enhance the oxidative stress通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Free radicals also produced either by stimulation of H.O， production through heavy metal toxicity or feedback inhibition of amino-levulinic acid synthase， which leads to an elevated level of heme precursor Amino-Levulinic Acid (ALA)， enolization of ALA followed by autoxidation generated free radicals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Increased level of free radical by inhibition of antioxidant system has been observed in fishes when exposed to metal toxicity by Zheng et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Effects of increased oxidative stress on DNA impairment is complex and pleomorphic. Increased oxidative stress caused by heavy metal leads to DNA damage and it can initiate cancer processes as well as participate in its progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Oxidative DNA damage has also been identified in the lymphocytes of the person exposed to the heavy metal environment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Chromosomal aberration and DNA strand break has been well demonstrated in cultured mammalian cells even at the minute deposition of heavy metal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Simultaneously ROS causes DNA damage by oxidizing nucleoside bases such as8-oxoguanine， which if left unpaired， it may cause G-T and G-A transversion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Moreover， heavy metal exposure can produce|删除段之间换行|intrastrand bifunctional adducts through covalent binding with the N-atom of guanine and adenine present at 7th position of DNA residue leading to the destabilization of the DNA helix 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.\n\nSuppression of DNA repair mechanism and genotoxicity due to oxidative stress caused by heavy metal： Giaginis et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u> has reported about suppression of mismatch repair， nucleotide excision， and base excision DNA repairs mechanisms due to heavy metal toxicity， either by binding to residues of negatively charged surface on DNA repair protein or by replacing Zn-atom in their Zn finger motif. Inhibition of repair mechanism result into conformational changes and disturbance in DNA protein interaction required for DNA repair process and preservation of genomic integrity. Substantiation of aberration in chromosome， micronuclei， and high sister chromatids exchange due to heavy metal has observed by Valverde et al.， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u> in person exposed to heavy metal environment. Heavy metal compounds alter expression of tumor suppressor gene and oncogene through deregulation in DNA methylation pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Which may be cause hypomethylation leading to oncogene activation through suppression of DNA methyl transferase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u> or transcriptional inactivation due to|删除段之间换行|hypermethylation of the p53 gene at the promoter region by heavy metal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Heavy metal also reduces the levels of S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAM) and methyltransferase gene which encode for enzyme that transfer a methyl group to nucleotides residue of DNA. Dysregulation in methylation processes due to heavy metal exposure has also observed in rats model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Methylation at promoter region of tumors suppressor gene family CDH1，CDKN2A， p16 and REpRIMO is responsible for apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis in gallbladder malignancy. Methylation of p73， MGMT， DCL1 were also observed in cell of gallbladder malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. Modification in promoter region and remodeling in process of methylation of DNA have a tumor-encouraging effect and enhance the up regulation of the proto-oncogene pool out-turn into mutation and accumulated mutation with time results in tumor formation.\n\nRole of heavy metals on the physiological role of taurine responsible for galbladdertumorigenesis： Cysteine derived Taurine(2-aminoethane sulphonic acid) freely present in intracellular space play a key role in the reduction of oxidative tension induced by heavy metal toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. It has been observed that taurine reduces|删除段之间换行|superoxide synthesis by elevating electron transport chain activity of mitochondria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Toxicity of heavy metal leads to a consequential reduction in taurine accumulation and falloff of the membrane protected by taurine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Taurine is critical for gallstone formation， which induces inflammation in inner lining of gallbladder tissues and eventually turns into a malignant mass of cells through mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Taurine also has been spotted in mt-tRNAs as a modified component of 5-taurine methyluridine and 5-taurine methyl-2-thiouridine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Increased ROS level due to reduction in GSHleads to enlargement and malfunctioning of mitochondria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. Mitochondrial malfunctioning and high susceptibility of mt-DNA to ROS leads to alteration in mt-tRNA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>， and mutated mt-tRNAs leads to several metabolic diseases as well as cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.Disintegration of the inner membrane of mitochondria by modified mt-tRNA results in a remarkable reduction in CYP27A1 protein expression in taurine-depleted liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u>， which further inhibits bile acid formation in addition to deterioration in the flow of bile， results in reduction of conjugation of taurine with bile acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[51\\]</u>. Accumulation of un-conjugated bile acid leads to the formation of gallstones， which cause irritation and turn into cancer in the long run. Modification due to heavy metals in MDR3， a gene involved in bile formation， and CYP27A regulates cholesterol metabolism in the liver， play critical role in gallstone formation 52\\].\n\n【14】Signaling expressed in gallbladder carcinoma\n\n【15】Cell signaling is necessary for sustaining critical cellular functions like development， differentiation， migration， and cell growth. Activation of ERK/MAPK 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53\\]</u> and mTOR signaling pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[54\\]</u> due to heavy metal toxicityhas been reported in gallbladder cell lines， which incite circumstances that fuel cancer progression .\n\nMAPK signaling pathway activation in gall bladder cancer due to heavy metal exposure： Activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in presence of excess heavy metal through generation of ROS was extensively studied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>. Nanomolar concentration of Cd|删除段之间换行|also activates MAPK signaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. MAP kinase activates different downstream substrate such as transcription factors Elk-1， c-jun， c-fos， c-myc， stress-activated protein kinase (MSK) and Ribosomal S6 Kinase 1 (RSK1) in gallbladder carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>. Which stimulate cancer regulatory processes： Angiogenesis， cell proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>， cell differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>， cell cycle progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>， growth， metastasis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>， invasiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u> in GBC celllines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Role of heavy metals in mTOR activation leading to gallbladder cancer： mTOR activation occurs early in the development of GBC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[64\\]</u>. Activation of PI3K kinase， which stimulate mTOR pathway and phosphorylation of mTOR， S6K1 and 4E-BP1 by heavy metal has reported in GBC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activate mTOR by phosphorylate Ser 2448， which further activates the eukaryotic Translation Factor 4E (eIF4E) by inactivating its inhibitor 4E-BP1.35 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u>. An element PI3K of the mTOR signaling pathway stimulates different tumorigenic cellular processes such as angiogenesis， cell survival， cell proliferation， adhesion， and motility通用删除6(英):<u>\\[66\\]</u>. Riener et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u> found a missense mutation in PI3KCA，which contributes to gallbladder carcinogenesis . Outcomes of immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated p70S6K has been shown a high prevalence (>80%) of up-regulated p70S6K in gallbladder cell lines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[64\\]</u>， which have the potential to rearrange the actin cytoskeleton through its actin filament cross-linking Rac1/cdc42 and leads to cell migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[68\\]</u>.\n\nOther transcription factors up-regulated by heavy metal in gall bladder cancer： Besides mTOR and MAPK signaling hyper activation of other transcription factors MTF1 (Metal Regulatory Transcriptional Factor1)， USF (Upstream Stimulator Factor)， Nuclear Factor kB (NF-KB) and NF-E2 Related Factor (NRF2) has also been observed in gallbladder carcinoma which is stimulated by heavy metals as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[69\\]</u>. Cd-induced tumorigenesis demonstrated through differential display analysis of transformed BALB/C-3T3cells due to CdCl2 exposure shows over expression of translation|删除段之间换行|initiation factor-3 and translation elimination factor 1 delta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[70\\]</u>. All these factors induced cellproliferation and cell survival， which is a key step in tumor formation. Nuclear Factor NF-kB regulate downstream target， modulate viability， and boost cell division of gallbladder cancer cells during chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[71\\]</u>. The result of an experimental study by Shibata et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72\\]</u>， supports the regulation of NrF2 activity by alters the inhibitory function of Keaplgene in gallbladder cancer cell lines \\[391.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】It was evident that gall bladder cancer is multistep process induced by activation of cascades of genes. Heavy metal enhances formation of gall stones which may be converted into gall bladder cancer with time. Taurine-cysteine pathway regulates formation of gall stones on activation due to increased concentration of heavy metal. MAPK， mTOR and transcription factor activation through different heavy metal finally leads to gall bladder malignancy through different pathways.

In the diagnostic course it was found that the sciatic nerve was compressed by a Heterotopic Ossification (HO) of the greater trochanter.\n\n【2】The stretching lead to a dislocation of the nerve around the HO， which prevented the nerve to slip back in its anatomical position.\n\n【3】Operation was performed and the neurological symptoms diminished.\n\n【4】Keywords： Sciatic nerve compression； Peronaeus nerve palsy； Heterotopic ossification\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 41 year old patient presented to our Emergency Department (ED) after performing a stretching technique derived from Yoga with the name， Ardha Paschimottanasana\". During this exercise one of the legs is bend in the hip and knee joint in a sitting position so that the foot is placed on the medial aspects of the contralateral thigh. Next step is to bend the upper body above the thigh which leads to stretching of the hamstring muscles.\n\n【7】While performing this exercise the patient felt a sudden pain in her posterior thigh which resulted in the inability to extend her knee. The knee was locked in 70° flexion.\n\n【8】In the past she has been treated due to algophobia (fear of pain) and she was diagnosed with a somatic disorder. Other than that she repeatedly suffered from muscle cramps in the posterior thigh. No further relevant past medical history was present.\n\n【9】On admission in the ED3 days later she showed no pain in a relaxed position but still was not able to extend her knee. A passive movement of the knee was not possible because the patient felt uncomfortable and reported dysesthesia of her lower thigh and foot. A meniscal tear was assumed and a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-scan was performed. There were no pathologic findings.\n\n【10】The patient was ambulating on crutches and Continuous Passive Motion (CPM) was applied. While walking her then expressed mild symptoms of sensory perineal nerve palsy.\n\n【11】A neurological examination was performed but did not show typical symptoms that could be associated with a nerve root injury or a peripheral injury of the perineal nerve. Knowing that the patient had a somatizing disorder (algophobia). The neurologist assumed an interference of her symptoms.\n\n【12】However an MRI-scan of the lumbar spine was obtained to rule out nerve root injury or compression， it also showed no significant pathologies. To prevent ongoing lack of motion of her knee joint it was extended under mild analgosedation. The knee showed free Range of Motion (ROM) under sedation. A knee brace was applied to keep the knee in an extended position. The following day she presented with a foot drop.\n\n【13】Once more we asked the neurologist for a detailed examination including a Nerve Conduction Study (NCS). The NCS showed pathologic signals indicating an acute sciatic nerve injury.\n\n【14】Mean while the patient mentioned that she had been diagnosed with a bony tumor in her proximal right femur. An MRI-scan of that area was obtained externally just a few weeks before. The MRI images were not available but the results were reported negative regarding any compression of the sciatic nerve.\n\n【15】The X-ray showed a heterotopic ossification of approx. 16 mm ×13 mm emerging from the posterior aspect of the greater trochanter.\n\n【16】An MRI-scan of the proximal femur showed significant swelling of the sciatic nerve and a dislocation from its anatomical position. The nerve was strained around the ossification and showed signs of acute hemorrhage.\n\n【17】The patient then was operated via Kocher-Langen beck approach and the ossification was removed.Intraoperativelythe nervepresented with elongation and hematoma but its continuity was preserved.\n\n【18】Once the ossification was resected the nerve slipped back into its anatomical position.

There are numerous case reports about compression syndromes caused by veins， pseudoaneurysms of the gluteal artery， heterotopic ossifications or hematoma following surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-10\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The number of patients suffering from sciatic nerve palsy is unknown since most of the literatures are case reports only.\n\n【27】Correct interpretation of this patient's symptoms was difficult due to a known somatic disorder. She was sometimes comfortable with her situation and did not express any signs of severe pain， while few minutes later she was crying in bed due to unbearable pain not responding to any medication. As complicating factor she was diagnosed with a， bony tumor “possibly resulting from a fall a few years earlier. Unfortunately we did not get this information on admission. Retrospectively the patient reported periodic cramps and pain in her posterior thigh ongoing for several months. An MRI-scan of that area was performed externally shortly before was reported to show no signs of sciatic nerve compression at that time.\n\n【28】This might have been one of the reasons why we first did not focus on a possible nerve injury but rather on thelocked knee and the lower spine. Therefore the MRI of the pelvis and thigh was the last of three MRIs performed.\n\n【29】The symptoms were inconclusive and only the nerve conduction study objectified the injury of the sciatic nerve.

It is characterized by a highly aggressive clinical course with a median survival of 15 months. PCGDTCL involves the subcutaneous fat and can often mimic both clinically and histologically other more indolent conditions such as Cytophagic Histiocytic Phagocytosis (CHP) and Subcutaneous Panniculitic T-Cell Lymphomas (SPTCL). In addition， diagnosis of PCGDTCL can be challenging due to aberrant expression of surface markers in the neoplastic cells and varied histologic presentation and multiple biopsies are required to make a correct diagnosis. This is a case report that the initial histopathologic findings were most consistent with CHP but with a very aggressive and uncommon clinical course and with extreme subcutaneous ulcerations.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP) lesions show histiocytic infiltration of adipose tissue with hemophagocytosis and lymphocytic invasion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The clinical course of CHP may be indolent with intermittent exacerbations or rapidly fatal heralded by fevers， hepatosplenomegaly， pancytopenia， coagulopathy， and transaminitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. Non-fatal， indolent CHP is responsive to immunosuppressive therapy whereas fatal CHP often requires cytotoxic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. The presentation of fatal CHP is similar to Subcutaneous Panniculitis-like T-Cell Lymphoma (SPTL) with differentiation made by the presence of malignant lymphocytes on histologic review of lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However， initial biopsies of SPTL are often consistent with CHP suggesting that CHP represents an indolent lymphoid malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. The following case illustrates an extreme clinical presentation of SPTL initially diagnosed as CHP.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 63-year-old Caucasian female presented with a month history of daily fevers up to 39.4C， night sweats， increasing fatigue， bilateral lower extremity edema and multiple erythematous lesions on her extremities and back. The patient reported she had similar symptoms of a milder nature one year prior， that had resolved spontaneously after six weeks without a diagnosis. At the time of presentation， the patient was a febrile and vitally stable. Multiple erythematous， patchy lesions with associated deep ulceration， necrosis， and subcutaneous nodular lesions were noted on the bilateral upper and lower extremities， left breast， and back . Cardiovascular， respiratory， and abdominal examinations were normal and without hepatosplenomegaly. Her course progressed rapidly over the next several months with aggressive， deep ulcerative lesions throughout her extremities， breast， and abdomen with ongoing intermittent fevers and progressive fatigue.\n\n【6】Initial blood work reported normal hemoglobin of 11.6 with giemsa smear showing microcytic hypochromic red blood cells and normal white blood cell and differential and platelet count. Iron studies were indicative of anemia of inflammation (Ferritin 1，188； Iron 44； TIBC 298 and Iron Saturation 15%). Markers of inflammation were elevated including CRP 7.9 and ESR删除4:<u> 55</u>. The patient had a mild transaminitis (AST 106， ALT 77) that spontaneously normalized on repeat laboratory work up.\n\n【7】Skin punch biopsy oflesions on upper and lower extremities were obtained from outside facility. Outside pathology of all three biopsies were read as squamous cell carcinoma with a co-existent lobular panniculitis. Second review of the original pathology was read as ulcer and atypical squamous proliferation with lobular panniculitis and interface dermatitis. Repeat biopsies were completed due to high suspicion of possible SPTL， but the pathology confirmed a lobular panniculitis composed predominantly of epithelioid histiocytes with phagocytosis of red blood cells. There were also small lymphocytes and karvorrhectic cells. Normal CD4：CD8 ratio with histiocyvtic predominance did not support a typical lymphoma diagnosis. Overall， these findings were reported suspicious for Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP). No malignant or infectious processes were appreciated on complete pathologic stains.\n\n【8】cardiolipin antibody， C-ANCA， P-ANCA， smooth muscle antibody， alpha-1-antitrypsin enzyme， angiotensin converting enzyme， and interleukin-2 receptor. However， mitochondrial antibodies were elevated at 1.31 with normal index value <0.91 and lipase was only mildly increased at删除4:<u> 196</u>. D-dimer was elevated at 1，214 ng/mL and fibrinogen was 556 ng/dL. Infectious disease and rheumatologic consults were obtained， both felt that an infectious or rheumatologic underlying process were unlikely.\n\n【9】Work-up for an underlying neoplastic process was performed. Computed Tomography (CT) of the chest， abdomen， and pelvis with contrast was obtained which noted mildly enlarged lymph nodes throughout the abdomen， pelvis， lower neck， mediastinum， and left axilla. Fat stranding of the subcutaneous soft tissues of the abdomen and pelvis and left breast were also reported. Mammography was reported as negative for malignancy.\n\n【10】Work-up for underlying causes ofCHP was performed. Infectious etiologies including HIV， EBV， CMV， Hepatitis B， Hepatitis C， Syphilis， andTuberculosis were excluded. Autoimmune and Vasculitis work-up was negative including Anti-Nuclear Antibodies(ANA)， SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La antibodies， Beta-2-Glycoprotein，\n\nWhile evaluating for underlying etiologies，the patient was actively being treated for aggressive CHP as she continued to have progressive|删除段之间换行|deep cutaneous ulceration/panniculitis and systemic symptoms. She was started on prednisone 40 mg per day and hydroxychloroquine200 mg twice daily for treatment of CHP. While this treatment course initially achieved mild improvement of skin lesions and edema， the patient developed progression of symptoms with visual disturbance， ptosis， and left eye discomfort. CT scan of the orbits showed an enlarged heterogeneous lacrimal gland without bony erosion or fat stranding. The patient was changed to prednisone 60 mg per day with cyclosporine 500 mg per day. The patient experienced disease progression on this regimen， and then she was initiated on Anakinra100 mg subcutaneously daily.\n\n【12】Due to a worsening disease course despite immune suppression and concern that CHP may be masking and underlying SPTL， repeat multiple skin biopsies were obtained. The previous biopsies did not show abnormal T cells and PCR studies for TCR gene rearrangement were inconclusive. A final set of skin biopsies were then obtained. Pathology confirmed lymphocytes positive for CD3， TCR delta， CD56， and TIA positive， CD4， and CD8 negative. PCR identified a clonal TCR gamma gene rearrangement. These findings were consistent with Subcutaneous Panniculitis T-Cell Lymphoma(SPTL) gamma/delta type (Primary Cutaneous Gamma/Delta T-Cell Lymphoma (PCGDTCL)) presenting as cytophagic histiocytic panniculitis. Anakinra was discontinued and patient was referred to bone marrow transplant for further management. She received six cycles of EPOCH regimen with excellent response and healing of the large， deep cutaneous ulcers . She is currently receiving Pentostatin and being prepared for allogenic stem cell transplantation.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Cytophagic Histiocytic Panniculitis (CHP) presents as ulcerating nodules or plaques based in the subcutaneous fat without antecedent infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. CHP is defined histologically by infiltration of subcutaneous adipose tissue by benign appearing cytophagic macrophages and T-cell lymphocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. The course of CHP may be indolent or aggressive with a fatal hemophagocytic disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5\\]</u>. As in this case， an initial benign course can progress to a fatal hemophagocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. This progression is often heralded by systemic findings including recurrent pyrexia， pancytopenia， consumptive coagulopathy and hemodynamic instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3，5\\]</u>. This patient did not have any cytopenias， liver or spleen abnormalities or a consumptive coagulopathy. Her clinical course was unusual in that she had a mild form of the disease one year prior that became latent.\n\n【15】Then， she developed progression of symptoms starting with cycling of fevers， fatigue， and multiple， large deep subcutaneous ulcers are not commonly seen to this extent in panniculitis. In addition， she developed orbital involvement that is also a rare finding in primary cutaneous gamma/delta T-cell lymphoma.\n\n【16】The systemic symptoms of aggressive CHP are also noted in SPTL通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Differentiation of CHP and SPTL is classically based on histologic findings， with SPTL displaying neoplastic T cell infiltrate into subcutaneous tissue involving fat septate and lobules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. However， a dominant benign inflammatory cell population accompanies neoplastic lymphocytes in SPTL， potentially obscuring them 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Furthermore， as documented in this case， initial biopsies of SPTL may be more consistent with CHP通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，6\\]</u>. Thus， an indolent course of CHP with histology interpreted as benign cannot be assumed non-fatal， as neoplastic transformation or a missed diagnosis may occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.In addition， the heterogeneity of the lymphoma can make this diagnosis more difficult to confirm.\n\n【17】T-cell gene rearrangements have been examined in an attempt to definitely differentiate CHP from SPTL. Though T-cell monoclonal rearrangements are more frequently associated with SPTL， they have also been noted in CHP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Furthermore， T-cell clonality is sometimes observed in benign conditions， and therefore is a poor diagnostic marker 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. EBV positivity has also been studied with latent infection noted in both CHP and SPTL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Given the similarity of clinical presentation， the lack of definitive molecular tests， and the transition of presentation， CHP and SPTL may be better characterized as a clinical spectrum rather than separate entities. This case provides excellent illustration of such disease progression and heterogeneity in the pathologic specimens. Maintaining a high suspicion of the development or an underlying cutaneous lymphoma is warranted in these rare cases. In addition， this case provides a reminder that patients with initial diagnoses of indolent CHP should be carefully monitored for neoplastic disease. Patients with aggressive CHP or SPTL would benefit from early aggressive therapy to prevent a fatal course.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

She had no distant metastasis at that time and received intensity modulated radiation therapy， with the prescribed dosage of 60 Gy/30F for P-GTV and 50 Gy/25F for PTV. The targeted sites included the chest wall and supra/infra-clavicular nodal region. However， the patient refused to undergo subsequent chemotherapy and came back on February 26， 2018 because of an enlarged lymph node in her right upper neck with a diameter of 2 cm. Further examination identified the swollen lymph node as a tumor metastasis from contralateral breast origin . Therefore， 4 cycles of TP regimen and subsequent radiation therapy were given to target this isolated metastasis. In accordance with standard protocol， the patient is currently undergoing hormonal therapy (Letrozole plus Goserlin).\n\n【19】Confucius once said， “Things in the past are beyond redemption， but we can consummate what is in the future\".

The most common presenting symptoms are cough， fever， malaise， weight loss， neurological abnormalities， and shortness of breath 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Lesions in the lung are usually well circumscribed and consist of small lymphocytes， plasma cells， and a variable number of large atypical mononuclear cells. Most small lymphocytes are T cells， while large atypical cells are usually B cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. B cells typically express CD20， but rarely CD30.

From this perspective， it would be interesting to evaluate thyroid function and structure in other patients.\n\n【25】In the end， symptomspresented by these patients are often thought to be purely psychiatric， so these conditions are often misdiagnosed. Unfortunately， a favorable outcome is time dependent. We have to remember that organic causes of psychosis have to be fully evaluated and considering the lack of biomarkers in clinical practice， imaging results， blood test and clinical data have to be integrated as much as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A careful history，physical examination， radiology and endoscopy may reveal the exact pathology which may be in larynx， trachea or bronchus and so with a proper diagnosis， the management is successful with a faster recovery and a cure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This misdiagnosis as asthma mayproduce a psychological trauma to parents and repeated visits to clinics will result into loss of working days and a monetary loss to parents as well as to state treasuries too. Wheezing is very common in children (40%) and by six years ofage， almost one half of children will have had at least one episode of wheezing. In children younger than 5 years， asthma is the most likely cause of recurrent wheezing but other causes should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The diagnosis ofa vocal cord dysfunction can be made using direct laryngoscopy， only during symptomatic periods or after the exercise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. A stridor may be produced by other glottis pathologies like glottis cysts， vocal cord granulations， polyps and papilloma. Aspirated foreign bodies， stuck up in larynx， can lead to persistent cough with dyspnea and a stridor and by going further down it may produce a generalized wheezing， necessitating an endoscopic retrieval 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Commonly found aspirated foreign bodies are food particles and seeds (70% of all episodes)， metallic or plastic pieces of toys or house hold items. The sudden onset of wheezing and choking may indicate foreign body aspiration， which warrants immediate bronchoscopy. If the history or physical examination suggests asthma， clinical guidelines recommend pulmonary function testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Stridor with drooling suggests the diagnosis of epiglottitis and there may be congenital anomalies involving the air passages.\n\n【5】In this study， six different etiologies irrespective ofage or sex and duration or site of lesion were taken up， to understand common antilogies which may be misinterpreted as bronchial asthma but can be diagnosed correctly by simple X-rays or CT scans and an endoscopy.\n\n【6】Case Series\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】(Glottis pathology-Foreign body) One year old girl was having SOB and cough for 3 months， after swallowing pieces of a cloth pin (plastic). The mother removed it from child’s mouth but the cough continued with a hoarse week crying sound and occasionally with a mild to moderate stridor. The patient was diagnosed and being treated repeatedly for asthma. The chest X-ray was found non informative. An FFL was indicated but due to its unavailability a rigid direct laryngoscopy was done which revealed a piece ofplastic cloth pin lying in between the true vocal cords， hooked at anterior commissure . Immediate after the FB extraction， the stridor disappeared and in next 3days the crying became normal.\n\n【9】Case 2\n\n【10】(Glottic pathology-papilloma) A four years old girl was being treated off and on for dyspnoea， stridor and cyanosis with a diagnosis of asthma， for about a month. The chest X-ray was found normal. Again a FFL was indicated but due to its non-availability， a rigid direct laryngoscopy was done which revealed an obstructive papillomatous growth on superior surface of both true vocal cords .\n\n【11】An emergency tracheostomy had to be performed and then through RDL， an excisional biopsy of the glottic growth was done. The histology confirmed it to be a papilloma. After a check direct laryngoscopy (before the decannulation) and with a gradual decannulation， the tracheostomy tube was removed after a week.\n\n【12】Case 3\n\n【13】(Supra glottic pathology-cyst) A four months old child， mature at birth， had persistent cough， wheeze and stridor， for two months. The chest X-ray was normal. A provisional diagnosis of Laryngomalacia/Bronchial asthma was made and due to non availability of FFL， a RFL was performed which revealed a， 0.5 cm size， round cyst on superior surface of epiglottis with its left edge extending to vallecula pushing the left side of epiglottis downwards. The cyst wall was excised and a mucoid fluid was drained. Few granulations were also seen over left false vocal cord near the arytenoid. True vocal cords， sub glottis and trachea were found normal. Post operativelythe wheezing disappeared though the hoarseness persisted for 2 weeks. Histology report from the cyst in vallecula revealed it to be a retention cyst contents with inflammatory cells and the granulations tissues from the false vocal cord showed “Fibromyxoid spindle cell proliferation”.\n\n【14】Case 4\n\n【15】(Glottic inflammatory. pathology-Sub acute inflammation) A nine months old child had a hoarse and low volume crying sound with a persistent dry cough and respiratory distress， for 2 weeks. There was no history of respiratory tract infection. The child was known to be asthmatic. Clinically and radiologically the chest was clear. The CBC was found normal. A RFL (as FFL was not available) revealed congestion and edema on true vocal cords. The child was treated for subacute Laryngitis with steroids and antibiotics and in seven days the patient recovered fully.\n\n【16】Case 5\n\n(Subglottic Pathology- FB) A nine months old child had breathlessness， noisy breathings for about two weeks and fever for 1week. She was being treated for bronchial asthma without any relief. The patient had mild inspiratory stridor with bilateral conducted|删除段之间换行|sounds in lungs. Incidentally a chest X-ray was advised which revealed a radio-opaque， 5 mmx3 mm， rectangular FB in subglottic region .\n\n【18】The child was taken to operation theatre for a RFL but an emergency tracheostomy had to be performed first， because of the falling oxygen saturation. Through RFL the metallic FB was extracted， from the subglottic region.\n\n【19】Case 6\n\n【20】(Oesophageal Pathology- FB) A two years old child had cough， wheezing and choking with drooling of saliva for 2 weeks， more so during getting feeds， which was liquid only. The child was being treated for suspected bronchial asthma but without any benefit so a chest X-ray was advised which revealed a coin in upper third of oesophagus . Coin found partially eroded. A RFL was used to extract the coin. The surfaces of the coin were found partially eroded and rusted due to its long stay inside the oesophagus.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\nRegarding the age factor， the cases in our study group， were in between 4 months to 4 years， similar to studies in the United States(between 1988 and 1994) which showed that the prevalence for|删除段之间换行|| S.No.  | Site/age/sex  | Pathology  | Diag.by  | Remarks  | Managed by  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Glottic/1 year/F  | F.B.(Plastic piece)  | RFL-  | Duration-3 Months (Cough， Hoarseness and Mild Stridor)  | RFL-Extraction  |\n| 2  | Glottic/4 years/F  | Papilloma  | RFL-  | Duration 1 Month， (off and on-SOB， Stridor andCyanosis)  | RFL-Excision  |\n| 3  | Supra-Glottic/4 months-/F  | Cyst and Granulations  | RFL-  | Duration 2 Months (Persistent Cough， Wheezes and Stridor)  | RFL-Excision  |\n| 4  | Glottic/9 months/-M  | Inflammation  | RFL  | Duration 2 Weeks， (Cough， Hoarseness and a WeakSound on Crying)  | RFL-Diagnostic  |\n\n【23】wheezing amongst two to three year olds was 26% and amongst 9to 11 year olds， it was 13%(4.5). FB aspirations， congenital laryngeal cysts and wheezes due to asthma are also common in young children， below 5 yrs of age. Regarding the sex incidence， in our study， 4 cases were females and 2 were male children but as we picked up the cases with only different pathologies and not age wise hence no inference can be drawn for the sex incidence. In other studies also no specific sex ratio has been found. Similarly a study on incidence of site and type of pathology was not possible in this study as cases were not selected for a particular period， site of lesion or as per pathology. The different sites with different pathologies were selected for the sake of discussion. In our study the symptoms and duration for all the cases was in between 2 weeks to 3 months as for this study the cases were selected who had dyspnea of recent origin with different pathologies. All the six cases in our study were being treated for asthma. These misdiagnosed asthmatic patients were later found to have a different pathology， emphasizing the importance of radiology and endoscopic investigation for a proper diagnosis. A diagnosed by rigid endoscopy was used due to non availability of a flexible fiberoptic endoscope and in radiology， plain X-rays of neck and chest were helpful. For removal of FB， rigid endoscopes were used which is still a preferred way of removing a relatively big FB from upper airway. In our study the FB seen were a coin (in oesophagus)， a ring from subglottis and a FB (plastic piece of a cloth pin) in glottis. As per the results are concerned， there was an immediate relief in case of FB extracted from glottis after excision of the glottic papilloma and when the coin was removed from upper third of oesophagus but the progress was gradual after supraglottic cyst removal and in the case of laryngitis. In the case of subglottic FB extraction， after a planned decannulation， the tracheostomy tube was removed.\n\n【24】Limitations\n\n【25】The cases were selected as per different aetiologies so this study is only for discussion of different aetiologies and their clinical confusing presentation as bronchial asthma (not in relation to incidence/sex/age).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Although several classifications exist， there are four major primary perforating disorders grouped according to types of epidermal disruption， nature of eliminated material， and clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are two types of reactive Perforan Collagenosis (RPC)， Acquired RPC (ARPC) and Inherited RPC (IRPC). IRPC is more common in infants and children； while ARPC usually develops in adulthood in association with variety of systemic disorders， such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)， Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD)， hypertension， even malignant neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Here， we reported a rare case of 57-year-old man who presented ARPC associated with three different systemic diseases including diabetes mellitus， chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 57-year-old male patient applied to emergency unit with shortness of breath， edema and generalized pruritus. He had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 10 years， congestive heart failure and hypertension. His blood glucose was regulated with insulin at home. At the time of hospital admission her blood glucose was： 160 mg/dL， creatinine： 7.68 mg/dL， CRP： 73.69 mg/L， albumin： 2.84 mg/dL. His calcium and phosphorus results were detected 7.2 mg/dL and 6.6 mg/dL respectively. His ProBNP was>35000 pg/mL. The patient was admitted to nephrology clinic with pre-diagnoses of chronic kidney disease and diabetic nephropathy. The patient’s proteinuria was2.5 g/day and bilateral diabetic retinopathy was detected in fundus examination. The patient had multiple moderately itchy lesions for six years. Dermatologic examination showed disseminated red or brown umbilicated papules， plaques or nodules between 2 mm to 3 cm diameters on extremities and trunk. There were hemorrhagic and necrotic crusts or keratin plug on the centre of these lesions . A punch biopsy was performed by dermatologist from one of the lesions. Histopathologically； neutrophils， basophilic material consisting of keratin material and necrotic debris， and epidermal ulceration were seen. Masson trichromestaining showed transepidermal elimination of collagen fibers . Based on the clinical and histopathological findings， the patient was diagnosed with acquired reactive perforating collagenosis. Narrow-band ultraviolet B three times a week， oral anti-histamine and topical steroid were started as treatment for the patient.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nAcquired Perforating Dermatosis (APD) is an all-encompassing term that describes the various types of perforating diseases that arise in adults， often related to an underlying systemic disease， most commonly diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>.

We present the case of a 66-year-old male with multiple myeloma who developed erythroderma.

Some cases are also associated with erosions， crusting， hair， and nail changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Most commonly， it is due to generalization of pre-existing dermatoses (such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis)， drug reactions， or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma， but identification of the underlying disease process represents one of the most complex challenges in dermatology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We present the case of a patient affected by multiple myeloma who developed erythroderma.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\nA 66-year-old male with a medical history of multiple myeloma developed an erythematous rash spread over the entire skin surface， with scaling and itching. Dermatologic examination revealed extensive pink patches with feathering edges and large scaling on head， neck， trunk， and limbs . He did not report previous dermatoses or known allergies， but a history of xerosis. Regarding multiple myeloma， he achieved Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) after four cycles of Bortezomib-Thalidomide-Dexamethasone (VTD) induction therapy followed by Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT). Laboratory tests showed eosinophilia (5500/mm)， which has progressively increased for two months， until reaching a peak concomitantly with erythroderma. The previous month， acyclovir was replaced by valganciclovir for a cytomegalovirus reactivation (28000 copies/mL). Current blood tests found the presence of cytomegalovirus (481copies/mL)andhuman herpesvirus-7(90 copies/mL). Thepatient was started on oralprednisone and hydroxyzine， associated with topical steroids and emollients， but one month later erythroderma with lamellar scaling， intense itching and eosinophilia persisted， and thus a skin biopsy was performed. A week later， the patient developed fever， and blood cultures resulted positive for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus casseliflavus， therefore he received intravenous daptomycin in combination with piperacillin-tazobactam. Following the resolution of symptoms， all unnecessary drugs were suspended and intravenous 1 mg/kg/day dose of methylprednisolone was started， resulting in gradual improvement of erythroderma and eosinophilia. On the third day，|删除段之间换行|as the patient developed a febrile relapse with positive blood cultures for Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC) enzyme producers， steroid therapy was suspended， and ceftazidime-avibactam treatment was set. Clinical improvement was again interrupted by a new febrile episode associated with reactivation of cytomegalovirus (16000copies/mL) and worsening of erythroderma. Foscarnet therapy induced resolution of fever and reduction of erythema and itching. A further biopsy was performed， and intravenous methylprednisolone was started again. The pathologist concluded that histological and molecular findings were referable to a non-specific inflammatory reaction. After the resolution of erythroderma  and negative viral tests， the patient was discharged with a follow-up prograr.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nErythroderma is a condition caused by several etiologies that result|删除段之间换行|in red inflamed skin on 80% to 90% or more ofthe body surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. The diagnoses of the underlying systemic or cutaneous disease can be remembered with the mnemonic SCALPID： Seborrheic dermatitis/sarcoidosis； contact dermatitis； atopic dermatitis/autoimmune diseases； lymphoma/leukemia； psoriasis/pityriasis rubra pilaris； ichthyoses， infestations (Norwegian scabies)； drug reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The most common disorders are contact dermatitis， atopic dermatitis， and psoriasis， along with drug reactions， while the most common malignancy is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>\n\nThe color of the skin can vary from pink-red to red-brown to deep red-purple， and pruritus is observed in up to 90% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The onset of scaling is typically seen 2 to 6 days after the onset of the erythema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. It varies in size and color， depending upon the stage of the erythroderma and nature of the underlying disease： In more acute phases scales are usually large and crusted， whereas in chronic states they tend to be smaller and drier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In cases of pre-existing dermatoses， nail changes may precede the erythroderma (e.g. pits in psoriasis or horizontal ridging in atopic dermatitis)， whereas others develop subsequently， for example they can become thick， dry， and brittle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. Colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus is common and can lead to secondary cutaneous infections as well as|删除段之间换行|bacteremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【11】A detailed history is crucial for diagnosing the underlying etiology： Patients must be asked about pre-existing medical conditions， allergies， medications， and skin diseases (atopic or other dermatitis， psoriasis， etc) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The presentation of erythroderma in individuals without a pre-existing skin disease is more common with drug-induced erythroderma or malignancy； compared with other causes， the onset of erythroderma secondary to medication is typically more sudden and rapidly progressing， the resolution is often quicker， and additional manifestations may be observed， like fever and peripheral eosinophilia， along with facial swelling， hepatitis， myocarditis， and allergic interstitial nephritis： This constellation of findings is referred to as DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Our patient reported no pre-existing dermatoses or allergies； he was recently started on valganciclovir， but there was no improvement despite its suspension， and eosinophilia already existed before. Furthermore， mites could not be identified from skin scraping examined microscopically， and a screening test panel for associated auto antibodies was negative， thus we performed a 4-mm punch biopsy. Histological examination showed parakeratosis， spongiosis， vacuolization in the basal layer， exocytosis1of lymphocytes and granulocytes， inflammatory infiltrate in the dermis (with predominantly CD4+ T lymphocytes， histiocytes and granulocytes， but a moderate amounts of ezsinophils) and edema of the dermis.\n\n【12】Histological findings were compatible with1paraneoplastic erythroderma， idiopathic erythroderma and atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Tests for multiple myeloma showed no evidence of disease activity， so we excluded this possibility. Erythroderma is labeled as idiopathic in9% to 47% of cases (this group is composed mainly of older adult men with a chronic and relapsing course of pruritic erythroderma) and longitudinal monitoring of patients with idiopathic erythroderma may reveal undiagnosed cutaneous T-celllymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>，therefore we performed a second biopsy to enhance the accuracy ofhistopathologic diagnoses， but it excluded again a lymphoproliferative disease and showed a non-specific inflammatory pattern. Acute lesions of atopic dermatitis show spongiosis， intracellular edema in the lower epidermis， exocytosis of lymphocytes， a perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes and macrophages around vessels of the superficial plexus， mast cells in different stages of degranulation， and occasional eosinophils 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The presence of dermal eosinophilic infiltrates is a characteristic histological feature observed in skin biopsies from patients with erythrodermic atopic dermatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis remains clinical， as there is currently no reliable biomarker that can distinguish the disease from other entities： An elevated total and/or allergen-specific serum IgE level is not present in about 20% of affected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u> as well as in our patient.

We|删除段之间换行|believe that cytomegalovirus might have been a trigger of the cell-mediated immune response that unleashed an erythrodermic onset of atopic dermatitis.

Hafez et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> found that active subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with atopic dermatitis and may have possible immunomodulatory role in the etiopathogenesis， even if it is not related to disease severity. Docke et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> suggest that active， subclinical cytomegalovirus infection is more frequent in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis and may have immunopathological relevance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.

Specifically， any potential drugs inducing erythroderma must be stopped. Early diagnosis is paramount as it allows early treatment and prevention oferythroderma-associated morbidity and mortality. It is very important to recognize atopic dermatitis as a cause of erythroderma， especially in a patient with late onset of the disease and no personal or familial history of allergic diseases.

Delecluse first reported 16 cases of PBL， all of which occurred in the oral cavity， of which15 cases were accompanied by HIV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Later， it was found that PBL also occurred in people with normal immune function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u>. Our study demonstrated that patients with PBL were immunocompetent and the prognosis seems to be better than that reported by western countries通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of PBL remains largely unknown and the prognosis was still poor and it is urgent to develop new targets and agents.\n\n【8】China\n\n【9】Here， we reported a male patient with HIV V negative PBL with rapidprogression after chemotherapy followed by ASCT.\n\n【10】通用间距删除-1:<u>Citation：</u>\n\n【11】A 57-year-old Chinese male presented in November 2021 with multiple lymph nodes enlargement which was detected by computed tomography for lung during physical examination. No systematic symptom was observed and he was negative for HIV test. The patient was referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT examination and extensive 18F-FDG positive mass involving lymph nodes throughout the body (cervical， mediastinal and hilar) and pancreas were detected . No evidence of lymphoma was observed by bone marrow biopsy of the right iliac crest. A biopsy of the supraclavicular lymph node indicated a B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma with plasmablastic morphology and immunohistochemistry results showed that CD38， Mum-1， CD30， Bcl-2， c-Myc were positive while CD20， CD79a， Bcl-6，CD10， CD138， CD30， CD138， PAX-5， TIA-1，CD4，CD8， CD7， CD43. The ki-67 expression was nearly 100% and EBV-Encoded small RNA (EBER)-1/2 was positive.\n\n【12】Laboratory examination was as follows： White blood cells 8500/uL， hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL， platelets 340，000/uL； the lactate dehydrogenase， serum calcium and immunoglobulin levels were at normal ranges； following the PET/CT and biopsy results， the patient received 5 cycles of DA-\n\n【13】EPOCH chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide，doxorubicin， vincristine， etoposide， prednisone). The metabolic activity decreased significantly and the patient achieved partial remission as determined by PET/CT . This patient received Autologous hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (ASCT) as consolidation therapy after chemotherapy. However， disease progression occurred and brain metastases was revealed by MRI two months after ASCT . The patient died around three months after ASCT and the overall survival time was around 11 months.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】PBL was classified as a special subtype of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) in the 2016 World Health Organization(WHO) classification of lymphoid and hematopoietic diseases. Although previous studies showed that PBL mainly occurred in the HIV positive population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， recent research demonstrated that most of the reported cases of PBL in China were elderly with normal immune function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nThe most common sites of HIV negative PBL were oral cavity， followed by gastrointestinal tract， lymph node and skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>. The|删除段之间换行|pathomorphological features of PBL were unique， the tumor cells had immunocytoblast/plasmablastic morphology but showed plasma cell markers， with weakly expressed or no expression of mature B cell markers such as CD20， PAX-5， CD3， CD45. CD56Was expressed in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】PBL is characterized by high recurrence and mortality rates and poor overall prognosis. At present， there is no standard treatment regimen for PBL. Surgery and radiotherapy are mainly used for early cases with local involvement. Anthracycline-containing regimens such as CHOP or CHOP-like regimens are commonly used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4，7\\]</u>. However， the duration of remission obtained by chemotherapy is short， and ASCT shows greater feasibility， especially for patients with high risk factors. A retrospective analysis of 9 HIV-negative PBL patients from Moffitt Cancer Center in the United States was conducted. Four patients received ASCT as consolidation therapy after complete remission (first complete remission) as first-line therapy. The survival time was 13.3 months and 36.5 months， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for HIV-negative PBL has rarely been reported. The patient in our study received ASCT after achieving PR， however， brain metastasis occurred and the survival time was 11 months.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】HIV-negative PBL is an aggressive disease and most of the patients are in late stage. ASCT may be a better treatment option for HIV-negative PBL patients. However， since PBL is rare， it is difficult to achieve single-center research， and prospective and multi-center collaboration is still needed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

However， angular measurements accounted for 100% skeletal expansion and 0% of alveolar bone bending and dental tipping in both sides. For the female case，linear measurements suggested47.79% and 51.7% of skeletal expansion， 10.91% and 20.47% of alveolar bone bending， and 41.6%and 27.83% of dental tipping for right and left side.

Traditional linear system could underestimate orthopedic effects and overestimate dentoalveolar side effects. Angular measurements should be preferred.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Rapid Palatal Expansion (RPE) was first described by E.C. Angell in 1860 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Since then， many types of RPE appliances have been developed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2-4\\]</u> with different rates of expansion， but the principles are essentially the same 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Palatal expanders separate the midpalatal suture， leading to skeletal orthopedic expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. RPE also opens the circum-maxillary sutural systems depending on their anatomic location and degree of interdigitation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，8\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Because conventional RPE appliances by design transmit the expansion forces through the teeth， alveolar bone bending and dental tipping are inevitable， particularly in older patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. To ensure expansion of the basal bone without surgical intervention while attempting to minimize dental side effects， micro-implants have been utilized in conjunction with RPE devices， known as Microimplant-Assisted Rapid Palatal Expanders (MARPE) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-14\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Although MARPE appliances have been designed to enhance the orthopedic effect of maxillary expansion， dental tipping and alveolar bone bending has been reported in previous studies from RPE/MARPE appliances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10，13-16\\]</u>. Additionally， past studies have relied solely on linear measurements with no consideration to the rotational nature of the maxillary expansion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\nThere is no consensus regarding the fulcrum anatomic location of the maxillary bone during|删除段之间换行|maxillary expansion. Some studies have reported this center of rotation to be localized at the frontomaxillary suture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，18-20\\]</u> while others point it close to the superior orbital fissure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21，22\\]</u>. A recent Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) study with Midfacial Skeletal Expander (MSE) has established that the zygomatic bone and maxilla move as a unit consistently， with its fulcrum slightly above the frontozygomatic suture in the coronal plane 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Since the expansion with MSE is Archial in nature and the fulcrum location can be defined， perhaps an angular measurement system should be used to assess the expansion pattern ofthis appliance.\n\n【10】This methodological paper aims to present a novel angular measurement systemthat can accurately represent the MSE expansion outcomes having as a reference the precise localization of the rotational fulcrum of the zygomaticomaxillary complex in the coronal plane.\n\n【11】Materialand Methods\n\n【12】Institutional review board approval (IRB number 16-001662) was granted by the University of California， Los Angeles (UCLA). Two cases are presented， consisting of pre-treatment and post-expansion CBCT records of a 20 years old male and an 18 years old female， who were treated with MSE (Biomaterials Korea， Seoul，Korea) appliance. The patients were diagnosed with maxillary transverse deficit and posterior crossbite， without craniofacial irregularity nor previous orthodontic treatment. Treatment was performed at the Section of Orthodontics， UCLA School of Dentistry， under supervision of one clinician.\n\nMSE was indicated in lieu of traditional tooth-borne expanders， based on patients’ maturity and cervical vertebral maturation stage higher than CS4 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. An MSE device  consists of a jackscrew unit with four holes， housing the palatal micro-implants which engage the palatal bone bicortically. Additionally， two|删除段之间换行|supporting arms extend from the jackscrew and are soldered to the molar bands. The rate of expansion was 2 turns per day (0.25 mm per turn) until a significant diastema of 2 mm to 3 mm. appeared； then the rate changed to 1 turn per day. MSE activation was stopped when the maxillary skeletal width， defined in Figure 1， matched or was greater than the mandibular width. The MSE was maintained in place with no further activation for at least 6 months during the restructuring of the suture.\n\n【14】The CBCT scans were taken before expansion and within 3weeks after completion of the expansion. The time between the scans was 3 months for both patients. In order to assess the outcomes induced purely by MSE， the post-expansion scans were obtained before patient received any other orthodontic appliances. A CBCT scanner (5G； NewTom， Verona， Italy) was used， with an 18 cmx16cm field of view， 14-bit gray scale， and a standard voxel size of 0.3mm. Configuration of the CBCT included scan time of 18 sec (3.6sec emission time)， with 110 kV. An automated exposure control system was used to detect the patient s anatomic density， to properly adjust the milliamperes. On demand 3D (Cybermed， Daejeon，Korea) software was used for superimposing the pre-expansion and post-expansion CBCT images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Localization of fulcrum\n\nAfter superimposition of CBCT images， the following steps were taken to localize the fulcrum of the zygomaticomaxillary complex. The maxillary sagittal plane was identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， passing through the anterior nasal spine， posterior nasal spine， and nasion on the pre-expansion CBCT image . Then the coronal zygomatic section  was selected. This section passes through the uppermost point of the frontozygomatic sutures and the lowermost point of the zygomaticomaxillary sutures. The previous study by Cantarella 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> indicated that fulcrum is near the external surface of the frontozygomatic suture because the suture is the weakest point during the Archial movement of midfacial structure. The most external and inferior points of the zygomatic processes of the frontal bones were chosen as initial reference points. The interfrontal distance between these two reference points were measured on both pre-and post-expansion CBCT images . If these two measurements were different， the correct fulcrum points must be more superiorly located. A parallel line slightly above the initial interfrontal line was used to identify the true fulcrums by incrementally moving this line upwards until both pre- and post-expansion distances were equal. This newly established line with no width changes was named the modified interfrontal distance， and the most external points of this line were denoted as the right and left rotational fulcrum respectively(Case 1， ). If the initial interfrontal distances (pre- and|删除段之间换行|post-expansion) were the same， the most external points of this|删除段之间换行|line can be denoted as right and left rotational fulcrum points. To verify this， a parallel line slightly below the initial interfrontal line was used to confirm that the post-expansion distances were greater than the pre-expansion. In this situation， the modified interfrontal line is the same as initial interfrontal line (Case 2， ). To further verify the true center of rotation， two different landmarks in the zygomatic bone were chosen and the angular displacement was measured around this proposed fulcrum point. One landmark was the zygomaticomaxillary suture and the other landmark was easily definable corresponding landmarks within the zygomatic bone in both pre- and post-expansion CBCT . The angles formed between the modified interfrontal line and the line connecting the proposed fulcrum to two chosen landmarks were measured. The changes in pre- and post-expansion values were identical for the|删除段之间换行|two measurements within each zygoma in all cases， confirming the accuracy of the fulcrum locations .\n\n【17】Novel angular measurement system\n\nFrom the rotational fulcrum， three angular measurements were selected to differentiate the skeletal， alveolar and dental components of the expansion. The following angular measurements were selected： The Frontozygomatic Angle (FZA) is an angle between the interfrontal line and the line extending from fulcrum to the most external point of the zygomaticomaxillary suture， the Fronto-Alveolar Angle (FAA) is an angle between the interfrontal line and the line extending from fulcrum to the alveolar bone surface at the level of distobuccal root tip ofthe upper first molars， and the Fronto-Dental Angle (FDA) is an angle between the interfrontal line and|删除段之间换行|the line extending from fulcrum to the occlusal point located at the central groove of the upper first molar . For FAA， a line parallel to the interfrontal was moved down until it contacted the tip of the root， and the alveolar surface that intersects the line was chosen. These three different angles were measured on both sides， and the pretreatment value was subtracted from the post-expansion value in order to determine the treatment change for each component. The FZA changes correspond to the zygomaticomaxillary expansion， a true skeletal expansion (FZA changes)； the FAA changes correspond to the sum of the skeletal expansion (FZA change) and the alveolar bone bending (FAA changes-FZA changes)； and the FDA changes correspond to the sum of the skeletal expansion (FZA changes)，\n\n【19】alveolar bone bending (FAA changes-FZA changes) and the dental tipping (FDA changes-FAA changes).\n\nWith the same coronal zygomatic section， a set of traditional linear distance measurements were employed . The Zygomaticomaxillary Line (ZML)， the Alveolar Bone Line (ABL)， and the Dental Line (DL) are perpendicular lines connecting the three landmarks used for the above angular measurements to the intersecting points on the maxillary sagittal plane. The changes in the three sets of linear measurements， before and after the MSE treatment， were calculated for both sides in order to determine the treatment change of each component. The ZML changes describes|删除段之间换行|the Zygomaticomaxillary skeletal changes (ZML changes)； the ABL changes as the sum of the skeletal change (ZML change) and the alveolar bone bending (ZML changes-ABL changes)； and the DL changes as the sum of the skeletal change (ZML change)， alveolar bone bending (ZML changes-ABL changes) and the dental tipping(DL changes-ABL changes).\n\n【21】Statistical analysis\n\n【22】All measurements were obtained three times by 2 raters， to assess method reliability. Measurements were then repeated after 2 weeks by the same operators. Additionally， to compare linear and angular measurements for the two selected cases， both linear and angular measurements of the three components were transformed to relative percentages from the total expansion， the fronto-dental changes.\n\n【23】Results\n\n【24】The amounts of activation of the MSE expansion jackscrew were11.5 for the male patient and 7.5 for the female patient. The duration of maxillary expansion was 23 and 15 days respectively.\n\n【25】For the male case selected， the treatment change with linear measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 4 mm and 3.95mm (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0.77 mm and0.49 mm. (right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 1.61 mm and 1.7 mm. (right and left sides). These values suggest 62.7% and64.33% (right and left sides) skeletal expansion， 12.06% and 7.98%(right and left sides) alveolar bone bending， and 25.24% and 27.69%(right and left sides) dental tipping. In contrast， the treatment change with angular measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 4.3and 4.4 (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0 (both right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 0° (both right and left sides). These values represent 100% skeletal expansion for the right and left sides， 0% alveolar bone bending and dental tipping for the right and left sides .\n\nFor the female case selected， the treatment change with linear measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 1.61 mm and1.97 mm (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0.37 mm|删除段之间换行|and 0.78 mm. (right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 1.41mm and 1.06 mm. (right and left sides). These values suggest 47.79%and 51.7% (right and left sides) skeletal expansion， 10.91% and20.47% (right and left sides) alveolar bone bending， and 41.6% and27.83%(right and left sides) dental tipping. In contrast， the treatment change with angular measurements at the zygomaticomaxillary level was 2° and 2.1 (right and left sides)， at the alveolar bone level was 0o(both right and left sides)， and at the dental level was 0.3° and 0.4(both right and left sides). These values represent 89.96% and 84%of skeletal expansion for the right and left sides， 0% alveolar bone bending for right and left sides and dental tipping of 13.04% and 16%for the right and left sides respectively . For the considered parameters， the ICC value was 0.95.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\nEach expansion device produces expansion force directed at different parts of craniofacial structure， depending on its design and the means of anchorage. The expansion pattern can greatly vary from one appliance to another. MacGinnis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> illustrated the difference between MSE and Hyrax using FEM simulation. A study on FEM located the fulcrum around the upper border of the orbit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， while others stated that is placed near the frontomaxillary suture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18，20，26\\]</u>. Other studies on FEM mention that the maxillary center of rotation is located near the superior orbital fissure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，27\\]</u>； that in agreement with the results of Gardner and Kronman 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u> in a study with rhesus monkeys.

The MSE has a unique feature， promoting skeletal movement in Archial Imanner， around the fulcrum located near the frontozygomatic sutures. Cantarella 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> has illustrated this effect but the precise location of the fulcrum was not clearly defined， only indicating that it is near the frontozygomatic suture. In the current study， additional steps were taken to further define the true points of rotation. The interfrontal distance which connects two fulcrums should not change with the expansion.

By applying these concepts， the fulcrum positions were identified. Arbitrarily， the most external and inferior points of the right and left zygomatic processes of the frontal bone were used for initial interfrontal distance measurements. If the distance changed with expansion， the line was moved upward until the distance was|删除段之间换行|stable (Case 1). If this initial interfrontal distance did not change， the line was moved downward and verified that the distance increased below the initial reference points (Case 2). Once these fulcrum points were established， one additional step was taken， in order to ensure that these were truly the points of rotation.

The displacement of two separate landmarks within a zygomatic process around the proposed fulcrum were measured， and they showed uniform displacements， indicating the fulcrum position was accurate .\n\n【33】The fulcrum positions for these two individuals were identified by the findings from previous studies of MSE and by applying additional measurements； however， the fulcrum position may vary greatly with other expansion devices because of the design differences described above. Since most of the expansion devices lack fulcrum information， the pattern of expansion was customarily described by linear width changes of various points within the structures. If the skeletal movement was Archial in nature as seen in MSE cases， the differential movements measured by these linear distances introduce inherent error. The linear distance changes were greater for the landmarks further away from the fulcrum， falsely exaggerating the magnitude of alveolar bone bending and dental tipping . This effect was examined by applying both linear measurements often used traditionally and novel angular measurements stemming from the fulcrum points.\n\nTwo MSE cases were selected to illustrate the difference between the angular andlinear measurements. The first case was a male patient who had received MSE treatment with optimal quality expansion. When the angular measurements were employed ， the results clearly indicated that there was no alveolar bone bending or dental tipping， but the entire movement was a skeletal rotation from the fulcrum， identified from the first part of this study. On the other hand， the linear measurements  yielded different results with exaggeration of the dentoalveolar components： 12% R and 8% L bone bending， and 25% R and 28%L dental tipping . Because the movement was in Archial configuration， the structures further away from the fulcrum were displaced more . These discrepancies inlinearlength change can be misinterpreted as the alveolar bone bending and the dental tipping were significant components of the expansion. However， the angular measurements indicated that the expansion was purely|删除段之间换行|skeletal， with midfacial rotation and with no additional bone bending or dental tipping. With MSE， both zygomatic bone and maxilla were rotating around the fulcrum， without significant bone bending or dental tipping 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The MSE is placed at the palatal vault， close to the center of resistance， and the micro-implants were engaged bicortically promoting superior expansion. The MSE produced an orthopedic response， causing the fulcrum to be near the weaker frontozygomatic suture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The best way to differentiate the percentage of skeletal expansion， alveolar bone bending and dental tipping for MSE is to use the angular measurements from this fulcrum. This novel measurement system can eliminate the inherent error associated with the linear distant measurements discussed above.\n\n【35】The second case was a female patient who has a successful split of midpalatal suture but with difficulties， yielding some tipping of the implants during the expansion . Some bone bending and dental tipping was anticipated with this patient， and this case was chosen to prove that the novel angular measurements can illustrate these changes. The angular measurements  indicated that most of the expansion was skeletal (87%R and 84%L). There was no alveolar bone bending but some dental tipping (13% R and 16% L). As the implants tipped during the expansion， the molars experienced some buccal tipping， but the alveolar process did not move further away from the zygoma as the midfacial complex was rotating from the fulcrum . On the other hand， the linear measurements yielded very different results with exaggeration of the dentoalveolar components 11% R and 20% L bone bending， and42% R and 28% L dental tipping . These sets of numbers indicate entirely different expansion pattern， emphasizing that linear measurements are severely inaccurate in assessing Archial movement， as seen in MSE.\n\nIn the past， many studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10，13-16，20，30\\]</u> have evaluated the maxillary expansion outcomes with linear measurements. Assuming that the fulcrums of these changes were above the landmarks they have chosen for the distance measurements， the linear distance changes for the alveolar bending and dental expansion were probably exaggerated， simply by the fact that these landmarks were further|删除段之间换行|away from the fulcrum. If we assume that the skeletal expansion is Archial in nature， the intermolar distance will increase more than the skeletal components， even with pure skeletal rotation. The actual dental tipping may be much less than the reported values. However， the angular measurements can also have inherent errors if they are measured from the wrong fulcrum. The fulcrum location may vary with each appliance， and the origin of the angular measurements must be identified.\n\n【37】Obtaining the accurate measurements differentiating skeletal， dentoalveolar and dental expansion is a difficult task， as illustrated above. Two conditions must be met in order to produce accurate valuation： The identification of the true fulcrum and the designing of the angular measurements from this fulcrum. Each appliance presumably has different fulcrum location， and it is important to identifythe accurate position. With MSE， the fulcrum waslocated near the frontozygomatic suture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In this study， this area was further explored， in order to define the precise fulcrum position， utilizing the superimposed CBCT images，acquired before and after the expansion. Subsequently， the three angular measurements from this fulcrum were used to differentiate skeletal， alveolar and dental components of the expansion. By using these angular measurements radiating from the fulcrum， the above-mentioned problems with linear distance measurements can be eliminated. This new mathematical approach illustrated that commonly used linear analysis may not be the best way to assess the differential components of maxillary expansion.\n\n【38】Tn thiIsSstudythe precise rotational fulcrumof the zygomaticomaxillary complex after MSE treatment was determined， and a novel angular measurement system that accurately assesses the expansion outcomes has been developed. The results obtain from the cases in this study are not representative for all the MSE cases. These cases were selected to illustrate a novel methodology that can accurately assess expansion of MSE. A further study will be conducted in order to assess the overall impact of MSE treatment，by applyingthe method developed in this study to all MSE cases. Further studies in defining the fulcrum locations for other expansion appliances would be beneficial in accurately determining the expansion outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

At the age of 25 months of age he hospitalized again with symptoms ofencephalitis and was treated for 15\n\ndays， during that period his neuroimage of brain have shown hyper intensity on right hemisphere in T2WI， FLAIR and DWI with normal ventricles . MRA of brain， cardiac evaluation， metabolic screening， coagulation profile， EEG findings all were normal. At the age of 40 months he came to us with history of recurrent fall， weakness of left side of body and recurrent seizure in the form of myoclonic jerks. His antenatal and perinatal history was uneventful. His developmental age was age appropriate up to 18 months of age before the attack of meningoencephalitis then there is stagnation of motor， cognitive and speech development. He is anthropometrically well thrived and vaccinated as per EPI schedule. On examination|删除段之间换行|there is no facial dysmorphism， OFC 48 cm which lies above 10\"centile on centile chart. On neurological examination he is conscious， cooperative， no sign of meningeal irritation， no cranial nerve palsies， motor examination reveals hypertonicity present in left upper and lower limb with brisk deep tendon reflexes， plantar extensor on left. His motor developmental age around 18 months， speech and cognitive age corresponds the age of 18. Interictal EEG showed right fronto-temporo parietal discharge with generalized slowing of background activity . Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) showed hyper intensity on T2WI and FLAIR images on the whole right cerebral hemispheres with leptomeningeal enhancement Right lateral ventricles are effaced . Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) of brain shows decrease NAApeak and|删除段之间换行|normal choline peak. His routine blood and CSF investigations all are within normal limits. On the basis of clinical criteria based on European consensus criteria proposed on 2005 we diagnosed the case as Rasmussen's encephalitis and started Inj. Methylprednisolone at a dose of 30 mg/kg for 5 days followed by oral prednisolone 2mg/kg for one month and tapering for next one month along with antiepileptics levetiracetam and clobazam. With this treatment his clinical improvement obtained and complained no seizure activity for last 3 months. Now he can ran and able to talk two word sentence. Parents were advised to come for follow up visit regularly； they were also counseled about the nature and treatment plan of the disease and also instructed to continue his physiotherapy， speech therapy and cognitive behavior therapy.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Here we report a case of a three year six month old boy presented with recurrent focal seizure， weakness of one side of body after 18months of normal development. Diagnosis of RE is based on clinical and neuro-radiological criteria based on European consensus criteria proposed on 2005 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Progressive neuroimaging deterioration indicates the chronic inflammatory nature of the disease.\n\nThis disorder is rare and usually affects children with median age of onset 6 years， but our patient presents at early age. Delayed presentation may also reported by Klaa et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. There is no gender preference. RE almost in every patients involved one hemisphere of brain which progressively atrophied in the course of time， typical disease course usually follow the pattern of variable prodromal period which is usually contains minor sign and symptoms of viral fever then the patients enters in to the acute stage which is characterized by progressive deterioration of functions of the affected hemispheres like hemiparesis， hemianopia， cognitive deterioration， aphasia and predominantly intractable unilateral focal motor seizure with or without secondary generalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. Epilepsia Partialis Continua (EPC) in the form of focal myoclonic twitching of facial muscles or muscles of distal extremities persisted for more than one hour with seizure free interval less than ten seconds is one of the characteristics features of RE that may present among half of the patients. Some patients may present without any evidence of seizures. Acute stage of the disease usually persists around 8 to 10months thereafter a phase of residual stage came which have a stable neurological deficit but seizure activity remains high but low|删除段之间换行|compared to acute stage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8-10\\]</u>. Several studies has been carried out to search the etiology of RE，Rasmussen and their colleagues in their index paper suggested slow viral infection as a causative factors but still it is neither established nor excluded as a causal association 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Antibody mediated pathogenetic hypothesis originated in 1994， antibodies to subunit 3 of the AMPA receptor (Glu R3 antibodies) had been suggested to dominate pathogenesis. Other anti-neuronal antibodies such as Munc-18， and the alpha7-acetylcholine receptor were identified in some patients with RE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14\\]</u>. Function of cytotoxic T cells is now considered in the pathogenesis of RE， where affected hemispheres found to be infiltrated with cytotoxic CD8+T cell， astrocytic degeneration caused by cytotoxic T lymphocyte attack give rise to neuronal cell death and seizure induction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Abnormal Electroencephalography (EEG) as slow background with slow focal and epileptic abnormalities in the lesion hemisphere present in the acute stage later on interictal abnormal discharge may appear on unaffected hemispheres 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Brain MRI is one of the best tools for diagnostic evaluation and to assess the prognosis of the disease， at the early stage unilateral hyper intensity in T2， FLAIR image noticed in the cortical， subcortical region， then unihemispheric atrophy sets on， our case typically follow those changes. Most of the tissue loss happens from the 12 months onset of symptoms. Usually post contrast enhancement less commonly present in RE. Functional imaging like Flurodeoxyglucose-Positron Emission Tomography(FDG-PET) shows diffuse hypometabolism of affected segment通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，18\\]</u>. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) studies showed decreased N-Acetyl-Aspartate (NAA) levels and increased or normal choline peaks resulting in a decreased NAA/Cho-ratio suggestive of neuronal loss or dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，19\\]</u>.\n\n【21】As the etiology is still clearly not known so the treatment is aimed to symptoms and inflammation， to control seizure and to prevent further deterioration of neurological deficit effective AEDs， immunotherapy and surgery are the main modalities of treatment. Immunosuppressive， immunomodulatory and antiviral treatment approaches have been tried in different studies， among them corticosteroid found to be effective on seizure control and neurological improvement. Forlong term steroid therapy started with bolus methylprednisolone 20 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg， followed by oral prednisolone 1 mg/kg to 2 mg/kg for months then slow tapering. Here in our patients we followed the regimen with significant improvement in seizure remission and also there is improvement observed in motor， speech and cognitive domain. IVIG and IVIG plus steroid other modalities of immunotherapy also found effective by some reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Tacrolimus also found as superior outcome regarding neurological function but not found as effective as seizure control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Other immunotherapies targeting to T-cells like cyclophosphamide， natalizumab and alemtuzumab helps to reduce the inflammatory reaction of RE patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Epilepsy surgery may consider in case of refractory epilepsy for seizure control but neurological deficit could not be avoided. Functional hemispherectomy and hemispherotomy are associated with lower complications compared to anatomical hemispherectomies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【22】As the etiology of the disease is still controversial so specific managementapproach detected at F pathogenic factors， most work is now directed to the activation of infiltration CD8+ T cells and microglia to ensure the alternative of surgical management. Early suspicion at early stage with proper management to halt the inflammatory process will help to prevent neurological deficits.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】Rasmussenencephalitis is a rarechroni1cCprogressive unihemispheric inflammatory disease manifested with recurrent focal seizure， hemiparesis and neurocognitive deterioration. Neuroimage， EEG findings， early suspicion with exclusion of possible differential diagnosis may help to diagnose the patients earlier and will add better prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It has a wide range of symptoms as well as complications from fatigue to loss of consciousness. Although a lot of factors can cause low sodium levels， combining specific medications can lead severe hyponatremia in a rapid onset which can cause high mortality and morbidity. The objective of this case report was to underline that prescribing specific medications disregarding their side effects can cause this common electrolyte imbalance but in a more severe manner. In this case report， we present a 46-year-old male patient with serum sodium level of 104 mEq/L who consumed hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension and was under treatment with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) for major depression. Patient had tonic-clonic seizures at the second hour of the treatment and intubation was needed due to loss of consciousness and hypoxia. After proper replacement ofsodium with hypertonic solutions in intensive care unit for nine days， extubation was indicated. Even in healthy young males， hyponatremia due to two separately prescribed medications can lead life threatening hyponatremia. Physicians should be aware of the side effects of diuretics， especially hydrochlorothiazides and SSRIs and their combinations.\n\n【2】Keywords： Diuretics； Hydrochlorotiazide； Hyponatremia，SSRI\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hyponatremia is defined when sodium levels are decreased less than 135 mEq/L 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Most of the time the severity of hyponatremia is mostly mild or moderate and the patients are generally asymptomatic. Main symptoms include nausea， vomiting， headache， lethargy， fatigue， apathy， disorientation， drowsiness， agitation， muscle cramps and convulsions. Physical examination shows findings of dehydration， decreased level of consciousness， ataxia， decreased deep tendon reflexes， presence of pathological reflexes， pseudobulbar paralysis， increased intracranial pressure syndrome，hypothermia， Cheyne Stokes respiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Severe hyponatremia primarily presents with central nervous system symptoms and findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Renal or cerebral water wasting， loss of sodium via gastrointestinal system or skin， specific medications and many more factors can cause hyponatremia. In our case， we present a patient with severe hyponatremia secondary to combination of two specific medications usage which necessitated intubation due to generalized seizures.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 46-year-old male patient， who was diagnosed with hypertension a month ago， applied to the emergency department of our hospital with complaints of headache lasting for 10 days and lately developed confusion. Further questioning implied that the patient had had many emergency room admissions due to severe hypertension attacks for a month. Medication for hypertension he used for a week included spironolactone 25 mg per oral (po)， once a day (qd)；hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg po， qd； perindopril indapamide 5 mg/1.25 mg po， qd. He had taken 100 mg captopril right before he applied to the emergency room.\n\nPhysical examination findings were confusion， limited cooperation and coordination. Blood pressure was 158/70 mmHg， pulse was 76 beats per minute with normal sinus rhythm，saturation was 99%， and temperature was 36.6°C at the time of admission. No specific findings were noted on the respiratory and gastrointestinal system examination. He had not had nausea， vomiting and diarrhea at the onset of symptoms. Laboratory results were as serum sodium of 104 mEq/L， glucose|删除段之间换行|level of 122 mg/dl， potassium level of 3.5 mEq/L， chloride was 67mEq/L， blood urine nitrogen was 19 mg/dl， creatinine was 0.96 mg/dl. Blood gas levels showed that pH： 7.5， HCO3： 25 mEq/L. Blood count was WBC： 15.000， Hb 13 g/dl and PLT 330000/ul. According to clinical examination， patient was assessed as euvolemic. Since his serum osmolality was 221 mosm/kg it was decided that patient had been having euvolemic hyponatremia and internalized to the internal medicine clinic. Sodium gap was calculated， and 3% hypertonic serum infusion had been started. When the hypertonic infusion was at the second hour， patient had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. The patient had gotten unconscious and became hypoxic due to aspiration. Consequently， he was intubated and transferred to intensive care unit of internal medicine clinic. Phenytoin infusion had been started as the first line intervention. Cranial imagings of the patient showed no pathological findings while thoracic imaging indicated air bronchograms and diffuse consolidations. Patient diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and treatment of 4，5 gr piperacillin -tazobactam four times a day had been started.\n\n【8】Intubated patient was followed up for nine days. Sodium depletion was replaced carefully during this period with 3% hypertonic sodium chloride solution. When sodium levels reached to 139 mEq/L，patient had become conscious again and ventilation requirement was no longer needed； patient was extubated. After 3 more days of follow up in intensive care unit with sodium replacement therapy with hypertonic sodium infusion and antibiotic regimen for aspiration pneumonia， satisfying results were obtained from laboratory tests indicating pneumonia regression and acceptable serum sodium levels. Patient's sodium levels by day were demonstrated on Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. Patient had gotten clinically better， was no longer in need for intensive care unit admission and discharged to internal medicine clinic.\n\n【9】Investigations for etiology of the hyponatremic case had been started ultimately. Spot urine sodium was <20 mEq/L. Thyroid function was normal as the results were as follows： TSH was1.18uIU/ml， free T3 level was 3.05 pg/ml and free T4 was 0.97 ng/dl. No pathologic results of urine sampling were noted other than ketone bodies which were 2+. Patient’s morning cortisol level was 10.2 mcg/dl and ACTH level was 51 pg/ml. Therefore， intravenous ACTH stimulation test was performed. Adrenal insufficiency was ruled out due to the satisfactory results of cortisol response. Patient's lab results for functions of hypophysial hormones were within normal ranges. As a result of all laboratory testing， patient's evaluation for etiology of the normovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia was ended up with drug related hyponatremia as known as drug induced hyponatremia. Patient's all prescribed medications were stopped，and hypertension management was done with 30 mg nifedipine two times a day per oral. Following blood pressure levels were within normal ranges. Serum sodium levels were noted in normal ranges during the inpatient followed up. No additional seizures were observed. After completion of the antibiotic regimen for aspiration pneumonia which was confirmed with laboratory results and clinical recovery， patient was discharged with satisfying outcomes.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\nHyponatremia as one of the most common electrolyte imbalances is caused by numerous factors disturbing the balance between water and sodium. The diagnosis and the treatment are essentially based on the etiologic factors. First and the foremost， main etiological factors causing hyponatremia should be assessed properly. In some cases， various factors， especially multiple drug usage， can|删除段之间换行|cause hyponatremia at once. Careful history taking and physical examination can make a physician distinguish whether the patient ishypovolemic， normovolemic or hypervolemic. Additionally， history of the patient can reveal that if the condition is acute or chronic， and the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In patients diagnosed with hyponatremia， serum osmolality should be calculated， and etiology of the imbalance should be investigated. In our case， patient had become symptomatic in a short period of time which was obtained by a detailed patient history pointing out that the patient's condition was acute. Additionally， patient had severe symptoms which also occurred acutely and had high mortality rates.\n\n【12】The symptoms of hyponatremia mostly depend on the onset and the severity of the imbalance. Mortality is caused by cerebral edema， which is precipitated by acute decrease in serum sodium levels， or by osmotic demyelination syndrome due to the aggressive replacement of sodium in chronic hyponatremia patients. Hence it is crucial to get aproperhistoryofthe patient to determine whether the hyponatremia developed in a short or long period of time. Our patient’s serum sodium levels were very low as he applied for an emergency care with very low sodium levels (104 mEq/L).\n\n【13】The variety of the drugs causing hyponatremia is increasing constantly. Underlying mechanism ofthe drugsleadinghyponatremia mainly can be divided into three categories which are drugs physiologically acting as Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH)， stimulating the secretion of ADH and creating a synergistic effect of ADH on renal response删除4:<u> 4</u>.\n\n【14】In a study conducted by Fenoglio et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， which focused on the most reported drugs causing iatrogenic hyponatremia， they revealed that 75.5% of the patients had syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion.Selectiveserotoninreuptake inhibitors(n=15)，antiepileptics(n=7)， proton pump inhibitors (n=7) or hormones， antipsychotics， antineoplastics were taken by those patients. Additionally， 12.2% of the participants who were diagnosed with hypoosmolar hypovolemic hyponatremia，thiazide diuretics were submitted as the main etiology. Our patient was newly diagnosed with hypertension and was taking his medications which were spironolactone， hydrocholorthiazide， perindopril， indapamide. Moreover， he was taking hydroxyzine and sertraline for his major depression which was prescribed by his physician.\n\nIn another study， Movig et al. compared the risk of hyponatremia caused by SSRIs and other antidepressants. Also， they compared combined use of diuretics with SSRI's or with other antidepressant：The results indicated that SSRI's were 4 times more potential to cause hyponatremia than other antidepressants. Additionally， the use of diuretics combined with SSRI's in elderly population had the highest risk ratio among others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Although our patient was relatively|删除段之间换行|younger than the patients in the study； severe hyponatremia was caused by combined medications he was using for his hypertension and his depression which all were prescribed by physicians.\n\n【16】Time onset of hyponatremia has a wide range from the first day of the consumption up to few months. In one study conducted by Liu BA and his friends， the mean time interval was estimated at 13days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The time interval was also short in our study which was about seven days； as the patient developed prominent symptoms after starting his antihypertensive treatment with hydrochlorothiazide.\n\n【17】In hospitalized patients with hyponatremia secondary to SSRI usage，10% ofthose needed intensive care and mortality rates are up to7%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Thus， exclusion ofother etiologic factors causinghyponatremia and early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. As mentioned above， our patient was in severe depletion of sodium which led him had tonic-clonic seizures， become hypoxic and unconsciousness which all are signaling high rate of mortality， separately.\n\n【18】Checking the serum sodium levels both before and after the treatment is recommended in patients who have multiple chronic diseases and under the treatment with multiple medications since they have higher risk for drug related hyponatremia. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，10\\]</u>. First treatment approach is discontinuation of the possible drug and providing supportive therapy. In patients under SSRI medication， diuretic prescription should be avoided to minimize the risk of hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Physicians should keep this in mind that commonly used drugs such as SSRIs or diuretics are causing severe hyponatremia with acute onset which leads mortality and morbidity. In a patient with acute hyponatremia symptoms careful questioning about medication history should be done. We strongly recommend that combination of SSRI with diuretics， especially with hydrochlorothiazide shouldnt be prescribed to any patient since they have severe complications by decreasing the serum sodium levels rapidly.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Histologically they appear as small round blue cells， but this is nonspecific with broad differentials. The ESWR1 break-apart rearrangement using fluorescence in-situ hybridization is pathognomonic for Ewing’s sarcoma. Patients with extra skeletal Ewing sarcoma family have a poor prognosis， with median survival ranging between 8 to 15 months in two different case series. Among patients with cancer，approximately 5% develop a critical illness requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We report a case of a young female who developed acute respiratory failure secondary to this rare malignancy that required intensive care treatment. Unlike other reported cases， our patient had a large lung and mediastinal mass with pleura but no bony involvement， associated massive pleural effusion necessitating chest tube insertion， subsequent intensive care admission with invasive ventilatory support. This case highlights the importance of supportive intensive care needed to treat this aggressive disease mainly affecting children and young adults.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Cancer patients who require treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) is growing. In a large retrospective observational study using cancer registry data in the United Kingdom， 5% of cancer patients developed a critical illness and were admitted to an ICU within 2 years of cancer diagnosis通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

We report a unique case of a young female who developed acute respiratory failure secondary to this rare malignancy that required intensive care treatment.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】This was a 30-year-old Indonesian female who was admitted in our hospital， a large tertiary hospital in Singapore. She was a non-smoker/non-drinker with no known past medical history and had no family history of malignancy， tuberculosis， or autoimmune disorder. She presented with dry cough for a month， associated with worsening shortness of breath and left sided pleuritic chest pain. This was accompanied by a loss of appetite and weight over the past 3 weeks.\n\n【8】On examination， she was tachypneic and lethargic， temperature 36.8°C， blood pressure 113/65mmHg， heart rate 97 per minute， pulse oximetry reading 98% on supplemental oxygen at 2 L/min. There were reduced breath sounds in the left lung， and no lymph nodes or breast lumps were palpable.\n\n【9】She had opacification of the left hemithorax with contralateral trachea shift on erect chest radiograph ， with massive pleural effusion found on ultrasound. A chest tube was placed which drained 1350 ml of hemoserous fluid. The pleural fluid was exudative by Light's criteria and lymphocytic (80%) on analysis. Fluid lactate de hydrogenase (LDH) was elevated at 962 U/L and fluid pH was 7.32. Fluid acid fast bacilli smear was negative and no growth was obtained from fluid bacterial cultures.\n\n【10】Computed tomography of the thorax， abdomen and pelvis showed a large heterogeneous mass in the left hemithorax and mediastinum， encasing the left main bronchus causing collapse of the left lung. There was a filling defect in the left main pulmonary artery， which was also encased by tumor. Extensive nodular pleural thickening in the left hemithorax was present， inseparable from the mass. There was also a moderate sized pericardial effusion. No bony erosions were identified. Enlarged upper left para-aortic nodes were noted with a short axis diameter of 1.6 cm. An ill-defined hypodense lesion was noted in the segment IVB of the liver measuring 1.8 cm x 1.4 cm. No enhancing cerebral masses were noted on subsequent contrasted computed tomography of the brain.\n\n【11】She underwent a radiological-guided lung biopsy. The specimen was fixed in 10% neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections(4-micron thick) were cut and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and periodic acid-schiff (PAS).\n\n【12】The core biopsy showed sheets of small， round， and blue cells， divided into irregular lobules by fibrous stroma. The tumor cells possessed scant cytoplasm and small nucleoli. At least two rosette-like formations were identified. Some rounded globule material in the cytoplasm was highlighted by the PAS stain.\n\nImmunohistochemical studies using commercial antibodies listed in Table 1 was performed. Protocols recommended by the manufacturers were used. Appropriate positive and negative controls were included. The tumor appeared to be diffusely positive with CD99 ， and was positive for CD56. The tumor cells were negative for AE1/3， CAM5.2， EMA， (CD45)LCA， CD79A， CD3， CD20， TdT， TTF-1， S100， Desmin， Synaptophysin， Chromogranin and ALK-1， which negate the differential diagnosis of an epithelial/|删除段之间换行|neuroendocrine carcinoma， lymphoma， and other ‘small round blue cell tumors'such as synovial sarcoma， desmoplastic small round cell tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma. The ki-67 proliferation index was high (around 10% to 15%).\n\n【14】A fluorescence in situ (FISH) study for EWSR1 (EWS RNA-binding protein 1) gene rearrangement with a break-apart 22q12probe (test developed by the Cytogenetics Laboratory， Department of Pathology， Singapore General Hospital) was performed. These dual-color fluorescent labeled probes hybridize the telomeric and centromeric flanking regions of EWSR1. Where fusion signals exist， no break apart is present. Cells with split signals are considered positive for the ESWR1 break-apart rearrangement， which is present in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. These findings were pathognomonic for Ewing's sarcoma in this context.\n\n【15】During her admission， she was later noted to be drowsy and found to be hypercapnic. She was intubated for type 2 respiratory failure and mechanically ventilated in the intensive care unit. Repeat chest radiograph showed a new right lower zone consolidation， so she was started on intravenous meropenem for hospital acquired pneumonia.\n\n【16】She was consequentlyinitiated on chemotherapywith Vincristine， Doxorubicin， Cyclophosphamide， and received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor post-chemotherapy. Her hospital course was complicated by diarrhea secondary to Clostridiumn difficile infection. This eventually resolved， and she was transferred back to her home country to continue further chemotherapy. Unfortunately， she was lost to follow up since then.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】This case report highlights the challenges managing a rare aggressive tumor in a young female patient.\n\n【19】Table 1： Antibodies used for the characterisation of the small round blue cell tumour.\n\n| Antigen  | Source\\  | Product Code  | Clone  | Antigen Retrieval Method  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AE1/3  | DAKO  | M3515  | AE1 and AE3  | Enzyme  |\n| CD3  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-CD3-565  | LN10  | HIFR  |\n| CD5  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-CD5-4C7  | 4C7  | HIFR  |\n| CD20  | DAKO  | M0755  | L26  | HIFR  |\n| CD45  | DAKO  | M0701  | 2B11+PD7/26  | HIFR  |\n| CD56  | NOVOCASTRA  | PA0191  | CD564  | HIFR  |\n| CD79a  | DAKO  | M7050  | JCB117  | HIFR  |\n| CK19  | DAKO  | M0888  | RCK108  | HIFR  |\n| Chromogranin A  | DAKO  | M0869  | DAK-A3  | HIFR  |\n| Desmin  | DAKO  | M0760  | D33  | HIFR  |\n| EMA  | DAKO  | M0613  | E29  | HIFR  |\n| Ki67  | DAKO  | M7240  | MIB1  | HIFR  |\n| P16  | Ventana  | 705-4713  | E6H4  | HIFR  |\n| S100  | DAKO  | Z0311  | Polyclonal  | Enzyme  |\n| Synaptophysin  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-SYNAP-299  | 27G12  | HIFR  |\n| TdT  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-TdT-339  | SEN28  | HIFR  |\n| TTF-1  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-L-TTF-1  | SPT24  | HIFR  |\n| EBER-ISH  | NOVOCASTRA  | AR0833  | N.A  | Enzyme  |\n| CD99  | NOVOCASTRA  | NCL-CD99  | H036-1.1  | HIER  |\n| ALK  | Ventana  | 790-4794  | D5F3  | HIFR  |\n\n【21】EMA： Epithelial Membrane Antigen， TDT： Terminal Deoxynucleatidyl Transferase； TTF-1： Thyroid Transcription Factor-1； EBER-ISH： Epstein-Barr Virus-Encoded Small RNAs-Insitu Hybridisation； ALK： Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase， HIER： Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval. \"Sources were as follows： Dako： Dako Denmark A/S， Glostrup， Denmark； Novocastra： Novocastra， Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd， Newcastle， United Kingdom； Ventana： Ventana Medical Systems Inc， Arizona， USA.\n\n【22】Small blue round cell tumors have a typical clear cytoplasm on hematoxylin and eosin staining， due to the presence of glycogen.

Over the past decades， the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is classified according to their histologic appearance from undifferentiated Ewing sarcoma (ES)， to atypical poorly differentiated ES and differentiated PNET.\n\n【24】In the 2013 World Health Organization classification of tumors of soft tissue and bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， the term PNET was removed to minimize confusion with the histologically and genetically different PNET of the central nervous system and female genital tract.\n\n【25】The Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) share similar immunohistochemistry， and is positive for MIC2 surface antigen(CD99 gene). Cytogenetically， the translocation t 通用删除7(英):<u>(11，22)</u> (q24； q12) is pathognomonic， occurs in 85% of cases and gives rise to the formation of the EWS-FLI 1 fusion gene which is detected by FISH.\n\nA Korean case series of 70 patients studied over 17 years reported the characteristics of extra skeletal Ewing sarcoma. Most primary tumors manifested as large and bulky soft-tissue masses (mean size，9.0 cm； range， 1.3 cm to 23.0 cm)， frequently invading adjacent organs|删除段之间换行|(45.6%) and showed heterogeneous enhancement (73.7%)， a well-defined (66.7%) margin， and partial necrosis or cystic degeneration(81.9%). Metastasis was most frequent to lymph nodes (75.9%)， followed by bone (31.0%)， lung (20.7%)， abdominal solid organs(13.8%)， peritoneum (13.8%)，pleura (6.9%)， and brain (3.4%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Ewing sarcoma family of tumors is highly aggressive， with common local recurrence and distant metastases. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor， node and metastases (TMN) staging systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> for primary tumors of bone and soft tissue sarcoma are not widely used for Ewing family of tumors， but are sometimes used for staging of Askin's tumors. Using the AJCC TNM staging system for soft tissue sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， our patient would be classified to have T2b (deep tumor/mediastinal involvement)， likely N1 (involvement of para-aortic and axillary regional nodes)， and M1with possible liver metastasis， consistent with stage III disease， stage IV ifhistologicallyconfirmed distant spread. tumors that arise outside skin or subcutaneous sites have a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Standard guidelines are absent for the treatment of Askin's tumors. However the main stay of treatment based on case series includes neo adjuvant chemotherapy， surgical resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【28】The median survival in Askin’s first case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> was 8 months. A Chinese case series of 11 patients (mean age 14.5 years old， range8-22 years old) with Askin tumor found that the median survival for combined (chemotherapy-surgery-radiotherapy) treatment was 15months. Poor prognosis was associated with tumor diameter >5 cm， LDH levels >240 U/l and late stage (stage III or IV) tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\nThe overall survival in sarcoma in the ICU is comparable with|删除段之间换行|other critically ill patients with other solid tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.

This case highlights the importance of supportive intensive care needed to treat this aggressive disease mainly affecting children and young adults. In youngpatients with expected good lung reserve， respiratory symptoms may manifest late in the natural progression of Askin tumors without external chest wall signs.

The common presentations of pseudo-TORCH syndrome are congenital microcephaly， developmental delay， and recurrent seizure，|删除段之间换行|on neuro-radiology intracranial calcification， simplified gyration and polymicrogyria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Here our case Afifa presented with recurrent seizure and delayed developmental milestones with family history of epilepsy. Our patient had no history of perinatal asphyxia. One study reported two patients with Pseudo-TORCH syndrome from a consanguineous family with complex heterogeneous presentation like early onset seizure， severe psychomotor development， visual impairment， chronic renal dysfunction， calcifications in thalami， basal ganglion and subcortical white mater， sanger sequencing identified a homozygous genomic rearrangement involving the OCLN gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. O'Driscoll et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> also reported their patient with some renal impairment Reardon et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> have reported patients with hepatosplenomegaly， platelet dysfunction and purpura along with seizure and microcephaly which mimics the presentation of TORCH infection， but in our case we didn’t find any renal， hematological or hepatobiliary abnormality. Eye manifestations like nystagmus， cortical visual impairment， corneal clouding， congenital cataract and microphthalmia was documented from different studies， we have only found convergent squint as eye manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>. Facial dysmorphism in the form of hypertelorism， microphthalmia，|删除段之间换行|micrognathia， high arched palate， low set ears and sloping forehead was observed by Monastiri et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> and Abdel-Salam et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Different cases presents with different manifestations with clinicoradiologic findings similar to congenital CMV infections but was negative for serology. One cases of pseudo-TORCH syndrome presented as Dandy-Walker syndrome which is a hindbrain deformity with large posterior fossa cyst， this presented was explained in that way that extensive calcium debris from pseudo-TORCH syndrome in cerebrospinal fluid lead to obstruction at fourth ventricle outlet that leads to hydrocephalus and enlargement of posterior fossa cyst with cerebellar compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. So the main difference of DWM from pseudo-TORCH syndrome is the presence of features of raised ICP in the DWM. Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS) is another inherited form microcephaly which may mimic the presentation of pseudo-TORCH syndrome， most of the cases it follows autosomal recessive inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.

Whereas the most common identified genetic mutations are the homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the OCLN gene located on chromosome 5q13 in pseudo-TORCH syndrome1， USP18 gene mutation on chromosome 22q11 associated with pseudo-TORCH syndrome 2 and STAT2 gene on chromosome 12q13mutation is associated with pseudo-TORCH syndrome 3 \\[2，4，101. Along with homozygous mutation of OCLN gene there are another two heterozygous mutation occurred in our cases for that reason our patient presented with recurrent seizure. Though the patients showed clinical and radiologic features of congenital CMV infection but she was negative for serology and due to presence of marital consanguinity we went for genetic study and finally patient diagnosed as a case of pseudo-TORCH syndrome.

It is isolated from patients receiving broad spectrum of antibiotics or long-term urinary catheter carriers. Its identification is one of the biggest challenges facing the laboratory because it is usually missed in routine urine cultures since it does not grow well after an overnight incubation. Thus， its diagnosis is often delayed due to the need for specific culture media， staining techniques and electron microscopy. Herein， we report one patient with clinical suspicion of Corynebacterium urinary infection. However， the isolation of the pathogen was highly demanding. The aim of this case report is to highlight the need of a multidisciplinary approach to diagnose this pathogen and the establishment of protocols to make easier its diagnosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Infection； Encrusted cystitis； Urinary stones； Corynebacterium Lipophile\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Encrusted Cystitis (EC) is a rare form of Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)， especially in children通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Is characterized by bladder， ureteral and pelvic encrustations causing pain， bladder necrosis and occasionally renal failure or death. Such encrustations are usually composed of ammonium magnesium phosphate and calcium carbonate-apatite crystals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Corynebacteria Species (CS) are the cause ofthis pathology； they are gram-positive slow-growing bacillus characterized with a strong urease activity infecting the lower and upper urinary tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. CS are frequently selected by repeated broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and are nosocomial acquired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】EC is treatable， but its diagnosis is often delayed. Despite suggestive symptoms and imagining features， diagnosis of EC is challenging given the need for specific culture media， staining techniques and electron microscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. There is no consensus of treatment， but multiple options have been suggested based on three complementary elements： Antimicrobial therapy； acidification of urine， chemolysis and elimination of encrustations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Here in， we report the importance of a multidisciplinary work between urologist， radiologist， microbiologist， anatomopathologist and infectiologists. After a clinical suspicion， specific staining techniques and electron microscopyare needed for its identification. In addition， due to its multiple resistances and the tissue adherence， the antibiotic treatment may be insufficient， and a multiple approach is needed.\n\nAn 18-year-old woman， with 10 years of repeated history of UTI， visited the urology department referring hypogastric pain， painful urination， and bladder stones expulsion. Normal uroflowmetry without postvoid residual urine. Laboratory workup did not reveal any clinically significant findings， except alkaline urine (pH 7.8). Standard urine culture was negative. Stone composition analysis revealed ammonium magnesium phosphate (struvite). CT pelvic scan showed thickening and calcification of the bladder wall . The patient went through an endoscopic transurethral resection， multiple solid neoformations coated by calcifications were resected (Figure|删除段之间换行|2). Anatomopathological analysis revealed intense mononudear leukocyte infiltration with focal calcified encrustations . The procedure exacerbated the pain.\n\n【9】Prompting a diagnosis ofEC， with pathogenic agent identification missing， a second endoscopic transurethral resection was performed. The anatomic pathology revealed again an intense mononudear leukocyte infiltration with focal calcified encrustations. Resected tissue culture for CU revealed few copies of the bacillus suggesting that urine cultures may be positive for CU infection. To confirm the species identification， PCR and sequencing was performed on the 18S ribosomal gene DNA of the bacteria isolate revealing a Corynebacterium Lipophile Group F1.\n\n【10】We started a combined therapy with levofloxacin 500 mg every 24haccordingtoantibiogram results，L-metionine and acetohidroxamic acid (125 mg every 8 h). Three weeks later an endoscopic removal was performed. After one month， the symptoms of frequency， urgency and suprapubic pain disappeared. Urinalysis was normal. Ultrasonography did not show any calcification of the bladder wall.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\nMany urea-splitting bacteria are responsible for EC， but CU (or Corynebacterium group D2) are the most frequent causative agent通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> and can be isolated from different samples including urine， blood and expelled encrustations in urine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. This fastidious and opportunistic slow-growing microorganism can be missed in routine cultures， requiring enriched media and prolonged cultures(>48 h). Hence， clinical suspicion should be communicated to the|删除段之间换行|microbiologist when samples are sent for culture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Another factor contributing to the delayed diagnosis is the lack of familiarity with EC and diphteroids reputation as colonizers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Progress in molecular taxonomy (DNA-DNA hybridization and 16S rRNA sequencing) and in chemotaxonomy has profoundly modified the classification of Corynebacterium species. Amplified rDNA analysis， and amplification of the 16S-23S gene spacer regions can differentiate between species that are difficult to be differentiated by biochemical reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. In our case， resected tissue culture revealed few copies ofthe bacillus suggesting that urine cultures may be positive for CU infection. To confirm the species identification， PCR and sequencing was performed on the 16S ribosomal gene， revealing a Corynebacterium lipophile group F1.\n\n【14】The correct identification is important because the antimicrobial susceptibilities of different coryneform bacterial isolates are quite variable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In addition， antibiotic therapy must be administered with urinary acidification 7，14.Endoscopiccresection of encrustations appears necessary to remove bacteria within calcified plaques (especially when cannot be dissolved by urine acidification therapy). This combined therapy should least until the mucosa is completely recovered and repeated urine culture is negative.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Encrusted cystitis is not a life-threatening disease but is a very painful condition. The delayed diagnosis and drug resistance of CU makes its treatment arduous. The identification of CU is one of the biggest challenges facing the laboratory and its diagnosis demands a multifocal approach.

This case suggests the possibility of use of ASV to negate the need for fasciotomies for compartment syndromes complicating snake bites.\n\nAn 11-year old previously healthy child presented with a history of snake bite on his left hand|删除段之间换行|index finger complicated with progressive painful swelling of his left upper limb. His parents immediately tried to stop the bleeding by sucking out the venom and applying traditional remedies over the wound， though no cuts were made. The parents noticed bruising， bleeding and gradual swelling then， a tourniquet was tied and the patient was brought to the nearest district hospital which was 2 h away. The swelling had progressed over the left wrist and extended half way up the forearm. The tourniquet was immediately removed at the hospital. Intravenous antibiotics and tetanus prophylaxis were administered. He did not have any bleeding or neurological symptoms. However overnight the swelling had progressed beyond the elbow joint and there was bruising and bullae formation over the bite site Painful finger movements on the left hand with absence of radial pulse were noted. The patient was then referred to the orthopedic surgeon at our hospital for management of compartment syndrome.\n\n【17】On examination there was swelling of the entire left upper limb extending onto the left shoulder joint. There was significant tenderness on palpation of forearm and arm muscles and pain on passive extension. Radial pulse was palpable. Capillary refill time on the finger beds was less than 3 sec. Local examination revealed evidence of severe envenomation including redness， swelling， blistering and underlying ecchymosis.\n\n【18】A diagnosis of compartment syndrome was made. Patient was initially planned for urgent fasciotomy. However， his 20 min Whole Blood Clotting Time (WBCT) was found to be prolonged and he also had prolonged pro thrombin time and International Normalized Ration (INR). In view of the rapidly progressive severe local envenomation signs and deranged coagulation profile， the decision to first administer polyvalent Anti- Snake Venom (ASV) was made， though at that time >24 h had elapsed since the bite. After discussion with the orthopedic surgeon， it was decided to continue ASV and to withhold fasciotomy unless there is no evidence of improvement.\n\n【19】During the course of administration of anti-venom， the patient developed early allergic reaction evidenced by cough， scratchy throat， and urticarial rashes and vomiting with presence of hematemesis. The reaction was immediately managed1 with fluids， oxygen， adrenaline， antihistamines and steroids. ASV was stopped and patient was monitored. With resolution of symptoms， the infusion was further diluted and slowly restarted at a slower infusion rate. Is coagulation profile was normalizing at 6 h. Overnight his swelling over the forearm reduced significantly and pain had reduced. With normalization of coagulation profile and improvement of compartment symptoms fasciotomy was withheld. He responded well despite late administration of ASV. His limb swelling drastically improved and was discharged on day 7 of admission.\n\n【20】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【21】Epidemiological data on snakebites in Bhutan remain limited.Of what is known and recorded， there are 69 species， of which 15 are venomous snakes belonging to two families， Elapidae and Viperidae删除4-1:<u>6</u>.\n\n【22】The timely administration of ASV remains the mainstay to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with snakebites. A retrospective study in Bhutan reported that around 35% of snake bites developed envenomation signs and symptoms. Polyvalent ASV was found to have excellent outcomes with only 7% mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Compartment syndrome involves the sustained elevation of interstitial tissue pressures within an osteofascial envelope to non-physiologic levels. It causes tissue injury leading to irreversible damage and， therefore， early recognition and treatment is critical for optimal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Alternatively， fasciotomy performed prophylactically may lead to worsened local myonecrosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In most cases of snakebite， fasciotomy is not necessary. Once administered， anti-venom helps neutralize the venom， reducing compartment pressure and inhibiting the development of compartment syndrome.\n\n【24】In our case， in view of deranged coagulation profile， a decision was made to defer fasciotomy and observe response to ASV. Gregory et al.， reiterates that fasciotomy should only be performed in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome that are present despite elevation of the affectedlimb and administration of 20vials of anti-venom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. A study by Hall noted that， out of 1，257 cases of extremity bites only two required fasciotomies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【25】In contrast， a recent study， where intra-compartmental pressures were measured for diagnosis of compartment syndrome， recorded a higher rate fasciotomies at 10.8%. As in the discussed case， the local and systemic envenomation effects of venom closely resemble the signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome. Fasciotomy， in the past， could have been withheld in patients with actual compartment syndrome， attributing the symptoms to the venom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Initiation of anti-venom should not be held for delayed presentation of snakebites. Prophylactic fasciotomies should be considered after correction of hematological parameters. Though controversial， it is still prudent to start ASV first with closely monitoring and consider surgery only if compartment symptoms persist with failed response to ASV. ASV can， not only reverse coagulopathy， but may also be helpful in reducing symptoms of compartment syndrome， thereby negating the need for fasciotomies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Currently， there is no such quantifiable measurement to guide towards a diagnosis. Unfortunately， although it is an easy parameter to obtain， no absolutely reliable Standard Uptake Value (SUV) threshold has been found that can be used to clinically differentiate benign from malignant uptake due to the similar mechanism of FDG accumulation between tumor cells and white blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Unexpected and incidental uptake foci in oncology PET/CT are relatively common.Given the increased uptake of 18F-FDG，infectious and inflammatory responses have the potential to be misinterpreted as metastatic disease. Following analysis of more than 1，000 patients undergoing 18F-FDG PET/CT， it has been reported in the literature通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> that more than a quarter of these scans contained foci of FDG uptake of benign origin attributed to infectious and non-infectious inflammation. Respiratory tract infections and brain infections were among the most common etiologies incidentally identified by PET/CT performed for oncological indications. The body responds to inflammatory stimuli with a cascade of events， including local hyperemia， release of proteins such as fibrin and immunoglobulins， andinfiltration of inflammatory cells.Inflammation exhibits18F-FDG uptake due to the recruitment of activated white blood cells(neutrophils and lymphocytes)， which have a high affinity for glucose transporters， particularly GLUT 1 and GLUT删除4:<u> 3</u>.\n\n【25】COVID-19 infection can lead to various imaging findings， as it is the great radiological mimic， as reported by Duzgun et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is well known that the most common imaging finding of COVID-19pneumonia is bilateral matted glass opacities accompanied by consolidation with thickening of interlobular or intralobular septa(crazy pavement pattern). Atypical findings are isolated lobar or segmental consolidation， interlobular septal thickening accompanied by pleural effusion， cavitations and solitary pulmonary nodules. Nodules represent one of the many facets of COVID-19 infection， with an incidence on CT scans of 3% to 12% in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Spontaneous regression of the solitary pulmonary nodule may be associated with the organization of pneumonia thathas been shown to occur secondary to COVID-19 infection. Recognition of rare imaging cases of COVID-19 infection is essential for proper diagnostic and treatment management通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Similar cases with complete resolution of lung nodules have been reported in the literature and are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. One of these cases is of a 57-vear-old patient， smoker， diagnosed with COVID-19 infection， imaging evaluation by computed tomography， with the detection of a 20 mm lung nodule， irregular in the left upper lobe (a，b). To rule out a possible primary lung cancer， given the history of chronic smoking， transthoracic percutaneous needle biopsy is planned. Pre-procedural chest CT shows regression of nodule size (c)， so biopsy is postponed and re-evaluation is recommended at three months， when complete resolution of the left lung nodule is described (d) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> .\n\n【28】It is unclear whether the pulmonary involvement of COVID-19in cancer patients is different from that in the general population. Therefore， the development of new pulmonary nodules in a patient with a history of malignancy requires further evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【29】The occurrence of metastases with a mammary starting point at a distance of 15 years is a rare phenomenon described in the literature. Most breast cancers metastasize about two vears after the start of treatment， with another peak at 8 to 9 years. In a meta-analysis described by Dr. Rikke Norgaard， Dr. Buket Ozturk Esen and Dr. Lene Mellemkjaer， in a paper published in November 2021， following 36，924 women with breast cancer， 2，595 cases developed late metastases， 10 to 32 years after diagnosis. Women at risk for late recurrence are those with high lymph node burden， large tumor size， and estrogen receptor positivity， requiring more extensive surveillance or more aggressive treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Approximately 75% of primary breast tumors have already spread by the time of diagnosis， seeding micrometastases at a regional or distant anatomical site. These micrometastases survive in a resting tumor state， whereby cell growth is balanced by apoptosis. Changes in cytokines， immune cells and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment leads to cessation of tumor rest， resulting in complete metastatic growth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【31】In breast cancer， understanding the mechanisms underlying cancer cell stagnation and retreatment is of crucial importance due to a particularly wide window of tumor recurrence， spanning up to two decades after diagnosis. Hypoxia， which occurs in patients with COVID-19 in the setting of respiratory distress and thrombosis， is a hallmark of micro-medial， poor prognosis of solid tumors. In breast cancer， hypoxia has been shown to be responsible for dormant cell generation by promoting expression of genes involved in cancer quiescence，drug resistance， stemness and EMT通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\nThroughout the pandemic， questions have been raised about how the SARS-CoV-2 infection， including its long-term effects， acts on cancer patients. Thus， it has been hypothesized that severe COVID-19infection may increase the risk of subsequent cancer recurrence by inducing reactivation Of Latent Cancer Cells (LCCs). In a severe form of SARS-CoV-2， pathophysiological events such as immune-mediated tissue inflammation， impaired T-cell and Natural Killer(NK) cell activity， neutrophil hyperactivation and thrombocytosis occur， which may collectively generate a temporary pro-tumorigenic microenvironment favorable to LCC reactivation. Since the beginning|删除段之间换行|of the pandemic， ACE2 has been identified as the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Although ACE2 has been reported to exert multiple antitumor effects， including inhibition of cancer angiogenesis and metastasis， its downregulation may itselfpromotetumor progression. Up-regulation of ACE2 causes hyperactivation of NF-kB， the most important molecule linking inflammation to cancer. NF-kB activation in cancer cells promotes proliferation， chemoresistance and invasion， while in the Tumor Microenvironment (TME) it stimulates angiogenesis and immune suppression， supporting the metastatic process 7|\n\n【33】Patients with the severe form of COVID-19 usually develop acute respiratory distress and Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)， which can lead to sustained fever， edema， neurological symptoms， organ failure and shock. IL-6 plays a central role in the pathophysiology of CRS， and its high levels have been correlated with increased risk of tumor recurrence in breast cancer and head and neck cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Recent studies have reported that NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps)，activate metastasis formationby severalmechanisms，including the trapping of circulating tumor cells， activation of pro-metastatic fibroblasts and proteolytic destruction of the anti-tumorigenic factor thrombospondin删除4-1:<u>-1</u>. Importantly， NETs (Neutrophil Extracellular Traps)， have been reported to awaken dormant breast cancer cells disseminated to the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>\n\n【35】The association between COVID-19 and increased risk of lung metastasis in patients with prior breast cancer should lead to specific follow-up programs and personalized therapies using anti-inflammatory agents capable of interfering with immune-mediated inflammatory pathways or NETs formation in order to decrease the risk of tumor recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Conclusions\n\n【37】PET/CT is a very useful tool in cancer diagnosis and follow-up， due to the high sensitivity of this imaging modality. Its specificity， however， may be reduced by the presence of infectious and inflammatory traps， the COVID-19 pandemic bringing new difficulties in tumor vs. inflammatory interpretation.\n\n【38】It is important to always be alert to these false-positive results， as they can influence the diagnosis and course of patient treatment. Patient pathological history is a mandatory step in navigating PET/CT imaging.\n\n【39】Before scheduling patients for 18F-FDG PET/CT scans for various oncological purposes， we must consider sources of possible interferences， such as COVID-19 infection， considering that there is no concise protocol indicating the time required for lesion resorption. Double PET/CT examination at a two-month interval shows the fleeting nature of the inflammatory capturing lesions three months after the COVID-19 infectious episode.\n\n【40】This case presentation is intended to increase awareness of the complications that COVID-19 disease can bring. In addition to many others， the effects of the pandemic can be felt indirectly， hindering the correct diagnosis of patients and decreasing the chances of survival. More similar case reports and other descriptive articles are needed to quantify the impact the pandemic has had on this type of situation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It is usually characterized by a persistent prolonged APTT despite correction.

He had a background history of ischemic heart disease and diabetes mellitus with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on regular hemodialysis and history of right BKA for diabetic foot ulcer.\n\n【9】As he was in severe sepsis， he required urgent Above-Knee-Amputation (AKA). However， his preoperative coagulation profile was deranged with prolonged Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) 131.9 sec， PT 35.3 sec， and International Normalized Ratio (INR) 3.70.

APTT and PT were not corrected by immediate and 2 h incubation mixing tests， with factor VIII level of 600% and hyperfibrinogenemia. These findings were suggestive of strong LA.\n\n【11】Intravenous methylprednisolone was administered， and plasmapheresis was performed twice\n\n【12】Table 1： Serial coagulation profile monitoring.\n\n| Day of Admission  | Coagulation Profile  |  |  | Remarks  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Day of Admission  | APTT (second)  | PT (second)  | INR  | Remarks  |\n| Day 1  | 52.9  | 16.1  | 1.31  |  |\n| Day 3  | 131.9  | 35.3  | 3.7  |  |\n| Day 4  | 112.6  | 43.5  | 4.87  | Transfused 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 5  | 135.6  | 46.3  | 5.29  | Transfusec 4 units FFP  |\n| Day 6  | 133.5  | 47.8  | 5.52  | Transfusec 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 7  | 155.7  | 50.4  | 5.92  |  |\n| Day 8  | 169  | 48.9  | 5.69  |  |\n| Day 10  | 137.3  | 49.1  | 5.72  |  |\n| Day 13  | 176.8  | 51.5  | 6.1  |  |\n| Day 14  | \\>180  | 62.1  | 7.8  | Transfusec 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 15  | \\>180  | 65.5  | 8.37  | Transfused 2 units FFP  |\n| Day 16  | \\>180  | 49.5  | 5.78  |  |\n| Day 17  | 146.4  | 46.4  | 5.31  | Startec onVMethylprednisolone 50mg OD  |\n| Day 18  | \\>180  | 69.5  | 9.05  |  |\n| Day 19  | 116.4  | 45.2  | 5.12  | Plasmapheresis x1  |\n| Day 20  | 98.4  | 51.1  | 6.03  | Plasmapheresis x2  |\n| Day 21  | \\>180  | 53.5  | 6.4  |  |\n| Day 22  | \\>180  | 75.4  | 10.08  | Went in for operation AKA  |\n| Day 23  | 75.1  | 37.4  | 4  | Day 1 post operation  |\n\nAPTT： Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time： PT： Prothrombin Time； INR：International Normalized Ratio； FFP： Fresh Frozen Plasma； AKA： Above Knee Amputation|删除段之间换行|with transient improvement in the coagulation profile.

Identification of the underlying cause is important as some disorders increase the risk of bleeding while the others are prothrombotic. The initial approach to a prolonged APTT or PT is to rule out an artefactual abnormality due|删除段之间换行|to a mixture of heparin solution with blood， use of anticoagulant， or due to liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. An additional test that can be done is a mixing test to differentiate between a coagulation factor deficiency and the presence of an inhibitor.\n\n【19】LA is an inhibiting antibody which causes prolonged APTT in vitro despite its prothrombotic activity. In sepsis， DIVC is the foremost important diagnosis of coagulopathy. However， persistently deranged coagulation profiles in a non-bleeding patient， which are not corrected with FFP transfusion or vitamin K should raise the suspicion of LA. Although rare， acquired LA is one of the possible differential diagnoses and has been reported in literature to be frequently developed in critically ill patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Lupus Anticoagulant-Hypoprothrombinemia Syndrome(LAHS) should be considered in LA with a prolonged PT and INR An acquired factor II deficiency in association with the acquired lupus anticoagulant complicates the management further as it may predispose the patient to both thrombosis and severe bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. PT is usually relatively insensitive to LA；however， a strong LA might give rise to a falsely increased PT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A factor II level and an uncorrected PT mixing test can help to differentiate a strong lupus anticoagulant from LAHS.\n\n【21】Managing a sick patient with the presence of LA and deranged coagulation profile who needs a surgical intervention may pose a big dilemma for the surgeons and physicians. In the present case， surgical intervention is the definitive management in acquired LA associated with severe sepsis from the infected stump. Improvement of the coagulation profile post-operatively indicated the infected stump was the most likely source of LA formation. Therefore， it is imperative to diagnose acquired LA as they differ in the coagulability state especially in the decision for surgical intervention and in critically ill patients whom the risk of thromboembolic event is high.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

It usually occurs in middle-aged population and starts as a firm plaque-like lesion and is most commonly seen in the trunk. When there is a fibromatous transformation within the DFSP， the lesion can rapidly increase in size and develop an increased metastatic potential. Treatment of choice for DFSP is surgical excision with negative margins. Adjuvant therapy is indicated based on the margin status and aggressiveness of the tumor. Here we present a patient with a large DFSP with fibromatous transformation which presented as a large abdominal wall mass with gross extension into the peritoneal cavity， which was successfully excised.\n\n【2】Keywords： Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans； Abdominal mass； Fibromatous transformation； Excision\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP) is a rare mesenchymaltumour. DFSPs are low grade tumors with low metastatic potential. In 5% to 20% ofcases，DFSPhave high grade fibrosarcomatous component and this transformation is responsible for high incidence of local relapse and distant metastases. Here we present a case of a giant DFSP of the abdominal wall which underwent rapid increase in size due to fibrosarcomatous transformation and was successfully excised.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 40 year old gentleman， otherwise fit and well， presented with a large swelling in the upper abdomen for about 5 years. The swelling was initially small and was slow growing up until a year ago when it rapidly increased in size to attain the present size. On examination， there was a large lobulated swelling in the midline measuring about 12 cm x15 cm， extending from xiphisternum to umbilicus craniocaudally and up to the midclavicular lines on either sides laterally . The skin on the surface of the mass was ulcerated at a few areas.\n\n【7】Ultrasonography of the abdomen was suggestive of heterogeneously hypoechoic mass arising from the anterior abdominal wall with moderate vascularity and cystic spaces within it. In view of giant size of the mass， contrast enhanced CT scan of abdomen was performed to look for infiltration into deeper structures. CT suggested heterogeneously enhancing lobulated protuberant lesion of12 cm x 15 cm x 13 cm， involving the skin， subcutaneous fat and musculature. The lesion was posteriorly protruding into the omentum， abutting the transverse colon and displacing the stomach posteriorly . Multiple prominent internal mammary and epigastric vessels were seen traversing into the lesion. Biopsy of the lesion was suggestive of dermatofibrosarcoma.\n\nHe underwent wide local excision of the giant lesion with clear margins. In view of infiltration into the abdominal wall musculature，tumor was excised along with muscular wall resulting in entry into peritoneal cavity. There was no obvious infiltration of thelesion to the intra-abdominal organs. Primary closure of the abdominal wall was done. Small defect of skin at the epigastric region was left open for healing by secondary intention. Intraoperative period was uneventful. There was no significant blood loss. Postoperatively he made a smooth recovery and he was discharged on the 2nd postoperative day. Histopathological examination of the mass on cut section showed grey white， fleshy and nodular lesion with margin clearance of 1.1 cm . Microscopic examination showed neoplastic cells arranged in a storiform and herringbone pattern with hypocellular|删除段之间换行|area representing dermatofibrosarcoma andhypercellular area representing fibrosarcomatous transformation along with 5% to10% necrotic areas. Spindle cells showing hyperchromatic nudlei were present and mitotic count was more than 30 per 10 high power fields. These features were suggestive of Grade II fibrosarcomatous transformation of DFSP. Medical oncology opinion was obtained and he was advised regular follow-up.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans (DFSP) is a slow growing，low to intermediate grade soft tissue sarcoma. It was first described by Darier and Ferrandas “progressive and recurring dermatofibroma”in1924 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. DFSP arises from the dermal fibroblasts and infiltrates into the deeper subcutaneous tissues. It constitutes 1% to 6% of all soft tissue sarcomas. It is more common in the middle age adults between20 and 50 years of age with an almost equal incidence in both sexes. It occurs commonly in the trunk followed by proximal extremity and head and neck region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nDFSP develops as a firm plaque like lesion over the skin and|删除段之间换行|characteristically grows slowly for several years and becomes protuberant with multiple nodules. Preoperatively， ultrasound scan， MRI or CT scan can be used to determine the nature of the lesion and its in filtration into the deeper tissues and surrounding vital structures. On ultrasound， DFSP appears as a well-defined hypoechoic mass. In some cases it can be mixed hypoechoic with high cellularity and hyperechoic with fibrous tissue along with tumour cells. DFSP is a moderately vascular lesion， mainly in the periphery which can be seen on color Doppler. MRI is more useful due to its high soft tissue contrast resolution. On T2 weighted images DFSP shows high signal intensity and on T1 weighted images it has similar intensity as skeletal muscle. On CT， DFSP appears isodense to the skeletal muscle and can be homogenous or heterogenous with non-enhancing areas of necrosis and cystic degeneration. CT is also useful in demonstrating involvement of underlying bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Histopathological examination of DFSP consists of uniform spindle shaped cells with elongated nuclei arranged in a storiform pattern. These cells have low mitotic index and infiltrate in to the subcutaneous tissue in a honeycomb appearance. DFSP has different histological variants， which include myxoid， pigmented (Bednar tumor)， giant cell fibroblastoma， granular cell， sclerotic and Fibrosarcomatous (FS) components. Fibrosarcomatous transformation in a classical DFSP occurs in 5%to 20% of cases. It is an aggressive variant with high rate of local recurrence and high distant metastatic potential. Features suggesting fibrosarcomatous transformation within DFSP are at least 5% area of spindle cells showing mitotic index >7/10 high power field， high pleomorphism and herringbone growth pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Genetically dermatofibrosarcoma is a result of translocation of chromosome t(17；22)(q22；q13) in 90% of cases， which leads to fusion of the genes COL1A1 (collagen type 1 alpha 1) on chromosome 17q21-22 and PDGFB (Platelet Derived Growth Factor Beta ) on chromosome 22q删除4-1:<u>12</u>. On immunohistochemistry classical DFSP is diffusely positive for CD34 staining in about 90%to 100% of cases， whereas in fibrosarcomatous DFSP the tumor cells lack CD34 positivity. CD34 staining is not a specific marker for dermatofibrosarcoma as it can be positive in benign neoplasms like solitary fibrous tumors and fibrohistiocytic tumors. DFSP can also express CD99 and SMA (smooth muscle antigen) but are usually negative for S100 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\nThe standard treatment for DFSP is wide local excision with 2cm to 4 cm margin. In tumors where cosmetically and functionally sensitive areas， Mohs micrographic surgery is preferred to preserve the vital tissue and prevent the local recurrence. Fibrosarcomatous variant of DFSP can also have a comparable local recurrence rate as classical DFSP， if surgical excision is done with adequate margins. Adjuvant radiotherapy improves the Disease Free Survival (DFS)， mainly in patients with close or positive margin conditions. Du et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> in their study， on role of adjuvant radiotherapy found that 5-year|删除段之间换行|DFS was 88.1% for surgery and radiotherapy group compared to56.2% for surgery alone group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. Systemic therapy with Imatinib mesylate， a tyrosine kinase inhibitor is beneficial in locally inoperable cases and metastatic DFSP. Imatinib acts by competitively binding to platelet-derived growth factor receptors on tumor cells and block their tyrosine kinase activity. Detection of chimeric gene COL1A1-PDGFB presence in tumour cells prior to starting systemic therapy with Imatinib is advisable to know the benefit. The usual dose of Imatinib is 400 mg/day and in cases with poor response， the dose can be increased to 600 mg/day to 800 mg/day. Novel VEGFR (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor) inhibitors such as Pazopanib， Sorafenib and Apatinib are on evaluation in controlling the Imatinib resistant cases 7\\].\n\n【14】The prognosis of DFSP is affected by the age， resection margin， lesion number， and histological subtype. Patients with age >50years， resection margin <2 cm and fibrosarcomatous variant have poor prognosis. Ki-67， tumor proliferation activity indicator is another prognostic factor. Tumors with high Ki-67 shows poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient presented with a slow growing anterior abdominal wall mass for 5 years with rapid growth in the last 1 year. Final histopathological examination after wide excision showed fibrosarcomatous variant of dermatofibrosarcoma with high mitotic count (>30 per 10 high power field). We believe that the rapid increase in size is due to the fibrosarcomatous transformation within the DFSP.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberancceeis rare soft tissule sarcoma with low distant metastatic potential. Fibrosarcomatous transformation which occurs in 5% to 20% of DFSP is an aggressive variant with high recurrence rates and high metastatic potential. Surgical resection with wide margins is the treatment of choice. Adjuvant radiotherapy in cases of close margins will prevent local recurrence. Imatinib mesylate， a tyrosine kinase inhibitor has a role in inoperable and metastatic DFSP.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Iliac Vein Compression Syndrome (IVCS) is caused by compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery and lumbar vertebra，leading to left common iliac vein stenosis， fiber adhesion and ultimately iliac vein thrombosis. IVCS is the main cause of acute iliac-femoral vein thrombosis. Herein， we report a case of a 38-year-old woman who was pregnant for 5 weeks and 5 days. She suddenly experienced swelling and pain in her left lower limb and was initially diagnosed with DVT and then IVCS upon further examination.\n\n【2】Keywords： Early pregnancy； Perinatal period； Gestation； Deep vein thrombosis； Iliac vein compression syndrome； Abortion\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a disease caused by abnormal blood coagulation in deep veins. Affected individuals can present lower limb swelling， pain and dysfunction due to obstructed blood flow. Thrombus detachment can cause a Pulmonary Embolism (PE)，leading to gas exchange disorder， pulmonary hypertension， right ventricular dysfunction， and even dyspnea， shock and death in severe cases. DVT and PE are collectively called Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). A series of changes during the perinatal period， such as hypercoagulability， uterine enlargement that compresses the inferior vena cava and pelvic vein， and venous stasis， increase the risk of thrombosis.\n\n【5】IVCS， alsoknown as Cockett syndrome or May-Thurner syndrome， is caused by the compression of the left common iliac vein bythe right common iliac artery anterior to it and the lumbar vertebra posterior to it， leading to left common iliac vein stenosis， fibrous adhesions after repeated intimal injuries， and finally iliac vein thrombosis. IVCS is one of the reasons why DVT is more common in the left lower limb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Some patients may have right iliac vein compression， and a small number of patients may have bilateral iliac or inferior vena cava involvement.\n\n【6】Although the relationship between gestation and DVT is known， there are few cases of iliac-femoral vein thrombosis during early pregnancy and the perinatal period.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Medical history\n\nA 38-year-old woman had 28-day menstrual cycles， 5 days of menses and 40 days of menopause. Color Doppler ultrasound revealed a fetal sac (1.7 cm x1.7 cmx0.8 cm) and a visible yolk sac in the uterus. The patient had a history of cesarean section 12 years ago and was usually anemic without other chronic diseases. The diagnosis was early pregnancy (5 weeks and 5 days of gestation). The pregnancy was unplanned， and the patient requested an abortion. Preoperative examinations showed a D-dimer concentration of 832 ng/ml (normal reference range： ≤250 ng/ml) and no other abnormalities. An abortion was scheduled for 1 week later. At 6 weeks and 3 days of gestation， she experienced swelling in her left lower limb in the morning， which became painful after getting out of bed. Therefore， she visited our hospital for emergency treatment. The physical examination revealed obvious swelling in her left lowerlimb，with red skin， high skin temperature， excessive skin tension， and Homans’ sign (+)； the circumference of the left calf was 4 cm larger than that of the right calf， and the circumference of the left thigh was 10 cm larger than that of the right thigh . The patient was preliminarily diagnosed with DVT of the left lower limb， and the possibility of IVCS could not be excluded. The patient’s D-dimer concentration was 2495 ng/ml. Color Doppler|删除段之间换行|b\n\n【10】a d\n\n【11】ultrasound indicated thromboses of the left iliac vein， femoral vein， popliteal vein and intermuscular veins of the calf. She denied past and family history of VTE and did not take oral contraceptives containing estrogen.\n\n【12】Diagnosis and treatment plan\n\n【13】Vascular surgeons and obstetricians and gynecologists jointly determined to first perform temporary inferior vena cava filter placement as emergency treatment to prevent a fatal PE， followed by an emergency abortion， anticoagulation treatment if there was no serious bleeding after the abortion， and last thrombectomy.\n\n【14】Diagnosis and treatment\n\n1) Temporary inferior vena cava filter placement was performed， and the distal thrombosis of the inferior vena cava was found by intraoperative angiography. (Radiation dose： 12 mGy). 2) The patient was immediately transferred to the obstetrics and gynecology operating room for an induced abortion. Because the patient had|删除段之间换行|approximately 6 cm H，O， and that in the left external iliac vein was approximately 15 cm H，O. Considering the severe compression of the left iliac vein， a 14 mm to 40 mm balloon was inserted to predilate the stenotic segment of the iliac vein， and a 14 mm-100 mm self-expanding stent was implanted in the stenotic segment. Postoperative angiography showed satisfactory removal of the venous thrombosis in the lower limbs， a good blood flow rate， and no obvious luminal stenosis . The pressure in the left external iliac vein was approximately 7 cm H，O (radiation dose： 180 mGy). No significant vaginal bleeding was observed during the operation. 5) Enoxaparin sodium (6000 IU， q12h) was administered after thrombectomy. 6) A thrombophilia-related examination was performed. Protein S activity was 38.7% (reference range 63.5%-149%)， and there were no abnormalities in antithrombin III， protein C， and APS-related antibodies. The result of the thrombophilia-related gene test was negative. Eight days after thrombectomy， both lower limbs were not swollen， with equal circumferences ， and the D-dimer concentration was 116 ng/ml； color Doppler ultrasound showed no thrombosis in the veins of both lower limbs and patent blood flow through the left iliac vein stent. 7) Eight days after thrombectomy， the inferior vena cava filter was removed， and enoxaparin sodium(6000 IU q12h) was administered postoperatively. 8) Thirty days after thrombectomy， the D-dimer concentration was 47 ng/ml； color Doppler ultrasound showed no thrombosis in the veins of both lower limbs and patent blood flow through the left iliac vein stent； contrast-enhanced CT showed satisfactory shape and location of the left iliac vein，patent blood flow through the stent， and relief of compression of theleft iliac vein . The patient was administered rivaroxaban(20 mg qd) as an anticoagulant.9) The examination at 3 months after thrombectomy showed no swelling in the lower limbs. The patient no longer felt heavy， sore or swollen legs， and her menstrual flow was normal. The D-dimer concentration was 45 ng/ml. Color Doppler ultrasound showed no thrombosis in the veins of both lowerlimbs，no deep venous return， and patent flow through the left iliac vein stent.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Increased risk of DVT during gestation\n\n【18】A series of changes during the perinatalperiod， such as hypercoagulability， uterine enlargement that compresses the inferior vena cava and pelvic vein， and venous stasis， increase the risk of thrombosis. VTE is the leading cause of maternal death， and the incidence of VTE is 4 to 5 times higher during gestation than in the non-gestation period and is even higher during puerperium. DVT accounts for 75% to 80% of VTE during the perinatal period， and it often involves the iliac-femoral vein and occurs more commonly in the left lower limb 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The lack of timely and accurate identification of risk factors for VTE is main reason that the incidence of and mortality associated with maternal VTE have not continued to decline worldwide over the past 2 decades.\n\n【19】IVCS\n\nIVCS is common in women of childbearing age， among whom women aged 20 to 40 years account for 60% to 85% of all IVCS patients. Compared with men， women are more prone to PE 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Women are in a hypercoagulable state during gestation. During middle to late gestation， the enlarged uterus compresses the inferior vena cava and iliac vein， causing blood stasis in the veins of the lower limbs. The presence of IVCS further increases the risk of DVT. The severity of iliac vein stenosis varies with posture. Iliac vein stenosis is more severe in supine positions； therefore， the risk of thrombosis is|删除段之间换行|higher in pregnant women who need to stay in bed most of the time to prevent miscarriages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.IVCS is the leading cause of acute iliac-femoral vein thrombosis， with a true incidence rate of 18% to 49%. However， IVCS is often overlooked. Past medical history of VTE has been included as the main risk factors for VTE during the perinatal period， but the detection of IVCS has not been included in routine prenatal examinations， and the accurate identification of IVCS is essential for the prevention of VTE during the perinatal period. For women with a previous VTE or women with no previous VTE history but with the IVCS symptoms， color Doppler ultrasound or MRI should be performed to determine the presence of IVCS. For pregnant women with IVCS， preventive measures for VTE should be actively taken to reduce the incidence of DVT，but IVCS has not been listed as a risk factor in existing guidelines； therefore， related research should be designed and implemented to provide more evidence for inclusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Post-thrombosis syndrome (PTS) should not be neglected\n\n【22】In addition to leading to PE， if not treated effectively and in a timely manner during the acute phase， DVT can also cause venous return disorders of the limbs due to deep vein occlusion. In the process of organized repair， damaged venous valves lead to venous return， causing venous hypertension of the lower limbs and often severe sequela， known as PTS.Long-term high venous pressure in the lower limbs leads to tissue edema， the accumulation of metabolites and tissue malnutrition， mainly manifesting as heaviness， discomfort and swelling in the lower limbs， symptoms that aggravate after long-term standing or activity. Some patients may present with pain， increased muscle tension， varicose veins， pigmentation in the feet and lower legs， thickening and rough skin， pruritus and eczema-like dermatitis in/on affected limbs. Recurrentorprolonged chronic ulcers may occur in patients with severe cases. These symptoms seriously affect quality of life and result in high medical costs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Once DVT is diagnosed in the perinatal period， active treatment is needed to reduce the occurrence of PTS or acute DVT， prompt and effective anticoagulation treatment together with rapid thrombus removal can quickly restore venous return and improve valve function， which are important means to treat DVT and prevent PTS.\n\n【23】Abnormal increase in D-dimer\n\n【24】D-dimer is a coagulation and fibrinolysis marker that is used to rule out VTE in patients with low to moderate clinical suspicion of VTE， and D-dimer levels gradually increase significantly during gestation， peaking during late gestation. However， the use of this biomarker in pregnant women has limitations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The patient reported herein had an unplanned pregnancy. Her coagulation tests prior to the abortion revealed a significant elevation in D-dimer， but the elevation in D-dimer was not addressed. The patient had severe DVT 5 days later. Abnormally high D-dimer concentrations in women should not be ignored， and VTE management should be pursued for women who wish to undergo an abortion and those who have undergone abortions. A VTE risk assessment should be conducted at the earliest possible time for all pregnant women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\nThis case indicates that clinicians should be alert to the risk of DVT during early pregnancy and attach great importance to DVT management during the perinatal period. It is of great significance to screen for IVCS for the prevention and treatment of DVT. Once VTE occurs during the perinatal period， clinicians should closely monitor and actively treat such patients， so as to reduce the mortality rate and|删除段之间换行|the occurrence ofthrombosis recurrence and PTS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

In addition to the review， 6 cases were collected among the HCW working at the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from September 2020 to January删除4:<u> 2021</u>.\n\n【5】Results： In our review， we included 17 articles in addition to our six cases. The type of papers was case series and case report in respectively 8 and 9 studies. Skin manifestations were reported in two studies including two HCW， in addition to our series of six HCW. Skin manifestations were：Chilblain like lesions (44.5%)， a generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (32.1%)， a papulovesicular rash and chicken pox-like vesicles (11.5%)， painful acral red-purple papules (4.6%)， urticaria (2.8%)， purpuric or petechial lesions (2.3%) and livedo reticularis lesions (0.45%). Of the218 cases， 203 cases have reported the location of lesions. The very great majority of lesions were found on the trunk， hands and feet. Fifty-one patient (23.4%) experienced lesions on the trunk. The time of onset of cutaneous lesions was variable. At the diagnosis or the onset of COVID-19symptoms，8.3%(18/218) ofpatients presented with cutaneous lesions.

Of the 197 cases with reported healing times， healing times were up to 24 days.\n\n【6】Conclusion： COVID-19 has been associated with different cutaneous manifestations， likely of varying pathophysiology and severity， some preceding COVID-19 symptomatology and others occurring during active disease or later in the course. Thus， heightened awareness and timely recognition of cutaneous manifestations in COVID-19 are important for occupational physicians treating HCW with COVID-19.\n\n【7】Keywords： Cutaneous manifestations； Healthcare workers； COVID-19\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】COVID-19 infection initially reported in Wuhan， China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> has been spread all over the world. As of July 7uh， 2021， COVID-19 has been diagnosed in more than 184 million people worldwide通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Its rapid spread across geographical borders leading to a pandemic can be explained by several factors such as the high rate of infectivity and transmission from asymptomatic persons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the COVID-19 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. COVID-19 pandemic still represents a great challenge for Healthcare Workers (HCW) around the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\nHealthcare workers are first-line fighters against COVID-19. They may experience symptoms ranging from influenza-like illness to life-threatening respiratory distress 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Apart from pulmonary involvement， it is interesting to note that multiple extra pulmonary manifestations have been reported in patients with COVID-19 including skin manifestations. Common clinical features|删除段之间换行|of COVID-19 are increasingly known but cutaneous manifestations associated with this infection are rarely described. A review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 especially among Health Care Workers (HCW) is thus required.\n\n【11】The aim of our current study was to provide a comprehensive review of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW through six case reports and a literature review.\n\n【12】Methods\n\n【13】We conducted a literature search for cases reports， original and review articles published from the beginning of the COVID-19pandemic until January 2021 using PubMed and the Google search engines. In our study， we used these key search words \"cutaneous\"“skin\"， and1 \"dermatology\" in combination with \"coronavirus\"，\"COVID-19\"and\"SARS-CoV-2\". A manual search of reference lists of some relevant articles was performed. We excluded the studies that did not mention skin lesions.\n\n【14】We extracted the socio-demographic and clinical data from the included studies. Socio-demographic data were mainly the number of cases， age， gender and status for COVID-19. The clinical data were mainly the description of the cutaneous lesions， its location， onset and healing time and associated signs. The occupation was extracted from these studies when mentioned. In addition to the review， 6 cases were collected among the HCW working at the Charles Nicolle Hospital of Tunis from September 2020 to January删除4:<u> 2021</u>.\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Case presentation\n\nCase 1： A 45-year-old nurse with a history of spontaneous pneumothorax， with no previous medication， or previous adverse drug reactions， presented to the occupational medicine department with a fever， a productive cough， asthenia， and body ache with no suspicious contact of COVID-19. The COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a positive RT-PCR on November 05h，删除4:<u> 2020</u>. Anosmia， headaches， and dizziness occurred between day 2 and day 13 of the infection. The patient was treated with antibiotics based on azithromycin and a third-generation cephalosporin， combined with vitamins and preventive heparin therapy. The clinical course was marked by the appearance at day 10 of an erythematous and pruritic cutaneous rash on the trunk and limbs with buccal ulcers without fever or signs of hemorrhages of the mucous membranes . Clinical improvement ofthe rash was noted after taking corticosteroid injections for 5 days. The nurse returned to work after 25 days of the|删除段之间换行|infection with a dry sequela cough.\n\n【18】Case 2： A 44-year-old physiotherapist with a history of high blood pressure， paracetamol-drugged hepatitis， and an operated thyroid nodule， tested positive to COVID-19 on October 7ih， 2020with symptoms of ageusia， anosmia， and fever. She was treated with vitamin therapy and antibiotics based on azithromycin. Diarrhea and dizziness appeared respectively at day 2 and day 6 of the clinical evolution. She returned to work on October 20\"h with only hyposmia. One month later， on November 25h， the patient reconsulted for an erythematous and pruritic herpetiform rash on the limbs and the abdomen without fever or other associated signs nor medication use . A progressive and spontaneous improvement of the cutaneous lesions appeared after one week.\n\nCase 3： A 57-year-old midwife with a history of hypertension was tested COVID-19 positive on September 25h， 2020， a sample indicated for body aches， asthenia and headaches with a suspicious contact. She was treated with vitamin therapy for 10 days， combined with azithromycin for 06 days. She received preventive heparin|删除段之间换行|therapy for 4 days. On day 13 of the infection， the patient reported cutaneous lesions.\n\n【20】These lesions were objectified at the return-to-work medical examination. There was none necrotic purpura (1 cm to 2 cm) on the legs and lower back， with no mucous lesions or fever. There were recurrent attacks that spontaneously resolved after 5 to 7 days. The patient was referred for further explorations. Skin biopsy showed a \"necrotizing neutrophilic leukocytoclastic vasculitis\" . Blood tests were normal and immunological tests were requested. The patient was not put under corticoid or immunosuppressive treatment. The clinical evolution was marked by remission of cutaneous manifestations observed about two months after the onset of the disease around December 5h，删除4:<u> 2020</u>.\n\n【21】Case 4： A 32-year-old neonatology technician with no notable history presented on October the 64， 2020 with fever， cough， shortness of breath and body aches. The nasopharyngeal swab confirmed COVID-19 infection on October 7h. The patient was put under azithromycin for 9 days combined with a third-generation cephalosporin and vitamin therapy. On October the 16h， 10 days after， the patient reported the appearance of cutaneous lesions， which were confirmed at the return-to-work medical examination on October删除4:<u> 204</u>. There was a pruritic rash on the lower limbs and the elbows， which improved after five days of antihistaminic treatment.\n\nCase 5： A 33-year-old doctor， with no notable antecedents， was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on December the 9h， 2020， by a nasopharyngeal swab indicated for suggestive symptomatology of fever with anosmia and contact with a positive case. The clinical evolution was favorable under medical treatment. On December23m， 15 days after the infection， the patient reported a spontaneous cutaneous lesion on the left forearm with no fever， which was objectified at the medical check-up on December 25h. It was a well-limited superficial ecchymotic plaque of 07 cm long on the anterior face of the lower third of the left forearm which has spontaneously|删除段之间换行|regressed after one week .\n\n【23】Case 6： A 50-year-old medical secretary， with no notable antecedents， was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on January the 18h， 2021 by a nasopharyngeal swab indicated for suggestive symptomatology of fever， cough， and odynophagia with no suspicious contact with a positive case. The clinical evolution was favorable under medical treatment. On January 23m， 8 days after the onset， the patient presented with spontaneous pruritic maculopustular eruption on the chin， neck and upper chest with lower back pain without fever. Cutaneous lesions have spontaneously regressed after one week.\n\n【24】Review of literature： Seventeen articles were selected for this review. There are 8 case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-13\\]</u>， and 9 case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14-21\\]</u>. The mean age was 49.8 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22，23\\]</u>. The gender was not reported in 17.9% of cases. In the other cases that mentioned the gender， sex ratio was 1.15.\n\n【25】COVID-19 infection was confirmed in 90.8% of cases. Skin manifestations among HCW were reported in two studies including two physicians 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，21\\]</u>， in addition to our series of six HCW.\n\n【26】Table 1 summarizes the characteristics and cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 cases published in scientific literature in addition to our case series.\n\n【27】Skin manifestations were： Chilblain like lesions (44.5%)， a generalized macular or maculopapular exanthem (32.1%)， a papulovesicular rash and chicken pox-like vesicles (11.5%)， painful acral red-purple papules (4.6%)， urticaria (2.8%)， purpuric or petechial lesions (2.3%) and livedo reticularis lesions (0.45%). Of the 218 cases， 203 cases have reported the location. The very great majority of lesions were found on the trunk， hands and feet. Fifty-one patient (23.4%) experienced lesions on the trunk. The time of onset of cutaneous lesions in relation to the onset of symptoms was variable. At the diagnosis or the onset of COVID-19 symptoms， 8.3%(18/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. After the onset of respiratory symptoms or COVID-19 diagnosis， 36.7% (80/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions. The timeline of the appearance of the skin lesions was not mentioned in 55% of cases. Healing times were up to 24 days in 197 cases.\n\n【28】The severity of cutaneous lesions was not correlated with COVID-19 severity in 99% of cases. Only two studies by Mahe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> and Estebanez 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> reported on the possible association between skin lesion severity and COVID-19 in 2 patients. Overall， histological findings were not reported. In our series， we have histological findings that may be related to the COVID infection in one patient.\n\n| Author.PublicationYear  | Region1  | Patientswith SkinSigns (n)  | Age，Genrer.

as compared to the common clinical features such as shortness ofbreath， cough and grippal syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. In our study， we summarized the characteristics of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 cases published in scientific literature in addition to our case series . We wished to characterize these manifestations， particularly among HCW for further diagnostic and prognostic value because cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have been increasingly reported worldwide. Skin manifestations were reported in 8 case reports and 9 case series.\n\n【33】In this review， 44.5% (97/218) of patients presented with chilblain-like lesions. In a previous review by Tan et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>， the most common COVID-19 skin manifestations in the USA and Europe were the chilblain-like lesions. There was only 1 case reported in Asia. Rash containing macules and papules was the second cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19. However， rashes containing macules and papules were not specific to COVID-19， and there were reports of misdiagnosed cases of COVID-19 in patients with rash containing macules and papules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【34】In the study by Recalcati et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， 20.4%(18/88) of COVID-19patients had developed skin manifestations. These manifestations were： erythematous rash (77.8%)， urticaria (16.7%) and vesicle formation (5.6%). These findings are nearly similar to our results.\n\n【35】Skin manifestations may aid in timely diagnosis of the COVID-19infection even in the asymptomatic cases with no respiratory or common symptoms. We found that at the onset of the infection， 8.3%(18/218) of patients presented with cutaneous lesions.\n\n【36】In order to prevent the misdiagnosis of the COVID-19 signs， doctors'awareness of the skin lesions related to COVID-19\n\n【37】infection must be raised 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Furthermore， skin lesions may have several outcomes on the professional quality of life of HCW. Having new manifestations of the COVID-19 infection can lead to frequent consultations seeking care and treatment so that frequent absenteeism. Also， HCW may wonder if they could be assisted with compensation of their skin lesions as sequella of the COVID-19occupational disease.\n\n【38】Visible skin lesions present on exposed body parts may induce fear， disgust， aversion， or even intolerance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Furthermore， some people with limited awareness of skin lesions after COVID-19infection believe that the disease still contagious， which mayeventually contribute to the social isolation of persons with skin lesions. HCW with skin lesions may be subject to segregation and stigmatization， especially if the lesions are visible on the face and exposed bodyareas.\n\n【39】Polymorphous cutaneous manifestations could reflect diverse interactions with the skin such as direct viral action in infected cells， hypercoagulability and immune system hyperactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The mechanisms of COVID-19 cutaneous lesions are not yet well known. Some studies have linked the cutaneous symptoms to a primary infection of the skin itself. In other theories， skin disturbances are seen as a secondary consequence after the respiratory infection. Suchonwanit et al. reported that the late-onset of lesions may be related mainly to thrombotic vasculopathy and vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Moreover， Litaiem et al. reported a case in Tunisia of a 39 year-old female patient diagnosed with COVID-19 infection， and 18 days after hydroxychloroquine (600 mg daily) initiation she developed a cephalocaudal spread of erythematous and pustular plaques. The Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis (AGEP) was diagnosed. Skin lesions were significantly improving after hydroxychloroquine withdrawal. They hypothesize that pustular eruptions occurring in COVID-19 patients are more likely to support drug-related origin\n\n【40】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Gianotti et al. described the histopathology of skin COVID-19lesions with a spectrum of findings that ranged from mild spongiosis of the epithelial layer to the important situation of vasculitis and extravasation of red blood cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The scientific understanding of cutaneous manifestations in patients with COVID-19 is still evolving.\n\n【41】We believe that this work is the first study describing cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 among HCW. However， several limitations must be considered. Due to evolving literature and language-related exclusion criteria， this paper only examines 218cases. The inclusion of our cases was limited because of the low declaration by the patients and the quarantine restrictions. Moreover， publication bias was encountered. Drug side effects not mentioned in most of the studies must be taken into account. Also， occupation was not mentioned in several cases.\n\n【42】Further studies are still required to understand the mechanism and the link between skin lesions and COVID-19.So that prospective studies based on clinical and histological confrontations are needed通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n\n【44】In summary， COVID-19 has been associated with different cutaneous manifestations， likely of varying pathophysiology and severity， some preceding COVID-19 symptomatology and others occurring during active disease or later in the course. Given the evolving state of evidence， occupationalphysicians should be aware of the variety of skin manifestations related to COVID-19among Health care workers. Thus， heightened awareness and timely recognition of dermatologic findings in COVID-19 are important for occupational physicians treating HCW with COVID-19. Further studies are still required to understand the mechanism and the link between skin lesions and COVID-19.

Upon admission， Glasgow 14， severe dehydration and pale. Ectoscopy showing acromegalic facies， enlarged extremities， acrochordons in the cervical region， macroglossia and skin sweating. Vital signs： Blood pressure 100 mmHgx60mmHg， HR 100 bpm， SatO，97% in room air， capillary blood glucose above 500 mg/dL. Laboratory tests were performed， of which alterations are reported： plasma glucose 503 mg/dL (RV 70-99)， glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 9.8%(RV<5.7%)， creatinine 1.9 mg/dL (RV 0.6-1.1)， plasma sodium 175 mEq/L (RV 135 to 145)， potassium 3.4mEq/L (RV 3.5 to 5.1)， CPK 8023 U/L (RV 38 to 174) and arterial blood gases： pH 7.2，pCO2 19， HCO3 6.3，BE-3.2 and lactate 3.9. Type 1 urine with 3 ketonuria crosses.\n\nThe patient was diagnosed with Diabetes and Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)， starting treatment for DKA，prioritizing intravenous hydration， with care not to reduce acute sodium levels， in addition|删除段之间换行|to an intravenous insulin pump， after correction of hypokalemia. Due to the fluctuation in consciousness， the patient underwent a cranial tomography， showing a lesion in the pituitary topography， progressing the investigation with Magnetic Resonance (MRI)， which showed a Pituitary Macro adenoma with suprasellar invasion， compressing optical chiasma， measuring in its largest axis 6.1 cm.\n\n【10】Pituitary hormone measurements were performed： GH>200mcg/L， IGF-1 476 ng/mL (RV 112 to 282)， Prolactin 21 mcg/L (RV up to 24)， ACTH 28p g/mL， Basal cortisol 23 mg/dL (RV>15)， TSH1.2 mUI/L (RV 0.45 to 4.5) and free T4 0.5 ng/dL (RV 0.6 to 1.3).\n\n【11】Diagnosis of Acromegaly due to hormonal changes， lesion in adenohypophysis and suggestive phenotype. Treatment with a somatostatin analogue (Octreotide) 20 mg monthly was started， in addition to a dopaminergic agonist (Cabergoline) 1.5 mg/week.\n\n【12】One day after admission， the patient evolved with a decrease in the level of consciousness requiring Orotracheal Intubation (OTI). He maintained high sodium levels， but already improving DKA. He was kept under OTI for 4 days， being extubated after normalization in sodium levels.\n\n【13】The patient refused the surgical procedure for the treatment of acromegaly. He remained with difficult glycemic control during the period of hospitalization， with improvement in intra hospital glucose levels after about 15 days of admission， using high doses of insulin (2 ui/kg/day). He also received treatment with corticosteroids(hydrocortisone 300 mg/day for 8 days， followed by prednisone 40mg/day for 18 days) due to the airway infection associated with the condition (sinusitis).\n\n【14】After 12 days of hospitalization， a picture of flaccid tetra paresis of proximal predominance (total MRC score of 40 points)， associated with global hyporeflexia， without changes in cranialnerves， sensitivity or in other modalities on neurological examination， was noted. Cerebrospinal fluid was normal. On the fourth day of hospitalization，he presented a Creatine Kinase (CK) of 12665， with a peak on the fifth day of 12888， followed by a gradual decrease during hospitalization. In the two weeks following extubation， the patient showed progressive clinical improvement in the peripheral nervous system， especially after better glycemic control. Due to the presence of generalized muscle weakness after severe， diffuse， symmetrical， flaccid pattern and without involvement of cranial nerves， associated with a sum of MRC less than 48 points， a diagnosis of myopathy of the critically ill patient was then established.\n\n【15】At the time of hospital discharge， 30 days after admission， the patient had a sum of the MRC score of 50 points， good glycemic control， using insulin， improvement in CPK， creatinine and sodium levels. Maintained GH 195 mcg/L (RV<1)and with refusal of surgical procedure. Referred to the endocrinology clinic to follow up on the diagnoses of acromegaly and diabetes； and the neurology outpatient clinic for follow-up of the diagnosis of myopathy.\n\n【16】Given the current epidemiological context， we emphasize that throughout the hospitalization period， the patient did not show any signs or symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 infection.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\nIn the case in question， the patient had multiple risk factors for the development ofICU-Acquired Weakness (ICUAW)and had a course of Critical Illness Myopathy (CIM). Although the pathophysiology of CIM is still being studied， the likely mechanisms include|删除段之间换行|inhibition of protein synthesis， mitochondrial dysfunction， changes in the ubiquitin-proteasome system， oxidative stress and changes in intramuscular calcium homeostasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Hyperglycemia associated or not with the use of steroids， uise of neuromuscular blockers and sepsis are the main risk factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Myopathy is worsened by multiple endocrine logical and metabolic factors. Among them， thyroid diseases， diabetes， adrenal dysfunctions and acromegaly stand out 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The patient in question had hyperglycemia， with DKA，and was diagnosed with acromegaly during hospitalization. Acromegaly， characterized by high plasma levels of GH and IGF-1， has pituitary adenomas as its main etiology. It usually causes slowly progressive proximal myopathy and normal CPK levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Myopathy presented by the patient probably was not due to the acromegaly， once there was clinical neurological improvementdespitee maintaining activity cof this disease， documented by the presence of high GH levels， even after therapy with somatostatin analog.\n\n【20】Diabetes is associated with multiple presentations of neuropathy and muscle involvement. Pathophysiology may be associated with microvascular changes in muscle and nerve regions， but neuropathies arenot common in the first years ofthe disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Theytendtoappear after 10 years of diagnosis and are commonly associated with other micro vascular lesions typical of this disease， such as retinopathy and nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Regarding the clinical muscle condition， it has been documented in some cases that the cause of the injury is probably due to focal myonecrosis， followed by micro vascular injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Low carbohydrate diet and hydration should be instituted， in addition to the measurement of glycated Hemoglobin (HbA1c)， aiming at the previous diagnosis of diabetes， in those patients with in-hospital hyperglycemia in addition to assisting in the management of the disease at hospital discharge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The insulin prescription should ideally be performed according to the protocol of each institution or with the help of a specialist. Glycemic control aims at an intra-hospital goal between 140 and 180 mg/dl 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6-8\\]</u>. These measures reduce overall mortality and the risk of developing polyneuropathy in critically ill patients. Values below 100 mg/dL are correlated with increased mortality， due to the risk of severe hypoglycemia and， therefore， should be avoided 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Myopathy mainly affects the proximal and axial muscles and makes weaning from mechanical ventilation and recovery of normal respiratory function difficult. It can be associated with elevation of muscle enzymes， such as increased Creatine Kinase (CK)， which can assist in diagnosis， as occurred in the case reported. However， CK values within normal levels can be found in mild cases or at the beginning of muscle involvement and， therefore， should not exclude the diagnosis in the face of a strong clinical suspicion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In the Electroneuromyography exam， changes such as the reduction of the amplitude and duration of the action potentials of the motor unit with early recruitment stand out， in which there may be， in some cases， fibrillations and positive acute waves. In nerve conduction studies， the result is usually normal， but there may be a reduction in the amplitude of the Compound Muscle Action Potential(CMAP) with prolonged duration， suggesting MDC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\nMuscle biopsy shows signs of myopathy with loss of myosin， severe atrophy of type 2 fast-twitch fibers and loss of the myosin heavy chain. Findings such as accumulation of inflammatory cells， glycogen or lipids are not typical of MDC and indicate the need for|删除段之间换行|investigation of differential diagnosis， such as immune-mediated inflammatory myopathies， dystrophic or metabolic myopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The patient persistently refused to perform invasive exams， as he progressed with evident clinical improvement. Such complementary exams were not performed and a diagnosis was established based on clinical criteria：“Generalized weakness developing after the onset of a serious illness； diffuse weakness (affecting the proximal and distal muscles)， symmetrical， flabby and sparing cranial nerves； the sum of the MRC-SS score <48 points， more than once with an interval>24h； and other causes of weakness unrelated to serious illnesses have been ruled out.”\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】ICUAW canbring long-term consequences. It is important to pay attention to identify it， in the ICU environment， and provide early rehabilitation in order to minimize chronic dysfunctions，morbidity and disability.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

A well-known complication of nephrotic syndrome is increased risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)， caused by various physiologic changes. Multiple treatment options are available for the treatment of VTE， including heparin， warfarin，and non-warfarin oral anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban. In this case report， we describe a 25-year-old male who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a Pulmonary Embolism (PE). He was deemed low-risk and eligible for discharge from the ED with rivaroxaban. The treatment is believed to have failed after he developed another VTE in a renal vein five months later while taking rivaroxaban daily. He was admitted to the hospital for thrombolysis and was subsequently diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome and hypoalbuminemia. There is no available data on the use of rivaroxaban in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Despite the fact that hypoalbuminemia could result in higher serum concentration of free drug for highly protein-bound agents such as rivaroxaban， the additional VTE risk inherent to NS appears to have led to re-thrombosis in this patient. Based on the pathophysiology of nephrotic syndrome， we caution the use of rivaroxaban in patients with this condition.\n\n【2】Keywords： Rivaroxaban； Venous thromboembolism； Nephrotic syndrome； Hypoalbuminemia； Pulmonary embolism；Anticoagulation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) is a rare manifestation ofkidney disease with an annual incidence of three per 100，000 persons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. NS is defined as proteinuria >3.5 grams per 1.73 m止body surface area per day in association with hypoalbuminemia， peripheral edema， and hypercholesterolemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，3\\]</u>. NS may be caused by systemic disease， medication， infection， or intrinsic renal disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Development of VTE is a well-known risk of NS with incidence of up to 25% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， not all causes of NS confer the same risk of VTE. Risk is higher in patients with membranous nephropathy compared to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>. A number of physiologic changes occur in patients with NS that may explain the prothrombotic state， which can be generalized as increased platelet reactivity， increased activation of the coagulation system， and reduced activity of the fibrinolytic system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>.\n\n【6】VTE includes both Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) as well as Pulmonary Embolism (PE). PE may be present in 40% to 50% of patients with DVT and has an average mortality of 10% to 15% in the first one to three months after diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10-12\\]</u>.Other complications of DVT and PE include right ventricular dysfunction and post-thrombotic syndrome， which is characterized by pain， heaviness， and swelling of the leg secondary to venous valvular damage caused by the venous thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\nThereare a number oftreatments for patients with VTE，including heparin，low molecular weight heparins， vitamin K antagonists (i.e. warfarin)， and non-warfarin oral anticoagulants， including factor Xa inhibitors and direct thrombin inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Of the non-warfarin oral anticoagulants， rivaroxaban， apixaban， edoxaban， and dabigatran are all FDA-approved for treatment of DVT and PE. Rivaroxaban was shown to be a non-inferior treatment option for DVTand PE when compared with the standard of care (i.e. enoxaparin and warfarin.) in the EINSTEIN and EINSTEIN PE trials通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. Rivaroxaban treatment demonstrates unique advantages over traditional therapy with warfarin due to decreased need for laboratory monitoring， dosing adjustments， and decreased costs|删除段之间换行|when compared to the standard treatment \\[16-291. Rivaroxaban is a highly protein-bound drug with 92% to 95% protein binding(primarily to albumin). It is hepatically metabolized with a terminal half-life of 5 h to 9 h. Approximately 66% of drug excretion occurs in the urine via active tubular secretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Patients with severely reduced kidney function were excluded from the EINSTEIN and EINSTEIN PE studies； therefore， rivaroxaban should be used with caution in patients with advanced kidney disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. EINSTEIN does not report any demographic or outcomes data in patients with nephrotic syndrome. Clinical management of rivaroxaban in this unique subset of patients remains unclear. This case report describes a recurrence of VTE in a young， previously healthy， obese male receiving rivaroxaban treatment for an unprovoked PE who was later diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 25-year-old Hispanic male presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of chest pain after traveling for approximately 24 h via airplane and car. His past medical history was significant only for obesity， weighing 120 kg with a BMI of 36.8kg/m²at presentation. There was no known family history of VTE. A chest CT was obtained， which revealed a PE in the subsegmental arteries of the posterior basal right lung. Patient was deemed low-risk based on the absence of Hestia criteria， and discharged with outpatient management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. He was prescribed rivaroxaban 15 mg by mouth twice daily for 21 days， followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg by mouth daily for 12 months. Of note， a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) upon presentation revealed hypoalbuminemia， with a serum albumin of 3.0 g/dL (normal 3.4 g/dL to 5.0 g/dL). Serum creatinine at that time was 1.06 mg/dL and BUN was 20 mg/dL， both within normal limits.\n\n【10】He followed up with his Primary Care Provider (PCP) two days later and was prescribed tramadol 50 mg and cyclobenzaprine 5 mg for persistent abdominal and chest pain， which was attributed to the recent PE. He also followed up with the outpatient Embolism Clinic， managed by clinical pharmacists，6 weeks after the PE diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. At this visit， the patient reported no issues with rivaroxaban therapy， indicating no adverse effects or barriers to adherence. He had not missed any doses and the clinical pharmacist verified appropriate fill history with his outpatient pharmacy. Duration of therapy and additional education points were also discussed and documented at that time.\n\n【11】Two months later， the patient presented to the ED with severe abdominal pain and was found to have an extensive right renal vein thrombus that extended into the Inferior Vena Cava (IVC). Of note， the patient was still taking rivaroxaban， as prescribed， at this time. He was noted to have a serum albumin level of 1.8 g/dL.\n\n【12】He was admitted to the hospital， underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis with alteplase and systemic heparin， and a suprarenal IVC filter was placed. Serial imaging showed resolution of caval thrombus with residual non-occlusive renal vein thrombosis， at which point the IVC filter was removed.\n\n【13】ue to developing a new， large thrombus while being therapeutically anticoagulated， Hematology began an inpatient hypercoagulability work-up . A scrotal ultra品sound and germcell tumor markers were obtainedto rule out malignancy-related VTE； both were normal . Nephrology also began to work up and treat his NS empirically with methylprednisolone and prednisone.\n\n【14】Table 1： Hypercoagulability Screens (all negative).\n\n【15】Hypercoagulability Screens (all negative)\n\n| Anti-neutrophil antibody  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dilute Russel viper venom (lupus anticoagulant)  |  |\n| Factor V Leiden mutation R506Q  |  |\n| Prothrombin Factor 2 G20210A  |  |\n| IgG and IgM beta 2 glycoproteins (antiphospholipid syndrome)  |  |\n| Anti cardiolipin IgG antibody  |  |\n| Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria panel (RBC and WBC)  |  |\n\n【17】Table 2： Other hypercoagulability-associated laboratory tests.\n\n| Other Hypercoagulability-Associated Laboratory Tests  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Test  | Result  | ReferenceRange  |\n| C3 Complement  | 102 mg/dL  | 90 to180 mg/dL  |\n| C4 Complement  | 9 mg/dLt  | 10 to 40 mg/dL  |\n| Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) IgG  | <1：20  | <1：20  |\n| Phospholipase A2 receptor antibody lgG  | <1：10  | <1：10  |\n| Antithrombin 3 level  | 72%十  | 82% to 136%  |\n| Double Stranded DNA antibody  | 32 units  | 0 to 99 units  |\n| Serum alpha-tetoprotein  | 3.9 ng/mL  | 0.7.9 ng/mL  |\n| Serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin  | <1U/L  | 0 to 3 IU/L  |\n| Glomerular basement membrane antibodyIgG  | 0AU/mL  | 0 to 19 AU/mL  |\n| IgM  | 40 mg/dL  | 40 to 230 mg/dL  |\n| IgG  | 616mg/dLt  | 700 to 1600mg/dL  |\n| IgA  | 272 mg/dL  | 70 to 400 mg/dL  |\n| Platelet aggregation  | Normal with allagonists  |  |\n| Immunofixation for monoclonal protein band  | Negative  |  |\n\n【19】tIndicates result value outside of the reference range\n\n【20】The decision was made to switch this patient from rivaroxaban to warfarin. He was discharged after 9 days of hospitalization with a5-day prescription for therapeutic enoxaparin as a bridge to warfarin therapy. The patient has remained on warfarin with no further episodes of VTE to date.\n\n【21】His NS was empirically treated with prednisone until biopsy Wasdone three months after discharge. Immunofluorescence stain for PLA2R and immunoperoxidase stain for TSHD7A， the most common antigens for membranous nephropathy， were both negative at that time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Immunofluorescence stain showed anti-IgG predominant glomerular capillary loop deposits consistent with membranous nephropathy. Electron microscopy also showed numerous subepithelial electron dense deposits， consistent with membranous glomerulopathy. He was started on cyclosporine 100mg by mouth twice a day， and prednisone was decreased to 40 mg by mouth daily. Immunosuppressive therapy， such as cyclosporine Orcyclophosphamide， is indicated in patients with idiopathic membranous glomerulonephropathy who have experienced severe or life-threatening symptoms related to NS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The prednisone dose was tapered and stopped slowly over the following 8 months due to the development of iatrogenic Cushing Syndrome.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\nThrombus recurrence while therapeuticallyanticoagulated with rivaroxaban is uncommon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14，15\\]</u>. The EINSTEINPE trial|删除段之间换行|demonstrated rivaroxaban treatment provided similar protection against recurrent VTE compared to the standard treatment of enoxaparin bridged to a vitamin K antagonist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However， while patients with creatinine clearance <30 mL/min were excluded， there was no reporting of albumin levels or presence of proteinuria in the study. The clinical conundrum described above raises the question of Rivaroxaban's efficacy for treatment of PE in patients with NS. There is currently no published data on the efficacy of rivaroxaban in patients with NS or hypoalbuminemia.\n\n【24】Rivaroxaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that was approved for the treatment of DVT and PE in 2012. Dabigatran， apixaban， edoxaban， and enoxaparin bridged to a vitamin K antagonist are also approved for the treatment of venous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Rivaroxaban is highly (92% to 95%) bound to plasma protein， the most significant of which is albumin， and has a volume of distribution of approximately 50 liters 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. It reaches peak concentrations in 2 h to 4 h and has a half-life of 5 h to 9 h in adults and up to 11 h to 13h in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17，22\\]</u>. About 2/3 of each dose undergoes metabolic degradation and about 1/3 undergoes direct renal excretion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Standard dosing for the treatment of DVT or PE is 15 mg by mouth twice a day for 21 days， followed by at least six months of 20 mg by mouth daily.\n\n【25】A number of physiologic changes in patients with NS increase the risk of thrombus formation. Platelets in patients with NS are hypercoagulable， and the degree of hypercoagulability correlates with the severity of NS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. This may be due to hypercholesterolemia or increased thromboxane generation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23-25\\]</u>. Other prothrombotic factors such as factor VIII and fibrinogen also have increased rates of synthesis and increased plasma concentrations in patients with NS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Plasminogen and antithrombin levels are also decreased in patients with NS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. These changes all increase the risk of VTE in patients with NS. In addition to NS， the patient was at increased risk for development of VTE due to obesity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. However， his hypercoagulability workup by Hematology did not reveal any other definitive causes for increased risk of VTE.\n\n【26】Other physiologic changes in patients with NS could also affect VTE treatment. Urinary protein loss， mostly of albumin but also of other proteins， is a defining feature of NS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Hypoalbuminemia was shown to be an independent risk factor for thrombus formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Despite this risk， hypoalbuminemia theoretically should increase the serum concentration of free rivaroxaban due to its high degree of protein binding. This juxtaposition of competing factors results in an unclear overall risk profile for thrombus formation. To our knowledge，there are no other case reports or literature evaluating the use of rivaroxaban in patients with NS. Current literature provides the strongest support for the use of heparin or low molecular weight heparins followed by vitamin K antagonist for the treatment of VTE in patients with NS通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7，28\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\nIn this case report， we describe a patient with previously undiagnosed NS who developed an extensive renal vein thrombus while being treated for a prior PE with rivaroxaban. Rivaroxaban is one of several drugs approved for the treatment of PE， although limited data exists regarding its use in patients with NS. We suggest that the development of repeat thrombus in this patient may be due to either rivaroxaban treatment failure or the physiologic changes in patients with NS. With numerous alternative treatment options for|删除段之间换行|VTE， we suggest caution in the use of rivaroxaban in patients with NS.

The virus can cause severe respiratory problems and affects the lungs. Timely precautions and accurate diagnosis is necessary to contain the spread of the virus. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was often misdiagnosed as Pneumonia and Tuberculosis(TB) in some cases. Accurate diagnosis is as important as timely diagnosis of this virus. For this purpose， multiple Machine Learning (ML) Deep Learning (DL)， and Transfer Learning (TL) based approaches have been used. This paper analyzes transferlearning-based models that have been used， including classes ofimages， diseases， datasets， and accuracy.\n\n【2】Keywords： Transfer Learning； Machine Learning； Deep Learning； COVID-19； X-ray； CT； Lungs\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of the Coronavirus infection a pandemic in March 2020， called the COVID-19 pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic. After initially starting in Wuhan， China， the virus later spread to every nation in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The person who has the coronavirus can distribute it to others by coughing or sneezing respiratory droplets. These droplets have the potential to contaminate the surfaces， even more， speeding up the spread. People with the coronavirus may experience respiratory conditions ranging from minor to serious that may call for ventilation support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world， the first task which had to be tackled was the detection of the disease in its early stages so patients will be quarantined and the spread will be controlled.\n\n【6】At first， COVID was diagnosed using nasal swabs and Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)， but these methods had high false positive rates and were slow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The researchers claimed that by using image processing and AI techniques， the process of detecting COVID-19 can be made faster and more accurate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. As all these diseases i.e. pneumonia， TB， and COVID-19 damaged a similar part of the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This became an issue as it caused misdiagnosis， which furtherlead to wrongtreatment. The researchers used ML and DL to accurately classify COVID-19 from other lung diseases. For this purpose， chest X-rays and CT scan images were used. After this Transfer Learning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> is used to get results more accurately and on time.\n\n【8】In this study， different Transfer learning models for classifying COVID-19 are discussed.\n\n【9】Transfer Learning\n\n【10】A transfer learning model takes parts of a trained machine learning model and applies them to a new， but similar， problem. Through transfer learning， the performance of a current task is improved by utilizing source data that are different from， but similar to， the target data. In a target task， the current problem is being solved. The source task is similar to the target task 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The purpose of the transfer is to use the experience gained in one task to improve performance in a similar but different one 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Transfer learning is employed in this study to identify some useful characteristics derived from a large amount of source data collected under one working condition， and then transfer these characteristics to a target task under a different working condition with only a limited amount of target data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Sum mary of Methodologies based on Image Type\n\n【13】Dataset description\n\n【14】The datasets were taken from public resources mostly from Kaggle and GitHub. Datasets taken contained CCOVID-19-positive Pneumonia，TB，and healthy images. In terms of radiological images， X-ray and chest CT scan images were used.\n\n【15】Models and methods\n\n【16】Authors in consideration have used transfer learning either as they were with increasing or decreasing layers， by an ensemble of two or more models， or in image preprocessing step by applying algorithms and filters.\n\n【17】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> focused on feature extraction， dimension reduction， and classification of diseases using X-ray images. For feature extraction， authors ensemble deep Convolutional Neural Network CNN using Xception and InceptionResnetV2. The extracted features were then passed from a custom-made sparse autoencoder for reducing dimensionality and then Feed Forward Neural Network(FFNN) was used for classification. But a huge range of parameter values of sparse autoencoder was not experimented with and was neglected during the creation ofthe model.\n\n【18】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> applied a modified lightweight CNN model for purpose of classification. The proposed CNN model contained four 2D convolutional layers and one fully connected layer with a MaxPooling 2D layer. The dropout regularization technique was also applied after each layer. A three-step process was proposed by 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The first step was segmentation which was done using C-GAN. The second step was feature extraction for which multiple deep transfer learning models and algorithms were used and the last step was classification which was done by machine learning classifiers. Final comparisons showed that VGG19 combined with Binary Robust Invariant Scalable Key-points (BRISK) algorithm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> showed the highest accuracy.\n\n【19】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> have used cGAN to generate images and these images were fed to CNN models (ResNet-50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， ResNet-101通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， Xception， DenseNet-201 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>，DenseNet-169通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>). SoftMax classifier was used in these models to classify images. This model is used to overcome data imbalances and overfitting. CNN models when using images without cGAN produced average testing accuracy of 90.71%， and when the images were generated with the help of cGAN， the testing accuracy of 92.17%.ResNet-50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> showed the best accuracy among these all. Though the dataset was still limited in this study the classes of COVID from different stages were taken which was a remarkable attempt in the said matter.\n\n【20】CNN-based model namely，CovFrameNet， is proposed by authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. SoftMax layer was used for classification purposes and deep learning regularization techniques were applied to avoid overfitting. In 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>， ResNet-101 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> is used as the backbone architecture. The weights of the image were extracted from the last layer of the architecture， and an average of these weights was calculated. That average weight was then used to generate a heatmap.\n\n【21】Authors have proposed an algorithm with a CNN model to increase the accuracy of COVID detection. A public dataset of CT images was used out of which 120 images were taken this study focuses on detecting Ground Glass Opacities from the CT images通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【22】To increase the detection accuracy authors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> have designed a lightweight CNN model，D2-CovidNet，by proposing feature-sensitive modules called Dual-Path Multiscale (DPM) feature fusion modules and Dense Depth-wise Separable (DDS) convolution modules as these have strong characterization capabilities and efficient computing abilities. In 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>，authors have proposed an algorithm was proposed to classify COVID-19 accurately. Different pre-trained CNN models(SeresNext50，SeresNext101) along with Sparrow Search Algorithms(SpaSA) were used. Out of these models， MobileNetV3Large showed the best results. Similarly， in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>， the author has used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)， Zeiler and Fergus Network (ZFNet) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>， and Dense ConyolutionalNetwork-121 (DenseNet-121 1 17D architectures of deep convolutional neural network models to provide an accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 on binary classification. Out of these， customized CNN showed the best performance.\n\n【23】In 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>， Ensemble learning was used to ensemble the transfer learning models i.e.， EfficientNet， GoogLeNet， and XceptionNet. Which performed classification among taken images. Whereas， authors ensembled DenseNet-121 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and Resnet-50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> based on their orthogonal features and created and trained a deep learning network named DenResCov-19 in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. DenResCov-19 network is a concatenation of four blocks from ResNet-50通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> and DenseNet-121通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> with width， height， and frames of 58×58×256， 28×28×512，14x14x1024， and 7x7×2048， respectively. A model was created in通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> created by the assembly of DenseNet， h5， and the Inception model. And results were demonstrated based on weights.\n\n【24】The authors have created a model named DeQueezeNet by ensemble DenseNet-121 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and SqueezeNet1.0 to increase the COVID-19 prediction efficiency by extracting various important features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. In 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>， ResNet-50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> with 5 folds and 10 folds cross-validation to recognize COVID-19 is being used.\n\n【25】Three models i.e.， Inception V3， ResNet34，and DenseNet-201 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> are being used in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u> and they were ensemble to detect COVID-19more accurately using a bagging ensemble， called ET-NET.\n\n【26】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u> have combined DenseNet and Optimization of Transfer Learning Setting (OTLS) strategy to make the diagnosis of COVID more accurate. A Composite Learning Factor (CLF) was put to work to assign learning factors t different layers. It was observed that “201-IV”achieved better performance by using the proposed OTLS strategy.\n\n【27】In 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>， the authors used a pre-trained transfer learning-based framework on the CheXnet model， which is trained in DenseNet-121通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. In 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>， authors have ensemble three models named DCCNs， ResNet152V2，and VGG16 to tackle the sensitivity issue.\n\n【28】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u> have fine-tuned existing pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG16，VGG19， Inception V3， ResNet-50通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， ResNet50V2， InceptionResNetV2， Xception， and MobileNet on CT images and then these models were used to create a strong ensemble classifier that makes the further decision. Models were further divided into 5clf and 8clf. The results of 5clf showed better results than that of 8clf.\n\n【29】Authors in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u> have focused on feature extraction from R， G，and B areas of CT images using Empirical Wavelet Transformation. Then DenseNet 121 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> is used to classify these images based on COVID-19and non-COVID. A classifier fusion strategy is proposed in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u> that fuses the predictions from the different classifiers via majority voting.\n\n【30】Apart from that authors have used pertained variants of the ResNet model to detect COVID with more accuracy. The results showed that ResNet-50 has outperformed other variants with a recall of 98.80%.\n\n【31】Limitations and Future Work\n\nFrom this brief study following drawbacks have been found along|删除段之间换行|with suggestions to improve them：\n\nOverfitting is the common one seen which can be avoided|删除段之间换行|by more regularization techniques.\n\nThough models showed good accuracy there was no balance|删除段之间换行|between accuracy and speed.\n\nMostly the validation of the models is for only binary|删除段之间换行|classification and three-class classification tasks\n\n【36】Models should be validated in one specific coherent.\n\n【37】The major drawback of detecting COVID with ML techniques is the unavailability of public datasets. Researchers have used limited datasets.\n\n【38】Imbalance in the dataset can be seen in work that has used large datasets.\n\n【39】Another one is that accuracy of the model is affected when the test dataset has a different origin than that of validation.\n\nCXR and CT images have been separately used in most of|删除段之间换行|the studies. The one in which both of them are used showed better|删除段之间换行|results.\n\n【41】Some of the models showed issues with feature extraction.\n\n【42】Some datasets were from specific geographical regions which arise validity issues.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n\n【44】In this paper， transfer learning models and methods have been discussed which are used to detect and classify COVID-19 from other lung diseases using lung X-rayand CT scan images. The lung diseases in observation were Pneumonia and TB. Many models were used like CNN， Resnet， DenseNet， Xception， GoogleNet， VGG， and Alexnet. Lesser dataset caused overfitting and noisy images in the dataset resulted in lower accuracy. To remove noise and overcome overfitting image preprocessing techniques including data augmentation and cGAN were used. Ensemble learning and algorithms during different phases of the model are being used to boost classification accuracy. Models pretrained on ImageNet datasets were also considered to extract better results. In 2 class classification， MobileNet V3 showed better results， whereas， in 4 class classification with a larger dataset， ensemble learning has been proved to be better than other techniques with an average accuracy of more than 95%. It is concluded from the study that even though there is a lot of work done in this field. There still are drawbacks that can be improved by using different models and better approaches.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

We present a case of a 49 year old female with left lung mass and left pleural nodule showing typical clinical and radiologic features of pulmonary synovial sarcoma with focal unusual histomorphology.

Immunohistochemistry demonstrated Pan-Cytokeratin and CK7 immunoreactivity with focal S-100 expression， but were negative for muscle markers， other melanoma markers， and CD34. The tumour was negative for t(x；18). In conclusion， awareness of focal unusual histology in otherwise typical pulmonary synovial sarcoma can prevent misdiagnosis， particularly when t(x； 18) is negative.\n\n【2】Keywords： Pulmonary； Pleura； Synovial sarcoma\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma is an aggressive tumor sharing common histologic features with soft tissue synovial sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-5\\]</u>. Molecular testing for the pathognomonic t(x； 18) chromosomal translocation has enabled diagnostic confirmation in approximately 90% of cases通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In t(x； 18) negative cases， diagnosis must rely on histologic and immunophenotypic features. The differential diagnosis of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma is particularly challenging when histologic features unusual to synovial sarcoma， but common to other neoplasms are focally present. This challenge is compounded with negative t(x； 18) findings. We present a case ofprimary pulmonary synovial sarcoma where unusual histology was present and t(x； 18) was negative. We offer diagnostic pearls to prevent misdiagnosis in such challenging cases.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 49 year old female presented with chest pain and shortness of breath with no significant medical or family history. Laboratory and cardiac work-up was normal and chest x-ray showed a left pulmonary mass. Computed tomography redemonstrated the pulmonary mass with likely metastatic left pleural nodule . Biopsy and surgical excision of tumour showed classic monophasic pulmonary synovial sarcoma histology with dense spindled cellularity， interlacing fascicles， and hyalinized stroma as diagnosed by a pulmonary pathologist， however with focal Verocay body formation， rhabdoid morphology and vague rosette formation . Immunohistochemistry showed pancytokeratin and CK7 immunoreactivity with focal S-100expression， but were negative for muscle markers， other melanoma markers， and CD34. The SYT/SSX RNA fusion transcripts resulting from t{x； 18) 通用删除11(英):<u>(p11； q11)</u> translocation were not detected using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The patient showed no sign of widespread metastatic disease and was treated with complete resection of tumour and received adjuvant radiation treatment. The patient presented with recurrence and pericardial seeding eight months later and died of disease 10 months following diagnosis.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\nSynovial sarcoma， although rare， is a primary pulmonary neoplasm with distinctive histology. The presence of focal unusual histologic findings characteristic of more common epithelial and mesenchymal tumors may lead to misdiagnosis. This is particularly problematic in small biopsies or in primary pulmonary synovial sarcomas that are negative for the pathognomonic t(x； 18) translocation. We present a case of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma with unusual histologic|删除段之间换行|features， negative for t(x；18). The focal unusual histology in primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma can erroneously suggest more common primary and metastatic pulmonary neoplasms. Verocay body-like areas in this case were similar to those seen in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The stromal background of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor， however， typically lacks hyalinization and appears more basophilic. While focal immunoreactivity for S-100 can be present in both tumors， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma is often immunoreactive for cytokeratin 7， a finding not generally seen in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Clinically， malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors arise from nerve or neurofibroma and are associated with neurofibromatosis type I in approximately two-thirds of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma with focal vague rosette formation can leadto misdiagnosis as primitive neuroectodermal tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7\\]</u>. Primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma may also be reminiscent of primitive neuroectodermal|删除段之间换行|tumor when the former is poorly differentiated and displays round cell morphology. Unlike primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma， primitive neuroectodermal tumor typically has distinct cell borders， clear cytoplasm， scant stroma， and lacks hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature typically seen with primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma. Both tumors can express CD99，CD56， and cytokeratins， 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> although expression of cytokeratin 7 makes a diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumor less likely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Chromosomal translocation t (11； 22) is present in 85% of primitive neuroectodermal tumors通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We present a case of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma with focal unusual histologic features that may erroneously suggest more common primary and metastatic pulmonary neoplasms. This unusual histology may be particularly chalenging in small biopsies or when t(x； 18) is negative. Awareness of typical histology of pulmonary synovial sarcoma， their potential misleading unusual morphologic features， and prudent use of Immunohistochemistry will prevent misdiagnosis， even in t(x； 18)-negative cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

The individual who takes the drug assigns multiple meanings both to the drug itself and to the fact of taking it 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Considering that today's patients often seek diagnosis online before visiting a doctor， and verify the recommendations received after the appointment itself， they often arrive at their doctor's doorstep having already formed a preconceived opinion about their alleged condition and the treatment required. In some cases， this can make consultation easier； in others， it may result in increased difficulties in introducing the correct drug therapy. In the latter case， the doctor's clinical experience may prove to be of paramount importance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This paper describes the case of an individual suffering from generalized anxiety disorder who presented for counselling with a self-diagnosis of dissociation and a hesitant attitude towards pharmacological treatment. The first step enabling the introduction of treatment was to reformulate the patient's prior beliefs.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 38-year-old IT company employee came forward with complaints of \"derealization and dissociation\"， which he diagnosed himselfwith based on descriptions available online， claiming that“there are no cures for this\"， also based on internet sources.\n\n【4】First appointment\n\n【5】通用间距删除-1:<u>OPEN ACCESS</u>\n\n【6】通用间距删除-1:<u>\\Correspondence：</u>\n\n【7】通用间距删除-1:<u>Slawomir Murawiec， Mental Health Centre， Harmonia Luxmed Medical Centre， Warsaw， Poland，</u>\n\n【8】The patient described the symptoms experienced in a way that mostly corresponded to his self-diagnosed condition， saying： \"I have been in a state of permanent dissociation and derealization for3 weeks. In these states， I feel like I'm doing everything on autopilot； my consciousness is watching what I'm doing； these states are exacerbated in stressful situations. My stress resistance has dropped to zero.\"Further， he added the following： \"I have also read that there is no treatment for dissociation and derealization， only psychotherapy can help.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>E-mail： smurawiec@gmail.com Received Date： 14 Feb 2023Accepted Date： 23 Feb 2023Published Date： 27 Feb 2023 Citation：</u>\n\n【10】The meaning structure imposed by the patient at the onset of the appointment was based on a diagnosis formulated by the patient himself and a narrowing of the range of treatment options available. Yet， at the same time， the patient reported to a psychiatrist rather than a psychotherapist， which indicated uncertainty about his own attitude. During anamnesis， it was established that the patient had already experienced such a state of mind before. He recounted： \"I had already felt like this at one point， the previous time was after a party， during which I had taken a psychoactive substance.\n\nMurawiec S.

This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License， which permits unrestricted use， distribution， and reproductionin any medium， provided the original work|删除段之间换行|is properly cited.\n\n【12】The patient made a connection between the two periods when he was experiencing similar feelings， saying that the psychoactive drugs he had taken many years before had permanently damaged his brain， with his current state being a manifestation of biological brain damage. Sharing this concern expanded the scope of the conversation to include a new area： Anxiety. This made it possible to go beyond the meaning of \"dissociation and derealization\"-for which \"there are no cures\"- as proposed at the beginning. It soon turned out that the patient was facing an increased workload and experienced more pressure at work (which he caused himself) and believed his workplace intellectual performance to be declining. His interpretation was as follows： \"I am not so efficient at work because I had damaged my brain at that time； this damage has permanent consequences\".\n\n【13】Subsequent statements by the patient directly pointed to anxiety symptoms\n\n【14】“My thoughts are that I'm very scared it's going to get worse； I'm going to run out of strength to fight it. I feel like I'm losing my identity in a way. I have this question about who I am， what I want and what is important lingering over my head. Profoundly philosophical. I am afraid this condition will get worse. I am afraid that something might happen to me， a serious illness. If I wake up in this state at night， allI want to do is survive； sometimes panic sets in.\"\n\n【15】He also reported experiencing a “constant feeling of anxiety\"and claimed： \"I have always been thinking of what might go wrong； my head couldn’t stop； I would go from a minor thing to tragic consequences. The patient had a multifaceted neurological diagnosis. No features of CNS neurological problems were found.\n\n【16】This statement by the patient also indicated another aspect of the treatment that proved crucial. One important value for the patient was his identity -the question \"Who am I?\". Indeed， this question made the context of treatment more meaningful still. It made it clear that the patient would not accept treatment that would lead to a subjectively discernible violation of his sense of identity. The patient needed to be in control of himself and that which concerned him. After all， he reported to the doctor with a ready-made self-diagnosis and views on the possibility of receiving help. In the subsequent part of the conversation，he stressed the importance of his sense of self， of who he was.\n\n【17】After reformulating the diagnosis from1“dissociationi and derealization\" to \"anxiety disorder\"， to which the patient agreed，he was presented with a description of generalized anxiety disorder. The patient fully identified with this description. Treatment with pregabalin was then suggested， which included a reference to the presentation ofdrug-related information and the summary ofproduct characteristics. The remainder of the visit was spent discussing the patient's fears， anxieties and beliefs about the possible use of the drug. While the patient ultimately agreed to take pregabalin， he did indicate that he had an appointment with another psychiatrist to get a \"second opinion\".\n\n【18】Further treatment stages\n\n【19】The second opinion he sought confirmed the recommendation to take pregabalin. At the follow-up appointment， the patient reported that \"This drug has helped a little， I don't have as many panic attacks\". He was taking 75 mg of pregabalin at the time； however， he did not consent to an increase in the dosage of the drug. He feared that taking higher doses would make him lose his identity. Subsequent appointments with the patient can be described as a \"negotiation\"between the desire to take higher doses of pregabalin， linked to perceived improvements in mood and function， and fears of losing control. Although the patient had carefully read the information about the drug， including the dose range starting from 150 mg， and did not dispute this information，he expressed strong concerns about increasing the drug dosage (and simultaneously a desire to do so). These concerns applied even to the threshold dose indicated in the leaflet. The patient was concerned about losing control over himself and his well-being， as well as suffering a loss of identity， and feeling a sense of dependence on a drug-a factor beyond his control.\n\nAfter increasing the dose of pregabalin to 150 mg， the patient experienced a marked improvement， including in terms of mood and function throughout the day. As a result， he grew even more hesitant|删除段之间换行|about the drug he was taking. The drug's effect proved to be very helpful； the irritating and function-limiting symptoms he had been suffering from for years began to disappear. On the other hand， this confronted the patient with the feeling that his well-being was not entirely up to him and was not fully un der his control， raising his fear and，ironically， creating some anxiety. Nonetheless， so great were the benefits of taking pregabalin that the patient opted for another dose increase to 225 mg. The features of generalized anxiety have subsided， and the patient's functioning in many spheres has significantly expanded in capacity. The patient reframed his mindset， recognizing that “I'm myself the way I am now\". He was satisfied with the new opportunities to meet other people (which had previously been significantly limited)， to travel and go on trips， and the significant improvement in his workplace status and image.\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】An important feature of generalized anxiety disorder is a specific form of anxiety- thinking of negative scenarios of future events， anticipatory anxiety and having anxious thoughts about the future. Individuals suffering from this disorder often craft elaborate scenarios full of negative expectations based only on a piece oftrivial information 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Their anxiety can take many forms， some of which do not directly indicate that they are experiencing it. Patient complaints can include a range of somatic and psychological symptoms， as well as a variety of behaviors. To formulate a diagnosis， it is necessary to carry out a more thorough history taking and discuss with the patient the content of the experiences underlying the reported symptoms.\n\nIndividuals suffering from anxiety may express fear of SDe treatment and various aspects of it， including those of a highly improbable nature. This fear should be thoroughly discussed to ensure the patient's cooperation in treatment.

The hydronephrosis and pulmonary infiltrates rapidly improved under immunosuppressive therapy with high-dose corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil oral QD. The signs and symptoms of ANCA negative vasculitis are varied， which can lead to misdiagnosis. In clinical practice， patients with progressive renal failure and hydronephrosis but ANCA negative need to be screened for vessel vasculitis also.\n\n【2】Keywords： ANCA-negative vasculitis； ANCA-negative pauci-immune CrGN； Hydronephrosis； Pulmonary infiltrates\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】通用间距删除-1:<u>OPEN ACCESS</u>\n\n【5】通用间距删除-1:<u>\\Correspondence：</u>\n\n【6】通用间距删除-1:<u>Minou Zhang， Department of Nephrology， Hangzhou TCM Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang Chinese Medical University Tiyuchang Road 453，</u>\n\n【7】通用间距删除-1:<u>Hangzhou 310007，China，</u>\n\n【8】通用间距删除-1:<u>E-mail： zhangminou@163.com</u>\n\n【9】ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (AAV) is a group of diseases characterized by inflammation and destruction of small-and medium-sized blood vessels and the presence of circulating ANCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Other abnormal laboratory findings include elevated C-reactive protein|删除段之间换行|(40.2 mg/L)， alkaline phosphatase (190 U/L)， blood urea nitrogen(47 mg/dl)， decreased albumin (2.3 g/dL)， complement C3c (40 mg/dL)，and a normal complement C4 (25 mg/dl). Brucella (capture) was<1/80 negative. Patient underwent hemodialysis due to decline in kidney functions and oliguria. Percutaneous kidney biopsy revealed immune complex focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis. Treatment plan at discharge included 64 mg/day oral prednisone， 6cycles of cyclophosphamide (500 mg) for 6 months followed by oral azathioprine (2 mg/dayx50 mg/day) for 6 months.\n\n【9】Patient was non-compliant for his follow-ups. Patient was admitted to our clinic with dizziness， headache， night sweating， dry mouth， fatigue， and worsening in kidney function (SCr： 7.6 mg/dl) at 1-year follow-up. Some laboratory findings at admission were hemoglobin 5.7 g/dl， albumin 2.7 g/dL， CRP 79.9 mg/L， and BUN 54mg/dl. Kidney biopsy was performed with the preliminary diagnosis ofacute or chronic renal failure and biopsy revealed immune complex focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis. And patient received corticosteroid and rituximab therapy. On that visit Brucella (capture) was >1/5250 positive. Doxycycline (2 mg/day x100 mg/day)+rifampicin (1 mg/dayx 600 mg/day) + ceftriaxone (2 g/dayx2g/day) treatment was planned by the infectious disease department. CLI Bone marrow biopsy was performed regarding the possibility of bone marrow aplasia in response to immunosuppressive treatment， though， no pathological finding had been determined. Patient was discharged after symptomatic relief and improvement in kidney function (SCr：4.8 mg/dl) . Two months later the patient presented to clinic for routine outpatient follow-up. He had no complaints and his kidney functions were improved (SCr： 1.44 mg/dl). Follow-up of the patient for 6 months was uneventful.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Brucellosis is the most common zoonotic infection in Turkey， primarily affects bones， lymphatic tissies， and the heart. The genitourinary involvement rate of brucellosis is around 2% to 20%. Orchitisand epididymitis are the most common types of genitourinary involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Symptomatic renal involvement is especially rare with limited number of cases including membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis， tubulointerstitial nephritis， IgA nephropathy， and a single case of RPGN 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-8\\]</u>. Only one case of RPGN associated with Brucellosis reported by Ardalan and SShoja \\[通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>which demonstrated RPGN in a young male patient which responded to rifampicin + doxycycline+ corticosteroid treatment dramatically in 2weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>， while we report RPGN case in an elderly male patient who required multiple hospitalizations during the course of treatment and became difficult to manage. Decline in kidney functions， hematuria， weight loss， requirement for RBC transfusions， multiple hospitalizations， morbidity and mortality are possible in the course of Brucellosis-associated RPGN especially， if it is not considered in the differential diagnosis or inappropriately treated. In addition， Brucellosis-associated kidney involvement may occur at any age despite most reported cases include young patients.\n\nFurthermore， our case is significant by illustrating immune complex depositions which may be the primary mechanism of kidney involvement in the course of Brucellosis. Since immune complex depositions are frequently observed on kidney biopsies performed with the preliminary diagnosis of RPGN， it is important to consider Brucellosis， an infection， as a differential diagnosis of immune complex deposits especially in areas where it is endemic along with predominant causes， including systemic lupus erythematosus and|删除段之间换行|other immune complex ANCA-positive vasculitis.\n\n【13】Even though renal involvement rates are low and most cases report good prognosis and general status， it is important to point out the possibility of RPGN as a manifestation in which emergency cases may develop. Low rates of Brucellosis-associated kidney involvement may also be a consequence of not being considered in the differential diagnosis in most instances. Therefore， we recommend consideration of Brucellosis in the differential diagnosis of glomerulonephritis especially in the areas where Brucellosis is endemic or in patients with specific environmental or other risk factors. Also， it may be beneficial to evaluate Brucella serology in RPGN patients with unknown etiology after elimination ofpredominant causes which could become a cost-effective approach for patient evaluation.\n\n删除6:<u>1\\.

Data were collected through standardized Nordic MSDs questionnaire and strain index tool for distal upper extremities on selected garment workers. And also using logistic regression analysis were used to identify the factors that influence the prevalence of work-related Musculoskeletal disorders and associated risk factors for operators.\n\n【3】Result： The result showed that the prevalence rate for Musculoskeletal pain in different body regions was 93.9% in the low back， 93.3% in the upper back， 76% in the neck， 65.4% in the hip/thigh/and buttocks， 52.0% in the shoulder， 45.8% in the elbow， 40.2% in the wrist or hand， 33% in the knee and 36.9% in the ankle or feet. Moreover， the Strain Index (SI) score indicates hazardous (57%) and some risk (29%)， uncertain (21.7%)， and probably safe (3.5%) of upper extremity disorders during performing their tasks.\n\n【4】Conclusion： After analysis of the data using regression models， the result revealed that the suitability of the sitting chair with the sewing workstation， the comfort of the working environment， job satisfaction， medical history in the previous 12 months related to MSDs， working experience， education level， and gender were the most significant factors associated with the prevalence of WRMSDs among various body parts. The finding revealed the workstation of sewing machine operator andemphasized the need for ergonomic interventions to minimize the MSDs among them.\n\n【5】Keywords： MSDs (Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders)； Strain index； Nordic MSDs Questionnaire\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】More than half of all countries in the world do not keep official statistics on work-related occupational sickness. Particularly in underdeveloped nations， there is a lack of data reporting in the domain of work-related sickness and musculoskeletal disorders. In nowadays， Garment is a rapidly growing sector in Ethiopia. Reports show that until the end of 2007 E.C. There were 102 garment industries in Ethiopia. Among these garments， 79 of them were found in Addis Ababa and 22 of them were found Oromia special zone near Addis. Approximately more than 10，000 workers (70%female) were working in this sector which became a great source of employment.\n\n【8】In the report of the Ethiopian Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA)， from 279establishments in the year 2014/2015， a total of 5，135 work-related accidents were reported and among which 5，092 (99.16%) were non-fatal. This resulted in a cost of 2，195，960.74 ETB for a medical case and an absence of 12，612 workdays by injured employees. According to MOLSA report of 2014/15 in manufacturing industries 2856 (56.62%)， victims were registered as work-related accidents and diseases， in which garment industry is one of the most hazardous sectors because mostly garment factory works are repetitive and requiring strong visual demands， improper postural requirements and involving long hours sitting or standing in one position.\n\n【9】In the sewing section， the risks for sewing machine operators have been linked to conditions such as poor workstation design， and actions should be taken to eliminate the causes of this disorder and make the workplace safe and healthy for the operators.\n\nSo， this paper mainly focuses on assessing the prevalence and associated risk factors of work-|删除段之间换行|related musculoskeletal disorders in different body segments of operators in sewing workstations in the case company.\n\n【11】As we see in Figure 1， in Desta garment， the sewing section workstation is not scientifically looking suitable.\n\n【12】Finally， this paper conducted to fill this gap by ergonomically evaluating the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders in different bodysegments andassociated risk factors for sewing section operators， and then using logistics regression analysis to identify which factors are significantly associated with musculoskeletal disorders.\n\n【13】Literature Review\n\n【14】Ergonomics is the process of designing or arranging workplaces， products， and systems so that they fit the people who use them， and the profession that applies theoretical principles， data， and methods to design to optimize well-being and overall performance.\n\n【15】Maintain neutral posture and ergonomics workstation\n\n【16】The neutral posture is the ergonomic standard for sitting in a chair and using the computer or standing.

There are three major categories of the workplace：Sitting， standing， and sit/stand.\n\n【18】Ergonomics in sewing room\n\nThe workingposture at sewing machines should allowthe mobility of the limbs， ergonomically favorable arrangement of working and visible zones， and a stable balanced state when performing the work process. The study stated that 70% of sewing machine operators using foot controls report back pain， 35% report persistent low back pain， 25% have suffered a work-related disorder and 49% of workers experience pain in the neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

It is defined as the time during which the operator was occupied performing a task and would be unable to perform another task at that time with that hand|删除段之间换行|and it's assumed as the duration of exertions.\n\n【52】The ratio of busy time to cycle time provides insight into how much non-busy time is available to the worker. This non-busy time may be used for rest， or it may provide time to correct if an error or disruption occurs，busy time was used to determine the allocated time for each task. Allocated time for a task is the amount oftime a person is busy plus the amount of rest associated with that task. So allocated time was determined the total observation time in seconds using a stopwatch.\n\nC. Efforts per minute are measured by counting the number of exertions that occur during an observation period， then dividing the number of exertions by the duration of the observation period， measured in minutes. synonymous with the frequency of exertions per minute. The number of exertions is calculated as busy time without rest in required time in minutes|删除段之间换行|number of exertions Efforts per Minute =total observation time (min)\n\n【54】Hand/Wrist posture is an estimation of the position of the hand or wrist relative to the neutral position or it is the anatomical posture of the hand\n\n【55】E.

(health and safety training). Mekonnen et al.(comfortable of the working environment). According to Nazerian et al， (fitness of sitting chairs with the working machine)， and according to Girma， job satisfaction was assessed using the liker scale to identify the level of satisfaction on the work， the option was 5 Likert scales (very unsatisfied， dissatisfied，neutral， satisfied， and very satisfied)， and the researcher was converted into one independent variable. These had been computed according to Macdonald's workplace job satisfaction scale.\n\n【68】In the second part， a questionnaire helped to collect information about the severity of musculoskeletal disorders in different body segments that are present while performing a task during the last 12months. According to Kuorinka et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>， the Standardized Nordic musculoskeletal tool was not only developed for clinical diagnosis. According to Biadgo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， based on the severity of MSDs report from participants and taken as the dependent variables in nine body parts (neck， shoulder， upper back， elbows， wrist/hands， lower back， hip/thighs， knees， and ankle/feet). The results from these surveys determine the amount of severity of musculoskeletal disorders in operators body segments， and using the analysis tool， determine the associated risk factors and the prevalence of MSDs that are present in the selected company.\n\n【69】Reliability test： The reliability of the Standard Nordic MSDs questionnaire and strain index was pre-tested among 20 (11%)， selected operators from participants were tested using Cronbach's alpha =0.710 and 0.762， respectively， and the reliability of this instrument was supposed to be tolerable. The 9th item job satisfaction scale questionnaire was also checked for reliability and a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.796 was found. The goodness of the model fitness has been checked using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness oftest which showed x²=6.394 with df=8 and significant of =0.603. the Hosmer-Lemeshow test should be insignificant as the p-value at 0.05 indicates that the variable entered fits the model.\n\n【70】Data analysis\n\n【71】The demographic features， personal factors， job-related factors， and SI score linked with MSDs of the study population were reported as a number， percentages， and frequency using the IBM SPSS version26 software program for descriptive analysis.\n\n【72】Theconnection betweenmusculoskeletal symptomsand independent variables for each body part was investigated using bivariate and multivariant logistic regression analysis. To assess the effective variables of MSDs disorders， nine distinct regression models were created for nine different body areas. The association between the dependent and independent variables was examined by bivariant logistic regression analysis. The Odds Ratios (ORs)， p-value， and 95%Confidence Intervals (CIs) were calculated from bivariant logistic regression models. The statistically significant level， p<0.05 was considered for all statistical tests.\n\n【73】A Chi-square test was used for testing the hypothesis to identify the significant factors for the MSDs among the operators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The data was then displayed in a variety of statistical tools. As a result， all of the data contribute to the completion of the study and the precise determination of the workstation's evaluation.\n\n【74】Table 1： Demographic and personal factors of participants in Desta garment Addis Ababa， Ethiopia， April删除4:<u> 2021</u>.\n\n| Categories of variables  | Frequency(n=179)  | Percent (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  |  |  |\n| Valid 19-60  | 179  | 100  |\n| Gender  |  |  |\n| Male  | 11  | 6.1  |\n| Female  | 168  | 93.9  |\n| Marital status?

Here we report a case of breast cancer in which heterogeneous IBF-FDG accumulation demonstrated on digital PET/CT correlated with intratumoral heterogeneity histopathologically.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 56-year-old Japanese woman presented to our medical center with a palpable mass in her right breast. She had no previous or family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Elastic hard mass was palpable in her right breast. Mammography and ultrasound revealed a lobulated shaped mass in the breast and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the right axilla suspicious of breast cancer with multiple axillary lymph node metastases. The internal echo was homogeneous on ultrasound. The MRI appearance was of a lobulated mass surrounded by slight rim and septal enhancement within the tumor. Biopsy of the lesion revealed invasive ductal carcinoma.\n\nThe patient underwent 'F-FDG PET/CT of the right breast and axillary lesions as part of the preoperative work-up. Scanning was performed using a digital PET/CT scanner (Discovery MI； GE Medical Systems， Milwaukee， WI) about 60 min after the intravenous administration of 5.49MBq/kg oflF-FDG. PET was performed from the skull base to the proximal thigh with the patient in the supine position； the patient was then moved into the prone position using a hand-made breast positioning device， and single-bed PET/CT was performed of the breast region alone. The CT and PET acquisition parameters were as follows. Non-contrast whole-body and additional regional CT scans were obtained at 120 kV with automatic dose modulation， and PET was performed with acquisition time of 2.10 min per bed position in three-dimensional mode. The PET images were then reconstructed using Q.Clear (GE Medical Systems； B=400) with attenuation correction. The|删除段之间换行|interval between the two PET/CT scans was 17 min. The images revealed marked focal IF-FDG uptake with SUVmax of 27.9 that corresponded to the breast lesion identified on other modalities. The tumor appeared heterogeneous accumulation on PET image . No distant metastases were detected. The clinical staging was T2N1M0 Stage II. Right modified radical mastectomy was performed. Histological analysis revealed invasive ductal carcinoma， mixed type， with pleomorphic carcinoma components. The histological appearance was of a mixed tumor with solid and cystic components bounded by fibrous septa. Areas with abundant tumor cells in the lesion identified with Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining and with Ki-67 staining matched the site of marked IF-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images， and fibrotic or cystic sites corresponded with areas of hypo-1F-FDG accumulation seen on the PET images.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， the tumor demonstrated heterogeneous accumulation on PET that correlated to intratumoral heterogeneity histopathologically.\n\nThe role of PET/CT in breast cancer has been the pre-treatment systemic staging of locally advanced breast cancer. Several breast cancer guidelines have not recommended PET/CT for women with|删除段之间换行|apparent early-stage breast cancer or even for those with operable stage III breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The use of PET/CT for imaging primary breast lesions is hampered by its low spatial resolution， which reduces its sensitivity by missing small lesions； in addition， it is less sensitive than sentinel lymph node biopsy for assessing axillary lymph node involvement. The low prevalence of distant metastases in these patients and the relatively high risk of false-positive findings are considered to detract from the usefulness of PET/CT for distant staging in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The development of dedicated Breast PET (dBPET) systems has enabled detailed high-resolution imaging by setting the detector close to breast lesion. An association between baseline tumor glycolytic activity and tumor biology have been reported. Masumoto et al. reported that intratumoral heterogeneity on dBPET can predict the malignancy grade of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. They considered that such intratumoral heterogeneity could not be demonstrated on conventional PET/CT. However， the dBPET is specialized for breast scan， it cannot obtain whole-body image at same equipment.\n\n【12】Advances in PET/CT technology have improved image quality and the ability to detect small lesions. In a previous study， the quantitation and detectability of sub-centimeter spheres was higher with a digital PET/CT system compared with conventional OSEM-based reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In the present case of invasive ductal carcinoma， PET/CT imaging acquired with a digital PET/CT system demonstrated heterogeneous 18F-FDG accumulation. A. marked abundance of tumor cells identified within the lesion histopathologically with HE staining matched the region of marked18F-FDG accumulation identified on the PET images， and fibrotic and cystic sites matched those of 1F-FDG hypo-accumulation. It is known that US and MRI have high tissue resolution； however， the present case shows the ability of digital PET/CT to evaluate the internal properties of tumors.\n\n【13】In conclusion， we report a case of invasive ductal carcinoma that demonstrated heterogeneous IF-FDG accumulation on novel digital PET/CT that correlated to histopathological intratumoral heterogeneity. Digital PET/CT imaging shows potential for evaluating the internal properties of a lesion and may enable prognostic prediction.\n\nwith Ki-67 staining (c， d) that matches areas of marked 1F-FDG accumulation on the PET images.

Her past medical history included heart transplant8 years ago for cardiomyopathy， hypertension and a recent open umbilical hernia repair with mesh. Her medications included oral immunosuppressive medications (tacrolimus and mycophenalate) and anti-hypertensive's (amlodipone). She was not known to have any allergies.\n\n【2】Routine observations on admission were normal. Abdominal examination demonstrated a non-distended abdomen with localized guarding and rebound tenderness in the right iliac fossa.\n\n【3】ECG was in sinus rhythm with heartbeat of 96 Beats per Minute (BPM). A recent echocardiogram demonstrated normal ventricular and valvular function. Routine biochemistry was largely unremarkable with a mildly raised CRP at 38 but normal white cell count and no evidence of neutrophilia. Computerized tomography showed uncomplicated acute appendicitis and a post-operative seroma around her previous open umbilical hernia repair site.\n\n【4】Broad spectrum intravenous antimicrobial treatment was commenced prior to surgery and the case was discussed with the patient's transplant team. It was advised that immunosuppressant agents be continued as per her usual dose. Additional treatment with steroids or anti-fungals was not recommended.\n\n【5】An open appendicectomy was performed. The appendix was divided and delivered through a Lanz incision using an Alexi's wound protector. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure with systolic BP ranging from 98 mmHg to 118 mmHg. She was admitted to a general surgical ward post-operatively where she made an unremarkable recovery and was discharged three days later. The patient returned 2 weeks post-operatively for a planned wound review and was noted to have a clean well-healing scar. No major complications were recorded within the 30-day post-operative period and histological examination of the specimen confirmed acute appendicitis.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】A clear understandingand appreciation ofthe altered physiology in particular cardiac physiology in transplant patients is vital. This knowledge is crucial to the general surgeon and will help guide with decisions such as the best approach to intra-abdominal surgery. In addition it is important to recognize that transplant patients are often on of a cocktail of immunosuppressive medications and the impact this may have on post-operative complications， in particular surgical site infections. Effective management of such a patient is best approached with the aid of a multidisciplinary team.\n\n【8】Altered cardiac physiology in transplant patients and the impact on intra-abdominal surgery\n\n【9】The transplanted heart lacks both sympathetic as well as parasympathetic innervation. The loss of vagal tone results in a higher resting heart rate； between 90-110 Beats per Minute (BPM) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Another key change in physiology is that the transplanted heart depends entirely on venous return. It is said to be pre-load dependant'通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In normal cardiac physiology，hypovolaemia results in an increase in cardiac output by increasing heart rate and increasing contractility. This is achieved by the stimulation of neurohormonal pathways as well as the activation of Frank-Starling mechanism通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\nA transplanted heart cannot respond to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimuli， and is therefore dependant entirely on venous return 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. This is an important consideration in intra-abdominal surgery， as many gold standard approaches are laparoscopic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Laparoscopic surgery|删除段之间换行|involves establishing pneumoperitoneum. The increase in intra-abdominal pressures during surgery may decrease venous return and this in turn may reduce heart rate. Unfortunately a denervated heart will be unable to compensate by utilizing neurohormonal pathways due to the reasons discussed above 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. In the case reported here， this altered cardiac physiology was the primary reason an open approach was adopted. Whilst laparoscopic appendicectomy， is now the gold standard approach， in this case an open approach was in the patient's best interest.\n\n【11】Immunosuppression： surgical considerations\n\n【12】To reduce the risk of rejection， transplanted patients are on a combination of immunosuppressant medications. The commonest combination is tacrolimus and mycophenalate with or without prednisolone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Whilst an important， anti-rejection strategy， one of the key considerations post-operatively is the increased risk of infections. In particular the increased risk of surgical site infections通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our case this was an important consideration for several reasons. Firstly not only was our patient immunosuppressed， an additional factor to consider was the surgical approach. An open approach is associated with increased risk of surgical site infections通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. To reduce this risk， intra-operatively an Alexi's wound retractor was used. This offered protection to the wound edge during the operation， in particular during dissection of the acutely inflamed appendix. An additional advantage of using an Alexi’s wound retractor was to confer better visibility intra-operatively facilitating the identification of the appendix prior to dissection.\n\n【13】Effective multidisciplinary approach\n\n【14】In order to effectively manage transplant patients it is important to involve a number of teams.\n\n【15】Pre-operatively， as per Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> protocol， the patient was counseled. Information regarding the approach was discussed with the patient and consent was obtained for an open appendicectomy， due to reasons discussed above. Additionally， advice was sought from the patient’s transplant team. In particular， guidance was sought over the need to continue immunosuppression pre and post operatively. Furthermore a clear direction was sought for the need to start steroid and initiate anti-fungal therapy. The need for anti-microbials was also discussed with the microbiologists.\n\nPre-operatively， the case was discussed with cardiologist and cardiac physiologists to ensure that the transplanted heart was optimized prior to general anesthesia. All essential imaging and|删除段之间换行|cardiac physiology tests (echocardiogram， ECG) were conducted to the highest standard. Anesthetic opinion was sought both pre-operatively and intra-operatively， paying particular regard to goal directed fluid management and effective use of pain management. In accordance with ERAS intra-operative protocols， the incision was deliberately made as small as possible and care was taken to ensure strict aseptic control was maintained throughout. Despite a small incision， surgical visibility was adequate due to the use of the Alexis wound retractor.\n\n【17】Post-operatively，thepatient Was discussed with the physiotherapists and early mobilization was encouraged with good oral pain control. Once again in keeping with the ERAS protocols， the patient was encouraged to start oral intake early and effective pain management was prescribed.\n\n【18】Effective management of such patients is dependent on input from a number of specialties. Strict adherence to the ERAS protocols pre， peri and post-operatively ensures that patients are offered the best possible care allowing them to return to their normal activities of daily life sooner and decreasing post-operative complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

However， migration and early spontaneous expulsion of the screw after treatment of the symphysis pubis disjunction is considered rare. We present a report of a 64-year-old man who， after a fall from a height， presented with a disjunction of the pubic symphysis treated with two-plate fixation and presence of screw migration into the bladder and spontaneous expulsion one month after surgery.\n\n【2】Keywords： Screw； Pelvic fracture； Internal fixation； Bladder foreign body\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Disjunction ofthepelvic ring is associated with a 7%to 25%incidenceofurinarytract injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Treatment with an anterior plate in the pelvis is recommended as a fixation method for disjunctions of the pubic symphysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>. Because the fixation is performed in the joint area， micro movements occur and may cause plate breakage or loosening of screws 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The literature demonstrates that late screw loosening with migration to the bladder is relatively common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. In this study， we report a case of migration to the bladder and early (one month) spontaneous expulsion of the screw after anterior pelvic ring surgery with plates in the pubic symphysis.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Male patient， 64 years old， victim of a fall from a roof， approximately three and a half meters high on November 254，删除4:<u> 2021</u>. Upon admission to the orthopedic emergency room， after physical examination and imaging tests， the opening of the pubic symphysis chapter II was diagnosed.\n\n【7】Both the patient and the fracture remained stable throughout the treatment， and it was decided not to temporarily fix the pelvis with an external fixator. After carrying out all the preoperative preparation， the definitive orthopedic surgical procedure was performed seven days after the trauma. A pelvic approach was used through the Pfannenstiel access， with associated detachment to protect the urinary bladder. The orthopedic surgical technique used was the placement of two orthogonal plates， one superior and one anterior. Top plate was large fragment DCP with 4 mm x4.5 mm screws. The anterior reconstruction plate was made of small fragments with 4 mmx3.5mm screws. Satisfactory radiographic control was performed at all stages .\n\n【8】On January 015， 2022， the patient reported spontaneously eliminating， via urine， 1 screw 3.5mm from the anterior plate after loosening the plate. After examination of excretory urography associated with cystoscopy， it was confirmed the formation of a fistula in the anterior wall， close to the transition with the lateral/medial bladder fundus， around 0.6 cm .\n\nThe formation of the fistula was due to a foreign body reaction (friction against the bladder) after loosening the 3.5 mm screw， and after its formation it was encompassed by the organ. From the urological point of view， we proceeded in an expectant manner， keeping the patient using an indwelling urinary catheter for 30 days associated with the use of the antibiotic Bactrim|删除段之间换行|(sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim) for 10 days and ultrasound control to confirm the closure of the orifice. From the orthopedic point of view， watchful waiting was maintained； with no weight bearing for two months associated with radiographic control and computed tomography.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Screw migration to the bladder after disjunction of the pubic symphysis with exit through the urethra has been reported as an extremely rare event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Bladder injury can be caused by the trauma itself， considering theproximity ofthe organ to thebone，byherniation of the bladder into the symphysis or by iatrogenic injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Perry and Husmann 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> observed that 50% ofurethral injuries after fracture of the pelvis in women were not diagnosed by inadequate urological evaluation.\n\n【12】Fridman et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and Sho et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported a patient with spontaneous expulsion of the implant after fixation of the pubic symphysis similar to our case. Peled et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported that there was an injury to the bladder during the trauma， therefore， the possibility that the screw migrated through the injured area cannot be excluded.\n\nThepubicCsymphysisis afibrous joint thateexhibits micromovements during walking. Therefore， when the surgeon performs fixation ofthe pubic symphysis， in the pelvic ring， loosening of the screw and/or breakage of the screw and plate is common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. What is observed in the literature is the presence of this complication|删除段之间换行|in patients with disjunction symphysis pubis treated with a plate， in which migration of the screw to the bladder generally occurs late 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-4\\]</u>. Hosseini et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported a case of bladder perforation due to screw loosening seven weeks after pelvic surgery， which was treated with cystoscopic screw removal. Unlike the previous case described by Hosseini et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， our case involved the exceptional case with migration of the screw to the bladder with spontaneous elimination1 month after surgery， still in a state of convalescence and without any complaints. This reinforces the lack of diagnosis due to previous bladder injury， which may have favored its migration， despite the patient still being at rest.\n\n【14】Matta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> advocated a single， curved pelvic plate with four or six holes with 3.5 mm screws.

To avoid the instability generated by fixation of the pubic symphysis， fixation with two plates was chosen a 4.5DCP in the upper region and a 3.5 anterior reconstruction plate. The doubt raised by the authors was the need for posterior fixation of the sacroiliac joint and the use of long V-shaped anterior screws， which could stabilize the pelvis， preventing screw migration.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】This report is intended to alert orthopedic surgeons to be careful with the fixation ofthe pubic symphysis and to look for the diagnosis of bladder injuries due to trauma， avoiding complications such as migration of the screw to the bladder.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

He underwent parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP and soft tissue calcification was observed， but calcific uremic arteriolopathy keep progressive development.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 43-year-old man with uremia due to glomerulonephritis， receiving hemodialysis since 2010， three times per week， four hours per time， was presented with ulcer of left heel for 1 month. He found a swelling over the right shoulder joint in early删除4:<u> 2011</u>. The swelling was mobile and soft， and grew rapidly from 2 cm to 10 cm in five months， but he had neither pain nor skin changes. There was no special treatment or regular examination of serum calcium， phosphorus and intact Parathyroid Hormone (iPTH). Over the next two years， another swelling developed over the left elbow joint similar to the ones described for the right shoulder joint. He hospitalized for lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain in July删除4:<u> 2016</u>. Blood tests revealed： (iPTH) 2156.5 pg/ml (<72 pg/ml). Computed Tomography (CT) scans showed bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass opacities areas distributed in the upper lobes . He was diagnosed with uremic renal osteopathy and uremic pulmonary metastatic calcification. There was no significant decrease in iPTH level after treatment with calcimimetics for 2 months. The lumbosacral area and bower limbs pain still progresses. He was difficulty in walking by the end of 2017. One yearlater， the patient returned to our hospital with the complaint of severe pain in left heel. In the past eight years， his height has been shortened by 6cm and his weight has dropped by 20kg.\n\nPhysical examination on admission showed： Emaciated form， a blood pressure of BP 144/96mmHg， a pulse rate of 90/min， a body temperature of 36.5℃ and a respiratory rate of 28/min. Two irregular， hard masses were found around right shoulder joint and left elbow joint. Joint range of|删除段之间换行|(A) and coronal (B) computed tomography in lungs window shows more calcifications in both upper lungs.\n\n【5】motion was normal and with no pain. Tender and necrotic indurated plaques with surrounding erythema were noted on his left heel.\n\n【6】Blood tests revealed： Calcium 2.27 (2.02-2.57) mg/dl，phosphorus of 2.53 (0.6-1.6) mg/dl， and iPTH levels up to 2580.5 pg/ml. Parathyroid scintigraphywas performed 15 min and 2 h after injection of Tc99m MIBI.

The pain of lumbosacral and lower limbs was significantly relieved the second day after operation， but the pain on heel ulcer was not relieved.

Peri-articular soft-tissue calcifications ofthe right shoulder were barely visible . X-ray of knee joint showed have no change . calciphylaxis on his left heel got worsen .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\nWith the advent of hemodialysis technology， the incidence of secondary hyperparathyroidism is rapidly increasing and metastatic calcification has become prominent. Metastatic calcification refers to the deposition of calcium in normal tissue， that is commonly|删除段之间换行|associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Regions most commonly involved by this pathology are subcutaneous tissue， soft tissues of periarticular， vascular wall， internal organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the presented case， a middle-aged patient suffered from multiple metastatic calcification due to secondary hyperparathyroidism. The biggest differences of our patient are the widespread metastatic calcification with pulmonary metastases， vascular calcification， soft tissue calcification surrounding large joint and calcific uremic arteriolopathy. To our knowledge， no similar researches have been reported in the past.\n\n【10】The diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism is mainly depending on the history of chronic renal failure and elevated PTH levels， hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia were also observed.\n\n【11】Visceral calcinosis can affect lung， stomach， heart， pancreas， and kidneys， but lung is the most vulnerable organ 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The pathological characteristics of Metastatic Pulmonary Calcification (MPC) is calcium salt deposition in basement membranes ofthe epithelium and endothelium of pulmonaryalveoli 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The main pathogenesis of MPC has not yet been illustrated， but some factors， such as hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia， dialysis-associated intermittent acid-base imbalance， and local secretion of free hydrogen ions in the lungs， kidneys， and stomach have been suggested as the risk factors for MPC formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The diagnostic rate of MPC is very low， but histological changes of MPC are seen at autopsy in 60% to 75% of maintenance hemodialysis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. This may probably due to insufficient sensitivity of chest X-ray examination， poorly understood about the imaging manifestations of MPC among clinicians， and the benign clinical course of the disease.\n\n【12】Chest radiographs are not very sensitive in the detection of MPC， especially in early stage of disease (small calcifications)， and are usually show patchy or confluent airspace opacities or normal. CT has high sensitivity in an early detection of MPC. A chest CT scan of metastatic pulmonary calcification reveals of bilateral， diffuse， centrilobular， ground-glass nodular opacities and partially calcified nodules or consolidations， predominantly in the upper lung fields， is the most common finding on 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. Calcium preferentially deposits in relatively alkaline tissues. The upperlung fields have high Ventilation/Perfusion (V/Q) ratio， creating high oxygen and low carbon dioxide levels.\n\n【13】The high V/Q ratio results in decreased PaCO， and increased pH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Therefore， it had nothing strange that the lung apex is more commonly involved than the lung base. In our case showed symmetrical， multiple， centrilobular areas of ground-glass opacity throughout both upper lung area in 2016. Preoperative CT scan showed more calcareous were deposited in upper lung zones， but not in lung base，which was in accordance with the characteristics of MPC imaging changes. In addition， radionuclide imaging is another useful technique in finding out the early MPC， demonstrating generally symmetrical and increased radioactive isotope uptake in affected lung fields 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The pathological examination is the diagnostical golden standard for metastatic pulmonary calcification. However， it is largely limited in clinical applications since it is an invasive procedure.\n\nMPC is a benign lesion， it generally slows progression in a long time， but it can also deteriorate rapidly within several weeks or months通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Most patients with MPC are asymptomatic， but several cases of hemoptysis， cough， dyspnea have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，9\\]</u>. In our case， diffuse， patchy high-density shadows were found in both upper lungs|删除段之间换行|in 2016. The imaging changes of MPC were obviously aggravated in 2018 before operation， but throughout， the patient have no any respiratory symptoms. Preoperative pulmonary function test mainly shows mild restrictive ventilatory dysfunction. The pathological changes were absorbed gradually after five months of operation.\n\n【15】So far， the best treatment of MPC has not been established. The mainstayoftreatmentisnormalizationofphosphate and calciumlevels， primarily with phosphate binders. Another means is too applicate of active vitamin D to control secondary hyperparathyroidism on the basis of maintaining normal calcium-phosphorus product 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Most of these patients with asymptomatic， non-progressive MPC do not need to intervention since these patients eventually died of other causes instead of MPC. Cases have been reported that MPC can be fully absorbed after parathyroidectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11，12\\]</u>. More research’s need to be done to see whether renal transplant is good for MPC通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In this case， the patient has no any respiratory symptoms， however， besides MPC， the patient had multiple periarticular metastatic calcifications， severe systemic vascular calcification， bone deformation，bone pain and calciphylaxis of the heel at the same time. Therefore， he underwent total parathyroidectomy. Five months after surgery a rapid regression of MCP was observed.\n\n【16】Soft tissue calcifications are another common manifestation of secondary hyperparathyroidism， characterized by large calcium phosphate deposition into cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues. Depositing of calcium salt in periarticular soft tissue region on patients of maintenance hemodialysis for chronic renal failure call Uremic Tumoral Calcinosis (UTC). Its estimated incidence is between 0.5% and 7% of hemodialysis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. It usually presents with benign nodules at periarticular sites， mainly manifests as firm， painless， lobular， tumor-like masses around the joints that can lead to limitation of movement of joint when large in size. The key feature is absence of erosion and destruction of nearby bone， and such lesions is reversible after medication or parathyroidectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The sites commonly affected are soft tissues of periarticular shoulder， elbow， hip regions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， other areas such as wrist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>， spine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>， and knee have been observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Our patient had extensive involvement of the shoulder and elbow； findings were consistent with metastatic calcinosis cut is secondary to TC. Why does it preferentially occur around joints? The exact mechanism behind this clinical entity is unknown. It may be related to the pH value of joint fluid， like the pathogenesis of gout. However， there have been no related experimental investigations published on this subject. In the natural course of such lesions is usually slow and progressive over several years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Sometimes， too much tumoral masses leads to ulceration with superadded secondary infection. In this case， five months after surgery， a rapid complete absorption of the tumoral masses around the right shoulder and left were observed.\n\n【17】Additionally， this case also showed calcification in vessels along chest and limbs. There was no improvement in systemic vascular calcification， instead an aggravation of calcific uremic arteriolopathy on his left heel was observed. These results consistent with the previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19，20\\]</u>， indicating that once calcification develops it probably cannot be reversed and tends to become more severe as time passes.\n\nOverall， we report this case for the purpose of expanding the clinical and treatment of multiple metastatic calcifications in patient with SHPTH.

The true incidence is unknown. The available estimates in literature report the range from 1/1800 to 1/2500of all caesarean delivery performed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. The only risk factor is one or more previous caesarean sections. Vaginal bleeding of different degrees may be the first sign of a caesarean scar pregnancy， while pain is usually not a typical presenting symptom.

The initial and early US (between 5 and 7weeks) are critical to avoid misdiagnosis. The differential diagnoses are： cervical pregnancy and a miscarriage in progress. US diagnosis criteria are： empty uterine cavity and emptyendocervical canal with detection of an early gestational sac and/or placenta in close proximity of the hysterotomy scar/niche， an absent or thin myometrial layer between the gestational sac and the anterior uterine wall and an abundant peri-trophoblastic blood flow at Doppler examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

The woman did a caesarean section an year before in Sri Lanka. The pregnancy was studied with transvaginal and abdominal ultrasound exam that described：“Anteverted uterus， inside which is displayed a 21 mm gestational sac on the bottom with a single embryo with BCE， 7 mm CRL and biometry corresponding to 6+2 weeks. Area of organized hematoma of 42 mm x 37 mm. Another gestational sac of 18 mm at isthmic level that reaches the hysterotomy scar， with a single embryo with BCE， 5 mm CRL. The thickness of the myometrium above the scar is regular and not invaded by the trophoblast.\" Pregnancy arising on|删除段之间换行|the hysterotomy site was very dangerous for the mother and for the pregnancy itself. As pregnancy progressed， it could cause uterus rupture with consequent loss of the second gestational chamber and risk of death for the mother. Furthermore， between the two gestational chambers there was a large hematoma of unclear origin (detachment area?) which was probably the cause of the woman’s blood loss. The patient was hemodynamically stable. At first we waited three days to monitor the conditions of the woman and the twin pregnancy. The maternal blood loss progressively stopped， the two embryos grew regularly， both had a heartbeat and the hematoma between them remained stable compared to previous checks. The woman wished to continue with the intrauterine pregnancy， so we proposed her to perform selective voluntary abortion of the embryo located on the previous hysterotomy site. This attitude was intended to preserve the other pregnancy and to avoid bad consequences for the mother but it was not without risk. The abortion of the first embryo would have eliminated the risk of a future uterus rupture but could also lead to the abortion the second fetus. To carry out the abortion we decided to use aspiration of part of the sac contents and the injection of 2% KCl inside the gestational chamber because it minimizes the risks posed to the coexisting intrauterine pregnancy. We decided to abort the pregnancy on the caesarean scar but to leave the residual gestational sac in place to let it reabsorb on its own because removing it could cause the loss of the other pregnancy.\n\n【6】The operation was performed with local anesthesia and sedation. After a thorough disinfection of the vagina and external genitalia， the Criyagen transvaginal ultrasound probe was inserted and highlighted the two gestational chambers， one of which on the hysterotomy site and the hematoma organized between them. An oocyte retrieval needle was inserted through the posterior vaginal fornix with which5 cc of intracavitary fluid were aspirated and 1 cc of intracardiac KCl2 mEq/mL solution was injected into the embryo in the isthmus. We saw the arrest of the ECB of the embryo. At the end of the procedure， in the US exam the heartbeat of the embryo on the bottom was present .\n\n【7】After the procedure we carefully monitored the woman with serial clinical， blood chemistry and transvaginal ultrasound checks. The days after there was minimal blood loss that stopped after a few days. At the US exams was described on the bottom of the uterus a single embryo with BCE， increasing CRL corresponding to the weeks.\n\n【8】On the previous hysterotomy site there was a residual gestational sac in resorption. The thickness of the myometrium above the scar was regular and not invaded by the trophoblast. Upon discharge， the mother was sent back to normal pregnancy management by Pontedera Hospital. The pregnancy continued regularly， the growth of the remaining fetus was regular. The patient underwent an elective caesarean section at Lucca Hospital at 39 weeks and the fetal outcome was excellent.\n\n【9】Result and Discussion\n\nThe optimal management of CSP has not been completely clarified yet 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is a common clinical practice to offer termination of pregnancy in view of the reported high rate of morbidity associated通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7，8\\]</u>. Iftheembryohas noheartbeat， it can followa waitingprocedure because a spontaneous abortion could occur. If the heartbeat is present it is better to perform an interruption of pregnancy because the risks of uterus rupture and other complications become greater通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There are pharmacological treatments and surgical treatments. Operative methods include laparotomy， uterine artery embolization， hysteroscopy and curettage with suction. Dilatation and curettage with subsequent intrauterine Foley catheter insertion may be simple|删除段之间换行|and effective but it is not recommended because it carries significant risk of bleeding and of secondary hysterectomy with fertility loss通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Pharmacological treatment options include systemic or local administration of Methotrexate (MTX)， local administration of hyperosmolar glucose solution， chloride potassium， prostaglandin or combination of the medications. These substances can be used in laparoscopic assistance or directly injected into the gestational sac. Some authors reported local or systemic methotrexate administration as a most effective treatment but systemic methotrexate treatment can’t be used on the routine due to relatively low efficacy (fibrous tissue is poorly vascularized and drug penetration is insufficient) and high risk of various adverse effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. It is believed that MTX treatment is effective when serum bHCG levels are lower than 5000mIU/ml 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12-14\\]</u>. Ultrasound imaging is not only used to diagnose but it is also used as a part of a combined approach. In fact， under ultrasound guidance， we can inject local methotrexate therapy in fetal sac (or both in fetal sac and in fetal pole) to end the pregnancyand to offer fertility preservation in asymptomatic pregnant patients without concomitant hemodynamic disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Ifthe CSP exceeding 3 cm， local methotrexate administration can be followed by laparoscopic or laparotomy surgical correction of the caesarean section scar通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Promising results have also been obtained with the innovative HIFU technique that utilizes high intensity focused ultrasound通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The most effective way to manage caesarean scar pregnancy is synchronous use of different treatment methods. The combination of local methotrexate with simultaneous aspiration of gestational tissues under ultrasound guidance seems one of the better and minimally invasive attitudes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. It is the technique that we choose：Intracavitary fluid was aspirated and 1 cc of intracardiac KCl 2 mEq/mL solution was injected into the embryo. We have been very careful to inject methotrexate only in CSP and we have tried to be minimally invasive： Not to break the gestation sac and not to stimulate uterine contraction or spontaneous expulsion to protect the other pregnancy. We couldn't use systemic methotrexate because there were two pregnancies. After this stage， the remaining gestational tissues could be removed hysteroscopically with later vascular coagulation of the implantation site. In our case the remaining gestational tissues couldn’t be removed without damaging the pregnancy on the bottom， so we decided to leave it in place and to have it reabsorbed over time. As time passed the gestational material gradually reabsorbed while the bottom pregnancy continued to grow steadily. With this combined minimally invasive approach we have therefore saved the woman's life and preserved her fertility.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】A definitive consensus of CSP treatment hasn't established yet and the type of treatment method depends on many factors. It is necessary to adapt the treatment to each individual patient taking into account size of pregnancy， bHCG level， presence or absence of uterine continuity， patient’s hemodynamic state， other contemporary pregnancies and fertility preservation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Four weeks prior to the presentation， the patient had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2， and the cough continued as an aftereffect. The Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) was 1.0 and0.6 in the right and left eyes， respectively. Fundoscopy demonstrated bilateral serous retinal and choroidal detachments in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed bilateral serous retinal detachment and choroidal thickening. Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed multiple pinpoint leaks.

In the acute stage， bilateral panuveitis caused by choroidal inflammation， inner ear disorder， and meningitis are frequently observed. The chronic or late stages are characterized by granulomatous uveitis， sunset glow fundus， vitiligo， and gray hair.\n\n【6】The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the latest pandemic infection， which lasted for approximately three years in Japan. The ocular manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection include chemosis， epiphora， and conjunctival hyperemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.

This big data is of very important for designing the new drug product but it is very difficult to extract the information manually from this huge source. Now days a new ways of data mining and processing are on focus of the scientists such as Machine Learning (ML)， Deep Learning(DL) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Therefore， in the era of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer revolution， the conventional methods of product design seem to be irrelevant as personalized medicines are now getting more attention. Now the conventional approach of “one drug-fits all”have been replacing by the “customizable dosage forms\" based on the individual needs. So a large scale updation of pharmaceutical sector is indeed required to adopt for innovative engineering and processing methods of formulation development. Induction of computer simulation and computational approaches such as Quality by Design (QbD) concept， statistical analysis and simulation software's now shifted the paradigm from lab-based research to in-silico research where majority of the research activities related to product development are performed on the computer simulated mathematical models with high degree of accuracy covering the interaction of all the process variables. In silico approach eliminates the irrelevant sets of experiments and only provides the best suitable ones using AI based simulated model. The areas of application of AI approach in formulation development can be formulation optimization and pharmacokinetic evaluation as discussed one by one in the coming sections. The data of physicochemical properties of the different drugs， chemicals and excipients is stored in the AI enabled computer software. The AI algorhythm in the computer system find the expected results of the mutual interaction ofany given set of excipients and drug by the aid of algorhythm based mathematical calculations and predict the characteristics of the resulting formulation. Here we can optimize the formulation for the desired results as defined by the QbD tools by varying the concentrations of the excipients without performing the actual experimentation. Statistical tools such as Central Composite Design (CCD)，box-behnken design or others provide us with the different formulations with the varying concentration ranges of polymers which may have the desired and optimized formulation. Using computer algorhythm a blend of raw materials can be designed based on the physical and chemical properties ofthe drug and excipients to produce the product with desired characteristics. This saves the cost and time of research and increase the confidence on the quality of product. The customization of the dosage forms based on the individual needs is also possible through in-silico approach. The customization is done to adjust the pharmaceutical， pharmacokinetic and therapeutic characteristics of the product as per the need of the individual patients i.e.， based on the behavior of the drug in individual patients due to different genetic makeup and different body physiology. AI based evaluation of pharmacokinetics parameters is the necessary and important part of the formulation development as it reduces the attrition rate and failure of drug compounds during the clinical studies. AI based techniques predicts the ADME profile of the drug in a particular dosage form that not only help in drug optimization but also in drug repurposing. Establishing an In Vitro-In Vivo Correlation (IVIVC) predicts the pharmacokinetic behavior of the drug inside the body in earlier phase of the study before going in to the actual experimentation. In this manner a product can be designed from initial step to final optimized formulation using the computer simulated algorhythm. After validation of the final design， the product is developed in the lab and tested for its characteristics to check if these are as per the given specifications or not", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Survey-based studies and papers clearly not related to the object were excluded.\n\nA description of two consecutive cases of COVID-19-induced vestibular impairment evaluated at the Audiology and Phoniatrics Unit of Treviso Hospital between January 01， 2021 and January22m，2022 is reported. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. Patients gave their written consent for clinical case publication. Data were examined|删除段之间换行|in accordance with Italian privacy and sensitive data laws， and the in-house regulations of our Institution.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】Literature review\n\n【14】The review process is shown in Figure删除4:<u> 1</u>. After applying the above mentioned criteria， 15 papers were retrieved and 6 were included： 1retrospective 5\\] study and 5 case reports 6-10J.\n\n【15】Four patients were excluded from the article by Malayala et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> due to repetition of previously published cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， and to the presence of unconfirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found5 case reports which overall described 6 patients who were given the diagnosis of VN related to COVID-19. Five patients were female and one patient was a young male (age ranging from 13 to 63). They all were given the diagnosis of mild or moderate COVID-19 according to the international guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Table 1 summarizes characteristics of included patients.\n\n【16】All the patients experienced typical symptoms of VN： Rotatory vertigo and unsteadygait with associated nausea and vomit. Diagnosis was obtained through physical examination， instrumental tests and exclusion ofother possible disorders .\n\n【17】In three cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8，9\\]</u> the VN symptoms emerged at onset of COVID-19. In the other three patients the vestibular symptoms occurred after 13 days of COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， after 32 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and after2 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> from the beginning of infection. Notably two cases described by Vanaparthyet al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and Aasfara et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> alsopresented unilateral facial palsy. All patients were treated with corticosteroids and/or vestibular rehabilitation. In the cases who performed a follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8-10\\]</u>， a resolution of symptoms was noticed after one month.\n\n【18】Case report 1\n\n【19】A 31-year-old woman referred to our department. According to her history， in August 2020 she complained of cough， fever， rhinitis， headache， fatigue， muscular pain， and loss of smell and taste. The patient underwent nasopharyngeal swab and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection， as confirmed with Real-Time PCR test.\n\n【20】After three days since symptoms onset， she had sudden objective24-h-lasting vertigo， with nausea and vomiting. She did not have any associated cochlear symptoms (e.g.， tinnitus， hearing loss or ear fullness) or central nervous system symptoms (e.g.， diplopia or loss of consciousness). Accordingtohergeneralpractitioner'sadvice，shetook symptom-relief medications and rested. During the following days her vertigo and dizziness progressively improved. One month later， she tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection (PCR test on repeated nasopharyngeal swab). During the following months she complained of recurrent episodes of dizziness， therefore she underwent clinical evaluations in our department. At physical examination no relevant clinical signs were present： No postural sway， external auditory canals and tympanic membranes were normal， spontaneous nystagmus was absent， and bed-side examination (Rose position， Dix-Hallpike and Pagnini-McClure maneuvers) were negative. Bithermal caloric test was performed at 50°C for warm air and 24C for cold air， 60sec of stimulation per year under direct visualization of tympanic membrane. It showed a left side hyporeflexia (40% left hypofunction with 15% right side directional preponderance). Dizziness handicap inventory resulted in 30/100 (mild handicap). All other instrumental tests were negative： ocular motility tests were normal， pure-tone audiometryand ABR revealed bilateral normal hearing，and Distorted Product Otoacoustic Emissions (DPOAE) were present.\n\n【21】The patient had not suffered from any pre-existent audiovestibular disorder before infection. According to the symptoms described during SARS-CoV-2 infection and reported findings， a diagnosis of COVID-19-related Vestibular Neuritis (VN) in compensatory phase at the moment of our evaluation was hypothesized， therefore vestibular rehabilitation exercises were prescribed. One month later， on a telephone follow-up interview， the patient stated that her dizziness episodes had resolved.\n\n【22】Case report 2\n\n【23】A 44-year-old man was evaluated at our unit complaining of sudden onset， 4 h before， of objective rotatory vertigo， nausea and vomiting. No headache， diplopia， paresthesia， loss of consciousness were reported.

At physical examination， external auditory canals and tympanic membranes were bilaterally normal， Romberg's and Unterberger’s tests showed a slightly right-side postural sway. Head impulse test was right-positive， a third-grade left beating spontaneous nystagmus was present， and Dix-Hallpike maneuver was negative. A neurologic examination showed no abnormalities， a CT scan of the brain was negative for acute ischemic-hemorrhagic events； blood tests were within normallimits.\n\n【29】The patient had not suffered from any audiovestibular disorder previously. Recent medical history was relevant for mild COVID-19disease one month before. The infection that was confirmed by a positive PCR nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 lasted 2 weeks and was characterized by anosmia and dysgeusia.\n\n【30】A right side VN of probable viral origin was then diagnosed. At discharge a counseling， including reassurance on benignity of symptoms， was performed， oral steroid therapy was prescribed (50\n\n【31】mg prednisolone daily for 5 days and subsequent tapering of the drug for 5 days) followed by vestibular rehabilitation exercises after therapy.\n\n【32】A follow-up appointment was set for one month after. At the second evaluation， the patient denied any rotatory vertigo. Romberg's and Unterberger's tests were normal， spontaneous and positional nystagmuses were absent. Bithermal caloric test was performed， as previously described， and the exams showed right side hyporeflexia (29% right hypofunction with 21% left side directional preponderance). Ocular motility was within normal limits， pure tone-audiometry， tympanometry DPOAE and ABR revealed normal hearing functions， dizziness handicap inventory resulted in 6/100 (no handicap).\n\n【33】Discussion\n\n【34】VN is an inflammatory inner ear disorder that involves the vestibular portion of the 84h cranial nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Current findings about etiology mainly support the role of viruses (first infection and viral reactivation) and dysregulated immunological responses. VN is usually a benign and self-limiting condition， but in some cases can lead to residual imbalance. Diagnosis is typically based on clinical history and symptoms， ear nose and throat evaluation including vestibular test， videonystagmography with caloric test， and audiometry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Application of the HINTS protocol (Head Impulse， Nystagmus， test of Skew) in the emergency room is essential to rule out a cerebellar stroke， with a sensitivity of 96.7% and a specificity of94.8%\\[131. The presence ofunidirectional nystagmus， a positive head impulse test in the opposite side than the fast phase of nystagmus and the absence of vertical eye misalignment and other neurologic symptoms can be highly diagnosed of acute peripheral vestibulopathy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In doubtful cases， a neurological evaluation - eventually including neuro-radiological images - is required in order to exclude any central causes of vertigo. In recent years， a growing interest was put in cervical and ocular Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials(cVEMPS and oVEMPS) and in the video Head Impulse Test (vHIT) as useful tools for the diagnostic work-up of VN. In particular vHIT， by analyzing the distribution of semicircular canals involvement， allows identification of selective vestibular structures alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Definition of the site of vestibular damage and distinction between upper and/or lower branch of vestibular nerve involvement may correlate with the underlying cause of acute peripheral vestibular deficit， but does not change the initial treatment. The management of VN typically includes symptomatic relief medications， such as antiemetic drugs. Corticosteroids are prescribed with the aim of reducing vestibular inflammation. Vestibular rehabilitation has the role of enhancing the mechanism of central balance compensation that usually occurs within 2 to 8 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\nThe incidence of vestibular disorders in COVID-19 patients is still unknown and varies across different studies. Data based upon an Italian multicenter study questionnaire administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> showed that 18.4% ofpatients reported equilibrium disorders after COVID-19diagnosis (dizziness in 94.1% and acute vertigo episodes in 5.9%). A recent investigation about possible residual vestibular impairment in48 recovered patients found dizziness in 8.3% of subjects， spinning vertigo in 2%， dynamic and static imbalance in 2% and 6.3%respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These symptoms were mostly transitory and there was no evidence of clinically relevant persistent vestibular damage. Preliminary meta-analysis showed a pooled prevalence of 7.2% for rotatory vertigo， but the authors reported a possible overestimation|删除段之间换行|because it was not always clear whether the included studies report a new onset vertigo or change in preexisting symptom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【36】The retrospective study by Charpiot et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> is a quantification of the numberofhospitaladmissions forAcute PeripheralVestibulopathy(APV) in 5 French Hospitals over the period February-May 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. A comparison with 2018 and 2019 showed no significant increase in admission for APV， no significant difference among hospitals located in COVID-19high-and low-risk zones and no significant increase in the severity ofthe APV cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In accordance， a retrospective review of acute cochleo-vestibular disorders after and before pandemic conducted at our department found no significant changes regarding incidence of APV.\n\n【37】Our review retrieved only 5 case reports， in which overall6different ppatients with COVID-19 related acute vestibular impairment were included. Moreover we reported clinical and instrumental findings of two cases of vestibular impairment possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Other main differential diagnoses of acute peripheral vestibulopathy have to be considered. A first episode of Meniere’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> or vestibular migraine attack18could have occurred \\[18，191. Nevertheless， the literature review we have presented may support our clinical hypothesis. According to our review， in three cases VN was present at the onset of COVID-19通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，8，9\\]</u>. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 can cause VN is unclear and speculative. Given its neurotrophic potential， a direct effect on the cochleo-vestibular nerve can be postulated， similarly to its pathogenesis in hypo/anosmia and optic neuritis. In this respect， the cellular receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2(ACE2)， that mediates the intracellular entry of SARS-CoV-2， has been found in nasal tissues in murine and human model and in Eustachian tube， middle ear and cochlear tissues in murine model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. A relationship with vasculitis or vasculopathy has also been suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Another possibility is that the physical and emotional stress that people with SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced could have played a role in the expression ofvestibular symptoms-as occurred for headache patients通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>-or could have triggered the reactivation ofpossiblelatent viruses(e.g.， HSV-1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. This latter mechanism could be hypothesized especially in patients in which VN was not present at COVID-19symptoms onset but later during the course of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，7，10\\]</u>. Our second case， as well as the cases of Vanaparthy et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， due to the temporal delay between PCR negativity and onset of vertigo， suggests the possibility of VN occurrence in the subacute phase of infection. To date， the post-COVID-19 syndrome is characterized by neurological symptoms such as headache， anxiety/depression， sleep and cognitive disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Finally， a SARS-CoV-2 neuro-invasive disease，leading to a COVID-19-related meningoencephalitis， may be implicated， as described for audiovestibular impairment in other neurotrophic viruses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The latter situation does not certainly regard our patients， as oculomotor testing was accurate and ruled out any functional change in the central vestibular pathways.\n\n【38】The data we found in literature could be underestimated because many patients may not have undergone medical evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Therefore， many diagnoses of possible COVID-19-related VNs may have been missed and only disclosed in later assessments， as occurred in our first described case. In general， a decrease in the number of vertigo/dizziness outpatients during the pandemic outbreak has been observed， due to visit cancellations and government restrictive measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Therefore， to give support to patients in diagnosis and therapy，the role oftelemedicine was enhanced and a specific guideline of virtual management of vestibular disorders was recently published\n\n【39】通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Preliminary data have shown the role and utility， during the pandemic， of telemedicine in the management of dizziness patients通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>， but further studies are necessary to better define possibilities and limits of these methods.\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】According to the present review，only a few cases ofinstrumentally diagnosed COVID-19-related VN have been reported so far. Since hearing and balance disorders are rarely reported among patients with COVID-19， it would be appropriate to routinely test for SARS-CoV-2 infection patients with diagnosed VN. Moreover，prospective studies on a large series of COVID-19 patients should try to better define the epidemiology of cochlear-vestibular involvement and elucidate the SARS-CoV-2-related prognosis on peripheral and central audiovestibular functions. Among patients that can’t be easily visited due to quarantine regimen， a telemedicine evaluation could be helpful， as performed in accordance with standards of recent guidelines. In cases with cochlear-vestibular involvement， a long-term follow-up of more than 6 months should be preferred.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Iatrogenic vascular injury to the jugular and carotid vessels and branches of the neck during surgery is usually the cause for major bleedings during the immediate postoperative period， lasting up to 3 days. Delayed bleeding is usually the result of tracheal erosion by a major artery，leading to pseudoaneurysms or fistulae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In most cases， the innominate artery is involved， resulting in Trachea-Innominate Artery Fistula(TIAF)， with mortality rates reaching 100% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In some cases， sentinel bleeding， hemoptysis， or pulsation around the cannula may precede. In the past， the only treatment options for acute and delayed bleeding were open surgery to repair， ligate or resect the damaged vessels. Once the bleeding is controlled， repair of the tracheal fistula is indicated. Reported success rates following surgical repairs are low， with high morbidity and mortality of more than 75% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In recent years， an endovascular approach is replacing the need for surgery， with higher survival rates of over 70%and fewer complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. We sought to describe our experience with endovascular treatments for immediate and delayed post-tracheostomy hemorrhage.\n\n【14】Methods\n\n【15】The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for reporting observational studies and the Case Report (CARE) guidelines were followed in the study.\n\n【16】Design and settings\n\n【17】After receiving the Institution Review Board (IRB) approval， a retrospective chart review was conducted. Three patients who were treated for acute life-threatening post-tracheostomy bleeding with endovascular stenting during 2014 to 2016 qualified.\n\n【18】Participants\n\n【19】All patients were admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) after stomal bleeding had already commenced at home and were treated in a single medical center with a multidisciplinary team of professionals from head and neck surgery， vascular surgery， and Interventional Radiology (IR) departments. Diagnostic imaging studies were performed on all patients and included CTA scans. Follow-up period was of up to one year with no evidence of recurrent bleeding in any of presented patients.\n\n【20】Interventional angiography\n\n【21】Emergent interventional angiography was performed through a 10Fr. sheath via a brachial or femoral approach. Stent grafts were used in all patients (Bard Fluency， C. R. Bard， Inc. New Jersey，USA)， with the additional use of a balloon expandable stent (Medtronic Assurant Cobalt， Medtronic Inc. Minneapolis， USA) in some. After the procedure， patients were closely monitored in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for several days before being discharged home.\n\n【22】Brief patient presentations and clinical findings\n\n【23】PatientA： A72-vear-old male with ischemic heart disease treated with a coronary bypass 5 years ago， developed acute pulmonary edema and respiratory distress due to severe aortic stenosis. He was intubated and later underwent tracheostomy. On the 40h day following surgery (POD 40)， the patient presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with an active bleeding exiting the stomal area. Immediately upon arrival to the hospital the tracheostomy cuff was inflated. The patient was rushed to CTA， followed by an urgent diagnostic angiography in the IR unit. A large right subclavian artery pseudoaneurysm was detected . Through a 10Fr. sheath right brachial artery approach， three stent grafts sized 12 mm to 13.5 mm， were placed in an overlapping manner. Next， a 10mm balloon expandable stent was placed in the subclavian artery origin， followed by remodeling with 12 mm balloon inflation. The patient was then transferred to the ICU and was discharged after a week.\n\n【24】No complications due to the angiography were seen. Six months following the procedure， the patient remained asymptomatic.\n\n【25】Patient B： A 75-year-old woman was brought to the ED following a sentinel bleeding from the tracheostomy cannula. She had been put on assisted ventilation and underwent tracheostomy 3 months prior due to a right-sided hemisphere stroke. Upon arrival to the ED， acute intractable bleeding begun. The patient was immediately transferred to the Operating Room (OR)， for laryngotracheoscopy. During the procedure the bleeding had already stopped， and the origin was not traced. She was then transferred to CTA， which demonstrated the source of the bleeding from a TIAF . The patient was rushed to the IR unit， where a 12 mm stent graft was inserted to the innominate and subclavian arteries， covering the right common carotid artery origin， through a 10Fr. sheath right brachial approach. A control of the bleeding was achieved. As the patient had already suffered from a right sided stroke， no sequela following the procedure was seen. A post procedural CTA demonstrated accurate stent position without evidence of residual bleeding. In the ICU the patient had undergone a successful cardiac resuscitation following an arrest， due to significant blood loss. The patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation 3 days after the procedure. On follow-up， 9months after the incident， she remained asymptomatic.\n\n【26】Patient C： An 80-year-old woman presented had undergone tracheostomy following prolonged intubation 8 months ago. She was admitted to the ED due to acute and significant bleeding from the stomal area. Hemostasis was achieved by inflating the tracheostomy balloon and local dressing pressure. An emergency angiography demonstrated TIAF . Through a 10Fr. sheath right femoral approach， a 13.5 mm stent graft was placed in the innominate artery， followed by 14 mm balloon inflation. Control of the bleeding was achieved. The patient was discharged from the ICU after a week. On one year follow-up the patient remained asymptomatic.\n\n【27】Discussion\n\nAnysignificantbleedingfollowinggtracheostomyy。eeither immediate or delayed is a potential life-threatening complication. Peak incidence and the risk for bleeding are found during the first6 weeks after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most of delayed postoperative bleedings are the result of TIAF and in more than 50% of cases， a sentinel bleeding occurs. Risk factors associated with an increased risk for TIAF are low tracheal ring incisions (lower than 3ring)， which lead to cannula-induced constant arterial pressure， surgical site infection and overinflated cuff that can cause pressure necrosis to the tracheal wal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Following angiography， all three patients survived the procedures， without re-interventions. No neurological sequala was|删除段之间换行|seen. Follow-up period was of up to one year with no evidence of recurrent bleeding in any of presented patients.\n\n【29】Surgery to control early and delayed postoperative bleeding in general， and specifically in cases of TIAF， is still considered the treatment of choice. Ligation or resection of the innominate artery and repair of the fistula is usually performed via a median sternotomy approach， with the use of grafts if needed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Complications following surgery include cerebral hypoperfusion that may lead to stroke， graft infection， high risks of re-bleeding and poor survival rates. Wang et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a 7% 1-year survival rate following a surgical TIAF repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Taechariyakul et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> published in a recent literature review of 260 cases， a comparison between surgical and endovascular interventions for TIAF.

World Health Organization (WHO) recommends every newborn baby to feed breast milk within 1-h of birth and feed colostrum. However， in Ethiopia， colostrum feeding is poorly practiced and culture makes a difference in the acceptability of colostrum. Thus， the study aimed to assess the knowledge， attitude， and practice of colostrum feeding among lactating women in Northeast Ethiopia，删除4:<u> 2021</u>.\n\n【2】Methods： An institution-based cross-sectional study was done in Debre Berhan town from May to June删除4:<u> 2021</u>. A systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit 308 participants. The data was cleaned， coded， and entered into Epi-Info software version 7.2.1 and exported to SPSS version 24.0 statistical software for analysis. Univariable analysis was computed and the finding was summarized using frequency tables. For continuous variables， means and standard deviations were computed.\n\n【3】Result： The overall prevalence of good knowledge， favorable attitude， and good practice ofcolostrum feeding among participants was 74%， 69.4%， and 56.2%， respectively. Believe that colostrum feeding cause's abdominal pain and diarrhea (51.2%)， and culture (30%) were the main reasons for avoidance of colostrum. About 26.9% of mothers initiate prelacteal feeding. Butter and non-human milk were the commonest prelacteal feedings.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The knowledge， attitude， and practice of colostrum feeding were very low. Health education dissemination should be given to all reproductive age groups， pregnant and postnatal mothers， and community members regarding the importance of colostrum and avoidance of prelacteal feeding. Besides， emphasis should be placed on harmful cultural practices to increase the level of practice.\n\n【5】Keywords： Knowledge； Attitude； Practice； Colostrum； Ethiopi\n\n【6】Abbreviations\n\n【7】ANC： Antenatal Care； CSA： Central Statistical Agency； EDHS： Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey； EPI： Expanded program of immunization； KAP： Knowledge， Attitude and Practice； UNICEF： United Nation Childrens Fund； WHO： World Health Organization\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】Colostrum is the first milk produced by the mammary glands of mammals immediately following the birth of the newborn and continuing through the early days of breastfeeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This is the most suitable food for the newborn and ensures the neonate's adaptation and successful transition to independent postnatal life. This special milk is thick， sticky， and yellow to orange in color 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is very rich in proteins， carbohydrates， immunoglobulins， vitamin A and sodium chloride， but contains lower amounts of lipids，fat， and potassium than normal milk. Thus， it helps to fight against various viral， bacterial， fungal， and protozoal infections. Besides， it protects against childhood and adolescent illnesses， i.e.，pneumonia， diarrhea， overweight， obesity， various cancers， asthma， allergies， and autoimmune diseases that are difficult to treat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\nEarly initiation of breastfeeding (provision of breast milks to infants immediately/within 1-h of|删除段之间换行|birth) is important for both the mother and the child and confirms that the infant receives the protective milk， the colostrum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Early initiation of breastfeeding protects the newborn from diseases， encourages bonding between the mother and her newborn， facilitates the production of regular breast milk， and helps the uterus contract， reducing the postpartum hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In addition， colostrum has a laxative effect that encourages passage of the baby’s first stool(meconium) which intern helps to clear excess bilirubin produced in large quantities at birth and helps prevent jaundice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. For most children breastfeeding makes the difference between life and death and is the infants “passport to life\". Colostrum is also considered the first vaccine for newborns. Even if it is secreted in small amounts (30ml to 100 ml per day)， the mothers need to be explained that this small amount of colostrum is adequate for the infant and must not be discouraged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【11】A secondary analysis of the WHO Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health indicated that the prevalence of Early Initiation of Breastfeeding (EIBF) ranges from 17.7% to 98.4% (average 57.6%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. According to data from 35 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS)， the timely initiation of breastfeeding in SSA is 58%， ranging from 24% in Chad to 86% in Burundi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In Ethiopia， 73% of children begin breastfeeding within 1 h after birth，92% of infants breastfed within 1 day of birth， and 8% of children receive prelacteal feeding. Amhara region is the third-lowest region in the level of early initiation of breastfeeding (66%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Malnutrition has been a cause directly or indirectly for millions of deaths annually among under-five children. Globally in 2020， over 149 million children under 5 were estimated to be stunted，45million were wasted， and 38.9 million were overweight or obese. Under nutrition accounts for about 45% of deaths among under 5years of age. They are the most vulnerable groups to ill health. These mostly occur in low-and middle-income countries particularly in Southern Asia， Asia， and Africa. However， the number of children with stunting has declined in all regions except Africa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. One of the main reasons for under nutrition is delayed breastfeeding along with colostrum avoidance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.Additionally，newborns who initiated breastfeeding 2 h to 23 h after birth had a 33% greater risk of neonatal mortality， and those who initiated after 24 h of birth had an 85%greater risk of neonatal mortality than those initiated within 1-h of birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Universal optimal breastfeeding could save more than800，000 child death per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>， and an estimated 20，000 annual deaths from breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【13】In a study of Wolaita Zone， 66% of mothers were knowledgeable and 70% had a positive attitude towards colostrum feeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Though 90% of mothers in the Tigray region knew about colostrum feeding； only 48% of them started colostrum feeding within 1-h of birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. According to a study done in Bench Maji Zone， 66.6%，69.4%， and 72.4% of mothers had good knowledge， positive attitude， and practice colostrum feeding， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In Debre Tabor， 74%of mothers gave colostrum to their index children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\nIn Harar town， 8% of mothers discourage colostrum feeding because of increased abdominal cramping (45%)， difficulty to digest(18%)， and belief it is polished (36%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Similarly in Debre Tabor，12% of mothers thought that colostrum doesn’t contain sufficient milk secretions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Further， in North-Eastern Ethiopia， 13.5% of mothers discard colostrum. The reasons for colostrum avoidance were a belief that colostrum is not good (26%)， traditional (23.5%)， and thought colostrum milk is dirty (22.4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The 2016 Ethiopian|删除段之间换行|Demographic Health Survey (EDHS) results showed that theneonatal， infant and under 5 mortality rates were 29，48， and 67 deaths per 1，000live births， respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Besides， in Ethiopia， colostrum feeding is still unsatisfactory. These major child deaths can be reduced by immediate initiation of breastfeeding and colostrum after birth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Thus， this study aimed to assess the knowledge， attitude， and practice of colostrum feeding among lactating women in North Shewa Zone， Ethiopia删除4-1:<u>，2021</u>.\n\n【15】Methods\n\n【16】Study setting， design， and population\n\n【17】An institution-based cross-sectional study was done in Debre Berhan town from May to June删除4:<u> 2021</u>. Debre Birhan is the capital city of the North Shewa Zone of Amhara Region and is located 130km Northeast of Addis Ababa on the Ethiopian highway. It is the highest town in Africa with an elevation of 2，840 m. Debre Berhan has fourteen kebeles with a total population of 1，10，500； of whom 14，966are children under five years. The town has 2 hospitals， 3 Health centers， 14 clinics， and around 20 pharmacies.\n\n【18】All lactating women presented for an Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) in the North Shewa Zone health facilities were the source population. All lactating women who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were available at the time of the data collection were the study population. Randomly selected mothers with infants less than6 months of age presented for EPI were included. Lactating mothers with known chronic illnesses (Hepatitis B/C and HIV/AIDS)， had active herpes simplex virus infection with lesions present on the breast， who delivered premature baby， and birth defects (cleft lip/palate) were excluded from the study.\n\n【19】Sample size， sampling technique， and procedure\n\n【20】The sample size was determined using Open Epi Version 3.03. The following assumptions were considered： 95% confidence level，5% margin of error， and proportion， 74.4% of practice of colostrum feeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Adding a 5% non-response rate， the final sample size equals删除4:<u> 308</u>.\n\n【21】The number of mothers with infants less than 6 months of age visiting the health facilities was obtained from the respective health institutions EPI registration book. Then systematic random sampling was applied to proportionally select mothers from all health institutions included in the study.\n\n【22】Data collection tool， quality control， andstatistical analysis\n\n【23】A striictuired and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. The questionnaire was adapted from different works ofliterature and modified according to the local context. The questionnaire was first prepared in English and then translated to the local language， Amharic， and then back to English to maintain consistency. The questionnaire was pre-tested on 5% of the samples in Deneba health center which was not selected in the study. The questionnaire was modified based on the result obtained from the pre-test. In addition， one-day training was given to the data collectors and supervisors about the obiective and methods of data collection. The supervisor and principal investigators daily checked and reviewed the data for completeness， clarity， and consistency.\n\nThe data was cleaned， coded， and entered into Epi-Info software version 7.2.1 and exported to SPSS version 24.0 statistical software for analysis. Univariable analysis was computed and the finding|删除段之间换行|was summarized using frequency tables. The means and standard deviations were estimated for continuous variables.\n\n【25】Measurement\n\n【26】Knowledge： Participants who answered greater than or equals to 60% of the knowledge questions were considered to have“Good knowledge\"， whereas those who scored below 60% were considered as having \"Poor knowledge”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Attitude： Participants who responded greater than or equals to60% of the attitude questions were considered to have a “Favorable attitude\"， whereas those who scored less than 60% were considered as having“Unfavorable attitude 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1-3\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Practice： Is the overt habit of feeding colostrum/first thick and yellowish milk to the newborn within the first three days of birth without prelacteal feeding.\n\n【29】Optimal breastfeeding practice： Is the early initiation of breastfeeding within 1 h of birth， exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life， and continued breastfeeding for up to 2 years or beyond with appropriate complementary feeding beginning at 6months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Prelacteal feeding： If the newborn is given any solid or liquid foods other than breast milk during the first 3 days of birth.\n\n【31】Ethical clearance\n\n【32】Ethical clearance was obtained from Debre Berhan University， Institute of Medicine and Health Sciences. A cooperation letter was written to the selected health institutions. After explaining the objective and benefits of the study， written informed consent was obtained from voluntary participants. Confidentiality was ensured.\n\n【33】Result\n\n【34】Socio-demographic characteristics\n\n【35】A total of 290 mothers were interviewed in this study making a94.2% response rate. The mean age of participants was 29+5.45 years. Half of the respondents (52%) belonged to the age group of 20 to 34years. About 77.2% of mothers are housewives， and 91.7% of them are married. Regarding monthly income， 41.4% of mothers earn less than2000 Birr per month .\n\n【36】Utilization of maternal health service\n\n【37】About 45.9% of mothers had only one child. More than half(53.8%) of women had Antenatal Care (ANC) follow-up， however， only 7% of them had postnatal care visits. Around 61% of women were counseled about early breastfeeding during antenatal care follow-ups .\n\n【38】Knowledge of colostrum feeding\n\n【39】More than half (54.5%) of mothers have heard about colostrum feeding. Health provider (51%) was the main source of information about colostrum feeding. Around 53.8% of mothers know that colostrum is the best nutrition for the newborn . The overall prevalence of good knowledge of colostrum feeding among participants was 74%， 95% CI (68.3-79.4).\n\n【40】Attitude towards colostrum feeding\n\n【41】About 38.3% of mothers believe that colostrum causes diarrhea， and 41.7% think that colostrum breast milk is dirty and looks like pus. Besides， more than half of mothers (57.2%) agree that colostrum is important for growth and mental development .

About 73.8%of mothers in the Bench Maji Zone also had good knowledge of colostrum feeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However， this was higher than the findings from Wolaita Zone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> which found that 66.1% of participants|删除段之间换行|were knowledgeable on colostrum feeding. This might be due to the differences in socioeconomic， culture， and study period. In the current study， 55% of mothers are urban residents compared to 48%in Wolaita Zone. This might increase access to information from various sources (mass media and campaigns). Further， the higher knowledge may be the result of health information dissemination and awareness creation done by the health extension workers in the study area.\n\n【56】On the otherhand， the result was lower than the study conducted in Mekelle city which showed that 89.7% of mothers had good knowledge about colostrum feeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The variation maybe because of the differences in socio-cultural， geographical， and utilization of maternal health care services. In the current study， 53.8% of mothers had Antenatal Care (ANC) follow-up compared to 83% in Mekelle，60.9% have been counseled about colostrum during ANC follow-up compared to 86.7%， and 59.7% of mothers delivered in health institutions compared to 81.5% in Mekelle. The utilization of health services increases access to health education and promotion.\n\n【57】This study found that 69.4%， CI (64-74.5) of mothers had a favorable attitude towards colostrum feeding. This is similar to the studies done in Bench Maji Zone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， Mekelle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>， and Wolaita Zone通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> which reported that 69.7%， 67.2%， and 69.9% of mothers had a positive attitude about colostrum feeding， respectively. However，this result was lower than 89% in Harar town 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This discrepancy might be due to differences in the study setting， socio-cultural deference， and a better understanding of colostrum feeding among the study participants living in Harar city.\n\n【58】This study also assessed the practice of colostrum feeding by mothers and the finding showed that colostrum feeding is practiced by 56.2%， CI (51.9-60.3). WHO recommends every newborn baby to feed breast milk within 1 h of birth and feed colostrum. This was comparableto the study done in Mizan Tepi Teaching Hospital(60.8%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A study from Debre Tabor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> showed that colostrum feeding is practiced by 74.4% of mothers which is higher than the current study. Similarly， it is lower than 72% in Pakistan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> and 80.5% in Mekelle通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The variation may account for sociodemographic differences and cultural beliefs. Debre Berhan communities are more bigoted for culture and religion. In addition， it may be due to variation in information access and utilization of maternal health care services including place of delivery.\n\n【59】According to this study， 43.8% of mothers avoid colostrum. About51.2% of mothers believe that colostrum causes abdominal pain and diarrhea and 29.9% of them believe that it is culturally forbidden. A study in Pakistan reflected a similar finding where 28% of mothers feel that colostrum is not milk， having harmful effects on child health and may cause diarrhea. Mothers prefer to feed water， honey， or herbal preparation in place of the colostrum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Similarly， in Mizan Tepi， 60.5% of mothers believe that colostrum harms both the mother and her newborns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A cross-sectional study in Bure identified the reasons for colostrum avoidance and found colostrum causes neonatal illness (2.3%)， is culturally forbidden (4%) and is very thick(2.7%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.

It presents with an unpredictable， chronic， and recurrent course， affecting 0.2% to 1% of the adult population between30 and 60 years. It is more common among females in a ratio of two women to one man， with no racial predisposition. Sporadic in character， rare are the reports of familial cases， which are of earlier onset and have a recurrent course. The disease can affect all skin types， with a predilection for the oral and genital mucosae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>.\n\n【9】The skin， appendages and mucosae play a role in protecting against aggression from external agents， such as invasion by microorganisms， exposure to allergens， and also mechanical protection against trauma， in order to ensure the integrity of the organism and its homeostasis. For this reason， the cutaneous-mucous epithelium acts like the first line of physical and immunological defense， which constitutes an essential part of the immune system. Biological processes affecting the skin's barrier function and interfering with its differentiation and repair process can lead to the development of LP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The disease starts off with cellular damage to the keratinocytes in the basal layer， secondary to autoimmune stimulation. This reaction is mediated by T lymphocytes that normally do not respond to the skin. However， when they are stimulated by exogenous agents that bind to the lymphocyte receptor by a mechanism of molecular mimicry， an aggression reaction to keratinocytes is triggered， which leads to their apoptosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\nIts clinical forms can be divided into linear， hypertrophic， atrophic， and annular. It presents with an acute course and a predilection for the flexor surface of the wrists. A typical lesion is characterized by a purple-colored papule having a polygonal contour and flat surface surmounted|删除段之间换行|by thin， off-white lines， conferring on the lesion a lace-like pattern， also known as Wickham’s striae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Its clinical manifestation varies and is determined by the affected topography， epidermis' respective peculiarities， time of progression， which interferes in the thickness and color of the lesion， and by the severity of the condition， i.e. a more severe condition may progress with erosions and blisters， depending on how aggressively the basal layer has been affected. The condition may be associated with the Koebner phenomenon， as represented by the appearance of lesions following local trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Mucosal involvement is present in 45% of males and 53% of females， with the genital region being especially affected in males通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. LP lesions can adopt different clinical presentations according to the time of progression， location， and severity. The clinical forms of mucosal LP are classified into reticular， annular， erosive， bullous， and atrophic types， and may be the only manifestation of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The oral mucosa is the most affected site， followed by the genital track. However， LP can affect any mucous site， such as the eyes， tympanum，esophagus， and trachea. The symptoms vary， with pruritus being the most common symptom，reported in cases of一either asymptomatic or painful lesions， or with a burning sensation. Genital Lichen Planus (GLP) is found in 25% of the male population with LP， and its morbidity is due to the possibility of it progressing with stenosis， genital synechia， and even carcinoma，in addition to the psychological impact of a sexual nature resulting from this chronic and recurrent genital dermatosis， whose diagnosis is often made late， thereby causing great anxiety in the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7\\]</u>.\n\n【12】LP has been observed in association with other comorbidities， especially those involving immune disorders. The correlation between LP and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is well described， especially when erosive oral lesions are present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8，9\\]</u>. The relationship between this dermatosis and the presence of the Hepatitis B Virus(HBV)， active hepatitis A， and vaccination for hepatitis B has also been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. There are reports on the relationship between the disease and ulcerative colitis， alopecia areata， dermatomyositis， morphea， lichen sclerosus， lupus erythematosus， pemphigus， and hematological neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， corroborating the hypothesis of autoimmune etiology. Medicines， ingestion of quinine in tonic water， and alergy to the metals used in dental restorations lead to clinically indistinguishable lesions of LP， which is characterized by lichenoid eruptions， the topography， histopathology， and progression of which have particular features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The diagnosis is based on clinical and histological aspects. Classic cases can be diagnosed clinically， yet an anatomopathological study is often necessary. The histological findings that are representative of LP involve keratinocyte damage (keratinocyte damage apoptosis at the dermoepidermal junction， which leads to hydropic degeneration of the basal layer with subsequent pigmentary incontinence) and lymphocytic infiltrate (superficial perivascular， and/or with a band-like arrangement， called lichenoid infiltrate)， giving rise to typical changes in the epidermis and the dermoepidermal junction， such as orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis，hypergranulosis (which represents the clinical finding of striations)， and acanthosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【14】We propose an iconographic presentation describing the clinical and histological characteristics of patients with GLP treated at a tertiary hospital in the city of Sao Paulo/Brazil， in order to assist urologists and dermatologists to improve the diagnosis ofskin lesions.\n\n【15】Methodology\n\nThis is a retrospective study with male patients who received|删除段之间换行|treatment at a dermatology clinic of a tertiary hospital in the city of Sao Paulo， Brazil， between January 2009 and December删除4:<u> 2019</u>. All patients having a clinical and histopathological diagnosis of genital lichen planus were included.\n\n【17】The following aspects were analyzed in these patients： Age and comorbidities， presence of extragenital involvement of the skin and/or mucosa， time of progression， location， clinical form， and lace-like pattern (Wickham's striae， or the lack thereof) of the genitallesion.\n\n【18】The findings were included on a Microsoft Excel  spreadsheet in order to compare the clinical and histological data with each other.\n\n【19】Results\n\n【20】Seven patients were included， with a median age of 30.5 years and a mean age of 39.42±16.53 years. The lesion's median time of progression was six months， and the lesion's mean time ofprogression was 27.71±48.72 months. Four patients (57%) presented with some comorbidity， and the locations on the genital were： Glans penis (57%)， prepuce (28%)， balanopreputial sulcus (42%)， penis shaft (71%)， and penis base (14%)， with only one patient having a lesion in only one single anatomical site of his genital. All patients had a lace-like pattern corresponding to Wickham's striae， and the clinical forms present on the genital were： Annular (71%)， hypertrophic (14%)， and erosive (14%). Two patients (14%)had concomitant extragenital involvement of the skin and one patient， of the oral mucosa. Patients clinical aspects are illustrated in Figure 1， and their clinical data are shown in Table删除4:<u> 1</u>.\n\n【21】In regard to histological aspects， all patients presented with keratinocyte apoptosis at the dermoepidermal junction (100%)， with six cases (85%) having been observed in isolation and， in one patient (14%)， in a confluent manner. In all cases (100%) hydropic degeneration of the basal layer， acanthosis， hypergranulosis， and orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis were present. Lichenoid superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and pigmentary incontinence were also observed in all patients (100%). Band-like lymphocytic infiltrate was found in six cases (71%) in varying degrees； and in two cases (14%)， only an outline of this finding was observed； whereas in three cases (42%) this finding was observed in a more robust manner. Histological aspects are shown in Table 2 and Figure 2 illustrates the findings described.\n\n【22】In relation to laboratory tests， HIV， hepatitis C， hepatitis B， Anti-Nucleus Factor (ANA) serologies and a non-treponemal test for screening syphilis (VDRL) were conducted. Three patients (42%)had undergone complete laboratory screening， two (28%) had incomplete laboratorytests； and another two (28%)had undergone no laboratory screening tests. Three patients (42%)， who were coincidentally those having all laboratory test results， tested negative for all aspects surveyed. One patient (14%) tested negative for HIV， hepatitis and VDRL， but his other parameters had not been tested. One patient(14%) had hepatitis C and syphilis， coincidentally， with no other tests having been performed. Patients'laboratory results are shown in Table删除4:<u> 3</u>.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Genital lesions are a common complaint in a physician's office， and most doctors and patients tend to instinctively associate those with sexually transmitted infections. However， most complaints are actually due to inflammatory diseases such as balanitis， eczema，\n\n【25】Table 1：Description of the clinical aspects of seven cases of genital lichen planus.\n\n|  | Patient's Characteristics  |  |  | ExtragenitalInvolvement  |  | Genital Involvement  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Case  | Age(years)  | Time of progression(months)  | Comorbidities  | Cutaneous  | Mucosa  | Location  | Clinical Form  | Striations  |\n| A  | 30  | 2  | Peripheral venous insufficiency.Occasionaluse of dipyrone  | Disseminated throughout the  | Jugal mucosa(erosive form)  | Glans penis， prepuce  | Annular  | Present  |\n| A  | 30  | 2  | Peripheral venous insufficiency.Occasionaluse of dipyrone  | body.

In a study conducted in the United Kingdom with 226 patients receiving treatment over a three-year period， only ten received a clinical diagnosis (i.e. without a biopsy) of genital lichen planus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In another study also carried out in the United Kingdom with 600 patients， in turn， 7.3% were diagnosed with genital lichen planus， of which only 11 were confirmed with a biopsy通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Such data put into perspective the findings demonstrated herein， in which the seven cases were clinically diagnosed and confirmed by means of a histopathological examination.\n\nPatients with cutaneous lichen planus present with genital involvement in 1.5% to 3% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. On the other hand， GLP patients concomitantlyhave extra-genital manifestations of the disease on the skin in about 20% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Of the cases herein presented，|删除段之间换行|onlytwo patients had extra-genital skin lesions， a proportion that was similar to that described in the literature. Concomitant genital lesions and in the oral mucosa are rare and found in only 1.36% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> of those seven patients， only one had his oral mucosa affected.\n\nThe most common clinical presentation of GLP is annular and preferably on the glans penis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Of the cases shown here， five are annular； one is erosive， and one is hypertrophic. Of the annular cases， four involved the glans penis and one affected the shaft of the penis； other clinical presentations， in turn， affect the shaft of the penis. This shows the importance of epithelium involvement for the clinical expression of the disease， since the glans is composed of a semi-mucosa of non-keratinized， stratified flat epithelium and the shaft of the penis， in turn， is composed of keratinized， stratified|删除段之间换行|flat epithelium skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Elakis and Hall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> in 2017 analyzed the presence of genital dermatosis and the circumcision status and noted that the incidence of changes is significantly higher in uncircumcised patients： Among the 386 patients studied， 16 had GLP， 67% of who were patients with an intact foreskin. The presence of foreskin promotes the formation of an intertriginous region between the inner prepuce， the balanopreputial sulcus and the glans penis， which favors inflammatory processes in this region due to the accumulation of substances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. This situation favors a disorder of epithelial differentiation， already proven to be related to genital lichen planus in previous molecular studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. All cases presented in this study are of uncircumcised patients， a common situation in Brazil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\nLichen planus canbe diagnosed clinically in classic cases，although biopsy is useful for confirming the diagnosis and is necessary in less typical presentations. Histology shows a characteristic“sawtooth”acanthosis pattern in epidermal hyperplasia，hyperparakeratosis with thickening of the granular cell layer and vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis， with intense infiltration (mainly T cells) in the dermal-epidermal junction that can cause in apoptosis of some keratinocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. All the cases studied had the elements described. In case No. 2 in particular， whose clinical presentation was erosive|删除段之间换行|genital lichen planus， the biopsy was not performed on the ulcerated region， but rather on the perilesional skin， where intact epidermis and the clinically characteristic violet lace-like were found. Thus， the histological findings were compatible with the classic description， since the epidermis was represented in the sample sent to the laboratory. It is worth mentioning that performing the biopsy on the lace-like pattern (Wickham’s striae) is important in order to make any sign of hypergranulosis more evident in the histopathological exam 5|.\n\nIn regard to the patients’ laboratory test results， only three patients underwent a thorough investigation， i.e. had their HIV， Hepatitis B and C， ANF serologies investigated tested for syphilis by means of a non-treponemal test. Of the five patients whose Hepatitis C serology was investigated， only one tested positive. Such laboratory investigation is carried out in lichen planus cases， since there are studies demonstrating a significant causal relationship between Hepatitis C virus and lichen planus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In a study conducted with66 patients with lichen planus who had their Hepatitis C serology investigated， 7.5% tested positive vs. 0.69% of 44，947 blood donors from the same institution， which demonstrate a clear and statistically higher prevalence of infection in patients with lichen planus when|删除段之间换行|compared to blood donors at the same hospital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is worth mentioning that the clinical erosive form of the mucosa is the one that is most related to positivity for hepatitis C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， a situation that was confirmed in the cases presented herein， since the only positive serology for the hepatitis C virus was the very case involving genital erosive clinical presentation.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】The clinical aspects of dermatosis of the penis encompass multiple medical specialties.

With almost half of North American population having allergies to one or more common environmental antigens， it is imperative for us to look at the most upstream level involved in this reaction pathway. Though allergic reactions are rarely life-threatening it is a common issue in today's society that had led to much distress and loss of time.\n\n【11】To truly understand the mechanisms of an allergic reaction， we will try to analyze the earliest beginning of a reaction by looking at the impact of genetics and the cytokines involved in allergic reaction. While the most classical and common pathway involving IL-4 has been studied， we will be looking at a newer， less explored pathway involving IL-33 which has been very significant in allergic reactions and can be used as a future target for therapy.\n\n【12】IL-33 and ST-2\n\n【13】There are a group of damage-associated molecules released by tissue epithelial cells in response to external stimuli. These molecules are known as “alarmins.” One of the main alarmins being studied has been Interleukin-33 (IL-33). Originating from the IL-1 family of cytokines， IL-33 has been recently observed to be expressed in many allergy responsive cells such as epidermal， smooth muscle and epithelial cells. As we analyze allergies and the human response， it is important to appreciate this on an upstream level to comprehend all the signaling pathways and use this to evolve our knowledge base to create better treatments in the future 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【14】IL-33 plays a vital part in allergic response through various pathways and one of the initial stages involve binding to a membrane-bound receptor called Suppression of Tumorigenecity 2 (ST-2 receptor) and an (IL 1-R co-receptor) IL-1Receptor accessory protein via a heterodimeric receptor complex. This leads to activation of the primary signal MyD88 cascade pathway via homotypic protein-protein reactions. Other pathways involved include an increase in IL-5 cytokines that are IL-4 independent producing T-cells. Th2 cells， in general， respond via two pathways： the classic pathway involves IL-4， STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription proteins) and GATA3 (DNA sequence“GATA\"binding transcription factors) cascades while the non-classical pathway induces IL-5 production. This is polarized by IL-33 via the ST2 receptor and leads to a stronger allergic response.\n\n【15】The IL-5 cytokine also increases production of NF-kB (nuclear factor KB)， MAPKs (Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases) and OVA (Egg protein ovalbumin) that increase inflammation and activation of tissue-resident cells with ST-2. The IL-33/ST2 complex also increases TH2-inducing cytokines like Th17 that leads to cell-mediated airway inflammation via Mast Cells (MC).\n\n【16】The MyD88 pathway\n\nThe MyD88 signal cascade involves the MyD88 adaptor protein to increase production of several other proteins and cytokines including IRA K4 (Interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4)， TRAF6 (transcription factor 6)， IL-13 and IL-6. Increased IL-5 and induce goblet cell hyperplasia in respiratory epithelial cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This in turn leads to heavier mucus production in respiratory epithelial cells and a stronger allergic response. These responses were highlighted by when they found administration of IL-33 failed to induce IL-5 and IL-13 secretion by MyD88 -/-T cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. They also found that IL-33 induces NF-kB p65 and the MAPK p38， JNK %(c-Jun N-terminal|删除段之间换行|kinases) and ERK Y (extracellular signal-regulated kinases). Though IL-33 was reported to be integral to mast cells and allergic responses， the role of ST2 has been controversial for Ag-specific asthma. They concluded in that the IL-33/ST2 signaling is more involved in acute allergic response than chronic allergies.\n\n【18】The processing and release of IL-33\n\n【19】As part of the IL-1 family， IL-33 does not possess signal peptide to release the proteins via endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi pathway. Hence， via external stimuli like allergens or injury， IL-33 is released by epithelial， endothelial， smooth cells and fibroblasts. The involvement of IL-33 in the development of allergic rhinitis induced by ragweed pollen challenge as IL-33 knock-out mice failed to induce ragweed pollen induced allergic reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. They found that Type2 Innate Lymphoid Cells (ILC2) localized in mucosal tissues like lung and intestine， adipose tissue and lymphoid organs like spleen and lymphoid tissue were major targets of IL-33 due to their high expression of ST-2 receptors. Thesecells also produced high quantities of type 2 cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 which was previously discussed as part of the signal cascade involving IL-33/ST2/MyD88. The various functions played by IL-33 have resulted in theorizing IL-33 to be both a cytokine and an intracellular nuclear factor with transcriptional regulatory functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【20】The Novel Alarmin\n\n【21】IL-33 is considered a “novel alarmin\"due to its secretion upon necrosis or damage and released upon responseto antigen. It is notably increased in expression in asthmatic patients vs. normal patients. It has been reported to induce airway bronchoconstriction through mast cell activation in murine models and found IL-33 protein in the lungs of mice with OVA/alum-induced airway inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This is due to the increased expression of tryptophan hydroxylase I by IL-33 that leads to serotonin synthesis and storage causing airway obstruction in asthma. It is also noted to be higher in patients with atopic dermatitis founded in epidermal keratinocytes. The high number of ILC2s in epidermal skin cells and lymph nodes release IL-5 leading to eosinophilic dermatitis. These are some of the many ways IL-33 is involved in various allergic reactions.\n\n【22】Future uses and novel therapy targeting IL-33\n\nTo create an effective future treatment， we have to appreciate the basic genetic component of IL-33 and understand the target region. IL-33 consists of an N-terminal helix-turned helix motif responsible for nuclear translocation and chromatin binding. It also has an IL-1like C-terminal domain， which is cleaved by a caspase to form a|删除段之间换行|mature 18kDa peptide from the original 30 kDa peptide. The deletion of the N-terminal domain containing the chromatin-binding motif has led to early lethality in mice by constitutive secretion of IL-33 in serum leading to multi-organ failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【24】One of the endogenous mechanisms that was studied was the recently reported IL-22 cytokine that originated from the IL-10， expressing REG3y from lung epithelial cells in mice that suppress IL-33 expression and accumulation of ILC2s in the lung. Another idea is to sequester ILL-33 in the nucleus of IL-33 producing cells. The parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus releases a product named H. Polygyrus Alarmin Release Inhibitor (HpARI) that binds to IL-33via the N-terminus and tethers active IL-33 within necrotic cells \\[61. Other approaches involve controlling the bioactivity of IL-33 as it can be rapidly inactivated by oxidation of four critical cysteine residues that result in extensive reconfiguration of the ST2 receptors.\n\n【25】All these novel therapy approaches require further testing and clinical trials but the fact remains that IL-33 is a key factor in allergic responses. Targeting the IL-33/ST2 pathway will be a critical component in the future treatment of allergic reactions and the more extensive our knowledge grows on the vital IL-33 genetic and secondary pathways， the better future therapy will be to treat and prevent patients with allergic reactions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of a large pleomorphic adenoma in the upper lip in a 42-year-old man with a 6-month evolution， which due to its size could be mistaken for a malignant lesion. Biopsy is essential to close the diagnosis in these cases and to exclude the hypothesis of a malignant lesion； the treatment was performed with surgical excision.\n\n【2】Keywords： Pleomorphic adenoma； Salivary gland tumor； Benign neoplasm\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign mixed tumor of the salivary glands. May occur in both major and minor salivary glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2\\]</u>. This tumor usually presents as a solitary， painless， slow-growing nodular mass， with prevalence in females and with a higher occurrence between the third and sixth decade of life. Histologically， the lesion may present variable epithelial， myoepithelial and mesenchymal elements， usually presenting a well-circumscribed capsule. Epithelial cells can form ducts， islands， or cords of cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Differential diagnoses include mucoepidermoid carcinoma， salivary gland tumors， mucocele， neurofibroma， schwannoma and secondary infections. Treatment consists of surgical excision of the lesion with a safety margin. Incomplete removal cases can cause recurrences. Post-surgical follow-up is essential to assess the possibility of malignant transformation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Male patient， 42 years old， sailor， was referred to our department for presenting a painless swelling in the upper lip region. The patient reported evolution of the lesion of six months. During the anamnesis， the patient had a good general condition and reported being hypertensive controlled by medication. In the intra-oral clinical examination， the patient presented a large， solitary， painless， hardened， normocolored， pedunculated， smooth-surfaced tumor lesion in the region of the upper left labial mucosa， with an evolution of six months . Patient had a urine test result， performed six days before our appointment， without the presence of abnormalities.\n\n【7】Given the different diagnostic hypotheses， an excisional biopsy of the lesion was requested to clarify the diagnosis. The macroscopic material sent for analysis consisted of a soft tissue fragment， with a smooth surface， irregular shape， firm consistency， brown in color， measuring 20 mm x10 mm ×10 mm . Histological sections revealed a fragment of glandular neoplasia. Neoplastic cells form ducts with two or seven layers of cells containing hyaline material in their interior. In some fields， neoplastic cells displayed eccentric plasmacytoid-like nuclei. In other fields， the presence of deposition of hyaline material and myxoid material was observed. The neoplasm was delimited by dense fibrous connective tissue and showed， in some fields， neoplastic cells with a polyhedral shape that， sometimes，presented eccentric nuclei with a plasmacytoid shape. Completing the histopathological picture， a discrete mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate， extravasation of red blood cells and ectatic blood vessels of varying sizes were present in the specimen . The final diagnosis was compatible with pleomorphic adenoma.\n\n【8】The treatment was performed by surgical excision of the lesion and was uneventful . Antibiotic， anti-inflammatory， and analgesic were prescribed to control postoperative symptoms. The patient had a satisfactory recovery and within the expected parameters.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Salivary gland tumors are complex lesions that are differentiated by the clinical-histological pattern. These lesions are rare and represent about 3% to 10% of all head and neck neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Most represent benign tumors， about 75% to 85%； females are the gender most affected by these tumors， the parotid gland represents the most affected location， it can occur in any age group， however， the highest reports occur between the third and sixth decade of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7-9\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The AP represents the most common neoplasm of the salivary gland. Most of these tumors arise in the parotid gland. Intraorally， the most common sites are the palate， upper lip and buccal mucosa， areas that have many minor salivary glands. The name of this lesion refers to its varied histology， composed of epithelial， myoepithelial andmesenchymal structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，2，9\\]</u>. Clinically， the lesion is usually present as a unilateral， asymptomatic， slow-growing， well-circumscribed and most often encapsulated tumor， the overlying mucosa most often does not present ulceration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1，8\\]</u>.\n\nMinor salivary gland tumors are uncommon and among them the pleomorphic adenoma is the most frequent. In a study of 82 cases of tumors in minor salivary glands carried out by Toida et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， pleomorphic adenoma was the most common tumor intraorally， with the palate being the most common site (44 cases) and females the most affected， with a male/female ratio of 1：3.2通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma in the lip represents about 20% to 40% of|删除段之间换行|all intraoral pleomorphic adenomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the study by Toida et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， of the 54 cases of intraoral pleomorphic adenoma， only 3 were in the upper lip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The upper lip is more affected than the lower lip in a ratio of 6：1， the exact cause of this discrepancy is not known， but it is believed that it is due to differences in the embryonic development of the upper and lower lips， another theory is that the cells tumors would be destroyed by the continuous presence of inflammatory cells in the lower lip induced by frequent traumatic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11-13\\]</u>. Adenomas that occur on the lips appear to occur at a younger age than those that occur elsewhere， with a peak incidence between the third and fourth decade of life， with a mean of 33.2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. According to a bibliographic survey of 38 cases of AP in the lip performed by Suka，2021，the upper lip was the most affected， with a predominance of the left side， males (21 cases) were more affected than females (17 cases)， the mean age was 43.3 years and the mean diameter of the tumors was2.6 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This information corroborates our case， as it is a 42-year old male patient with a lesion in the upper lip on the left side.\n\n【13】Due to its nonspecific clinical features， the differential diagnosis of AP in the upper lip includes a wide variety of pathologies： benign and malignant neoplasms of the salivary glands， sialolithiasis， leiomyoma， hemangioma， neurofibroma， schwannoma or infection with a foreign body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，6\\]</u>. The diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma is made by histopathological analysis： It usually presents as a proliferation of encapsulated epithelial and myoepithelial cells with the presence of stroma， which can be myxoid， chondroid or hyalinized. The epithelium may form ducts and cystic structures or may appear as islands or nests of cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>. Imaging tests， such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography， can aid in the diagnosis， as they allow a better visualization of the location and size of the lesion， in addition to being useful for differentiating between a benign or malignant lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，12\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The treatment of choice for AP in the lip is tumor excision with a safety margin， but some authors suggest performing aspiration biopsy before definitive removal of the tumor，the prognosis is good. Recurrence cases may be associated with incomplete tumor excision or capsule rupture. Malignant transformation presents about 2% to7% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，14\\]</u>. Some authors report that the occurrence of AP in the upper lip is more related to benign tumors， while the lower lip is more related to malignant lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，11，15\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Finally， AP should be investigated and considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of painless tumor masses of the lips. Due to its non-specific clinical characteristics， diagnosis may be difficult， and for this， biopsy is indispensable，imaging tests can also be useful. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for this lesion and periodic follow-up should be performed to reduce the chances of recurrence and malignant transformation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

An improved level of awareness as well as understanding of refeeding syndrome， with effectively managed strategy is important for nutritional rehabilitation of the individual. In this scenario， a gradual and deliberate surge in nutritional intake with proper nutritional counseling， and psychotherapy are recommended by the experts. Our case study took a young 22 year-old girl suffering from anorexia with a BMI of 11.9. She had been misdiagnosed by the medical practitioner and got a severe electrolyte imbalance in blood levels. This occurred only because of the lack of cognizance regarding refeeding syndrome. After the cautious clinical and nutritional assessment， empirical and scientific evaluation， different protocols can be suggested to prevent and manage this syndrome. Equally important is to instill awareness in the patient about refeeding slowly and building-up micronutrient gradually for several days in nutritional therapy.\n\n【2】Keywords： Refeedingsyndrome； Malnourishment； Anorexia nervosa； Nutritional rehabilitation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Refeeding Syndrome (RS) is possibly a serious condition， that is defined by severe fluid and electrolyte imbalances cause by damaging nutritional rehabilitation in patients who are conditioned to malnourishment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

She developed refeeding syndrome due an aggressive nutrition intake and was managed in a hospital with “Total Parenteral Nutrition\"(TPN).\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】The 22-year-old girl living in Lahore hadbeen admitted in the emergency care unit on September删除4-1:<u>，2021</u>. She had a 2 days history of severe abdominal cramps， nausea and continuous vomiting. She endured the condition of secondary amenorrhea， and chronic constipation for two and half years before admission to the hospital. Notwithstanding， she had a psychiatric history of having anorexia nervosa， which is the fear of growing overweight and was on strict dieting schedule. The patient was asked to consume a large serving of meat just a day before her admission to hospital. She instantly developed afore-mentioned symptoms after eating the meal. Over the course fourteen weeks she lost eighteen kg of her weight. Upon examination，her weight was only twenty seven kilo grams and was 152 cm tall. As her Body Mass Index (BMI) stood at 11.9 which is extremely low. In addition to this her physical appearance was pale and weak. Her resting pulse rate was rapid (110 beats/minute)， with a low blood pressure measuring just 90/40 mm/Hg.

However， the abdominal examination of the patient showed recessed abdomen with a moderate tenderness in her right iliac fossa and the visceral organs were not palpable. The laboratory tests ofthe girl revealed low albumin， hypophosphatemia， hypochloremic metabolic acidosis， hypokalemia. Her liver function tests showed a disturbed liver function . She had turn to several gynecologists during the last 2 years to consult secondary amenorrhea. She was recommended some medicines to regulate her|删除段之间换行|monthly cycles， but her prolactin levels elevated later on. She was pre-occupied with the feelings of being overweight， despite the fact that her weight was only 42 kg with BMI of 18.6. The fear lead her to stop taking her medicines and she started dieting and vigor exercise. Afterwards she was taken for a psychiatrist consultation and there she was diagnosed with the condition ofanorexia nervosa and was advised to take anti-depressants. In her case， no family psychiatric history was found and there was no major childhood illness. She was again presented to hospital 3 days later with stark phosphatemia， abdominal distension， feet swelling. There she was diagnosed with refeeding syndrome as her reports were claiming severe electrolyte imbalances. Then she was recommended for nutritional consultation was given TPN 1 (for precise intake). Later on her schedule was changed to TPN2 as she was unable tolerate the oral intake. She had been prescribed a1，500 kcal/day diet plan and antiemetics before meals to stop nausea and vomit. She was also tied up into psychotherapy and motivational therapy. There was steady improvement in her condition and she was gradually substituted to a total oral consumption. In her 5th week of therapy， she added 6 kg in her total weight. She was discharged from hospital with a prescription of esomeprazole， some antidepressants and other vitamin supplements.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\nA forceful nutrient intake of carbs can evoke a release of insulin and increase levels of glucose，phosphate， magnesium etc in the blood. The severe electrolyte imbalances can end in severe complications including sudden death of the patients. Here， the natriuretic effect of insulin can cause sodium retention and edema.

Genotyping is an essential tool to predict the outcome of better treatment and control of this infection. 50 samples from patients with HCV infection within the ages from 20 to65 years were collected. HCV Ab ELISA kit was used for the detection of virus in the samples which tested 43 patients HCV RNA positive. Maximum viral load detected in patients was 9.4×10IU/mL and the minimum quantity of viral load was 1.2×105 IU/mL. The major mode of transmission of virus which caused hepatitis in patients included unsafe blood transfusion， use of unsterile needles and dental instrument. In our study 37 patients were detected with 3a genotype， 2 with 1a genotype and genotype of 4 patients was untypable. Further analysis of these patients’ genotype by Real-Time PCR revealed that they were also infected by 3a genotype. Overall assessment showed that genotype 3a is the most prevalent genotype affecting 95% patients followed by 1a. Only males were infected by genotype 1a due to travelling to neighbor countries. Comparative analysis on genotyping methodologies suggests that Real-Time PCR has advantage over traditional PCR. Conventional PCR is less effective method because of its poor resolution，less sensitivity and risk of contamination. It is time consuming process and yield results at the end point of reaction. In contrast， Real-Time PCR has enhanced rapidity， reproducibility， sensitivity and the reduced risk of contamination. In addition， it can resolve 95% of HCV genotypes and can provide data at exponential growth phase of the reaction.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hepatitis C virus； HCV-RNA； Genotyping； Real-Time PCR\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Viral hepatitis is one of leading killers across the globe since删除4:<u> 1989</u>. Hepatitis C virus is a blood borne virus and mainly affects the function ofliver causingacute or chronicliver diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients developing cirrhosis have high risk of HCC (1% to 4% per year) prompting liver transplantation. HCV is considered second most common cause of viral hepatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. On the basis of Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences， multiple genotypes and subtypes of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) have been recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Common subtypes that cause disease are la， 1b， 2a，2b，3a，3b，4，5a，6a.\n\n【5】WHO reported that globally 3.3% people are HCV infected and causes 700，000 deaths annually? The prevalence of HCV varies by region. HCV prevalence is lower (<2%) in regions of Western Europe， the Americas and Australia. Areas of African and the eastern Mediterranean have highest percentage of HCV prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Country with the highest prevalence of HCV in the world is Egypt， having more than 14% infected people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>. Estimates show that prevalence in Asia is about2% but it differs greatly between individual countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. As Mongolia shows the highest HCV prevalence which is above 10%， Uzbekistan and Pakistan are next having 6% of total population infected with HCV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Data on the HCV prevalence in Pakistan shows that it is highly endemic， infecting almost 6.8% population of the country. Most common HCV genotype is 3a which continues to infect almost 61.3% people in Pakistan. However， recently the frequency of subtype2a has increased in few areas of Pakistan. Subtype 2a was most common in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa infecting 17.3% population and in Sindh provinces infecting 11.3% of the total population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\nIncredible advancement has been made over the previous years in explaining the structure and function of the Hepatitis C Infection (HCV) proteins， a large portion of which are currently effectively being sought after as antiviral targets. Discovered in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>， HCV is a small enveloped virus with approximately 10 kb long plus-sense， single stranded RNA genome. It belongs to the Hepacivirus genera of Flaviviridae family 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Hepatitis C contains one long Open Reading Frame(ORF) which encodes for a non-functional polyprotein of approximately 3，000 to 3，010 amino|删除段之间换行|acids. This non-functional polyprotein is cleaved by signal peptidase， cellular and viral encoded proteases to yield at least 10 different viral protein products. Structural proteins which forms the viral particle， are encoded in the 5'N-terminal part of ORF and include C，E1，E2and P7， whereas the non-structural proteins are encoded in the 3part of the ORF in the order NS2， NS3，NS4A， NS4B， NS5A， NS5B通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. HCV enters the cells through endocytosis after binding to particular receptors. The viral genome is translated into a precursor polyprotein subsequent to uncoating， and viral RNA is incorporated by a virus encoded polymerase complex. Newly synthesized viral particles are discharged into endoplasmic reticulum and are secreted from cell passing through Golgi apparatus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Epidemiological studies revealed that the spread of HCV in Pakistan is through different modes of transmission which include blood transfusion， sexual activity， and intravenous drug abuse， unsafe use of needles， non-sterile dental instruments and hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13-16\\]</u>. HCV also spreads through non-sexual household contacts， ear piercing， tattoos， and use of community barber shops 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17-19\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Medical and public health literature in detail on the prevalence of HCV in Pakistan has been reviewed by scientists for long period. In order to decrease burden of HCV in Pakistan awareness programs are required targeting rural areas. Different genotypes of HCV have specific drug sensitivity according to which the therapy is recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【8】There is currently no licensed vaccine for HCV， which is a worldwide health issue， recently infecting 3 to 4 million people annually. In present HCV vaccine approaches include peptide， plasmid DNA， recombinant proteins and vector-based vaccines. HCV treatment is based on pegylated-Interferon-a (IFNa) and the nucleoside analogue ribavirin， which is expensive， toxic， prolonged(24 to 48 weeks) and leads to a Sustained Virological Response (SVR) in only 50% to 60% of patients， depending on the infecting genotype通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【9】The aim ofour study was to evaluate and comparetheperformance features of two currently available HCV RNA quantification procedures including Real-time PCR based assays and conventional PCR based assays. Real-Time PCR methods are sensitive with lower limits of detection/quantification on the order of 10 to 15 HCV RNA International Units (IU)/ml， and are not prone to carryover contamination. It is done to identify the genotypes circulating in Pakistan and to determine the suitability of the HCV genomic region for routine determination of HCV genotypes. The Abbott Real-time HCV assay was used to evaluate the genotype and then it was compared to the conventional PCR method. The intrinsic and clinical performances of the recently developed Abbott m2000 real-time PCR system for HCV RNA quantification， which uses the automated Extractor m2000sp and the m2000rtdevice for automated real-time PCR amplification and detection of PCR products is examined.\n\n【10】Materialand Methods\n\n【11】Serological diagnosis\n\n【12】In order to diagnose HCV infection， plan antiviral treatment programs and evaluate virological response to antiviral therapy， serological and virological tests play a key role. Serological diagnosis of HCV infection is based on two categories of laboratory tests， namely serologic assays detecting specific antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) (indirect tests) and， molecular assays that can detect， quantify， or characterize the components of HCV viral particles， such as HCV\n\n【13】RNA and determine HCV genotype (direct tests) prior to sample collection diagnosis of patients was done. ELISA was performed to test positive antibodies to HCV.HCV-RNA detection in plasma was carried out by Qualitative RT-PCR (Abbott m2000rt) with lower limit of detection of 50 IU/ml\n\n【14】Sample collection\n\n【15】In the present study 3cc blood was collected from 50 patients with detectable HCV RNA using disposable syringes. Blood samples were properly labeled with patient’s name and Lab ID number for convenient analysis. Blood was transferred into EDTA coated vacutainer. In our study 43 patients out of 50 were tested positive for HCV， on which further diagnosis was performed.\n\n【16】Plasma separation\n\n【17】Samples were left at room temperature before centrifugation. The sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and 750 ml of plasma was collected. Plasma was carefully stored at -80°C to avoid contamination until further use.\n\nRNA extraction by Abbott m2000sp： The automated steps of the extraction system include sample and reagent pipetting， heating and incubation， magnetic capture and washing， and elution， all of which are optimized in ready-to-use protocols|删除段之间换行|1\\. Sample is prepared for the extraction and concentration of RNA molecules to help amplification of target region and removal of potential inhibitors from the sample.\n\n【19】2\\. The Abbott m2000sp instrument prepares samples for the Abbott Real-time HCV assay using the Abbott mSample Preparation System reagents.\n\n3\\. The Abbott m2000sp uses magnetic particle technology to attach nucleic acids and particles are washed to remove unbound components from the sample|删除段之间换行|4\\. The bound nucleic acids are eluted and transferred to a 96deep-well plate. The nucleic acids are then prepared for amplification.\n\n【21】5\\. The IC (Internal Control) is placed through the complete sample preparation procedure along with the calibrators， controls， and specimens.\n\n【22】Amplification master mix：\n\n【23】1\\. The Abbott m2000sp instrument automatically assembles the amplification master mix (HCV Oligonucleotide Reagent， Thermostable rTth Polymerase Enzyme， and Activation Reagent) and then transfers aliquots of the master mix to the Abbott 96-Well Optical Reaction Plate.\n\n【24】2\\. Nucleic acid samples are then transferred into the Abbott96-Well Optical Reaction Plate by the Abbott m2000sp from the Abbott 96 Deep-Well Plate.\n\n【25】3\\. The plate is fixed by the user with an Abbott Optical Adhesive Cover and set into the Abbott m2000rt instrument for PCR amplification and fluorescence detection.\n\n【26】Amplification：\n\n【27】1\\. During the amplification reaction on the Abbott m2000rt， the target RNA is transformed to cDNA by the activity of reverse transcriptase of the thermostable rTth DNA polymerase.\n\n2 HCV and IC reverse primers anneal to their particular|删除段之间换行|targets and are extended during a prolonged incubation period.\n\n【29】3\\. After incubation， the temperature of the reaction is raised above meltingpoint of double stranded cDNAleading to denaturation step： RNA product， a second primer anneals to the cDNA strand and is extended by the DNA polymerase activity of the rTth enzyme to create a double-strandedDNA product.\n\n【30】4\\. During each round of thermal cycling， amplification products dissociate to single strands at high temperature allowing primer annealing and extension as the temperature is lowered.\n\n【31】5\\. Exponential amplification of the product is achieved through continual cycling between high and low temperatures， resulting in a billion-fold or greater amplification oftarget sequences.\n\n【32】6\\. Amplification of both targets (HCV and IC) takes place simultaneously in the same reaction.\n\n【33】Quantitation：\n\n【34】1\\. Quantitation of HCV RNA concentration of samples and controls requires a calibration curve.\n\n【35】2\\. Two assay calibrators are run in replicates of three to generate a calibration curve. The calibration curve slope and intercept are calculated from the assigned HCV RNA concentration and the median observed threshold cycle for each calibrator and are stored on the instrument.\n\n【36】3\\. The concentration of HCV RNA in specimens and controls is calculated from the stored calibration curve， and the results are automatically reported on the Abbott m2000rt workstation.\n\n【37】4\\. The Abbott Real-time HCV Negative Control， Low Positive Control， and High Positive Control must be included in each run to verify run validity. The Abbott m2000rt verifies that the controls are within the assigned ranges.\n\n【38】Determination of HCV viral load\n\n【39】HCV viral load was determined by using Abbott Real-time HCV genotype II amplification reagent on real time PCR instrument Abbott m2000sp.\n\nGenotyping： Primer based genotyping by core region of HCV|删除段之间换行|cDNA synthesis：\n\n【41】PCR water： 2 uL\n\n【42】5x RT buffer： 4 uL\n\n【43】dNTPs 10mM： 1 uL\n\n【44】RT enzyme： 1 uL\n\n【45】Antisense Primer： 1 uL\n\n【46】RNase inhibitor： 1 pI\n\n【47】Total： 10 uL10 uL RNA+10 uL cDNA Master Mix= 20 uL\n\n【48】The extracted 10 uL RNA was added with 10 uL of cDNA Master Mix containing 4 uL of 5x RT buffer， 2 uL PCR water， 1 uL antisense primer， 1 uL dNTPs， 1 uL RNase inhibitor and 1 uL RT enzyme in eppendorf tubes and placed in Thermal Cycler.\n\n【49】Synthesis conditions are 42°C and 60 min.\n\nThe synthesized cDNA was stored at 4C for short term storage or|删除段之间换行|\\-20°C for long term storage.\n\n【51】Regular PCR： A 50 uL of Regular Master Mix containing 25uL Dream Taq Master Mix， 1 uM Forward primer， 1 uM Reverse primer， 50 uL nuclease free water and 10 uL cDNA templates was prepared.

In age group 25to 35 years， 23.25% patients had genotype 3a while in age group >55years， 20.93% patients had genotype 3a.

Shift in|删除段之间换行|percentages from lower to higher in these areas as compared to conventional PCR results is due to detection of untypable genotype with genotype 3a by Real-time PCR.\n\n【109】HCV viral load\n\n【110】Patients were categorized according to viral load into six groups ranging from删除4:<u> 100000-100000000</u>. Maximum viral load detected in patients was 9.4×10'IU/mL and the minimum quantity of viral load was 1.2 ×10 IU/mL. Analysis of our data showed that greater number of patients were in the category of viral load ranging from>10000000 IU/mL to 50000000 IU/mL .\n\n【111】Comparison of conventional PCR and real-time PCR\n\n【112】Through statistical analysis it was observed that genotypes of patients that were identified as Untypable (9.3%) by conventional PCR were detected with genotype 3a by Real-time PCR. Percentage of genotype 3a patients (86%) detected through conventional PCR shifts to 95% when detected through Real-time PCR .\n\n【113】Discussion\n\n【114】Hepatitis C virus is one ofthe leading causes of death and disabil ity worldwide and also getting endemic in many parts of Pakistan because very limited data on the genotyping of HCV has restricted the treatment of patients. In this study， we compared conventional PCR and Real-Time PCR genotyping methodologies of HCV to evaluate their efficiency to diagnose genotype of HCV patients.\n\n【115】In our study percentage of HCV genotype 3 was observed higher(95.3%) than genotype 1a (5%). It is proven in other studies done by通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>， which claimed that 3a genotype is the major genotype in Pakistan followed by la genotype. Also in our study genotype 1a was second major genotype.\n\nThe predominance of genotype 3a in Pakistan is a good hope as it requires short duration of treatment and control of hepatitis C than genotype 1a 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The occurrence of HCV 3 genotype in our population confirmedthe occurrence ofHCV genotype in neighboring countries including China， Iran， Afghanistan and India. In the west， Baluchistan shares a long border with Iran where genotype la and3a are most prevalent. It is reported that there is the high prevalence of genotype 3a and 1b in China 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. So， it is quite possible that other genotypes and subtypes can be transferred from surrounding countries to Pakistan. In our study， only males were infected by HCV genotype 1a while all females were infected by genotype 3a. High percentage of genotype la in males is due to traveling in neighboring countries in search of jobs， trade and developing career opportunities通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Shifts in HCV genotype distribution needs to be noticed as it|删除段之间换行|is an alarming signal to take major steps to reduce infections caused by other genotypes because genotype la and 4a are responsible for severe cirrhosis.\n\n【117】We compared the results of conventional PCR with Real-time PCR results. Those patients whose genotype was untypable were detected with 3a by Real-time PCR. This proved that Real-time PCR is accurate method that can detect each genotype infecting a patient.Real-time PCR in contrast to conventional PCR is rapid and reproducible method for the assessment of Hepatitis C virus load and genotype in serum samples. Quantitative PCR method such as regular or conventional PCR detects viral load and measures amplification product at the final phase of the reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Similar study suggests that at the exponential phase ofPCR the quantity of product is directly proportional to the initial number of template copies. As the reaction reaches plateau phase this correlation is lost. In contrast to regular PCR， Real Time PCR allows the detection and accurate knowledge of amplification product in every cycle of the reaction. Measuring kinetics at exponential phase allows the samples to be analyzed before reaction approaches the plateau phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【118】In regular PCR， the end point varies from sample to sample and gel is insensitive to detect these variabilities， while Real-Time PCR is sensitiveenough to detect them. Moreover，conventionalPCR method is sophisticated， labor intensive and results are obtained within many days， also gel resolution is poor about ten folds. Whereas，Real-Time PCR is a speedy process and results can be obtained within hours and it can detect as little as two-fold change 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【119】Conclusion and Future Recommendations\n\n【120】Our study reveals the clinical significance of genotyping of HCV patients and the accurate methods for the assessment of viral load. It is hoped that this study will help clinicians to find precise viral load in HCV positive patients and manage a better treatment plan based on correct and reliable genotyping of patients. In this we have observed that 95% of patients are infected with genotype 3a and only5% patients were infected with genotype 1a. This data shows that genotype 3a is common in Pakistan's population which can be timely treated. Furthermore， it is clear from these results that Real-Time PCR was more accurate and reliable method for HCV genotyping and measuring the amplified product.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Its quick identification in its typical presentation， the elimination of the most severe alternative diagnosis and its management must be known in order to be adapted to the athlete's sporting objectives. Atypical forms with slow recovery are rare and represent a real diagnostic challenge. We report the case of a professional rugby player who presented an atypical Stinger injury and detail its management. This original case is an opportunityto provide a comprehensive review of the different forms and presentations of these traumatic plexopathies and their management.\n\n【2】Keywords： Plexus brachial； Sport traua； Stinger；COVID-19\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Two main types of brachial plexus injuries are traditionally described： Obstetric brachial plexus paralysis and adult stretch injuries. Both are serious and require specialized care. A third case exists：The traumatic plexopathy of the brachial plexus， better known as Stinger injury or Burner injury. It is little known to the orthopedic surgeon， yet it is a very frequent and common injury in high-level contact athletes. Owen Farrell， England rugby halfback， said when he refused to come out on suspicion of a knockout during a match at the 2021 Six Nations Tournament： \"It’s just a stinger； it has nothing to do with me.\"\n\n【5】The classic injury mechanism is a direct impact on the shoulder involving the upper limb on one side and the head on the opposite side. This corresponds to the classic move made by a tackler in rugby. This result in compression and stretching of the brachial plexus， which in some cases can lead to a transient plexopathy of the brachial plexus called a stinger injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Stinger in French \"dard\"refers to the symptomatology of the injury. The Stinger injury is described as an electric discharge running through the upper limb. The symptoms are generally resolved in 1 min to 2 min. They are characterized by an immediate sensation of burns and electric discharges going through the entire upper limb associated with an important weakness， even with a total paralysis of the upperlimb. In some cases， weakness of the upper limb persists over time， especially in the muscles innervated by the proximal roots (C5 and C6)； these symptoms may persist for several days or weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The 2020/2021 COVID-19 epidemics highlight a certain neurotropism of this type of coronavirus. This tropism can be manifested by mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Beside the known attacks of the central nervous system and their symptoms such as anosmia or ageusia， a tropism of this virus for the nervous elements composing the brachial plexus has been highlighted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，5\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present the case of a professional rugby player with a long recovery traumatic plexopathy in an athlete who was infected with the COVID-19 virus.\n\n【9】We then propose， based on the literature data， an update on the Stinger lesion in high-level athletes.\n\n【10】We present the case ofa professional rugby player of the \"Stade Francais”evolving as secondline in the French professional league. On November 29h， 2020 in a match following a tackle on the right shoulder ， he presented a Stinger injury characterized by a transient paralysis\n\n【11】Video 1： On November 29， 2020 in a match following a tackle on the right shoulder.\n\n【12】of the entire right upper limb associated with significant paresthesias. Within minutes of the accident， an almost complete regression of symptoms was noticed. Unlike the usual evolution of the Stinger injury， the patient presented persistent discomfort during training and weakness of the right upper limb motivating a consultation3 months after the trauma. During our clinical examination， we observed： Hypoesthesia of the shoulder stump， pain and muscle weakness major on the external rotators of the right shoulder， we also noted an irritative syndrome (pseudo-Tinel sign of the supra-clavicular region)， the overall being compatible with incomplete C5， C6 involvement.\n\nStandard X-ray of the cervical spine， dynamic bilateral positional Doppler ultrasound，electroneuromyogram of both upper limbs and MRI ofthe right brachialplexus were performed in order to document the lesions and to eliminate a differential diagnosis (Parsonage Turner syndrome and thoracic-brachial outlet syndrome). The|删除段之间换行|paraclinical evaluation was normal except for the brachial plexus MRI showing diffuse hyperfixation of the right brachial plexus. The diagnosis slow recovery Stinger lesion is therefore retained. The treatment consisted of rehabilitation in order to open the cervico-thoraco-brachial clamp associated with the prescription of low-dose pregabalin to treat the irritative syndrome. At 6 months after the trauma， the patient was seen in consultation. He presented a total regression of symptoms with， in particular， a strength in external rotation at 5/5 (symmetrical isometric test) as well as a normal sensitivity of the shoulder stump. However， there is still a mild supraclavicular irritation syndrome. The return to competitive sport was performed at 6 months with a “pad\" on the right shoulder as protective gear.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Focus on the Stinger injury in high-level athletes\n\n【16】Kawasaki et al.通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> have shown that 33.9% of professional rugby players experience at least one Stinger injury in a season， with a recurrence rate of 37.0% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Nevertheless， as these lesions are well known and commonplace among contact athletes， their incidence is probably underestimated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The mechanism involved in most cases combines downward traction of the upper limb and forced lateral flexion of the head on the side opposite the injury. This mechanism leads to a stretching of the brachial plexus associated in certain cases with a foraminal compression of the nerve roots of the brachialplexus. These traumatic stretch injuries of the brachial plexus are classified according to the Seddon Sunderland classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. They are in the majority of cases type 1 (Neurapraxia) and rarely of type 2 (Axonotmesis). Type3 lesions (Neurotmesis) are not part of the Stingerlesions and belongs to the well-known management of tear out lesions of the brachial plexus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\nGrade 1 lesions lead to a demyelination process without axonal|删除段之间换行|damage. In grade 2 lesions， the axons and myelin sheath are affected leading to a process of Wallerian degeneration， but the Schwann cells as well as the perinerve and epinerve remain intact. As previously mentioned， the Stinger injury corresponds to an immediate sensation of burning and electrical discharges running through the entire upper limb associated with significant weakness or even total paralysis of the upper limb. In some cases， weakness persists in the upper limb， more marked in the muscles innervated by the proximal roots (C5and C6)， but it can also affect any of the muscles of the upper limb； these symptoms can persist for several weeks or even months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Clinical examination and management\n\n【20】The context， the description of the symptoms， the spontaneous resolving character in less than two minutes and the experience of the lesions by the athlete easily allows to make the diagnosis of Stinger injury. In case of atypical symptoms (bilateral damage， damage to the lower limbs) or in case of doubt， it is needed to consider the trauma as a cervical spine damage (immediate immobilization with a cervical collar and exit on a stretcher) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The acute clinical examination should initially focus on eliminating differential diagnoses， such as cervical spine trauma or a shoulder girdle injury. Secondly， a complete motor and sensory examination of the upper limb concerned must be carried out， paying particular attention to the muscles innervated by the C6 and C7 roots， which are the most frequently affected.\n\n【21】As a matter of course， even in the typical injury cases， a complete clinical examination must be repeated after the game and regularly during the first two weeks. Indeed， a normal clinical examination in the acute phase does not prevent the occurrence of symptoms in the hours or days following the trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In case oftypicallesions，there is no indication to carry out further investigations. On the other hand， if the symptoms persist， the clinical examination must be repeated. It will try to asses' pain in the cervical spine， a sensory or motor deficit in the upper limb， the presence of a supra or infra clavicular pseudo Tinel's sign， an asymmetry of the radial pulse or a muscular atrophy especially in the shoulder (Deltoid， supra and infraspinous fossa) in order to eliminate a differential diagnosis.\n\n【22】After careful palpation of the cervical spine， a Spruling test is performed. If there is associated neck pain， the diagnosis can be guide to a cervical radicular damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The Spruling test consists of applying compression，rotation and homo-lateral tilt to the lesion. The maneuver is positive when it triggers radicular symptoms in the upper limb. Patients with Stinger injury have no neck pain and a negative Spruling test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The value of complementary investigation in Stinger injury is controversial. In cases of typical lesions with quick resolving symptoms， no further investigation is indicated.On the other hand， in case of persistent or recurrent symptoms or in case of doubt， imaging and electro-neuro-myograms can help to document the lesion and eliminate differential diagnoses.\n\n【24】Standard and dynamic cervical X-rays， as well as cervical MRI， are used to identify a spine facture， as well as cervical roots damage. Literature data seem to highlight anatomical predispositions of the cervical spine to the occurrence of Stinger injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Indeed， a higher incidence of foraminal or cervical canal stenosis has been found in athletes with repetitive Stinger injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【25】In case of persistent symptoms， we perform a dynamic arterial and venous positional Doppler ultrasound in order to rule out a cervicothoracic outlet syndrome.\n\n【26】The ENMG performed after 6 weeks in case of \"long stinger\"allows on the one hand to eliminate a pre-ganglionic damage of the brachial plexus and on the other hand to specify， if any， the level of the damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Brachial plexus MRI is also only performed in cases of \"long Stinger\" and if all other investigations are normal. Hypersignal of the involved roots is currently found in stretch lesions of the brachial plexus删除4-1:<u>14</u>.\n\n【28】Management and return to sport\n\n【29】The management of these injuries is mainly based on physical rest， pain management and rehabilitation.\n\n【30】Feinberg et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> propose an algorithm of management and return to sport according to the type of injury following the Sunderland classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Grade 1 lesions (Neurapraxia) are divided into three categories related to the severity of the symptoms. The lesion known as \"mild grade 1\" is defined by an immediate regression of the symptoms. In this context the sports activity can be continued immediately. In the case of \"moderate grade 1\" injuries， the symptoms persist during the sporting activity and end after the match， while in the case of \"severe grade 1\"injuries， the symptoms persist for over 24 h. In moderate or severe injury， the sport activity must be stopped， the clinical exam must be repeated regularly and the paraclinicals investigations in order to eliminate a trauma of the cervical rachis must be carried out. The return to sport can be considered as soon as the symptoms disappear.\n\n【32】For Sunderland's grade 2 lesions， sports activity must be stopped immediately for 15 days minimum. The clinical exam must be repeated.\n\n【33】Paraclinical investigation are performed for cervical spine trauma， an EMG should be performed if symptoms persist for more than 15days. The return to sport can be considered as soon as the symptoms regress and paraclinicals investigations are normal.\n\n【34】In order to reduce the incidence of spine and nerve injuries， sports federations have progressively changed the rules of high-risk sports by being more and more restrictive and by sanctioning risky behaviors more severely. For example， at rugby，head-on tackles， high tackles and tackles above the waist are now prohibited in France and in most international competitions.\n\n【35】Regardingequipment， although their benefits are not scientifically validated， wearing \"pads\" on the shoulders in order to absorb shocks and the use of medical devices limiting hyperextension such as the“Cowboy-Collar\" for American soccer players are becoming more and more common删除4:<u> 16</u>.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】The damage to the nervous system due to the neurotropism of COVID-19， although still unknown， seems to be more and more described and documented， the most common disorders are anosmia and agueusia. In addition to these， mononeuropathy or multifocal peripheral neuropathy have been described. Plexus lesions in patients with severe covid-19 infection were initiallyanalyzed as \"resuscitation neuropathies\"and consequences of prone sessions. The existence of a few cases of the upper limb deficits in patients who have not had any prone sessions has suggested the existence of a COVID-19 tropism for the nervous elements of the brachial plexus.\n\n【38】In our case the athlete had a positive COVID-19 PCR test on9/11/2020，during a systematicscreening of an official competition.He had no symptoms and was able to return to training and competition as soon as the regulatory isolation was over.\n\n【39】The occurrence of a stinger lesion in a professional athlete who played rugby intensively andhad neverpresented this symptomatology， brought us to search an additional subjacent lesion. The MRI showed diffuse damage to the roots of the brachial plexus.\n\n【40】We are unable to state that the lesion developed by the player is related to his contamination by COVID-19. But this leads us to wonder： \"Did a neurotropism of the COVID-19 virus in the brachial plexus facilitate the occurrence of a Stinger lesion and slow down his recuperation?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Therefore， assessing the burden of hypertension and possible risk factors in the community is a good opportunity to update the epidemiological data on hypertension in the South Gondar Zone rural community.\n\n【2】Methods： A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the 674-adult population. A multistage systematic sampling technique was employed to select study participants. Data were entered into Epi-Data Manager software version 4.6.0.0， and then exported to STATA MP 16 software for statistical analysis. A multivariable logistic regression model was conducted to identify factors associated with hypertension and presented by an Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with95% CI. The model's fitness was checked using Hosmer-Lemeshow significance testing at P values 0.05.\n\n【3】Results： Overall， the prevalence of hypertension among adults was 16.1%(95% CI， 13.5-19.26). In multivariable logistic regression analysis， older age (AOR=1.03， 95% CI， 1.01-1.05)， female gender(AOR=1.91， 95% CI， 1.15-3.19)， divorced or widowed marital status (AOR=3.2， 95% CI， 1.17-8.8)， and physically inactive individuals (AOR=4.02， 95% CI， 2.10-7.70) were statistically significant associated factors with hypertension.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The overall prevalence of hypertension was high in the study community. Older age， female sex， and not engaging in vigorous-intensity physical exercise were found to be significant factors associated with the risk of hypertension. Therefore， it is crucial to establish community education programs about hypertension， and its screening， in the study community.\n\n【5】Keywords： Hypertension； Adults； Community； Ethiopia\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Blood pressure is the force that moves blood through our circulatory system. It is an important force because oxygen and nutrients would not be pushed around our circulatory system to nourish tissues and organs without it 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>. Since 2017， the American Heart Association (AHA) has advised that people with high blood pressure should receive treatment at 130/80 mmHg rather than 140/90mmHg. The current category now forms two separate ranges： Elevated blood pressure， from 120129/less than 80 mmHg， stage Ihypertension， from 130-139/80-89 mmHg. In these new guidelines， the AHA also advises that doctors should only prescribe medication in cases of a previous heart attack or stroke， or the presence of risk factors for these conditions， such as age， a diabetes mellitus diagnosis， or chronic kidney disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Globally 1.13 billion people are estimated to have hypertension， two-third of them are living in low- and middle-income countries. Hypertension or high blood pressure is defined as a systolic and or diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg. The burden of hypertension varies across regions and countries. Nowadays the highest prevalence of hypertension occurs in low-and middle-income countries due to a rise in hypertension risk factors in those populations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nHypertension is a serious medical illness that knowingly increases the risk of heart， brain，|删除段之间换行|and kidney disease which is responsible for 54% of stroke and 47%of coronary heart disease globally. Besides hypertension is one of the major causes of premature death and the silent killer which is accountable for 7.6 million deaths per annum in the world 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【10】One of the global targets for non-communicable diseases is to reduce the prevalence of hypertension. However， the awareness and practice on prevention and control of hypertension are low in developing countries including Ethiopia. In low-income countries， there is a double burden of non-communicable and infectious diseases. The health care resources are priory invested in infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS， tuberculosis， and malaria. Due to these issues， prevention and control of hypertension didn’t get attention\\[31.\n\n【11】Environmental and personal lifestyle factors such as excessive alcoholconsumpottiioonn。 excessivedietarysalt intake， stress， sedentariness， and obesity may play a significant role in the increment of incidence of hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4-6\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Different organizations support low-and middle-income countries including Ethiopia to reduce hypertension as a public health problem and to improve cardiovascular health through launchingthe global HEARTS (Healthy-lifestylecounseling， evidence-based treatment protocols， access to essential medicines and technology， risk-based management， team-based care， and systems for monitoring) initiative since 2016 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，7，8\\]</u>. Besides to reduce the burden ofhypertension-related death require the parallel application of the population strategy at the community level and the clinical strategy focusing on new and improved treatments for people with hypertension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，8，9\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Therefore， assessing the burden ofhypertension and possible risk factorsinthecommunityissignificant forevidence-basedinterventions and it is a good opportunity to update the epidemiological data of hypertension in the South Gondar zone rural community. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of hypertension and associated factors in the rural community of the south Gondar zone.\n\n【14】Methods and Materials Study setting and period\n\n【15】A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the adult population living in towns of the South Gondar zone from March to June删除4:<u> 2021</u>. South Gondar zone is one of the zones in Amhara Regional state which is located 137 km from a regional town， Bahir Dar， and 701 km from Addis Ababa， the capital city of Ethiopia. According to population growth projection， the current total population of the zone is about删除4:<u> 2，578，906</u>.\n\n【16】Population\n\n【17】The source population was all adult persons living in South Gondar zone towns and the study population was all selected adult individuals who live in South Gondar zone towns during the study period.All adult persons whose age is ≥30 years and who lived at least6 months in the towns were included in the study. Those who were severely ill to the extent unable to communicate，known hypertensive patients (self-report)， pregnant women， and disabled individuals(difficult to measure blood pressure) were excluded from the study.\n\n【18】Sample size and sampling procedure\n\n【19】The minimum sample size required for the study was calculated using single proportion population formula as follows：\n\n【20】Were\n\n【21】n = sample size， Z=Confidence Interval (CI) at 95% which is1.96 (where a=0.05)， d = margin of error tolerated which is 5%， P= the highest prevalence of hypertension in the previous studies in Ethiopian adult population which was 28.3%通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Based on the above formula and assumptions the sample size was calculated to be 674 by considering design effects of 2.\n\n【22】A multistage systematic sampling technique was used to select study participants. At the first stage， four representative kebeles were selected by lottery method， and then the sample was proportionally allocated to the selected kebeles. In the second stage， a systematic random sampling method was used to select study households. The first household was selected by lottery method.\n\n【23】Data collection procedure\n\n【24】The data were collected using an interviewer-administered striictured questionnaireeandphysical measiirement. The questionnaire was adapted from the WHO STEPS instrument 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>， to collect socio-demographic profiles， behavioral related factors， and clinical data of eligible participants. To keep its consistency first， the questionnaire was prepared in English and translated to Amharic local language then back-translated to English. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured by a standard adult arm cuff mercury sphygmomanometer after 5-min rest in a sitting position. Two readings were taken in five-minute intervals and the average of the two was recorded as a final blood pressure of the participant.\n\n【25】Study variables\n\n【26】Dependent variable： Hypertension \\[Yes/No\\].\n\n【27】Independent variables： Age， sex， educational status， marital status， occupation，resident， income， family history of hypertension， alcohol consumption， cigarette smoking， Khat chewing， and physical activity， fruit consumption， vegetable use， and use of excessive salt.\n\n【28】Operational definitions\n\n【29】Hypertension： Systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg.\n\n【30】Regular physical exercise： Participants who purposively perform anykind of exercise for over 30 min at least 3 times per week.\n\n【31】Data processing and analysis\n\n【32】Data were checked for completeness and entered into Epi-data software version 3.1 then exported to STATA for statistical analysis. All variables were cleaned by running simple frequencies to avoid missing values and checked for normality and fulfillment of assumptions. Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation for continuous variables； and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables) were computed. Bivariate logistic regression was used to explore the relation between hypertension and each independent variable. P-value ≤ 0.25 cutoff points were considered to select potential candidates for the full model. Finally， a multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with hypertension and presented by Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) with95% of CI. The model fitness was checked using Hosmer-Lemeshow at significance test at P values <0.05.\n\n【33】Data quality management\n\n【34】To ensure data quality， training， and adequate orientation were\n\n【35】Table 1： Sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants in the south Gondar zone，删除4:<u> 2021</u>.\n\n| Variables  | Categories  | Frequency(n)  | Percentage (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sex  | Male  | 275  | 40.8  |\n| Sex  | Female  | 399  | 59.2  |\n| Age in years  | Below the mean \\[43.5\\]  | 381  | 56.5  |\n| Age in years  | Greater/equal mean \\[43.5\\]  | 293  | 43.5  |\n| Marital status  | Single/separated  | 88  | 13.1  |\n| Marital status  | Married/cohabitec  | 505  | 74.9  |\n| Marital status  | Divorced/widowed  | 81  | 12.0  |\n| Educational status  | No education  | 259  | 38.4  |\n| Educational status  | Primary  | 220  | 32.6  |\n| Educational status  | Secondary  | 103  | 15.3  |\n| Educational status  | College and above  | 92  | 13.7  |\n| Occupational status  | Government employ  | 67  | 9.9  |\n| Occupational status  | Non-Government employ  | 121  | 18.0  |\n| Occupational status  | Merchant  | 114  | 16.9  |\n| Occupational status  | Farmer  | 207  | 30.7  |\n| Occupational status  | Daily labor  | 165  | 24.5  |\n| The total individual in the household  | Less than five  | 410  | 60.8  |\n| The total individual in the household  | Five to twelve  | 264  | 39.2  |\n| Total  |  | 674  | 100  |\n\n【37】given for all data collectors and supervisors.

The variation might be due to the difference in the study population， sample size， and study setting. Since the study population might have differences in lifestyle in different settings. It might be also due to the age variation of the study population in the study sites. However， the finding is in line with evidence from a systematic review and meta-analysis which showed the overall prevalence of hypertension in the general population ranges from 9.3% to 30.3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>， and a study conducted in Southwestern Ethiopia (17.7%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【63】After controlling the effect of potential confounding factors in the multivariablelogistic regression analysis， the variables old age， female gender， widowed/divorced marital status， and inactive physical exercise were significantly associated factors with hypertension.

This finding is in line with a study conducted at Northwest Ethiopia， Mekele， and in Southwest Ethiopia in which older patients were more likely to develop hypertension than the younger age group通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，17\\]</u>. This might be due to the narrowing of blood vessels as age increases.\n\n【64】In our study females were more likely to have hypertension than males.

This difference might be explained by the variation in the age ofthe study population and sample size.\n\n【66】Another important variable which found to have a significant association with hypertension was marital status (widowed/divorced). The odd of developing hypertension among widowed/divorced was 3.2 times higher than singles. This could be explained as those divorced/widowed people may be at risk for stress and depression which problem leads to overweight or associated with increased blood pressure， consequently hypertension.\n\n【67】Our study also revealed that patients who did not do regular physical exercise (in active physical exercise) were more likely to have hypertension than their counterparts.

The reduction oflearning load through instruction is accurate because it must revalue knowledge based on meaningful experience， where the student develops attitude and skill. Where multiple analyses can be generated with respect to what is presented in the clinical case. In other words， between the teacher and the student， educational action is developed through experience translated into the assimilation of knowledge. The exercise carried out by an undergraduate student through the clinical case brings them closer to reality and prepares them to deal with problems through their competences.\n\n【18】Case Presentation\n\n【19】Male patient aged 21 years， ASA II， with no personal history of morbidities， no surgical history， with a family history of morbid hypertension. A moderate smoker， he came for assessment due to spontaneous consultation， with the reason for consultation \"I have a tooth on the side of my teeth， at the bottom\". Data collected： The last visit to the dentist was in 2019 for extraction of a supernumerary tooth without complications. The patient had poor dental hygiene， with an unspecified brushing technique， no flossing， a diet high in carbohydrates， sugars and soft drinks.\n\n【20】With regard to the dental history， we can highlight the extraction of another supernumerary tooth at tooth level 4.4 on the lingual side， bleeding on brushing and bruxism.\n\n【21】Within the segmental examination， a variation in the trajectory of mandibular movement was observed， with corrected deviation to the right and a unilateral left click noise， without pain on palpation or movement. As for lymph node palpation， only the submandibular nodes were palpable， unilateraly， on the right side， less than 1 cm， with a soft， mobile consistency and the presence of discomfort to the touch. The rest of the nodes were not palpable.\n\n【22】With regard to the dental anomaly of the patient， who presented a rudimentary paramolar supernumerary tooth； of a smaller size， molariform and located in the mandibular region， on the lingual side in the area of the premolar teeth， we can highlight the importance and responsibility we have as dentists to recognize and detect pathologies in our patients. This is one of the many examples of how elementary training is， in order to achieve correct care and good dental practice.\n\n【23】Intraoral examination\n\nLips unaltered， mucosa of the alveolar ridge， the rudimentary supernumerary tooth is located between teeth 3.4 and 3.5. The gingiva|删除段之间换行|is reddish in color， rounded margino-papillary shape， smooth， shiny and dotted surface， orange peel in some areas. It is mostly positioned on the LAC， with an enlarged， thick biotype and gingival recession from canine to lower canine .\n\n【25】Radiographic interpretation： Coronal slices every 1 mm 100um thick and axial slices every 1 mm 100 um thick at 1：1 scale are observed .\n\n【26】P.21： Erupted， rotated， in a straight position， towards vestibular， with root bifurcation of the middle third of the root towards apical. Normal periapical.\n\n【27】On the lingual side， presence of a supernumerary， rudimentary， erupted tooth under the occlusal plane. With straight root， in intimate relation with the numerary piece without generating rhizolysis， presents a single straight， conoid root.\n\n【28】P.27 and28：Erupted，P.28 slightly rotated，rootstraight，periapical normal. Immediate tooth to vestibular table. Note the presence of a rudimentary supernumerary piece on the lingual side， in intraosseous development， with apical third in formation. Normal pericoronal sac.

A case series of clinical suspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system (n=8) were analyzed. Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swab were analyzed by RT-PCR. Our results showed SARS-CoV-2 in five CSF samples and three patients testing positive for COVID-19 also on nasopharyngeal swab. The patients showed different clinical manifestations， including <95% saturation， fever， cough， dyspnea and abdominal pain. The findings of this study alert to the existence of nonspecific symptoms associated with central nervous system infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【2】Keywords： SARS-CoV-2；COVID-19； Cerebrospinal fluid； RT-PCR\n\n【3】Short Com munication\n\n【4】In December 2019， cases of severe acute respiratorysyndrome emerged and were after associated with SARS-CoV-2. Since then， reports have described neurological manifestations in addition to the typical clinical symptoms of COVID-19. This virus can spread from the respiratory system to the central nervous system， using transneuronal and hematogenous mechanisms. Although not all COVID-19 patient test positive for the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid exam， the appearance of neurological symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals the importance of understanding the neurologic manifestations and capacity for neural invasion associated with the pathogen. These aspects are relevant for correct diagnosis and treatment and for the potential development of vaccines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Hospitalized patients with COVID-19， especialy those with severe disease， can display neurological disorders as shown by Mao et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>， such as acute cerebrovascular disease in up to5.7%， impaired consciousness in 14.8%， and skeletal muscle injury in 19.3% of cases. Nonetheless， COVID-19 seems to be associated with a wide spectrum of neurological manifestations including meningoencephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3-5\\]</u>， encephalomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>， Guillain-Barre Syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>， and perfusion abnormalities in brain magnetic resonance imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This study highlights the evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on neurological involvement and laboratorial diagnosis， based in a case series.\n\n【6】We describe cases of clinical suspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the central nervous system. The patients (n=8) were admitted in a Brazilian public hospital. Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) and nasopharyngeal swab were obtained for laboratorial tests. The samples were analyzed by RT-PCR using technical protocol based on the Center of Disease Control.\n\n【7】Ours results showed SARS-CoV-2 in five CSF samples. Of the total， 3 patients also presented positive test for COVID-19 in nasopharyngeal swab. The patients showed different patterns of clinical manifestations， including <95% saturation， fever， cough， dyspnea and abdominal pain.\n\n【8】Laboratorial analysis of 3 CSF samples by RT-PCR did not demonstrate the presence of the virus. Of the 8 patients evaluated， 6 were newborns， 3 of them were children of mothers with COVID-19during the pregnancy .\n\nThis study describes cases of COVID-19 with clinical presentation and positive RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. To our knowledge， this presentation of COVID-19 is little reported so far and is important to consider as an atypical manifestation of the viral infection. Our findings reinforce data obtained by Huang et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u>通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> that RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF can be|删除段之间换行|cited.\n\n【10】Footnote： Blank columns means no symptoms or negative lab test； Black columns means presence of symptoms or positive laboratory test； ITU： Intensive Treatment Unit CSF： Cerebral spinal fluid.\n\n【11】considered as a detection modality for cases of COVID-19 affecting the central nervous system.\n\n【12】We demonstrate that patients with COVID-19 displaying distinct neurological disorders have extremely low levels of SARS-CoV-2in CSF， according high CT (cycle threshold) value of the samples， indicating that viral clearance precede the neurological involvement. It is important to emphasize that the RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2detection in CSFhas not been validated yet. Besides that， undetectable results in some CSF samples of patients could be false negative. This finding points to the need for the development of more sensitive molecular tests and the investigation of other neurotropic pathogens to exclude neuroinfection.\n\n【13】Considering the sole report of a severe case ofmeningoencephalitis with detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>， likely presenting a low viral load since just one of two RT-qPCR assays turned positive at a cycle CT of 37， we can assume that whether SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in CSF， it may depend on disease severity， the time of sample collection or the sensitivity of the molecular test used. On the other hand， herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2， varicella zoster virus， and enterovirus are responsible for the greatest number of CNS infection in immunocompetent hosts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore， CSF investigation of COVID-19 patients presenting with GBS or CNS manifestations to exclude concurrent neuroinfection with other neurotropic viruses should be encouraged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，8\\]</u>\n\nIt was not possible to perform the next generation sequencing in the positive samples， to determine the genetic variant responsible for the infection， because this methodology requires a high viral load，|删除段之间换行|consequently， a low Ct value. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance network in Brazil， during the period in which the present studysampleswere collected，the variantofconcernthatpredominated was Gamma 通用删除11(英):<u>(P.1)</u>， with an occurrence of 85% in the month of March2021， 93.8% in April and 95.5% in May. It may be reasonable to infer that the variant responsible for the CNS manifestations was Gamma by the circulation scenario at the time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Few cases of encephalitis/meningitis with positive RT-PCR assays of the CSF have been described \\[1-81. This can be attributed to several reasons： The RT-PCR assay of CSF may yield negative results when performed early； the method has limited sensitivity associated with false negative tests in CSF；and low viral load in the CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with invasion of the nervous system are being described with the emergence of the new pandemic due to the infectious disease COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19maypresent initially neurologicaallSsymptomIsSor experience neurological complications during hospitalization. The diagnosis of neuro-COVID-19 can be challenging. Since SARS-CoV-2 has neuroinvasive and neurotropic properties， early recognition can help initiate treatment and isolation early， to prevent clinical worsening and spread of the virus and the underreporting of neurological cases associated with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nRecent observations suggested possible neurological complications of COVID-19， including the first report of suspected viral encephalitis. We report a case of a 29-year-old male with on nasopharyngeal testing- confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with severe respiratory symptoms， followed by clinical and radiological|删除段之间换行|signs ofencephalitis. Magnetic resonance imaging ofthe brain showed an asymmetric FLAIR-hyperintensity of the left medial temporal cortex associated with mild gyral expansion. Lumbar puncture was normal and PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on CSF were negative. Clinicians treating SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should be aware of possible neurological complications， like encephalitis. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 encephalitis is difficult as the laboratory analysis of the CSF may not be altered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9，11\\]</u>\n\n【18】Clinicians treating SARS-CoV-2 infected patients should be aware of possible neurological complications. In case of suspected meningoencephalitis， additional exams should be performed such as brain MRI scan， long-term EEG monitoring， and lumbar puncture. However， the absence of a typical CSF profile of viral meningitis/encephalitis as well as the negative PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF， makes diagnosing encephalitis linked to SARS-CoV-2 less obvious删除4-1:<u>9，12</u>.\n\n【19】One ofthe studylimitations was the lack of follow-up of diagnosed patients. This follow-up was not possible because the diagnosis was performed as a service to the municipal health authorities，therefore， there were no personnel and financial resources available for this purpose.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】The findings of this study alert to the existence of nonspecific symptoms associated with central nervous system infection caused by SARS-CoV-2. This raises the need for laboratory examination to detect this virus in CSF samples and subsequent early and assertive treatment. Further studies are important to elucidate mechanisms of pathogenesis， protocols of clinical management， and laboratory practices of SARS-CoV-2 neurological manifestations.\n\n【22】Contributors\n\n【23】A.B.

Headache and decreased vision recurred 8 days after initial therapy. Serous retinal detachment worsened  and choroidal thickness increased 11 days after initial therapy.\n\n【15】The BCVA was 0.2 and 0.5 in the right and left eyes， respectively. Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide at 40 mg was injected in both eyes and serous retinal detachment and headache improved immediately. The BCVA improved by 0.6 in both eyes 21 days after initial therapy. Serous retinal detachment was almost resolved  and choroidal thickness improved by 484 and 421 um in the right and left eyes， respectively .\n\n【16】The therapeutic reaction was favorable， with no recurrence for 8months until the present.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\nOne of the features of VKH is recurrence. Recurrence that repeats several times will become a chronic type. The visual prognosis of chronic type is generally unfavorable. The PubMed (keywords， VKH； search years， 2000-2022) and CiNii Research (keywords， VKH； search years， 2000-2022) databases， revealed that VKH disease recurred after 8 days of initial steroid pulse therapy， which is quite short. Ishibazawa et al. reported that headache， tinnitus， and sensorineural hearing loss developed， with increased choroidal|删除段之间换行|thickness without other evidence of increased ocular inflammation after 6 months of initial steroid pulse therapy. Headache and ocular inflammation were observed in our case as recurrent symptoms. A few reports presented about the recurrence period from initial therapy， thus accumulation of cases is important.\n\n【19】Rubsamen et al. reported that VKH disease recurred in 9 (43%) of 21 patients in the first 3 months， usually in association with a rapid tapering of steroid dosage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Iwahashi et al. reported that poor initial visual acuity and rapid tapering of the corticosteroid were associated with posterior recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Our patient recurred during an oral administration of 40 mg of prednisolone after 3 days of1000 mg of methylprednisolone infusion. This change of medication may correspond to rapid tapering.\n\n【20】Hosoda et al. reported that sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection alone may have VKH recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Our patient received40 mg of sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection added with oral administration of 40 mg prednisolone. Therefore， recurrence was not observed. Our treatment was effective not only in ocular findings but also in headache resolution.\n\n【21】T cell reactivation which recognizes melanocyte antigenicity， suppressor T cell hypofunction which restrains expression of antigenicity of melanocyte，and antigenicity decoration of melanocyte by virus infection seem to be the causes of the mechanism of VKH recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Immune reactions may occur for the target of residual melanocytes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However， these assumptions are one of the speculations because the mechanism of VKH disease onset and recurrence remains unclear. Rapid elucidation is anticipated.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】VKH disease may recur in an early stage of steroid pulse therapy from the current case. We have to pay attention to recurrence at any time. Sub-Tenon triamcinolone acetonide injection added to oral administration of prednisolone is quite useful for the recurrence of VKH disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

According to the Lancet series on maternal and child undernutrition， 90% of the world’s stunted|删除段之间换行|children are found in 36 countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. UNICEF's West and Central Africa (WCA) region， which brings together 24 countries， includes 8of these 36 countries in which stunting is particularly high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In the Lancet papers， low investment in nutrition in most developing countries has been identified as a barrier to scaling up high-impact interventions in this area 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Several West and Central African countries have strategic plans for nutrition or food and nutrition security. However， very few of these plans are based on the latest science and are budgeted. Each year， nutrition officials， national-level nutrition actors， and their regional and international partners convene the Annual Economic Community of West and Central African States Nutrition Forum， under the technical direction of the West African Health Organization (WAHO). In 2010， the forum would have provided an opportunity to disseminate the latest technical information related to the theme of the forum：“Financing and planning nutrition programs in Africa”通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Every year in Africa， one million children under the age of 5 die from causes related to malnutrition. Malnutrition contributes to35% of all child deaths in the region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In 2009， the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) conducted a nutrition vulnerability analysis that looked at factors such as the prevalence of child undernutrition， access to vitamin A and salt iodized， the level of food insecurity and governance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This analysis has shown， for example， that Burkina Faso， the Central African Republic， Chad， Guinea Bissau， Niger and Sierra Leone have the highest level of nutritional vulnerability in WCA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The regional prevalence of wasting among children is 10%， indicating that the nutritional status of children is a serious concern. Moreover， these average hides significant disparities通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Wasting rates among children under 5 are alarmingly high in Sahelian countries such as Burkina Faso， Chad， Mali， Mauritania and Niger and range from 11% to 19%， affecting more than 1 million children (UNICEF，2006). As in the results promulgated by UNICEF， the UNICEF WCA region， which comprises a total of 24 countries， includes 8 of the 36 countries in which stunting is particularly high， for which an estimate of stunting is available. funding needs， and11 of 32 smaller countries with rates of stunting and/or wasting in children >20%， which could be added to previous estimates at an additional cost of 6% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\nWith regard to accessibility to RUTF (plumpy'nut/fortified biscuits) and its use in households， this depends on the food supplementation program or the social protection and food aid programs based on the level malnourished 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As we can see； for SAM with medical complications (P/T<70% of the median or bilateral edema or MUAC <115 mm and at least 1 of the following：Anorexia， ARI， fever >39C， severe dehydration， severe anemia， drowsiness or coma)， management and supply of RUTF are done at the level of URENI/CRENI/CNT/UNT (hospitals) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. But SAM without medical complications (<70% of the median P/T， or bilateral edema or PB. <115 mm， appetite preserved and the absence of worrying or warning clinical signs)， the supply here and the taking care is done on an outpatient basis at the level of the URENAS/CRENAS/CNA/ (CS)， only the non-malnourished can be taken care of by the family 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Reason why UNICEF wants all of Africa to aspire to achieve food and nutrition security， to say adequate food (quantity， quality， safety， cultural acceptability) is available， accessible and used satisfactorily by all individuals in order to lead a healthy and happy life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Despite the efforts made by many African countries in the fight against malnutrition， care and food supply centers suffer from|删除段之间换行|the unavailability and regularity of RUTF at their breasts， while most African countries are subject to nutritional emergencies. However， these dysfunctions do not prevent the hospital or the center from being frequented.Sohowto deal with these constraints that hinder the proper functioning of places of supply of RUTF and management of SAM? What can a nutritional rehabilitation center supplementation program for children with SAM look like in the African context? In order to answer these different questions，let's see what the rest of our work has in store for us.\n\n【22】In countries with limited resources， one person in five is chronically undernourished， that is to say more than 800 million individuals. Every year 6 million children under the age of 5 die from the consequences ofhunger and malnutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. On the other hand， more than 2 billion people suffer from various micronutrient deficiencies， of which 2 billion people， including 52% pregnant women and 39% children under five， suffer from anemia due to lack of iron， 740 million of people suffer from iodine deficiency； 120 million children are victims of vitamin A deficiency； 180 million children are stunted due to nutritional deficiencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5，6\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In Africa between 15 and 30% of adults are chronically undernourished and up to 50% of children have low birth weight. To achieve the objective set at the last World Food Summit， which is to halve the number of those who suffer from hunger， the number of undernourished people would have to be reduced by 22 million a year， whereas this figure is currently only 6 million per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. About 11% of children under 5 or 7.8 million suffer from acute malnutrition (wasting) (1.7 million in Nigeria， 1.7 million in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and 1.3 million in the Sahel countries (based on the latest available data from 2005-2010) Chronic malnutrition (stunting) affects 40% of children or 26.5million children in the region (10.1 million in Nigeria and 5.3 million in DRC)； underweight， an indicator used for the first Millennium Development Goal (MDG)， affects 22% of children under 5 - or 15.4million children in the region (5.7 million in Nigeria and 2.9 million in the DRC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Access methods\n\n【25】The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the community-based outpatient treatment program as the standard treatment protocol for the management of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition at the community level通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【26】In 2016 Eva-Charlotte et al.， in Ethiopia in her study on the challenges in the implementation of the integrated community outpatient therapeutic program shows that the availability of RUTF must be ensured by the application of the appropriate supply chain and policy monitoring. Furthermore， nutritional interventions that address household food insecurity have the potential to reduce the sharing and sale of RUTF， thereby improving the effectiveness of SAM management. This might need a political platform that brings together different actors such as local communities， non-governmental organization and international organizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，7\\]</u>. For the United Nations background the limited availability of inpatient care and a weak referral network between health posts and health facilities further consider barriers to referral of children who have failed to meet recommended program criteria to their exit from the program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\nAcute malnutrition is a continuum condition， but severe forms are treated separately， with different treatment protocols and|删除段之间换行|products， managed by separate UN agencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The Combined Acute Malnutrition Study Protocol aims to simplify and unify the treatment of severe uncomplicated acute malnutrition in children 6to 59 months of age into one protocol for each country in order to improve global coverage， quality， continuity care 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In humanitarian settings， current national and international recommendations imply treatment ofSAM is done with RUTF in separate UN programs， using separate protocols and UN agencies in an outpatient therapeutic program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，8\\]</u>. Only patients with SAM and medical complications require hospitalization to be stabilized while those without medical complications can be managed in outpatient therapeutic management with RUTF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The WHO recommends the use of Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) during the rehabilitation phase in outpatient therapeutic care for patients with SAM.\n\n【28】SAM management at community level\n\n【29】The management of SAM presents a huge challenge， especially in ealth facilities with insufficient resources. The integrated management of MAS includes both inpatient and community services. Children with SAM and complications such as severe oedema， fever or diarrhea are treated as hospitalized patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Community-based therapeutic care was instituted because admission to hospital had several disadvantages， includingthe risk of nosocomial infections and high expenses for the family. The health of siblings and the consequences of removing the mother from the household must be considered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Children with simple SAM who are clinically well and pass the appetite test are better managed in the community； household provides higher coverage than residential programs (more than 70% vs. 10%). Community therapeutic care was endorsed by WHO and UNICEF in 2009.\n\nGenerally， community therapeutic care is based in local health centers. At registration the child receives a course of oral broad-spectrum antibiotics weekly and appropriate distribution of RUTF with families， but weight gain is usually not as rapid as in hospitalized patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. RUTFs are very palatable and there may be a temptation|删除段之间换行|to share rations with other children in the household sometimes in accordance with cultural norms of food sharing， which is why the goal of its care is to promote recovery by providing nutritious food rations preferably from locally available foods and appropriate health education and， above all， preventing the progression of SAM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，4\\]</u>.\n\n【31】In an attempt to improve outcomes， and to address the multiple， co-existing abnormalities that occur in SAM， WHO has produced a standard 10-step protocol consisting of two phases (initial phase and rehabilitation phase)： Treat/prevent hypoglycemia，hypothermia， dehydration， infection； correcteelectrolyte and micronutrient imbalance； start of refeeding achieving catch-up growth； provide sensory stimulation and emotional support and finally follow-up通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The objectives of the study were： Describe the organization/functioning of SAM supplyand care centers， Describe the importance of using SAM RUTF at community level， identify approaches for implementing SAM interventions， determine the challenges in the African context of RUTF in the management of SAM.\n\n【32】ConceptualFramework\n\n【33】Based on the analysis of the nutritional situation and the determinants of malnutrition， as evidenced by the literature， to achieve our objectives we have adapted the framework of UNICEF，2008 .\n\n【34】Root causes\n\n【35】Refer to available resources (human， structural， financial) and their use (political， legal and cultural factors) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The degree to which the rights of women and girls are protected by law and custom； the political and economic system that determines the distribution of income and assets； and the ideologies and policies that govern social sectors，\n\n【36】Underlying causes\n\nThese are factors grouped into food security， care practices such as appropriate complementary feeding， and hygiene and health|删除段之间换行|seeking behaviors that promote good nutrition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These practices can be severely disrupted during emergencies， which can lead to insufficient food intake and increased infection. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation facilities can be severely limited in an area.\n\n【38】Immediate causes\n\n【39】These are the causes that can directly lead to lower immunity in non-pregnant women of childbearing age and children. This concerns the state of health of women and children： Parasitic infections such as malaria， or viral infections (HIV)， can lead to a drop in the level of hemoglobin， or worsen it if it is already present. The nutritional status of non-pregnant women of childbearing age： The poor nutritional status of women can lead to a deficiency in essential vitamins and micronutrients， including iron， which， in the long term， will impact the hemoglobin level and finally the intake in inadequate food ration通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Methods\n\n【41】Study framework and study period\n\n【42】We are interested in sub-Saharan Africa (West and Central Africa) which is the region of the African continent located south of the Sahara Desert and which has the most nutrition problems. It has48 countries for just over a billion inhabitants. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most dynamic part of the planet in terms of demographic， whose food and nutrition security problems are the most worrying at the global level.\n\n【43】Our study consisted in making an inventory through a review of the literature on the modes of access to RUTF and their uses in households to fight against SAM in sub-Saharan Africa during a period of four months from the month from March to June删除4:<u> 2020</u>.\n\n【44】Study approach\n\n【45】We reviewed the literature on RUTF in the fight against SAM in sub-Saharan Africa. The approach consisted of a situational analysis by compiling 20 relevant articles on the question of knowing the place of RUTF in the fight against SAM. And to make a synthesis on the organization， the challenges and prospects of the centers of supply and assumption of responsibility of SAM.\n\n【46】Results\n\n【47】Overview of SAM RUTFs and their indications\n\n【48】We have found some nutritional inputs， but given the diversity of protocols in African countries， we will limit ourselves to citing RUTF and their indications.\n\n【49】F-75 therapeutic milk： Administer in the stabilization phase of severe acute malnutrition. It must be used in therapeutic re-nutrition centers benefiting from medical supervision and must not be distributed directly to families. This stabilization phase consists of ensuring the rehydration of children and the management of their medical complications， while initiating re-nutrition. In addition to skimmed milk powder， F-75 therapeutic milk contains vegetable fat， maltodextrin， sugar， and a complex of minerals and vitamins.\n\n【50】With a caloric density of 75 kcal per 100 ml of reconstituted milk， F-75 is not intended to cause the child to gain weight， its use should therefore be limited to phase 1 (3 days on average). F-75 milk can be given from the age of 6 months. Once reconstituted， F-75 therapeutic milk can be stored for 3 hours at room temperature， up to 16 hours in the refrigerator. Beyond that， it becomes unfit for consumption and must be thrown away.\n\n【51】F-100 therapeutic milk： It must be used in therapeutic re-nutrition centers benefiting from medical supervision and must not be distributed directly to families. It is administered during the stabilization phase of severe acute malnutrition.F-100low osmolarity therapeutic milk has been specially designed for the nutritional rehabilitation of people suffering from severe acute malnutrition， during phase 2 of treatment. Once reconstituted，F-100 therapeutic milk can be stored for 3 h at room temperature， and up to 16 h in the refrigerator. Beyond that， it becomes unfit for consumption and must be thrown away.\n\n【52】Plumpy nut： It is the first RUTFintended for thetreatmentofSAM， with a nutritional value equivalent to that of F-100 therapeutic milk， Plumpynut is specially dedicated to the nutritional rehabilitation of people (children from 6 months and adults) suffering from severe acute malnutrition. This peanut-based paste， sugar， vegetable fats， skimmed milk powder， enriched with vitamins and minerals  comes in 92 g sachets providing 500 kcal. This peanut-based paste， sugar， vegetable fats， skimmed milk powder， enriched with vitamins and minerals comes in 92 g sachets providing 500 kcal (BP-5， BP-100). Ready-to-use food， Plumpy'nut' requires no preparation， no prior dilution in water， no cooking， and can be consumed directly from the sachet. Quantities to plan： 200 kcal/d/kg until the child reaches his target weight， i.e.， an average duration of 6 to 10 weeks. For the treatment of a 7 kg child suffering from severe acute malnutrition： approximately one box of Plumpy'nut， i.e.， 13.8 kg (calculation on the basis of 200kcal/kg/day，i.e.， 2.8 sachets/day for 8 weeks).\n\n【53】ReSoMal： Food intended for the preparation of oral rehydration solution in people with severe acute malnutrition. It must be used in therapeutic re-nutrition centers benefiting from medical supervision and must not be distributed directly to families .\n\n【54】Review of the operation and organization of the centers\n\n【55】The SAM prevention and care program in many African countries is modeled on the health pyramid， with a first level， consisting of villages with health huts run by a health worker or a community health worker supported by relays in charge of prevention，screening and referral activities. At the second level of reference， the integrated health centers， with the main tasks of prevention and integrated outpatient management ofcases without associated medical complications. The third level is essentially made up of hospitals where cases of undernutrition with associated medical complications are cared for .\n\n【56】Use of RUTF at household level\n\nIn DRC， the nutritional management of uncomplicated SAM is based on Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) product which consists of dry rations containing a mixture of pulses and starch foods fortified with micronutrients， oil， vitamin A and sugar. They provide between 1000 and 1200 Kcal/day/person 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>； and also， cows milk alternated with vegetable oil sugar preparations corn， soy，beans， is an acceptable alternative to conventional formulations of RUTF. This food is locally accessible in households， adequately responds to shortages in conventional supply in places without an adequate health system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6，12\\]</u>. In 2002， a study carried out in the DRC and Malawi shows that an amino acid enriched milk-free soya-but-sorghum based RUTF can be used to treat SAM in children 6 to 59 months vears old. This product achieves recovery and treatment rates that when not lower than standard RUTF and is superior in its ability to treat anemia and restore body iron stores 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The significantly lower cost|删除段之间换行|of this new RUTF and its reliance on locally grown ingredients would reduce SAM treatment costs， more children will be treated within existing budgets and facilitate the production of RUTF in countries with high SAM burden 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13，14\\]</u>. RUTF solved SAM problems with low water content and high energy density composition， which allows decentralized management of SAM， called community management of acute malnutrition， right at home 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Commercial RUTFs are biphasic oil/powder systems made from peanuts， skimmed milk powder， sugar， rapeseed and palm oil， and a mixture of vitamins and minerals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Nowadays， local production， following the precise specificities of the United Nations (UN)， Food and Agriculture (FAO) and the United Nations for Children (UNICEF)， is possible， but with|删除段之间换行|costs of still high ingredients， especially skimmed milk powder. Therefore， it is important to define new alternative recipes， usinglocal products for a sustainable production ofthe dough 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15，16\\]</u>.\n\n【58】Main Approaches to lmplementing SAM Interventions\n\nMost African countries use， among other things， the positive deviance approach commonly referred to as \"Home for Learning and Nutritional Rehabilitation\" (FARN) and that of Community-Based Growth Promotion are the most frequently implemented by example in Niger. Home gardening， home visits (VAD) and community screening for malnutrition are most often integrated as activities in both approaches. Social Communication for Behavior Change|删除段之间换行|(SBCC) or Communication for Development is a cross-cutting strategy for transmitting the messages of essential family practices that constitutes the bulk of interventions at the community level.\n\n【60】Challenges in the African context of RUTF in the management of SAM\n\n【61】The most used approaches are community-based， the following are the challenges：\n\n【62】The identification of promising intervention centers，\n\n【63】The scaling up of community interventions in the fight against SAM，\n\n【64】Ownership0o1finteryentions with full community participation，\n\n【65】Intersectoral collaboration for the availability of RUTF，\n\n【66】Good governance/politicalcommitment to siistain investment in nutrition.\n\n【67】Prospects for SAM supply and care centers\n\n【68】Many changes have taken place at the heart of the health system， often in response to contextual changes and health challenges. On the one hand， solutions have emerged， on the other hand， the actors have diversified， creating new challenges in terms of coordination， especially in emergency situations. Development strategies based on economic growth alone are insufficient to reduce SAM， hence the accompaniment by specific investments in nutrition or integrated approaches in nutrition， the strengthening of resilience are created in some African countries to assess the performance and effectiveness of a dietary supplementation program.\n\n【69】Conclusion\n\n【70】In view of the importance of these results from the documentary review，RUTF supplementation programs are of great value in Africa where malnutrition is experienced intergenerationally， ravaging human lives， especially children and adults. here that successful interventions are those designed and implemented in a decentralized way that is community-centered and encourages community participation at every stage of planning and implementation and at all levels of decision-making.

Clin Case Rep Iint. 2019； 3：删除4:<u> 1097</u>.\n\n【16】The primary evaluation showed a irreducible deformity of the right leg at 45°lateral flexion and about 10 degrees in frontal flexion at the junction 1/3 mid-1/3 inferior of the tibia . A cutaneous opening of a few centimeters was at the level of flexion. The clinical examination found a vascular suffering with a weak distal pulse， compared to the healthy side.\n\n【17】删除1:<u>Copyright C 2019 Breda R.

It had to allow ablation nail to allow aligning the limb. It had to preserve the bone capital to allow a secondary osteosynthesis. We decided to perform an anteromedial approach with a distal tibial corticotomy flap respecting the tibio-talar joint and an economical corticotomy at its proximal part. This is to extract the nail retrograde way.\n\n【19】With regard to osteosynthesis， we have been able to perform a conventional osteosynthesis by medial distal tibial plate LCP 3.5.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】The deformation of osteosynthesis material is frequent in cases of nonunion due to a progressive and irreversible embrittlement of the metal. In the vast majority of cases， the diagnosis is made at the time of the rupture of the latter and the extraction of this material is carried out in semi emergency. There are many methods of extraction通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The authors focus mainly on tactics with proximal anterograde extraction and distal percutaneous or retrograde extraction. In all clinical cases reported， there is no simple deformation but a complete rupture ofthe metallic material 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4，7\\]</u>.\n\nThe deformation of material in traumatic cases is much less frequent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The extraction of the material is made very complicated by this deformation. Yip et al. reported extraction of two tibial nails|删除段之间换行|by standard route 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. By carefully studying the deformations， one realizes that these were not important and finally allowed a classic extraction of the nail. One case reported by these authors had 13° of|删除段之间换行|anterior flexion and 20° of valgus. Our clinical case had a much larger deformity.\n\n【23】The idea of deforming the tibia by an external force to obtain a realignment allowing the conventional extraction of the nail has not been seriously considered. Some authors have tried with total failure删除4-1:<u>7</u>.\n\n【24】Some authors propose a minimal approach on the deformation focus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The goal is to cut the nail with a plier or saw. Thus， one can realign the limb and proceed to the extraction as in the case of a rupture on a nonunion. Some authors believe that the use of a saw is not advisable because of metal chips and the risk of bone burns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【25】We decided preoperatively to perform a distal corticotomy. We were then able to seize the nail to carry out a retrograde extraction. All the proximal diaphysis was intact. The bonyhood was then rested and fixed by a provisional strapping and a very long bone plate was placed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【26】In conclusion， the presence of osteosynthesis equipment may expose to complications in case of trauma as illustrated by our clinical case. However， it seems that a complication at this degree of severity is exceptional in the literature. According to our service habits， the removal of osteosynthesis equipment must be included in the therapeutic project from initial management， particularly in a population at high risk oftrauma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

If not managed appropriately it can lead to chronic pain and suffering. This case report presents a 55-year-old postman who was seen in the clinic complaining of persistent pain over the instep of his right foot with no history of trauma. His pain was localized to the first metatarsophalangeal joint with some radiation to the heel. MRI revealed an isolated avulsion fracture ofthe first metatarsal， which was initially missed on X-ray. In this case， the patient was successfully treated with a mixture of steroid and local anesthetic injections. Following our intervention， the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire reduced from 33 to 0. The goal of this article is to raise awareness of this rare finding for doctors who may face this in A&E， Orthopedic clinics or at a GP practice.\n\n【2】Keywords： Avulsion fracture； Peroneus longus； Conservative management\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】An isolated fracture of the peroneus longus tendon at the base of thelst metatarsal joint is a rare entity often unable to diagnose using X-ray upon the initial presentation. There is no gold standard treatments by which these injuries can be managed. Various case reports have shown where surgeons have used a combination of their own personal preference and the clinical picture in front ofthem. Management options vary from conservative using a lower leg cast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and restricted physical exertion with regular follow up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In the case of failed conservative management we must also consider surgery which includes percutaneous fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>， or excision of the non-healed fracture fragment and arthrodesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This case therefore possesses both a diagnostic and management challenge to doctors who face it.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】This case report brings to light a 55-years-old postman who presented to clinic with pain in his right foot for over two months. The pain was confined to the right first metatarsophalangeal joint with occasional radiation to instep and over the heel. This pain was in association with occasional cramping in his right calf muscle and was aggravated by standing or walking and relieved at rest. There was no history of trauma to his foot and this pain was insidious in onset.\n\n【7】Upon examination he was able to stand erect with plantigrade feet. There was a prominent bunion over the right foot. Both heels were in normal valgus alignment and went into varus on standing at the tip of toes.\n\n【8】Further examination revealed the patient was tender over the posteromedial aspect of calf just above the heel and as well as at the knot of Henry. It was noted that the pain got worse on hyperextension at the first metatarsophalangealjoint. The patient also had hallux valgus of moderate degree that was partially correctable. The affected foot itself demonstrated a satisfactory range of motion at the ankle， subtalar， mid foot and forefoot. The distal neurovascular status was found to be unremarkable.\n\n【9】Based on this examination the initial impression was tendinosis of the flexor hallucis longus. To confirm this diagnosis and rule out any other bony injury an MRI scan was requested of the right foot and ankle. Imaging revealed an avulsion of peroneus longus tendon at base of first metatarsal with a possible non-union as well .\n\nThis case was further discussed in the regional foot and ankle meeting. The outcome was to inject the painful nonunion located at the base of the 1st metatarsal on the plantar surface of the foot with|删除段之间换行|a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid injections. Post-procedure there remained no neurovascular deficit. The patient was reviewed at three months and his pain score and functional outcome improved significantly. Moreover following our intervention， the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ) reduced from 33 to 0. At the one year follow up he remained symptom free and discharged.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The peroneus longus tendon has a role in eversion and plantar flexion of foot along with providing stabilization to arches of foot 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The pattern of injury to this tendon is based on two factors one is the mechanism of insult， if injured， and second is the variation in the insertion pattern of peroneus longus tendon itself. The common agreed mechanism of injury is forced dorsiflexion and inversion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Moreover， the shear tensile force on the peroneus longus tendon is also considered as a contributory factor to injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. During cadaveric dissection a variation in tendon insertion has also been identified which includes insertion at the lateral aspect of cuboid and lateral aspect of calcaneum， fifth metatarsal bone and fibular trochlea of calcaneum as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Although both operative and conservative methods of treatment have been documented in the literature with a variability of success rates， the choice varies on the type of injury， treating surgeon and most importantly the patient. There are some notable factors which do favor non-operativetreatment compared to surgery. These in volve the size and displacement of fracture. Studies show small fragments or minimally displaced， undisplaced or multi fragmental fracture patterns will do better with non-operative treatment \\[21.\n\n【15】Hodor et aldescribes a non-weight bearing strategy of conservative treatment as a choice of regimen for this type of injury however， Zematten et al. findings were not supportive of this therapy as they were of the view that patient will represent with a painful non-union at six months and will require excision of the bony fragment along with arthrodesis following a trial conservative treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Literature regarding the role of physiotherapy in relation to these injuries is limited and at the moment there are no specific guidelines in practice. Some researchers have claimed to treat chronic ankle pain in patients following multiple subtle injuries to their joint by means of physiotherapy to provide an improved functional ability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】To conclude isolated avulsion fracture of peroneus longus tendon insertion are rare injuries and it is important to be aware of such injuries when patients present with pain over the instep. Mixed injections of local anesthesia and steroids was a successful way of managing un-united avulsion fracture ofperoneus longus in this case however it is important to always take patient selection and clinical judgment into account in managing such injuries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "ccri", "batch_name": "20240419", "version": "version1"}

Usually，diagnosis is made in emergency conditions due to complications such as rupture， which is associated with high mortality rates (21% to 26%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

The following is a case that depicts a rare case of spontaneous rupture of an inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm that was diagnosed during investigation of gastrointestinal symptoms. The treatment provided was endovascular embolization， with complete exclusion of the aneurysm and a good clinical course.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】E-maii\n\nMale patient， 55 years old， comes to our PS referring to widespread abdominal pain and constipation； no previous pathology. Blood tests (Hb 12， neutrophils 82%， Lymphocytes 13.6%) P.A.120/75 mmHg，fc 105 bpm， diuresis 1200cc，T.C38°C， open alvus with swollen and painful abdomen. Urgent abdominal ultrasound examination is performed， which shows a non-homogeneous hypoechogenic formation in the meso-hypogastrium  and some slightly thickened intestinal loops， but it is not conclusive. We proceed to hydration and start antibiotic therapy. Due to the persistence of the symptoms and the drop in Hb values (8.4)， the patient is then subjected to|删除段之间换行|is properly cited.\n\n【8】a CT examination of the abdomen with intravenous contrast which shows， in the median mesenteric region， extensive retroperitoneal hematoma with evidence of aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenal artery without active spreading in the arterial phase or in the venous phase . The patient is then urgently transferred to another hospital to undergo angiography that documents acute stenosis of the celiac tripod and aneurysmal dilatation of about 11 mm of the proximal tract of the first collateral branch of the inferior pancreatic-duodenal artery . The patient requires an endovascular treatment with embolization ofthe efference， the sac and the afference with complete exclusion of the aneurysm .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\nVisceral artery aneurysms are infrequent and in order those of the splenic artery account for about 50% followed by aneurysms of the hepatic artery (20%)， mesenteric superior artery (8%) and pancreaticoduodenal artery (2%)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3，4\\]</u>. Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms are extremely rare but are probably little known because|删除段之间换行|the symptoms are non-specific and heterogeneous as there may be mesogastric pain， dyspepsia， nausea， jaundice， digestive bleeding or an acute bleeding event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The incidence is the same in both sexes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and usually at diagnosis the average age is 60 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. They can be classified into true aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>； the pseudoaneurysms are secondary to trauma， infectious and inflammatory diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> while true aneurysms are secondary to celiac trunk stenosis， atherosclerotic disease， or fibromuscular dysplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. They have a high risk of rupture independently of the diameter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our case， the patient presented with a true aneurysm， as there were no other possible etiologies and arteriography showed a reduction in the caliber of the celiac trunk at the origin. Aneurysmal rupture occurs with a frequency between 59 and 69% giving rise to a retroperitoneal hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The diagnostic gold standard is contrast-enhanced CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The treatment options are conventional|删除段之间换行|surgical treatment and endovascular approaches 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Conventional surgery is indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients and in cases of aneurysms in territories that are inaccessible to endovascular procedures or after failure of embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，8，9\\]</u>. Angiographic embolization is indicated regardless of the size of the aneurysm and is the treatment of choice for its high efficacy (67% to 100%)， low mortality (2.7%)， low risk of rupture， low postoperative pain and limited post-procedural hospitalization time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2，10\\]</u>. In our case， after right common femoral arterial access， the selective catheterization of the celiac tripod was not possible due to emergency stenosis and therefore selective catheterization of the superior and super-selective mesenteric artery of the inferior duodenal pancreatic artery and subsequent aneurysmatic embolization was proceeded； the patient had no peri and post procedural complications.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】Aneurysms of the duodenal pancreatic artery are rare and present with non-specific symptoms； the diagnosis， made by CT examination of the abdomen with intravenous contrast， is incidental and considering the high mortality rate they must be included among the diagnostic hypotheses in the case of a patient presenting with abdominal pain and anemia.
