Even the best of these proposals have little chance of covering everyone, or controlling health-care costs overall, let alone meeting human rights standards of universality, equity, and accountability.\n\n【1】As a presidential candidate, Barack Obama's original reform plan only partly met human rights standards. As President, he has not promoted a plan that would most benefit the American people. Instead he has courted Republicans and the medical care industries. The result will be a windfall for insurance, hospital, and pharmaceutical corporations through the mandate to obtain health insurance that is a key component of each reform bill. In exchange for submitting to a few new regulations, such as guaranteed issue and renewal, insurance companies will get millions of new customers, many subsidised by the government.\n\n【2】Despite subsidies, health-care costs will still burden some families, particularly those just above income cut-offs. The proposed public plans are specifically structured to be available only to those not insured by their employer, rather than an option open to all based on Medicare. Specific regulations, and probably small enrolment, will limit these plans' ability to negotiate lower prices.\n\n【3】Meanwhile, despite the efforts of a few Democrats, legislation consistent with the right to health is mostly ignored. Publicly popular proposals, HR676 and S703, would create a national health insurance system, by expanding and improving Medicare to cover everyone. However, their passage is unlikely given massive campaign donations and lobbying from medical care industries, and the assertion that policies to improve public welfare equal socialism.\n\n【4】The health-care reform process exposes how corporate influence renders the US Government incapable of making policy on the basis of evidence and the public interest. The right to health requires that a health system, available and accessible to all, includes protection and promotion of health, and treatment of illness. There is no excuse for the USA not to adopt a system like any of those in many other countries that cover everyone and control costs—systems that better integrate public health and individual medical care. Without such a system, comprehensive primary health care will not be implemented, nor will the social determinants of health be effectively addressed.\n\n【5】The belief in US exceptionalism must be laid to rest. People living in the USA are as entitled to the right to health as others, and the USA should be accountable to the same standards as any other country.\n\n【6】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

These treatment strategies are either therapies of finite duration that aim to achieve sustained off-therapy responses, or long-term treatments that aim to maintain on-therapy remission. Pegylated interferon alfa may offer higher sustained off-therapy responses after 1 year, but most patients do not respond. Oral antivirals are the only candidates for long-term treatment of patients with chronic HBV infection. Viral suppression has favourable effects on patients' outcome and modifies the natural history of the disease. Viral resistance is the main drawback of long-term antiviral therapy. Lamivudine monotherapy is associated with higher resistance (year 1, 10–27%; year 2, 37–48%; year 4, 60–65%) than adefovir (year 1, 0%; year 2, 3%; year 5, 29%) or telbivudine (year 1, 3–4%; year 2, 9–22%). Entecavir resistance is rare in naive individuals (year 4, <1%), but increases over time in lamivudine-resistant patients (year 4, 43%).

She received six cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide from August to November, with good tolerance. She was also being treated with valsartan for essential hypertension, which had begun 2 years previously. In December, 2005, treatment with anastrozole (1 mg/day) was started, and 3 weeks later she noted severe asthenia and progressively developed jaundice and dyspnoea. Anastrozole was withdrawn and the patient was admitted to hospital.\n\n【1】Laboratory data showed thrombocytopenia (platelet count 65×10 9 /L), prothrombin time 22 s (normal range 11–13 s), aspartate aminotransferase concentration 1062 U/L (<37 U/L), alanine aminotransferase concentration 2012 U/L (<40 U/L), lactated hydrogenase concentration 2319 U/L (<460 U/L), alkaline phosphatase concentration 1186 U/L (<260 U/L), γ-glutamyl transferase concentration 714 U/L (<49 U/L), total bilirubin concentration 187 μmol/L (<17 μmol/L) and a direct bilirubin of 66 μmol/L. Serum copper, iron, ceruloplasmin, and α1-antitrypsin concentrations were normal. Serology for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses and non-organ-specific autoantibodies (ANA, ASMA, and AMA) were negative.\n\n【2】A chest radiograph showed a moderate right-sided pleural effusion, which was transudate.

A laparotomy disclosed a perforated duodenal ulcer, and a Billroth II procedure was done, but the patient developed septic shock and died in the postoperative period.\n\n【5】In our patient, a complete diagnostic workup ruled out non-toxic causes of liver injury. Doxorubicin has seldom been incriminated in hepatic toxicity, and cyclophosphamide has mainly been associated with sinusoidal obstructive syndrome in patients with haematological malignancies. In fact, late-onset hepatotoxicity due to cyclophosphamide could not be ruled out, but we did not see clinical evidence of liver disease during the courses of combination chemotherapy in our patient. She had been treated for 2 years with valsartan, a drug with a low risk of hepatotoxicity.\n\n【6】The temporal evidence seems to favour anastrozole as the most probable cause of liver injury in our patient. However, over the past 6 years, more than 30 000 patients with breast cancer have been treated with third-generation aromatase inhibitors with a good liver safety profile. We found no similar cases in the WHO database . Nevertheless, selection of ideal participants and analysis of predetermined side-effects in preclinical studies partly explain the appearance of unexpected drug-related events in the post-approval phase. Most importantly, uncommon genetic-based metabolic variants, or drug-drug interactions at the level of microsomal drug metabolism, are the basis for cases of toxic hepatitis detected only through a careful post-marketing surveillance. In fact, a case of anastrozole-related hepatitis was reported after the submission of this one, although liver histology was not documented in this patient.\n\n【7】In our patient, the absence of inflammatory changes in the hepatic biopsy and the location of necrosis at zone 3 of the liver acinus, paralleling the preferred location of most of the P450 isoenzymes involved in drug metabolism, were all compatible with a metabolically mediated hepatocellular liver injury. Anastrozole is extensively metabolised in the liver, by N-dealkylation, hydroxylation, and glucuronidation, but no data exist on the cytochromes involved in anastrozole hepatic detoxification. The drug, but not its metabolites, has been shown to inhibit the reactions catalysed by cytochromes P450 1A2, 2C8/9, and 3A4. However, pharmacological studies suggest that the risk of CYP-mediated drug-drug interactions is negligible in individuals treated with anastrozole or valsartan. For these reasons, although CYP2C9 has a minor role in valsartan metabolism, an interaction between both drugs seems unlikely in our patient.\n\n【8】Coadministration of tamoxifen and anastrozole significantly lowers the plasma concentrations of anastrozole, suggesting that a cytochrome-mediated drug-drug interaction might modify anastrozole concentrations in plasma. Thus, on theoretical grounds, if the drug is the toxic mediator and since CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 are the main phase I enzymes involved in N-dealkylation and hydroxylation of many other drugs, a genetic polymorphism of any of these cytochromes would predispose to anastrozole liver toxicity in some patients. But the pathogenesis of this liver injury remains speculative, since the toxic potential of the three main pharmacologically inactive metabolites of anastrozole is unknown, and an immune-mediated mechanism cannot be ruled out. In conclusion, clinicians need to be aware of the possible toxic effects of anastrozole on the liver. Additional well documented communication of suspicious cases is necessary to confirm this toxic effect, and to determine its prevalence and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms.\n\n【9】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

He was born on April 3, 1934 in Porto, Portugal, and died of cancer on Dec 8, 2021 in Porto, aged 87 years.\n\n【2】When José Eduardo Lima Pinto da Costa entered legal medicine in the early 1960s, the field was not popular with the Portuguese medical community. Through decades of teaching, advocacy, and practice, he changed that perception and transformed the field. “He was enthusiastic about demystifying legal medicine for the general public and raising awareness that this work was not only doing autopsies, but most of its practice entails examining people who are alive. Legal medicine owes him the visibility and respect that was not there before his professional activity in Portugal”, said his wife, Maria José Pinto da Costa, Professor of Legal Medicine and Forensic Toxicology at the University of Porto's Biomedical Sciences Institute Abel Salazar (ICBAS). She was his former student and worked closely with him for 45 years.\n\n【3】Pinto da Costa graduated with a degree in medicine and surgery from the Faculty of Medicine (FMUP) at the University of Porto in 1960. He received a postgraduate degree in legal medicine in 1961 from the Medico-Legal Institute of Porto and a PhD in legal medicine from the University of Porto in 1973, writing his thesis on the role of fingerprints in medico-legal identification. The University of Porto would remain his primary academic home throughout his career. He took on a role as Professor Auxiliar in Legal Medicine and Forensic Toxicology at FMUP in 1973 and became a Cathedratic Professor at FMUP in 1996. He also joined ICBAS, where he was a Professor and established the Master Course in Legal Medicine in 1999. Although he officially retired from ICBAS in 2004, Pinto da Costa continued to teach as an Emeritus Professor until his death. He served as a Professor of Legal Medicine at the University of Porto's Faculty of Law from 2000 to 2003.\n\n【4】Teaching was his passion, said Maria José Pinto da Costa, and he was a popular lecturer, with the “unique capacity of explaining complex concepts in a very simple way, making it easy for anyone to understand. And he had the utmost respect for any audience”, she said. Always meticulous and engaging, “he was a professor who remains in the heads of the people that had contact with him”, said António Sousa Pereira, the Rector of the University of Porto and Pinto da Costa's former student. Pinto da Costa also served as a Professor of Legal Medicine at the private Portucalense Infante D Henrique University in Porto from 1986 until his death and he taught in public and private universities across the country on subjects ranging from forensic psychology to criminology and medical law. “In Portugal, there will be few people who work in any of these areas that have not had contact with Professor Pinto da Costa”, Sousa Pereira said. “He was a role model for every person who now works in this field of knowledge.”\n\n【5】Pinto da Costa had a career outside of the classroom, including serving as the Director of the Institute of Legal Medicine of Porto, beginning in 1976. Under the supervision of the Portuguese Ministry of Justice, the institute provides forensic services to the police and government agencies. He did more than 30 000 autopsies, while also strengthening services for living patients, his wife said, including people involved in accidents related to road traffic or in the workplace and survivors of intimate partner violence and sexual assault. “He created a permanent service so that there was always a medical legal doctor that is on call at the police \\[station\\] and main hospitals” to conduct examinations and tests, she explained. Pinto da Costa also pushed to strengthen rules for reporting intimate partner violence and to create facilities where survivors could find shelter, while also recruiting psychologists and lawyers who could offer them free support. “His legacy is also these organisations, which play a very important role in our country”, Maria José Pinto da Costa said. After leaving the Institute of Legal Medicine of Porto in 2001, he founded his own private centre in 2003 to continue providing legal medical services.\n\n【6】Supporting and developing national networks and resources was another focus for Pinto da Costa. He was a founder of the Portuguese Medico-Legal Society in 1981 and the Portuguese scientific legal medicine journal, _Boletim de Medicina Legal e Toxicologia Forense_ . “Legal medicine was not only a profession, but it was something that was in his heart as a way of work and a way of living,” Sousa Pereira said. In addition to his wife, Pinto da Costa is survived by his four children.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 21 May 2022\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00883-2</u>\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

As specialised antigen-presenting cells with profound influence over the immune response, these distinctive leucocyte subpopulations are now attracting justifiable attention in a diverse range of clinical research programmes. Although there is still a surprising amount to learn about the basic biology of dendritic cells, each new fundamental observation offers potential for improving clinical knowledge. The Toll-like receptors on cells of the innate immune system sense pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Michele West and colleagues recently described an acute increase in antigen macropinocytosis by dendritic cells after the triggering of Toll-like receptors, which led to enhanced presentation of antigen on class-I and class-II major histocompatibility complex molecules. The finding has ramifications for clinical immunotherapy protocols, and provides a satisfying link between the beguiling morphology of dendritic cells and their migration. They also showed an increase in the active movement of membrane extensions of the dendritic cell and the simultaneous disappearance of actin-rich podosomes, which suggests a coordinated redeployment of actin to fuel the pathogen-driven increase in endocytosis. The changes require p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. Logically these functional changes might provide a mechanism to maximise presentation of pathogen-derived antigen over that of self-antigen to dendritic cells.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region, traffic deaths have remained stable at a high-level despite strong progress in other health domains. We evaluated the effects of road safety interventions in LAC and estimated the benefits that vehicle design improvements would have in this region.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In our study done in October, 2018, we used a counterfactual analysis to assess the reduction in deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost if eight proven vehicle safety technologies were made more widely available in LAC countries. We estimated: (1) country-level incidence of traffic injuries, (2) the effectiveness of technologies through a systematic literature review, (3) the prevalence of car safety technologies, and (4) the lives saved and DALYs averted if all cars had these technologies. We characterised uncertainty in estimates by reporting the sensitivity of the results to alternative modelling assumptions.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Increasing availability of electronic stability control, which includes antilock-brake systems, would have the largest benefits in the LAC region, estimated at 19·4% (sensitivity analysis range 8·6–31·1) fewer deaths and 17·0% (5·7–29·2) fewer DALYs. Increasing use of seatbelts would reduce deaths by 12·1% (9·1–15·5) and DALYs by 12·6% (9·4–16·3). Optimisation for side-impacts would result in 6·3% (3·1–6·5) fewer deaths, and improvements to vehicle front-end design would result in 6·0% (2·2–10·4) fewer deaths. The overall effect of improved vehicle design in the region would be 28·1% (12·8–39·2) fewer deaths, and 29·1% (13·5–39·8) fewer DALYs. Other safety technologies modelled, including airbag (front and side), side door beam, and side structure and padding, have smaller benefits.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Regulating and encouraging the use of proven vehicle safety technologies in LMICs would have large gains and needs to be prioritised in the SDG agenda for 2030.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Inter-American Development Bank.\n\n【10】</u>Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】As the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011–20) draws to a close, it has become clear that countries have made much less progress in reducing traffic injuries than in other health domains. Although Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.6 aimed to halve the number of global traffic deaths by 2020, deaths have continued to rise, or remained stable at a high level, in most low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2016, road traffic crashes in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region killed approximately 110 000 people and were the fifth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost in global burden of disease (GBD) rankings. Among people aged between 15 and 49 years, traffic injuries were the second leading cause of death in the LAC region, behind interpersonal violence. Although mortality from traffic injuries has remained stable in the region, there have been remarkable strides in reducing the burden of many diseases. Between 2000 and 2017, DALYs due to lower respiratory infections in the region declined by 45%, diarrhoeal disease declined by 64%, and HIV/AIDS by 39%.\n\n【12】In February, 2020, the 3rd Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety adopted the Stockholm Declaration, calling on countries to reduce traffic deaths by half by 2030. An understanding of what has worked in high-income countries (HICs) is important in this dialogue. By contrast to LMICs, HICs have done remarkably well at reducing traffic injuries. In the 1960s, traffic death rates in countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) were similar to those in the LAC region in 2016 (22 deaths per 100 000 people). However, death rates have declined steadily in OECD countries since the 1970s, and are now approximately five deaths per 100 000 people in many countries. This success has been attributed to broad based efforts across a wide range of areas, including the strengthening of institutional capacity, improvements in vehicle and roadway design, increased enforcement of road safety regulations, progress in medical care, and road user education. Consequently, WHO recommends for LMICs to undertake multisectoral action spanning health, transport, education, and law enforcement, among others.\n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【15】We searched PubMed and Embase for publications in English, without restriction by date, and that reported evaluations of the effect of vehicle design on the burden of road traffic injuries in LMICs using the search terms “traffic injuries” AND “vehicle design” OR “vehicle safety” AND “low- and middle-income countries” AND “effectiveness”. We found several studies that estimated the effects of various road safety interventions in LMICs but none that assessed the population-level effects of improving vehicle safety technologies, with the exception of studies that assessed the effects of seatbelt use.\n\n【16】**Added value of this study**\n\n【17】We estimated the effect of increasing the availability of proven vehicle safety technologies on mortality and population health burden of road traffic injuries in countries in the LAC region. We focused on technologies that relate with eight UN regulations that are considered high priority, and which have been available in high-income countries (HICs) long enough to evaluate their effects on traffic injuries. We found that, although the extent of benefits for countries vary on the basis of baseline conditions 删除2:<u>(especially for prevalence of technologies, crash configurations, and types of road users injured)</u>, all countries will see large benefits from increased availability of these technologies. Increasing the availability of electronic stability control would lead to the largest benefits in terms of lives saved and disability averted in the LAC region. A large portion of the health gains derive from antilock-brake systems (ABS), which are integrated in electronic stability control technologies. Motorcycle-ABS, in particular, are one of the few vehicle technologies that can have a large effect on reducing injuries in countries (eg, Colombia) where motorcyclists comprise a large proportion of deaths and injuries. Increasing the use of occupant protection technologies, including seatbelts, frontal and side air bags, side structure, and padding, will have a large effect on traffic deaths in countries (eg, Argentina) where occupants comprise a large proportion of deaths and injuries. Seatbelts are a highly effective technology that are already available in almost all cars in the LAC region, but seatbelt use is low in this region. By making the structures that interact with pedestrians (eg, bumper, hood, windshield, and A-pillar) softer, the front-end design of cars can help to reduce pedestrian injuries substantially, but the benefits would be greater if front-ends of other vehicles, especially buses and trucks, were also improved.\n\n【18】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【19】Road traffic injuries in most LMICs are either rising or stable at a high-level despite strong global advocacy as part of the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011–20). Many research papers show that improvements in vehicle safety design were a primary driver for the large reductions in traffic death rates in HICs since the 1960s. Nevertheless, vehicle design is not receiving adequate attention in global road safety advocacy efforts. 124 LMICs require only one (or none) of the eight priority regulations recommended by the UN World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. Therefore, our findings emphasise the importance of improving vehicle safety design for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals road safety agenda for 2030. Such improvements can be achieved by a combination of vehicle design regulations and the creation of consumer demand for safer cars through mechanisms like new car assessment programmes (NCAPs).\n\n【20】Although there is no doubt that HICs undertook a wide range of interventions, some factors, such as improvements in vehicle design, had much larger effects than others. For instance, the risk of driver death in a 2009 model passenger vehicle sold in the USA is estimated to be half that associated with vehicle models sold in 1984. In fact, a review by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that vehicle design improvements between 1960 and 2012 reduced traffic mortality by as much as all other factors combined.\n\n【21】Despite the potential benefits, vehicle design is neglected in policy efforts in LMICs. Although there have been several studies that have evaluated the effects of road safety interventions in LMICs, to our knowledge, none has focused on estimating the benefits from vehicle design improvements in LMICs. Although the UN World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations has developed a legal framework and identified eight regulations that should be prioritised, only 40 countries (mainly HICs) have implemented these. Among LMICs, 124 countries require only one (or none) of the eight regulations. Crash testing of the most popular brands of cars sold in LMICs show that most will not pass even the relatively low safety requirements of UN regulations, and thus are substantially less safe than vehicles commonly available in HICs. Although there is little systematic evidence on how these processes (regulation and consumer information by new car assessment programmes \\[NCAPs\\]) affect vehicle prices, estimates from global NCAPs suggest that the cost of these technologies is fairly low (eg, antilock-brake systems \\[ABS\\] plus electronic stability control are priced approximately between ∼US $75–100).\n\n【22】Therefore, we aimed to assess the reduction in traffic injuries that could be achieved if proven vehicle safety technologies were widely available in the LAC region. We focused on eight technologies that relate to the priority UN regulations 删除2:<u>( table 1 )</u> and that have been available in HICs long enough for their effects on traffic injuries to be systematically evaluated. These technologies are: ABS, electronic stability control, occupant restraints (ie, safety belts and child seats), frontal airbags, side airbags, side door beams, side structure and padding, and vehicle front-end design for pedestrian protection. In addition, we estimate the effects of overall improvements in side-impact protection and vehicle design. The estimated benefits depend primarily on how well the technologies do in the most common crash configurations. To show these variations, we present results for six countries (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Uruguay), in addition to the LAC region as a whole.\n\n【23】Table 1 Priority UN vehicle safety standards and associated existing technologies\n\n|  | **Associated technologies** |\n| --- | --- |\n| UN regulation 94 and 95: frontal impact protection and side impact protection; crashworthiness in crash tests at specific speeds | Occupant restraints, airbags (frontal and side), side structure and padding, and side door beams |\n| UN regulation 140: electronic stability control; prevents skidding and loss of control, requires antilock brakes | Electronic stability control |\n| UN regulation 78: motorcycle antilock brakes; helps maintain control during emergency braking | Motorcycle-antilock brakes |\n| UN regulation 127: pedestrian front protection; vehicle front-end modifications to reduce severity of pedestrian injuries | Vehicle front-end design |\n| UN regulation 14, 16, and 129: seatbelt, seatbelt anchorages, and child restraints | Occupant restraints |\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Study design\n\n【27】We did a counterfactual analysis to assess the number of deaths, injuries, and DALYs that would be averted in a scenario in which selected safety technologies were available in the entire fleet of vehicles. In summary, we used the following steps for each intervention: (1) identify which crash configurations are affected by the intervention, (2) estimate relative risks (ie, how much the technologies affect the probability of crashes and injuries) in different crash configurations, which were based on a systematic review of the literature, (3) estimate the proportion of vehicles that have the intervention, (4) and estimate the number of lives saved (and DALYs averted) in the scenario in which all vehicles had the safety technology. The method that we used requires many assumptions, which are summarised in table 2 .\n\n【28】Table 2 Assumptions and sources of uncertainty in modelling strategy\n\n|  | **Main or best estimate for modelling strategy** | **Sensitivity analyses** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Uncertainty in estimates of road traffic injuries at baseline** | **Uncertainty in estimates of road traffic injuries at baseline** | **Uncertainty in estimates of road traffic injuries at baseline** |\n| Estimates of traffic injury mortality in Latin American countries vary substantially | Overall road traffic injury incidence on the basis of global burden of disease estimates from 2016 | 95th uncertainty interval of global burden of disease estimates from 2016, and WHO's global health estimates |\n| There was no information available from the region on the distribution of crash configurations (ie, front, side, or rear) for occupant injuries | Assume distribution of crash configurations for occupant injuries from US data | Crash configurations based on data from Japan and Germany |\n| Information on the types of vehicles involved in pedestrian injuries was available for only six countries (Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Uruguay) | For countries in which impacting vehicles for pedestrians is not known, assume average of available data | For countries in which impacting vehicles for pedestrians is not known, assume minimum and maximum estimates from available data |\n| **Uncertainty in estimates of technology penetration** | **Uncertainty in estimates of technology penetration** | **Uncertainty in estimates of technology penetration** |\n| Information on the availability of technology in new vehicles sales was only available for Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay (time history data were available only from Uruguay) | Estimate prevalence of technologies of a vehicle fleet in Argentina, Colombia, and Uruguay was based on a technology adoption model for each technology that was calibrated using data from Uruguay; for other countries, assume average prevalence of these three countries | For countries in which prevalence of technologies is not known, assume minimum and maximum estimates from Argentina, Colombia, and Uruguay |\n| Reliable seatbelt-use estimates (ie, from multi-site observational studies) were only available for eight countries (Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, and Uruguay) | For countries in which seatbelt use is not known, assume average estimates from available data | For countries in which seatbelt use is not known, assume minimum and maximum estimates from available data |\n| **Uncertainty in estimates of relative risk (RR)** | **Uncertainty in estimates of relative risk (RR)** | **Uncertainty in estimates of relative risk (RR)** |\n| There is a large variation in estimates of RR 删除2:<u>(see appendix pp 11–24 )</u> partly because of variation in quality of evaluations | For the main or best estimate, we used the mean RR estimate from the most robust evaluation; we included the maximum or minimum of the 95th CI of the RR in sensitivity analyses (the specific modelling choices for each technology) | . |\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【30】### Estimation of baseline deaths and injuries\n\n【31】In most LMICs, official statistics on traffic injuries are sourced from traffic police, which can have substantial under-reporting. In the LAC region, however, data for total traffic deaths in most countries are relatively reliable (compared with other LMICs) and within 25% of the estimates based on vital ation data by the GBD study 删除2:<u>( appendix p 1 )</u>. Nevertheless, there are large discrepancies between the proportions of road user deaths reported in official statistics and those reported in the GBD study, reflecting the poor quality of coding for types of road user in the vital registration data for the LAC region. Therefore, for baseline estimates of deaths and injuries, we used the 2016 GBD estimates for total road traffic deaths and non-fatal injuries (disaggregated by age and sex) in each country, which we further disaggregated by type of road user using the proportions reported in official statistics presented in the WHO Global Status Report on Road Safety.\n\n【32】To estimate crash configurations (eg, rollover, side or frontal impact), we obtained records from traffic police databases from Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Uruguay. However, none of the records from these countries could be used for estimating crash configuration of occupant crashes, usually because this information was not collected or had high-levels (ie, >75%) of missing data. Therefore, we applied estimates of crash configurations for occupants based on data from the USA. We estimated impacting vehicles for pedestrians using crash data from six countries: Argentina, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Uruguay 删除2:<u>( appendix p 4 )</u>. For other countries, we used the average of estimates from available countries.\n\n【33】### Estimation of technology penetration\n\n【34】Our literature review and online searches showed no primary sources on the prevalence of any of the eight safety technologies in the vehicle fleet. Therefore, we estimated this prevalence on the basis of historical data for the availability of technologies in new vehicles collected by AutoData (Montevideo, Uruguay). These data were available for three countries in 2017: Uruguay, Colombia, and Argentina; and for 2000 onwards for ABS, electronic stability control, frontal airbags, and side-airbags in new vehicle sales for Uruguay 删除2:<u>( appendix p 5 )</u>. Following previous work on the adoption of technology and vehicle fleet attrition, we used a logistic function to model technology adoption (ie, the availability of technologies in new vehicles sold) to the historical data from Uruguay, and applied it to the 2017 data from other countries to estimate the historical availability of these technologies. Finally, we used historical vehicle registration data to estimate the prevalence of the technologies in the on-road vehicle fleet. Information about motorcycle ABS were not available from any source but is expected to be very low and was set at 0%.\n\n【35】For seatbelts, which have been available in new vehicles in most countries for many years, the relevant metric was prevalence of seatbelt use rather than seatbelt availability. We estimated prevalence of seatbelt use on the basis of a literature search for observational data in the region. Key sources of data included the 2013 and 2015 WHO Global Status Reports on Road Safety. These reports provide data for seatbelt use for all countries from various sources. We restricted the data to countries that we could verify that estimates had been obtained from a nationally representative observational study (ie, we excluded data from expert opinion, self-report surveys, and observational studies that were done at a single location). For all technologies (including use of seatbelts), we used country data when available, and the average for other countries.\n\n【36】### Estimating relative risks\n\n【37】We estimated the relative risk (ratio of probability of injuries for population exposed to vehicles with and without the technology) associated with each technology through a systematic search of the literature (including government reports). Our initial search identified 10 912 articles, which were reduced to 169 articles after screening for titles and abstracts, and 40 papers after a review of the full text. To these articles, we added 19 papers identified from snowball searches and feedback from experts. The final set of 59 papers were scrutinized for the quality of analytical methods and appropriate use of controls. Estimates of effectiveness were extracted from 13 papers. The search strings, inclusion criteria, studies identified, and forest plots of relative risks for each intervention are shown in appendix pp 8–10 . The final choice of relative risks are summarised in table 2 .\n\n【38】### Analytical approach\n\n【39】We used a comparative risk assessment framework to estimate the burden of injuries attributable to unsafe vehicles, and the proportional reduction in mortality and morbidity if the exposure to the risk factor was reduced to an alternative scenario (reduced to a counterfactual scenario). For individual vehicle technologies, the counterfactual scenario was defined as their availability in the entire fleet. For estimating the overall or combined effect of vehicle design improvements, the effects of gains from individual technologies cannot be added because their effects are not independent. Many technologies mitigate injuries in the same crash configuration (eg, seatbelts, airbags, ABS, and electronic stability control—all affect the risk of occupant injury in frontal crashes). Therefore, we estimated the overall benefits of improved vehicle design as follows: for pedestrians, we applied benefits of vehicle front-end design for pedestrian protection, which provides a conservative estimate because it ignores the benefits from other technologies, such as ABS. For motorcyclists, we applied benefits of motorcycle-ABS. For occupants, we used estimates of the annual reduction in occupant fatality risk in the USA due to vehicle design improvements, assuming that the fleet in the LAC region has safety characteristics similar to the USA in 1990. To convert estimates of deaths and injuries into estimates of DALYs for the population, we calculated DALYs using a previously described burden calculator.\n\n【40】### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【41】As described above, our analysis required many assumptions, which are summarised in table 2 . Furthermore, there was substantial uncertainty associated with various model inputs. We characterised this uncertainty by doing a sensitivity analysis that was based on recalculating results under alternative modelling assumptions. We reported the minimum and maximum values derived from modelling all possible combinations of the following variations to the main estimates: (1) baseline traffic injury estimates: we used maximum and minimum values of the 95th uncertainty interval of road injuries reported in the 2016 GBD, and WHO's Global Health Estimates; (2) crash configuration: we used the percentage of occupant injuries resulting from frontal, side, and rear impact crashes in Germany, and Japan; (3) technology penetration (including availability and use of seatbelts): for countries for which data on penetration of a particular technology was not available, we used the maximum and minimum values for other countries; and (4) relative risks: we included the maximum and minimum values of the 95th CI of the relative risk reported in the studies selected from the systematic review. For the overall effect of vehicle design improvements, we additionally modelled baseline fleet safety characteristics as similar to the US vehicle fleet in 1980 and 2000.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【42】The funder approved the study design and helped to connect with national agencies that provided data.

Increasing seatbelt use would reduce deaths by 12% (sensitivity analysis 9·1–15·5) and DALYs by 13% (9·4–16·3) in the LAC region, but these estimates vary substantially for countries. For example, Argentina, which had a large proportion of occupant injuries and relatively low (compared to high-income countries) use of seatbelts, overall DALYs would be reduced by 20% (14·1–24·5), in contrast with Colombia, where DALYs would be reduced by only 3% (2·3–4·0). Similarly, frontal airbags only provided protection to occupants. However, frontal airbags were less effective at reducing injuries than seatbelts and were already commonly available in vehicles. As a result, increasing penetration of frontal airbags would result in only 4% (1·8%–4·3%) fewer deaths and 3% (2·0–4·7) fewer DALYs in the LAC region.\n\n【56】Of the three side-impact technologies assessed, side door beams would have the least effect, with reductions in deaths and DALYs of less than 0·5%, even in countries in which occupant injuries are dominant. Side structure and padding, and side airbags were more beneficial than side door beams, with reductions in DALYs of 2% (sensitivity analysis range 0·7%–2·5%) for side structure and padding, and 3% (1·3–4·1) for side airbags, in the LAC region. However, developing a system for side impact protection, in which individual technologies are optimised to work together, would have large benefits. Increasing the availability of such vehicles would result in 6% (3·1–6·5) fewer deaths in the region. In Argentina, where occupant injuries are common, there would be 10% (4·8–10·0) fewer deaths.\n\n【57】Improving vehicle front-end design for pedestrian protection would result in large gains for pedestrians (ie, 18% fewer pedestrian deaths in the LAC region). In countries where pedestrian injuries dominate, overall DALYs lost to traffic injuries would be reduced. For instance, in Mexico, DALYs would be reduced by 8% (sensitivity analysis range 2·8%–13·2%) but the gains in Argentina, Colombia, and Uruguay, where a smaller proportion of traffic injuries involve pedestrians, would be less than half that in Mexico. In the LAC region, improving vehicle front-end design would result in 6% (2·1–10·0) fewer DALYs. These estimates do not account for the potential spillover benefits to bicyclists and motorcyclists.\n\n【58】Our estimates suggest large overall reductions in deaths and DALYs from improvements in vehicle design in all countries analysed. The gains are highest for Argentina (33% fewer DALYs) and lowest for Colombia (20% fewer DALYs). In the LAC region, improving vehicle design would result in 28% (sensitivity analysis range 12·8%–39·2%) fewer deaths, and 29% (13·5%–39·8%) fewer DALYs.\n\n【59】Discussion\n----------\n\n【60】We showed that the wide availability of proven vehicle safety technologies would result in large gains in the LAC region and LMIC, more generally. Notably, our analysis restricts attention to technologies that have been available for many years in HICs, and whose real-world effects have been established. In fact, there are many emerging technologies that hold great promise, including some, such as automatic emergency braking and lane departure warning, that evaluations suggest will have large beneficial effects.\n\n【61】In particular, we find that increasing availability of electronic stability control, which build on ABS, would provide the largest benefits. Although evaluations of ABS for occupant safety have shown mixed results (ie, the benefits for occupants are not proven), ABS provide modest benefits for pedestrians. Motorcycle-ABS, in particular, are one of the few vehicle technologies that have large benefits for motorcyclists, who make up the largest share of traffic deaths in many LMICs in the region (eg, Colombia and Uruguay) and globally. Similarly, improving the crashworthiness of cars will have a large benefits for countries in which occupants comprise a large proportion of traffic injuries (eg, Argentina). Seatbelts are a highly effective technology that are already available in almost all vehicles in the region, but seatbelt use is low. The LAC region needs to strengthen the enforcement of belt use laws to derive the benefits of this technology. Finally, although vehicle front-end design has a large effect on pedestrian injuries, regulations apply only to the design of cars. However, unlike HICs, where cars are the primary threat to pedestrians, in most LMICs, pedestrians are killed in crashes with other vehicles, especially buses and trucks, which need to be included in such regulatory efforts.\n\n【62】There is substantial uncertainty in our estimates due to the uncertainty in inputs 删除2:<u>(summarised in table 2 )</u>, not all of which could be modelled. Notably, the 2016 GBD and WHO's global health estimates provide differing estimates of the national incidence of traffic injuries in the region, which we model in our sensitivity analysis. Data for the distribution of crash configurations (eg, front, side, rear, and rollover) were not available from any countries in the region. Therefore, we used data for crash configurations from the USA for our main estimates and included data from Germany and Japan in the sensitivity analysis. Although crash configurations in these two countries did not differ substantially from the USA, it is possible that differences in crash configuration would be larger in countries with less developed highway infrastructure. There are very little available data in the region on the prevalence of vehicle design technologies. Our analysis used the range of prevalence estimates from only three countries to generate estimates for the entire region. Finally, our analysis assumes that the benefits of these technologies in the LAC region would be similar to those in HICs where their effects on safety were evaluated. Although we model the uncertainty in relative risks reported in these evaluations, it is important to note that deriving the full benefits of technologies often requires supportive structural design. For instance, the effectiveness of an airbag at preventing injuries depends on whether seatbelts are being used. Airbag and seatbelts are also more effective when crashworthiness design of the vehicle front-end ensures that the passenger compartment does not collapse. Therefore, although our analysis focuses on assessing the effect of technologies, the purpose of the analysis is not to promote particular technologies but to encourage regulatory efforts that will improve overall vehicle safety design.\n\n【63】Our finding of the large benefits of improving vehicle design raises an important question: what motivated manufacturers to improve vehicle design in HICs? There are two policy mechanisms that have driven advances in vehicle safety in HICs. First, regulations were instituted that required all cars that were sold to provide a minimum threshold of safety. Second, HICs established NCAPs that tested cars in conditions that were more stringent than regulations and change more often than regulations. Safety ratings from NCAPs had a large influence on consumer choices and created strong market forces for manufacturers to improve safety design. In fact, there is strong evidence from the USA and Europe that car manufacturers respond to changing NCAP test requirements by redesigning cars to be safer. Typically, these engineering efforts have involved the development of safety technologies and optimising how they work together to provide the maximum safety benefits. For instance, auto manufacturers responded to new NCAP tests in the USA by design modifications that reduced the probability of death in side impacts by 70%. As our analysis highlights, the benefit from the optimised response far exceeds the benefits of the individual side impact technologies.\n\n【64】The time it takes for new technology to become pervasive in the vehicle fleet is much shorter in rapidly motorising countries. Contrary to popular belief, the vehicle fleet in LMICs tends to be young. Based on our fleet evolution model, almost three-quarters of vehicles in use in the LAC region are less than 10 years old. In fact our analysis suggests that if vehicle safety technologies had been introduced in all new cars at the start of the UN Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011–20), by now there would be approximately 21% fewer traffic deaths in the LAC region, leaving this region much closer to SDG 3.6 of halving traffic deaths by 2020.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【65】KB contributed to the study design and led all aspects of the study, including literature review, acquisition of data, data analysis, and wrote the first draft of the Article.

Tedizolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial drug designed to provide enhanced activity against Gram-positive pathogens. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous to oral tedizolid for treatment of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】ESTABLISH-2 was a randomised, double-blind, phase 3, non-inferiority trial done between Sept 28, 2011, and Jan 10, 2013, at 58 centres in nine countries. Patients (aged ≥12 years) with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections (cellulitis or erysipelas, major cutaneous abscess, or wound infection) that had a minimum lesion area of 75 cm 2 and were suspected or documented to be associated with a Gram-positive pathogen, were randomly assigned (1:1), via an interactive voice-response system with block randomisation, to receive intravenous once-daily tedizolid (200 mg for 6 days) or twice-daily linezolid (600 mg for 10 days), with optional oral step-down. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and type of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection. The primary endpoint was early clinical response (≥20% reduction in lesion area at 48–72 h compared with baseline), with a non-inferiority margin of −10%. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01421511.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】666 patients were randomly assigned to receive tedizolid (n=332) or linezolid (n=334). 283 (85%) patients in the tedizolid group and 276 (83%) in the linezolid group achieved early clinical response (difference 2·6%, 95% CI −3·0 to 8·2), meeting the prespecified non-inferiority margin. Gastrointestinal adverse events were less frequent with tedizolid than linezolid, taking place in 52 (16%) of 331 patients and 67 (20%) of 327 patients in the safety population. Treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug were reported by one (<1%) patient in the tedizolid group and four (1%) patients in the linezolid group.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Intravenous to oral once-daily tedizolid 200 mg for 6 days was non-inferior to twice-daily linezolid 600 mg for 10 days for treatment of patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections. Tedizolid could become a useful option for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections in the hospital and outpatient settings.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Cubist Pharmaceuticals.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

Just two words. But, its meaning yields entire textbooks of prose. Over the past 3 years, _The Lancet Oncology_ has been investigating the drivers of cancer control via a series of Commissions. The first in 2011, addressed how the provision of adequate cancer care is affected by the cost of service delivery and considered the unsustainability of current models. The second, in 2013, covered the broader issues that affect disease prevalence and containment—including political, social, and biological determinants—within the context of Latin America and, in particular, the powerhouse BRIC nation of Brazil. In this issue, we present the third instalment in this series of Commissions, which builds on the issues raised in the previous reports and extends the debate to the other BRIC nations—namely Russia, India, and China. Collectively, these countries cover about 40% of the world's population, experience 46% of all new cancers worldwide, and account for 52% of cancer deaths globally; but on the basis of national wealth, the World Bank ranks them just 45th, 127th, and, 92nd, respectively, indicating a sizable gap between disease burden and ability to afford effective control measures. Additionally, these countries face considerable and unique sociopolitical, cultural, and environmental factors that add extra layers of complexity to the challenges that lie ahead and to their ability to enact change.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【1】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【2】Already registered?\n\n【3】Log in to existing account\n\n【4】Forgot password?\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Not yet registered?\n\n【8】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

On the plus side, Vince Cable and David Willetts—the two ministers responsible for defending funding for research councils and universities—are seen as committed to science. But the fact is that cuts are inevitable, from anywhere between 5% to 20%, some say. The science community is being asked to offer priorities and principles for the government to consider. A worry is that if we do offer ideas for cuts, we (and not ministers) will be blamed for the consequences. So we should talk with the government, but not too much. The day after this sober gathering, I went to Stockholm to watch the school graduation of two newly discovered nephews. The ceremony—Studenten—signifies an intellectual coming of age for a new generation of 18-year-olds. It is marked by family celebrations, many parties, and a few tears. It reminds us of the enormous hopes we invest in the lives of the young. Our obligation is to protect these hopes, not squander them. I wish British ministers had seen 600 young men and women run out of the school in Stockholm, joyous at their achievements, but reflective (and perhaps a little fearful) about their prospects.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

Although his recommendation that the technique should be refined is reasonable, his alternative, that is PTV should be abandoned, is not. Soll's argument is reminiscent of the commentary that arose after the initial HIFI study, which had a negative impact on the development of high-frequency oscillation and underscores the pitfalls of basing conclusions on a meta-analysis in which one large trial with contrary results unduly affects the outcome.\n\n【2】J Baumer and co-workers recruited 924 infants into their trial and reported no positive effect of PTV. Yet we and others have shown significant short-term benefits, including shortened duration of mechanical ventilation, less use of sedatives, fewer complications, and lower costs of care. Thus, the negative results of Baumer's study and another large trial included in Soll's review are surprising and raise questions as to whether suboptimum PTV delivery in the two studies led to the poor outcomes.\n\n【3】We have commented elsewhere on Baumer and colleagues' study but, most importantly, most of the infants in that and all in the Liverpool study were exposed to a pressure-triggering device that might be unsuitable for very preterm infants because of the work necessary to exceed the trigger sensitivity. Thus, a more appropriate recommendation for PTV is, as for all other neonatal management strategies, to be confident that the technique has been perfected before starting large randomised trials.\n\n【4】PTV is being refined, as evidenced by the development of features such as flow-triggering, expiratory sychronisation, volume guarantee, and volume-assured pressure support. Only after the optimum technique and strategy have been identified will the results of a study assessing long-term outcomes be meaningful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

We aimed to integrate the available evidence to create hierarchies of the comparative efficacy, risk of all-cause discontinuation, and major side-effects of antipsychotic drugs.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did a Bayesian-framework, multiple-treatments meta-analysis (which uses both direct and indirect comparisons) of randomised controlled trials to compare 15 antipsychotic drugs and placebo in the acute treatment of schizophrenia. We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's specialised register, Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov for reports published up to Sept 1, 2012. Search results were supplemented by reports from the US Food and Drug Administration website and by data requested from pharmaceutical companies. Blinded, randomised controlled trials of patients with schizophrenia or related disorders were eligible. We excluded trials done in patients with predominant negative symptoms, concomitant medical illness, or treatment resistance, and those done in stable patients. Data for seven outcomes were independently extracted by two reviewers. The primary outcome was efficacy, as measured by mean overall change in symptoms. We also examined all-cause discontinuation, weight gain, extrapyramidal side-effects, prolactin increase, QTc prolongation, and sedation.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We identified 212 suitable trials, with data for 43 049 participants. All drugs were significantly more effective than placebo. The standardised mean differences with 95% credible intervals were: clozapine 0·88, 0·73–1·03; amisulpride 0·66, 0·53–0·78; olanzapine 0·59, 0·53–0·65; risperidone 0·56, 0·50–0·63; paliperidone 0·50, 0·39–0·60; zotepine 0·49, 0·31–0·66; haloperidol 0·45, 0·39–0·51; quetiapine 0·44, 0·35–0·52; aripiprazole 0·43, 0·34–0·52; sertindole 0·39, 0·26–0·52; ziprasidone 0·39, 0·30–0·49; chlorpromazine 0·38, 0·23–0·54; asenapine 0·38, 0·25–0·51; lurasidone 0·33, 0·21–0·45; and iloperidone 0·33, 0·22–0·43. Odds ratios compared with placebo for all-cause discontinuation ranged from 0·43 for the best drug (amisulpride) to 0·80 for the worst drug (haloperidol); for extrapyramidal side-effects 0·30 (clozapine) to 4·76 (haloperidol); and for sedation 1·42 (amisulpride) to 8·82 (clozapine). Standardised mean differences compared with placebo for weight gain varied from −0·09 for the best drug (haloperidol) to −0·74 for the worst drug (olanzapine), for prolactin increase 0·22 (aripiprazole) to −1·30 (paliperidone), and for QTc prolongation 0·10 (lurasidone) to −0·90 (sertindole). Efficacy outcomes did not change substantially after removal of placebo or haloperidol groups, or when dose, percentage of withdrawals, extent of blinding, pharmaceutical industry sponsorship, study duration, chronicity, and year of publication were accounted for in meta-regressions and sensitivity analyses.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Antipsychotics differed substantially in side-effects, and small but robust differences were seen in efficacy. Our findings challenge the straightforward classification of antipsychotics into first-generation and second-generation groupings. Rather, hierarchies in the different domains should help clinicians to adapt the choice of antipsychotic drug to the needs of individual patients. These findings should be considered by mental health policy makers and in the revision of clinical practice guidelines.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】None.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

Since variola virus had no natural reservoir other than humans, the eradication of the virus by use of highly effective vaccines against orthopoxviruses was irreversible. However, other orthopoxviruses have reservoirs in wildlife, such as cowpox virus (in voles), taterapox virus (in African gerbils), and monkeypox virus (in small mammals), do have the potential to spill into the human population and facilitate a restart of the genetic adaptation of the virus to the human host, which once resulted in variola virus. This adaptation is possible by the unique genomic make up of orthopoxviruses and their ability to jumpstart evolution by use of gene loss, rather than by progressive mutation as seen in SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【1】Within orthopoxviruses, a genetic core of about 120 000 base pairs is highly conserved and thought to code for basic viral functions; however, towards the termini the orthopoxvirus genome is plastic, and large regions can be readily deleted 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. These regions contain genes related to host adaption. Orthopoxviruses like variola virus that have adapted to a specific host species tend to lose many terminal host-restriction genes during adaptation 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>, allowing them to spread more easily or cause more severe disease. This loss could optimise both the spread (eg, by droplet-related transmission) via enhanced systemic infection and disease severity.\n\n【2】• View related content for this article\n\n【3】Circulating monkeypox virus might be undergoing adaption for the human host, so we must keep its genetic changes under tight surveillance so as to be prepared when sudden epidemiological changes and prevent the emergence of a variola virus epigone. This surveillance, however, will require a conceptual shift from observing lone single nucleotide polymorphisms, as with SARS-CoV-2 variants, towards watching closely for the integrity and stability of the monkeypox virus genomic termini. Therefore, the constant sequencing of full monkeypox virus genomes is of utmost importance to detect not only single nucleotide polymorphisms but any intragenic frameshifts or premature stop codons, that might indicate initial signals of gene loss. This surveillance, however, requires the highest-quality genomic data and careful annotation. Currently many sequences from the ongoing outbreak are erroneous or do not have annotation, which makes it difficult to establish useful genomic characterisation.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>\n\n【5】删除1-1:<u>For **WHO's monkeypox outbreak situation update** see https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON393</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nSupplementary Material\n----------------------\n删除4:<u>\n*   Download .pdf (.16 MB)</u>\n\n【6】    Help with pdf files\n\n【7】    Supplementary appendix</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This study aims to investigate the effect of medical information on health-care utilisation and expenditure in China based on the supplier-induced demand hypothesis.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Data were derived from the China Labour-force Dynamics Survey (CLDS) done in 2014 using a multistage stratified cluster-random sampling method in 29 provinces in China. Providing information about health-care provision to some patients but not others, we identified 806 informed patients and 22 788 uninformed patients as our analytical sample. Using the coarsened exact matching method to control for confounding factors, we identified the impact of health-care information provision in China on proportion of patients who were outpatients and expenditure in the past 2 weeks as well as proportion of patients who were inpatients and expenditure in the past year. All study procedures were approved by the Health Science Center Ethics Committee at Xi'an Jiaotong University, Shaanxi, China (approval number: 2015-644) and all patients gave written informed consent.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】After coarsened exact matching, although the outpatient rate of uninformed patients seemed to be 0·6% higher than that of informed patients (4·3% \\[95% CI 3·9–4·8\\] _vs_ 3·7% \\[2·3–5·1\\]), and the inpatient rate of uninformed patients seemed to be 1·1% lower than that of informed patients (4·3% \\[3·7–4·6\\] _vs_ 5·3% \\[3·6–6·9\\]), none of these effects were significant.

However, our results highlight the need for policies to address the large outpatient care expenses attributable to medical information asymmetry in the health-care market in China. Creating incentives for providers to provide less health-care services that could be avoided in the process of outpatient services may work well to reduce health-care costs, improve the governance of public hospitals, and institute a stronger regulatory system.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】China Medical Board (15–277), Research Program of Shaanxi Soft Science (2015KRM117), the National high-level talents special support plan (thousands of people plan), Shaanxi provincial youth star of science and technology in 2016 and the Basic Scientific Research Funding of Xi'an Jiaotong University (SK2015007), China Scholarship Council (201706280307 and 201806280021), the US PEPPER Center Scholar Award (P30AG021342), National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Aging (R03AG048920 and K01AG053408).\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

However, studies summarizing the impact of COVID-19 on the perioperative mortality of patients and on the safety of medical staff are lacking.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Chinese database National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) with the search terms “COVID-19″ or “SARS-CoV-2″ and “Surgery” or “Operation” for all published articles on COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 to October 5, 2020.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】A total of 269 patients from 47 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The mean age of operative patients with COVID-19 was 50.91 years, and 49% were female. A total of 28 patients were deceased, with the overall mortality of 6%. All deceased patients had postoperative complications associated with operation or COVID-19, including respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), short of breath, dyspnea, fever, cough, fatigue or myalgia, cardiopulmonary system, shock/infection, acute kidney injury and severe lymphopenia. Patients who presented any or more of the symptoms of respiratory failure, ARDS, short of breath and dyspnea after operation were associated with significantly higher mortality ( _r_ \\= 0.891, _p_ < 0.001), while patients whose symptoms were presented as fever, cough, fatigue or myalgia only demonstrated marginally significant association with postoperative mortality ( _r_ \\= 0.675, _p_ \\= 0.023). Twenty studies reported the information of medical staff infection, and a total of 38 medical staff were infected, and medical staff who used biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) protective equipment did not get infected.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】COVID-19 patients, in particular those with severe respiratory complications, may have high postoperative mortality. Medical staff in close contact with infected patients is suggested to take high level personal protective equipment (PPE).\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Heilongjiang postdoctoral scientific research developmental fund and the National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n【10】</u>Keywords\n--------\n\n【11】*   Surgery\n*   COVID-19\n*   Mortality\n*   Medical staff safety\n*   Personal protective equipment\n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】### Evidence before this study\n\n【14】COVID-19 complicated the postoperative course to increase the mortality of operative patients, and brought serious threats to the safety of medical staff serving operative patients. We searched PubMed for all articles describing the clinical characteristics and outcomes of operative patients with COVID-19 up to October 5 2020, we found only some case reports, however, no studies performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the perioperative mortality of operative patients with COVID-19 and no data related the risk factors for poor outcome.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and CNKI with the search terms “COVID-19″ or “SARS-CoV-2″ and “Surgery” or “Operation” for all published articles on COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 to October 5, 2020. A total of 269 patients from 47 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The mean age of operative patients with COVID-19 was 50.91 years, and 49% were female. A total of 28 patients were deceased, with the overall mortality of 6%. The operative patients who had respiratory complications or COVID-19 typical symptoms may have higher mortality. Twenty studies reported the information of medical staff infection, and a total of 38 medical staff were infected, and medical staff who used biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) protective equipment did not get infected.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】COVID-19 patients may have high postoperative mortality, and postoperative respiratory complications and COVID-19 typical symptoms may be the higher risk factors for poor outcome after operation. Medical staff serving operative patients is at high risks of cross-infection, and effective personal protective procedures can reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection of medical staff.\n\n【19】1\\. Introduction\n----------------\n\n【20】The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic continues to infect a large number of patients, with fever, dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) as major symptoms. These symptoms are also the risk factors for ventilator dependence 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. As of October 5, 2020, over 36,600,000 cases and 1,000,000 deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported in at least 200 countries 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus such as SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 has a lower pathogenicity as compared with SARS-CoV, but has higher pandemic potential 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Respiratory droplets, close contact transmission, and aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment are the major routes of transmission 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Thus, surgical procedures may place clinicians at particularly high risk when caring for infected patients.\n\n【21】Surgical stress may impair cell-mediated immunity to reduce the resistance to viruses. Meanwhile, COVID-19 may complicate the postoperative course to increase the mortality of operative patients 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>, while the major factors contributing to the increased postoperative mortality in patients with COVID-19 remain unelucidated. At present, little is known about the clinical characteristics and outcomes of operative patients with COVID-19 during the perioperative period.\n\n【22】COVID-19 brought serious threats to the safety of medical staff in addition to the general public 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Among medical staff, surgeons, anesthesiologists and operating nursing staff are at the highest risk of infection due to the exposure to respiratory droplets or aerosol from infected patients during airway manipulations and surgery 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. An early report showed that fifteen hospital staff members in Wuhan Union Hospital (China) who had closed contact with infected patients, were confirmed as being infected with COVID-19 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Thus, effective personal protective procedures and cautions should be taken to prevent medical staff from COVID-19 infection. Our knowledge of the protective measures of COVID-19 during the perioperative period is inadequate and limited.\n\n【23】Thus, the present analysis aimed to describe the clinical outcomes of operative patients with COVID-19, and the safety of medical staff during the perioperative period to take appropriate protective measures to avoid cross-infection. It is out hope that our findings of the COVID-19 associated postoperative mortality and reasonable advises will benefit the global community in the battle against COVID-19 infection.\n\n【24】2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\n【25】This meta-analysis was accomplished in agreement with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【26】### 2.1 Search strategy and study selection\n\n【27】We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase and Chinese database National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) with the search terms “COVID-19″ or “SARS-CoV-2″ and “Surgery” or “Operation” for all published articles on COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 to October 5, 2020. Only full articles involving humans were considered. Duplicate results were removed. The remaining articles were screened for relevance by its abstracts independently by two authors (Changshuai Wu and Kun Wang). The remaining investigators (Zhenglian Gao and Xiaowang Zhang) read full selected articles that met the requirements. In addition, closely relevant references to the current research topic were also manually searched. These articles were thoroughly read, and those that fulfilled our criteria were included in the study.\n\n【28】### 2.2 Inclusion/exclusion criteria\n\n【29】The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) research types: randomised controlled trials (RCT), case report and case series; (2) research subjects: patients with COVID-19 underwent surgery and (3) data items: including clinical characteristics, outcomes, or medical staff safety. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) repeated research, and (2) lack of data.\n\n【30】### 2.3 Data extraction\n\n【31】Data extraction was performed independently by two authors (Changshuai Wu and Jian Xu), and we used standardized forms that include first author, publication date, country, number of patients, age, gender, comorbidities, surgery intervention, anesthetic method, surgical difficulty category, medical staff infection, study design, and clinical outcome, and so on. If there was any ambiguity in the search process, the decision was made by a third investigator (Zhengyuan Xia).\n\n【32】The primary outcome was the mortality rate of operative patients with COVID-19 and the secondary outcome was medical staff safety (i.e. the number of medical staff being infected with COVID-19 in the hospital).\n\n【33】### 2.4 Statistical analysis\n\n【34】Statistical analyses were performed using RStudio meta R package (version 3.6.2). Arcsine differences (ASD) were used as the measure of risk differences. The main advantages of using ASD are that the variance of the point estimate is determined solely by the sample size and that it handles occurrences of 0 counts, allowing for incorporation of trials with 0 events in both control and treatment groups into meta analyses 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.The combined prevalence and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random effects model or fixed effects model. The selection of the model was determined according to Q statistics. When Q statistics ( _p_ < 0.10) indicated heterogeneity, the random effect model was utilized for meta-analysis. When Q statistics ( _p_ ≥ 0.10) indicated the lack of heterogeneity, then a fixed-effect model was utilized for meta-analysis. Spearman's rank correlation was used to analyze the correlations among preoperative comorbidities, age, postoperative complications and the mortality rate.\n\n【35】Sensitivity analysis by leave-one-out was performed to single out heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Q statistic test and the I 2 test. The I 2 statistic measured the percentage of total variation across the studies aroused from clinical or methodological heterogeneity rather than by chance. The Egger test was performed to assess publication bias in all literature works, and _p_ < 0.05 was considered as the exist of publication bias, and the funnel plot showed the publication bias intuitively.\n删除5:<u>\n### 2.5 Role of the funding source\n\n【36】The funding agencies had no role in study design, data collection and analysis. The corresponding authors have full access to all data in the study and are fully responsible for the decision of submitting for publication.\n\n【37】</u>3\\. Results\n-----------\n\n【38】### 3.1 Study selection and demographical characteristics\n\n【39】Using the above selection criteria, we identified a total of 1426 records, and 574 papers remained after exclusion of irrelevant topics and duplicates. Of those, a total of 66 citations met the inclusion criteria and remained for title and abstract screening. Four of these 66 items did not have a full text. After assessing 62 full-text articles for eligibility, we further excluded 15 full-text articles due to the exist of one of the following reasons: 1) no operative patients (8 articles) or relevant data (5 articles), and 2) review articles (2 articles). Eventually, 47 studies were included in this meta-analysis, and the trial selection process was shown in Fig. 1 .\n\n【40】Fig. 1 Diagram of documents retrieval.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【41】### 3.2 Characteristics of studies\n\n【42】The characteristics of included trials were presented in Table 1 .

Discussion\n--------------\n\n【61】The main focus of this study was to investigate the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery, and the related risk factors of the death during the perioperative period. We found that operative patients with COVID-19 infection had higher rate of mortality and the occurrence of postoperative complications. In particular, respiratory failure/ARDS/short of breath/dyspnea or fever/ cough/fatigue or myalgia were significantly associated with postoperative death in patients with COVID-19. Twenty-eight of the 269 operative patients died of operation or COVID-19 associated complications, the overall mortality rate was 6%, with a mortality rate much higher than the 1.8–4.5% postoperative mortality in ASA-III patients as reported 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Most of the deceased patients had complications associated with COVID-19 symptom and respiratory syndrome. The patient's immune function is a major determinant of the disease severity, and surgical stress may not only impair immune function 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, but also induce systemic inflammatory response 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The immune suppression after surgery should have exacerbated the progression and severity of COVID-19 infection. Most of those patients quickly present with typical symptoms such as fever, dry cough, fatigue or myalgia. COVID-19 can cause quick deterioration of lung function because the lung is the main target organ of the virus. In our study, the majority of patients rapidly developed respiratory failure/ARDS/short of breath/ dyspnea, which rendered them vulnerable to death. This is consistent with the findings of Chen et al.'s study who showed that 17% patients developed ARDS and, among them, 11% patients' condition worsened in a short period of time and died of MOF 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【62】In addition to cause the progression to respiratory syndrome, COVID-19 disease also impairs other organ functions (e.g. heart, kidneys, liver) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In our study, patients developed cardiac injury/cardiopulmonary arrest/arrhythmia/palpitation, acute kidney injury, diarrhea and even MOF. Furthermore, several patients rapidly progressed to shock/coma/secondary infection/sepsis that were concomitant with severe lymphopenia and electrolyte disturbance. This is consistent with the findings of Lei et al.'s study who showed that the most common complications of patients in non-survivors included shock, hyperleukocytemia, and lymphopenia 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Thus, operative patients with COVID-19 infection have higher perioperative mortality 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>.\n\n【63】Medical staff serving operative patients is at high risks of the cross-infection. The availability and especially proper utilization of valuable personal protective equipment (PPE) are of utmost importance. Clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Alternative therapeutic approaches should be pursued, especially in very early - or very advanced-stage diseases. Turaga et al.'s study found that most cancer surgeries can be safely delayed beyond the current waiting time for at least 4 weeks without having a significant impact on patient survival or cancer progression 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Timely treatment of urgent cases with COVID-19 infection and the optimal of the protection of medical staff should both be taken into serious consideration. During a pandemic, it is essential to ensure emergency surgery care. If non-operative management failed and surgery is deemed necessary, appropriate PPE and precautions should be adopted, and surgery should not be delayed whilst waiting for the swab results 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. The decision and plan to recognize whether surgery is required should be conducted by a senior clinician with the experienced surgeon, anaesthetist and infection control experts 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【64】The protection level of the surgical gowns depends on the type of procedure 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. An filtering face pieces (FFP) 2 mask filters 94% of all particles that are 0.3 mm in diameter or larger; while N95 masks block 95% and FFP3 masks block 99% 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. A class 2 or 3 FFP face mask should be worn when working in close contact with patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, and only to use surgical face masks in a crisis scenario of shortage of FFP 2 and 3 respirators 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Airborne transmission risks are high during aerosol generating procedures such as laparoscopy, endoscopy and tracheal incubation to exposure patients' oropharynx and airway secretions with a high viral load 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. We suggest that surgical team members, including anesthesiologists, surgeons and operating nursing staff should ware highly protective levels of PPE when treating patients known to have been infected with COVID-19 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Most recent information from Italy reported that 12% of healthcare workers were infected at the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, and this incidence was greatly reduced when PPE was used properly and infection control measures were followed 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In our analysis, 38 medical staff were infected as reported in 20 studies, while medical staff who used biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) protective equipment did not get infected. Thus, implementation of strict protections for medical staff is essential to decrease the cross-infection risks. Additionally, the choice between laparoscopy and laparotomy as a surgical approach needs to be cautious. Laparoscopy is an option but a potential risk of aerosol exposure must be considered for SARS-CoV-2 even though there is not current demonstration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in the surgical smoke 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>, but aerosolization of blood born viruses has been previously detected in surgical smoke during laparoscopy 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. For critically ill patients with lung dysfunction, sepsis or shock, open surgery is advised 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Special care must be taken to reduce smoke formation (e.g. lowering electrocautery power settings, using bipolar electrocautery, using electrocautery or ultrasonic scalpels parsimoniously), and to limit smoke dispersal or spillage from trocars (e.g. lowering the pneumoperitoneum pressure) in the OR 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Pneumoperitoneum and surgical smoke should be evacuated only using a direct suction connected to a vacuum suction unit 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【65】To minimize infectious risk to medical staff during the perioperative period, detailed protective strategies have been proposed as briefly outlined below. Based on clinical information and expert recommendation, all elective cases are suggested to be canceled, with the focus to maintain only emergency operations and elective cancer surgeries 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. A negative pressure isolation transfer cabin is recommended for staff wearing BSL-3 protective medical equipment to transport patients 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Ideally, it seems necessary to create specific transfer pathways, and patients be transferred directly to the operating room (OR), without stopping at the pre-operation or post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) areas. It is also suggested that BSL-3 protective medical equipment should be worn, including N95 masks, goggles, protective suits, face shields, caps, shoe covers, and gloves 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Furthermore, all staff should take a training course on PPE use 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. A negative pressure (below - 4.7 Pa) OR must be established, preferably isolated from the main surgical theaters and with a separate ventilation system 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. A checklist should be used for preparation and incubation, and enough time should be allocated for the preparation of airway equipment. It is recommended that one experienced anesthetist to deliver 100% O 2 manually for 3–5 min and videolaryngoscopy be used to perform rapid sequence induction 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. It is further recommended to use a high-quality HMEF (Heat and Moisture Exchange Filter) between the face mask and breathing circuit. Medical staff should use fast-drying hand antiseptics and change gloves immediately after contacting a patient, body fluids or contaminated materials 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Anesthetic equipment must be used by one person only and the anesthesia machine be strictly disinfected 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. All protective gear should be disposed of properly. When using electrocautery devices during surgery, it is necessary to adjust to the lowest effective power in order to reduce the amount of surgical smoke 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Surgical smoke and pneumoperitoneum should be evacuated only using a direct suction connected to a vacuum suction unit 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Smoke evacuation electrosurgical devices should be used to minimize medical staff's exposure to surgical smoke. Postoperative patients should preferably recover in an isolation room with negative pressure when resources permitting in the PACU or intensive care unit (ICU). If negative pressure isolation rooms are unavailable, it is recommended to let the patients to recover in the OR prior to being transfer to a single patient room. Postoperatively, the anesthesia workstation needs to be disinfected for 2 h with an anesthesia circuit sterilizer (containing 12% hydrogen peroxide) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, and the next operation must be performed beyond 2 h after the completion of the disinfection 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. In particular, COVID-19 patients’ specimens should be clearly labeled and handled as infectious specimens for treatment by the pathology department 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【66】Our meta-analysis has several limitations. First, our analysis was based on a small number of cases and the data availability for several parameters, such as medical staff infection. Second, it should be noted that some articles did not clearly provide information regarding the type of surgery and the kinds of post-operative complications, nor did they describe the detailed symptoms of COVID-19, and thus the number of patients in these studies could not be used for the calculation of the total number or percentage of patients included in each of the 4° of surgical difficulties, and also not suitable for the correlation analysis in relation to the severity of COVID symptoms. Lastly, among of 47 studies in this meta-analysis, 26 articles were mainly from China, and the other 21 articles were from the United States and Europe. This imbalance of sources increased the possibility of publication bias. Most of the included studies were case reports or case series, which may affect the representativeness of the results. Therefore, large sample and/or multicenter trials are needed to further explore the perioperative mortality rate of operative patients with COVID-19 and in particular the factors that have highest impact on the perioperative mortality or medical staff infection.\n\n【67】In summary, we found that operative patients with COVID-19 have high mortality rate, and that postoperative COVID-19 symptom and related respiratory complications were significantly associated with the death of operative patients. Medical staff who have closed contact with infected patients are at the highest potential risk of infection. Thus, it is urgently needed to apply standard measures to actively deal with postoperative complications of patients with COVID-19 in order to reduce the mortality rate, and to provide effective protection and safe environment to avoid the cross-infection during the perioperative period.\n\n【68】Declaration of Interests\n------------------------\n\n【69】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests associated with this work.</u>\n\n【70】### Contributors\n\n【71】Kun Wang and Zhengyuan Xia had the idea for the study.

Patients with monogenic IBD frequently experience extremely early onset of treatment-refractory disease, with complex extraintestinal disease typical of immunodeficiency. Since more than 100 monogenic disorders can present with IBD, new genetic disorders and variants are being discovered every year, and as phenotypic expression of the gene defects is variable, adaptive genomic technologies are required. Monogenic IBD has become a key area to establish the concept of precision medicine. Clear guidance and standardised, affordable applications of genomic technologies are needed to implement exome or genome sequencing in clinical practice. This joint British Society of Gastroenterology and British Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guideline aims to ensure that testing resources are appropriately applied to maximise the benefit to patients on a national scale, minimise health-care disparities in accessing genomic technologies, and optimise resource use. We set out the structural requirements for genomic medicine as part of a multidisciplinary team approach. Initiation of genomic diagnostics should be guided by diagnostic criteria for the individual patient, in particular the age of IBD onset and the patient's history, and potential implications for future therapies. We outline the diagnostic care pathway for paediatric and adult patients. This guideline considers how to handle clinically actionable findings in research studies and the impact of consumer-based genomics for monogenic IBD. This document was developed by multiple stakeholders, including UK paediatric and adult gastroenterology physicians, immunologists, transplant specialists, clinical geneticists, scientists, and research leads of UK genetic programmes, in partnership with patient representatives of several IBD and rare disease charities.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【2】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【3】Already registered?\n\n【4】Log in to existing account\n\n【5】Forgot password?\n\n【6】One-time access price info\n\n【7】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【8】Not yet registered?\n\n【9】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, easy access to cheap alcohol is only part of the problem.\n\n【1】Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the leading cause of liver dysfunction in the west; a recent prospective study from the USA showed a prevalence of 46% for NAFLD and 12% for steatohepatitis in an asymptomatic cohort. UK levels of alcohol consumption do not fully explain the rise in liver mortality, and the high prevalence of obesity (22% of men and 24% of women aged 16 years or older) is likely to have contributed. Moreover, there is evidence of synergism between the effects of alcohol consumption and obesity on the incidence of liver disease.\n\n【2】If we are to achieve the proposed target of reducing liver deaths to about four per 100 000, we need effective policies to reduce both harmful drinking and obesity. Furthermore, there is currently a disparity between the treatment of patients with alcoholic liver disease and those with NAFLD. To be considered for transplantation, those with alcoholic liver disease must achieve abstinence and undergo psychological assessment. Those with NAFLD are encouraged to lose weight but the listing requirements are far less stringent. Conversely, the extra psychological support afforded to those with alcoholic liver disease is likely to contribute to its lower post-transplant recurrence rate.\n\n【3】Food addiction is not so different from alcohol addiction and perhaps we should consider these lifestyle-induced liver diseases on a more equal footing.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>I declare that I have no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Advanced liver disease is the second leading cause of premature mortality and years of working life lost in the UK, higher than that observed for patients with lung and breast cancer, stroke, and diabetes. Evidence has shown that early provision of palliative care can lead to improvements in quality of life and physical and psychological symptom burden with the potential for reduced health-care use and even improved survival for patients with serious illnesses. In 2015, the second report of the _Lancet_ Standing Commission on Liver Disease in the UK recommended that clinicians caring for patients with liver disease should “have parallel roles in prolonging life through optimum disease-focused treatment and in providing high-quality palliative care for those whose lives cannot be saved.”\n\n【1】Despite these recommendations, considerable inequity remains in the provision of palliative care and symptom-based management for patients with advanced liver disease compared with patients with other serious illnesses. Only 30% of patients with advanced liver disease are referred to specialist palliative or hospice care, often only in the last few days of life, once arduous hospital-based interventions have been exhausted. In England, approximately 70% of deaths secondary to liver disease (rising to 80% for alcohol-related liver disease) occur in hospital, compared with less than 40% of deaths secondary to cancer and other chronic conditions such as lung disease. Although a slight increase was reported in the proportion of patients with alcohol-related liver disease who died at home (23%) in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with previous years, more than 70% of deaths from alcohol-related liver disease in England still occurred in hospital 删除2:<u>(appendix)</u>. Death at home might be the option preferred by some patients as it allows them and their caregivers to be in familiar surroundings, eliminates the need for unnecessary invasive interventions, and puts patients in control. However, not all patients with advanced liver disease might prefer to die at home, especially if they are socially isolated.\n\n【2】Barriers to the provision of palliative care in advanced liver disease are diverse and complex and include fluctuating disease trajectory and prognostic uncertainty; unrealistic hope of a liver transplant; perceived incompatibility of transplantation and palliative care; provider reluctance to initiate palliative care discussions, as these are often misconstrued as stopping active treatment; shortage of palliative care specialists; and inadequate training at undergraduate and postgraduate level. Patients with advanced liver disease are often medically and socially disenfranchised and can experience complex psychosocial issues, including addiction and stigma, which might lead to reduced health-care seeking behaviours and allocation of resources. Additionally, a scarcity of evidence-based interventions is an important contributory factor to suboptimal palliative care in advanced liver disease.\n\n【3】To avert worsening outcomes for this already vulnerable population, ongoing investment by stakeholders, including funders, is imperative to support research that will address current inequities in palliative care provision. Despite a lack of emphasis on palliative care in earlier guidelines, UK and US national bodies have recently recommended the need for palliative interventional trials in advanced liver disease. Ascites remains the most common cirrhosis complication that necessitates hospitalisation. Therefore, managing patients with advanced cirrhosis often involves optimising debilitating ascites-related symptoms. In the UK, funding was obtained in February, 2022, for a national trial comparing palliative long-term abdominal drains with repeated hospital ascites drainage in patients with refractory ascites due to advanced liver disease (REDUCe 2 study, ISRCTN26993825). In the USA, the ongoing PAL-LIVER trial (NCT03540771) is a comparative effectiveness study of hepatologist-led versus specialist-led consultative palliative care for ambulatory patients with advanced liver disease. These trials will provide important data on the potential for palliative care interventions to improve outcomes for patients with advanced liver disease.\n\n【4】Initiatives are also needed to increase the number of palliative care specialists. An increased focus has been given to the training of both medical students and specialist trainees in palliative and supportive care via several initiatives, which include emphasis on palliative care during gastroenterology training and the Association for Palliative Medicine Special Interest Forum for Undergraduate Medical Education. Additionally, the number of hepatologists and palliative care physicians with an interest in this area is increasing. In England, this led to the establishment of the British Association for Study of the Liver End of Life Specialist Interest Group in 2017. Improved joint working between hepatology and palliative care can only enhance the end-of-life care experiences of patients with advanced liver disease. Dame Cicely Saunders, who is widely recognised as the founder of the hospice movement, aptly stated “You matter because you are you, and you matter to the end of your life. We will do all we can not only to help you die peacefully, but also to live until you die.”\n\n【5】删除9:<u>Rocket Medical are supplying the long-term drains for the REDUCe 2 study, for which SV is chief investigator.

It is caused by the protozoan _Trypanosoma cruzi_ , which was identified in the first decade of the 20th century. Once acute infection resolves, patients can develop chronic disease, which in up to 30–40% of cases is characterised by cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, megaviscera, and, more rarely, polyneuropathy and stroke. Even after more than a century, many challenges remain unresolved, since epidemiological control and diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic methods must be improved. In particular, the efficacy and tolerability profile of therapeutic agents is far from ideal. Furthermore, the population affected is older and more complex (eg, immunosuppressed patients and patients with cancer). Nevertheless, in recent years, our knowledge of Chagas disease has expanded, and the international networking needed to change the course of this deadly disease during the 21st century has begun.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

Nellie Bristol reports.\n\n【1】Health advocates for the poverty-stricken Mississippi Delta in southern USA have spent millions of dollars over the years attempting to address seemingly intractable health issues disproportionately affecting the region's African-American population. Now a group is turning to an unlikely source for a model of primary care provision: the health house programme of rural Iran.\n\n【2】Established in the early 1980s, the model uses community health workers to track villagers' health, and provide basic care and health education. Trusted workers chosen from the community help patients connect with appropriate high-level services when needed. The programme has bolstered the health status of Iran's rural population and garnered high praise internationally.\n\n【3】Continuous monitoring and support, and a community-based link to the fragmented US health-care system is just what the Delta needs as well, say health house advocates. The present system has failed the rural region for decades. Saddled with a long history of discrimination and unemployment, more than 20% of the population is uninsured, and rates of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and infant mortality are among the highest in the country. Many residents have no access to regular care and turn to the hospital emergency room when they need attention.\n\n【4】Aaron Shirley is a long-time champion of health care for the Delta and chair of the Jackson Medical Mall Foundation, supporting a facility that attends to Mississippi's underserved population. He is leader of the health houses initiative. Critical to its success, he said, is community involvement in both designing the programme and implementing it. “You've got to know the Mississippi Delta. There's a distrust factor. But this \\[programme\\] is from the ground up”, says Shirley. “You'd be surprised at the response that we're getting starting with the people and saying ‘here's an idea, what do you think about it’ rather than going in and saying ‘here's what we're going to do’”, he added. “They've had a lot of that.”\n\n【5】Delta health houses, like those in Iran, will employ members of the community to serve as health workers. They will bridge the divide between public health and clinical medicine, tracking individual household's health status and serving as advocates to improve living conditions including water quality and access to healthy food. They will help patients to negotiate the complex medical system, and follow physician instructions. The group initially will train workers with at least a high school education using the equivalent of nursing assistant certification, but hopes to develop an expanded curriculum with increased focus on community issues and even disaster preparedness.\n\n【6】Shirley and others are seeking US$30 million to begin supporting up to 15 health houses in the Delta region. With tight budgets in Washington, and reticence to adopt a model from a country in extreme disfavour in the USA, funding is an uphill battle. But the group is moving ahead with a pilot project in a donated building in Greenwood, MS. In addition to serving as a headquarters for the health workers, James Miller, another advocate for the project and managing director of Oxford International Development Group in Oxford, MS, says the building will be a meeting place for healthy activities, and will house exercise equipment and blood pressure monitors.\n\n【7】With health reform faltering in Congress, provision of community-based primary care for underserved populations will be paramount in the USA, both to improve access and cut costs. The use of community health workers like those in the Delta project, long a staple in global health programmes, is becoming more widely recognised and supported in the USA. According to Carl Rush, a community health expert based in San Antonio, TX, more states, insurers, hospitals, and the federal government are realising the value of the workers. They enhance disease prevention, ensure adequate prenatal care to prevent low birthweights, and encourage patient follow-up to reduce hospital readmissions.\n\n【8】Advocates hope turning to Iran as an unlikely ally in the promotion of rural primary health will finally start to meet the needs of the Delta population. “This is a human disaster that's been hitting here for decades”, says Miller.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【9】### Publication history\n\n【10】Published: 20 February 2010\n\n【11】### Identification\n\n【12】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60250-4</u>\n\n【13】### Copyright\n\n【14】© 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Wairagala Wakabi reports.\n\n【1】Amid continued fighting that has forced many health workers to flee Somalia or desert their work stations, WHO is sending surgeons to some of the most dangerous parts of the country to train local doctors in surgery and trauma management. Hundreds of health workers have already been trained in this initiative, which addresses crucial skills shortages in one of the world's most desperate places.\n\n【2】Between March 21–26, 2010, WHO provided on-the-job training in trauma management and emergency obstetric care to 33 clinical staff (nine physicians, 11 nurses, and 13 midwives) at Banadir Hospital in the capital Mogadishu. The training was in response to escalating conflict in the city, where more than 700 conflict-related injuries and 30 deaths were reported at the three main hospitals during the first 3 weeks of March.\n\n【3】The two-decades civil war in Somalia has left the health system in tatters, with few doctors and insufficient medical supplies. Health workers often lack specialised training in trauma management and rarely receive additional training for medical and surgical advances. The recent flare-up in the conflict placed an additional burden on the already weak health system. With escalating levels of trauma, services were being stretched to the limit.\n\n【4】“The thing is that there is continuous insecurity, which comes with movements of internally displaced people (IDPs). And you find that health workers are among the IDPs, so the number of health workers starts to decrease”, Omar Saleh, the WHO surgeon who heads the training, explained to _The Lancet._ “There is a big shortage of manpower. Besides, although the doctors in Somalia are very good, medicine, surgery, and trauma management are always evolving, \\[and\\] many of the doctors in Somalia are not updated.”\n\n【5】Banadir Hospital, where last month's training took place, used to be the national referral hospital for maternity care but from early this year it has registered an influx of casualties from the conflict. That necessitated training its staff, as well as those from other hospitals in the area, in trauma management. Nearly 1000 wounded people went to hospitals in the Mogadishu area as a result of the fighting in March, according to the UN.\n\n【6】Health staff are also at risk of death and injury amid the violence. On Dec 3, 2009, Somalia's health minister, along with other officials of the interim government and graduating students at Banadir University's medical school, were among 19 people killed in a bomb attack in Mogadishu.\n\n【7】Saleh said that when in December, 2009, they did the training at Buale Hospital, they received about 200 patients everyday with illness such as malnutrition, tuberculosis, trauma, and bullet wounds. WHO surgeons demonstrated surgical procedures such as removing benign tumours and bullets from children and adults. The training by WHO started in 2007. So far, more than 20 surgeons and 300 other health workers have been trained.\n\n【8】Marthe Everard, WHO representative to Somalia, said that there are about 250 doctors in Somalia, including 50 who are newly graduated from Mogadishu's Banadir University. There are 861 qualified nurses, 116 midwives, and 1412 health facility auxiliaries and technicians serving 8·5 million people. “Training is crucial as it strengthens the skill levels of the very health staff who see on almost a daily basis victims of the conflict, as well as women needing emergency obstetric care”, said Everard.\n\n【9】“In an unstable and unsafe environment such as Somalia, medical staff in the few remaining hospitals are under a lot of pressure”, Valery Sasin, coordinator of the medical activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Somalia, said in a statement released on March 31, 2010. “When fighting breaks out, they have to deal with a massive influx of patients with very limited resources. You need to be thoroughly trained to be able to do your job as a surgeon in such harsh working conditions, adding to the stress and danger associated with a conflict zone.”\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 17 April 2010\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60561-2</u>\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

He was born in Marple near Manchester, UK, on Aug 17, 1925 and died in London, UK, on Dec 27, 2022 aged 97 years.\n\n【2】In 1956, as a registrar at St Mary's Hospital in London, UK, and intent on a career in cardiology, Kenneth Bagshawe encountered a patient with severe breathing difficulties caused by occlusion of the pulmonary vascular bed. This woman died 3 days later. The pathologist who did a subsequent autopsy recognised her illness as choriocarcinoma. Intrigued by this uncommon disease of which he knew little, Bagshawe started reading about it. His interest was reinforced a few months later when he met another patient with what he thought was the same disease. Colleagues were sceptical. The key test for choriocarcinoma—an increased production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)—was at that time cumbersome and time consuming. Bagshawe had to propose a possible alternative diagnosis to persuade the hospital pathology laboratory to perform the test. When done, it showed a high concentration of hCG. By now fascinated with choriocarcinoma, Bagshawe decided to change specialty. It was a propitious move. “He was one of two or three people who introduced the field of medical oncology to the UK”, says Professor Gordon Rustin, retired consultant medical oncologist at Mount Vernon Cancer Centre in Middlesex, UK. “He basically established it as a subspecialty in this country”, adds Michael Seckl, Professor of Molecular Cancer Medicine at Imperial College London, UK. Bagshawe's career prospered and he went on to become Professor of Medical Oncology at London's then Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School.\n\n【3】Bagshawe had begun his higher education in 1942 at the London School of Economics and Political Science, UK, but left a year later for war service in the Royal Navy. On demobilisation in 1946, he opted not for economics but medicine, graduating from the then St Mary's Hospital Medical School in 1952. After working as a junior doctor in various London hospitals and a fellowship in the USA at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, Bagshawe rejoined St Mary's Hospital and began the work that led to him becoming an oncologist. He moved to the then Charing Cross Hospital, was appointed Director of its new Department of Medical Oncology in 1964, and remained there. He was awarded his chair in 1987, and became Emeritus in 1990.\n\n【4】The second of Bagshawe's two original patients with choriocarcinoma survived. “Cytotoxic drugs had just become available”, says former colleague Richard Begent, now Emeritus Professor of Oncology at University College London, UK. “She \\[the patient\\] had been in an oxygen tent. Within 3 days she was sitting up and eating her breakfast.She may have been the first patient in Europe to be treated with cytotoxic drugs.” With the facilities available to him at Charing Cross Hospital, Bagshawe began assessing the value of mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and other drugs used singly or in combination. “He devised the first chemotherapy regimen that really made an impact on the disease”, says Rustin. “He completely revolutionised the treatment of choriocarcinoma…He was also instrumental in advances in the management of testicular cancer.” Bagshawe was aware of the pressing need for better methods of measuring patients' hCG concentrations, not only for diagnosis but in monitoring the progress of their disease. During his year in the USA Bagshawe had acquired a knowledge of immunology. “He became interested in the radioimmunoassay of hCG,” says Begent. “He developed machines to automate it, and then set up a company to make them.” As Seckl adds, “He'd realised that immunology was an important asset in cancer… and built a group of people around him that could address the multiple questions that arise in treating it.”\n\n【5】“Ken had a huge enthusiasm to explore things, and an enquiring mind”, says Rustin. “He'd realised he was on a pathway that hadn't been trodden before….\\[He saw that\\] the developments in cancer were going to come from the laboratory, so he knew he had to have a foot firmly in the lab. And he understood the science.” Begent describes working with Bagshawe as a unique experience. “We felt that this was not like ordinary medicine, it was war.删除1-1:<u> \\[Ken\\] had been an officer on a motor torpedo boat in the war.and he seemed to retain his military attitude.</u> He was going to get this cancer, come what may.” A very determined man, Seckl adds. “But he was pretty modest about his achievements.” Bagshawe leaves a wife, cancer biologist Surinder Sharma, and children James and Janita from a previous marriage.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: 25 February 2023\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00360-4</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

In eight of the 13 countries with the most neonatal deaths (55% worldwide), we undertook a systematic assessment of bottlenecks to essential maternal and newborn health care, involving more than 600 experts. Of 2465 bottlenecks identified, common constraints were found in all high-burden countries, notably regarding the health workforce, financing, and service delivery. However, bottlenecks for specific interventions might differ across similar health systems. For example, the implementation of kangaroo mother care was noted as challenging in the four Asian country workshops, but was regarded as a feasible aspect of preterm care by respondents in the four African countries. If all high-burden countries achieved the neonatal mortality rates of their region's fastest progressing countries, then the mortality goal of ten or fewer per 1000 livebirths by 2035 recommended in this Series and the Every Newborn Action Plan would be exceeded. We therefore examined fast progressing countries to identify strategies to reduce neonatal mortality. We identified several key factors: (1) workforce planning to increase numbers and upgrade specific skills for care at birth and of small and ill newborn babies, task sharing, incentives for rural health workers; (2) financial protection measures, such as expansion of health insurance, conditional cash transfers, and performance-based financing; and (3) dynamic leadership including innovation and community empowerment. Adapting from the 2005 _Lancet_ Series on neonatal survival and drawing on this Every Newborn Series, we propose a country-led, data-driven process to sharpen national health plans, seize opportunities to address the quality gap for care at birth and care of small and ill newborn babies, and systematically scale up care to reach every mother and newborn baby, particularly the poorest.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【2】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【3】Already registered?\n\n【4】Log in to existing account\n\n【5】Forgot password?\n\n【6】One-time access price info\n\n【7】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【8】Not yet registered?\n\n【9】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

A pathogenic role for complement in anti-HMGCR-positive and anti-SRP-positive immune-mediated necrotising myopathy has been inferred from sarcolemmal deposits of membrane attack complex (MAC) and their correlation with fibre necrosis. Diffuse, prominent sarcolemmal deposition of MAC on non-necrotic fibres is an early feature of immune-mediated necrotising myopathy, and the extent of deposition correlates with disease severity. The detection of complement C1q and IgG in proximity to the sarcolemma supports a role for antibody-mediated activation of the classical complement pathway in myonecrosis. Immunomodulatory treatments that are effective in the management of pathogenically distinct subsets of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and are used by extrapolation in people with immune-mediated necrotising myopathy, have led to incomplete muscle recovery, with many people having persistent disabling weakness. A pressing need exists for more effective treatments for people with immune-mediated necrotising myopathy.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet Rheumatology_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

These patients were compared to 38 controls from the pre-COVID era matched for gestational age, fetal sex, and field strength of the MRI scanner. Both omicron- (n = 18) and pre-omicron infected (n = 20) females had more frequent glandular placenta, and more frequent placenta lobulation and placental hemorrhage than controls. Fetal growth retardation was found in a quarter of the pre-omicron cases. The study is excellent but raises concerns that should be discussed.\n\n【3】The main limitation of the study is that no evidence of infection of the placenta or fetus with SARS-CoV-2 or immunological responses was provided. No RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was performed on the placenta or fetus, nor were fetal antibodies determined to confirm transmission of the virus to the fetus. It is therefore questionable whether the MRI abnormalities found in the placenta or fetus were really due to a SARS-CoV-2 infection or due to other causes. Whether there is actually vertical transmission of the virus from mother to child is hotly debated. Some studies provided evidence of vertical transmission, others did not. In a study of 47 new-borns born to SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers, only four were SARS-CoV-2 positive. Vertical transmission to the infant may depend on the degree of placental damage by the virus. In utero infection of the fetus can be symptomatic or asymptomatic.\n\n【4】Another limitation of the study is that controls and infected females were not matched for comorbidities, current medication, and family history. Different comorbidities, different current medications, and different family histories can greatly influence placental and fetal morbidity. For example, it is not mentioned how many of the SARS-CoV-2 infected were smokers and non-smokers. No mention is made how other viral, bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections (e.g. toxoplasmosis) that could be responsible for the abnormalities detected were ruled out. No mention is made how many previously had diabetes, gestational diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, or hereditary coagulation disorders.\n\n【5】Another argument against a causal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and placental or fetal abnormalities is the long latency between the first positive RT-PCR and fetal MRI. Given the mean latency of 83 days, it is conceivable that placental and fetal MRI abnormalities developed long after the mother's SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore may not have caused the placental or fetal pathology.\n\n【6】Since the observational period covered the period from 7/2020 to 7/2022, it is also conceivable that at least some of the included SARS-CoV-2 infected females were vaccinated. We should know how many were vaccinated, how many doses they received, and whether there were fewer placental or fetal abnormalities among the vaccinated versus unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 infected females.\n\n【7】Considering that at least placental abnormalities were due to arterial or venous thrombosis, it is crucial that D-dimer values were provided and an explanation was given as to why thrombosis occurred only in placental vessels and not in other vascular beds.\n\n【8】We disagree with the general conclusion that the pre-omicron variant caused more severe placental pathology than omicron variants. The number of included patients infected with pre-omicron variants (n = 20) and with omicron variants (n = 18) is too small to draw such general conclusions.\n\n【9】The legend of panels A and D in figure 3 is insufficient. Hypointensity on T2 does not necessarily mean bleeding. Differentials diagnoses of hypointensities on T2 that should be ruled out include gadolinium-based contrast materials, melanin, mucous- or protein-containing lesions, dense cellular lesions, lesions containing iron, calcium, or copper, turbulent or rapid blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, and aerated spaces. We also should know if “blood sensitive sequences” means susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI). Regarding the intrauterine ischemic stroke in one fetus and the intracerebral bleeding in another case, we should know whether both patients manifested clinically postpartum with the typical stigmata of a cerebral vascular lesion.\n\n【10】Overall, the interesting study has limitations that call the results and their interpretation into question. Clarifying these weaknesses would strengthen the conclusions and could improve the study. Before SARS-CoV-2 is held responsible for placental or fetal damage due to thrombosis or endothelial damage to placental vessels, the causative agent or immunological reactions in the placenta or fetus must be proven.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【11】J.F. design, literature search, discussion, first draft, critical comments, final approval.\n\n【12】Declaration of interests\n------------------------\n\n【13】The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n【14】Acknowledgements\n----------------\n\n【15】Funding: no funding was received.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Nor am I only interested in pharmaceuticals, any more than I would presume Klim McPherson and colleagues to have no interests in life beyond their job titles. I share the view that obesity has many interrelated causes, prevention is key, and governments have a large role to play. I am not convinced we needed 2 years of Foresight research to tell us that.\n\n【1】The document did indeed receive media coverage, including from me, but could have generated still greater quantity and value had it been clearer and more far-sighted in its conclusions. I did not intend to turn readers away with my Comment. I encourage them to read the report and judge for themselves the obesity system map, which looks more like a spilled plate of spaghetti than anything of use to policymakers. Scientists struggle to model accurately very precise biological mechanisms, so how is it possible to measure (or use with any confidence) a purported 4·5–5 out of 5 link between such vague terms as “effort to increase efficiency of production” and “desire to maximise volume”; or to correlate “TV watching” with “tendency to graze”, but not at all with “alcohol consumption”?\n\n【2】If David King's 250 Foresight “scientists, health professionals…and policymakers” cannot come up with “specific integrated policies”, we ought to change the participants. Despite his claim that this is instead a job for government, Foresight's own official website says its aim is to “identify effective interventions”. One senior scientist told me officials prevented him from writing more precise advice. A panel without such power seems of limited use. And if “the evidence for successful prevention strategies is limited”, maybe the money already spent on Foresight should have gone to studying such pilot policies and launching new ones to speed up understanding.\n\n【3】As to “guesstimates” on the costs of obesity, I was simply expressing scepticism about the accuracy of all such long-term forecasts, which catch journalists' eyes but would be valuably supplemented by clearer policy advice. If, in 2050, the costs of obesity to the UK National Health Service really run to £6 billion (I suspect they will be much higher), I will eat the entire Foresight report, unpalatable though it is.

In response, I describe my experience with mass epidural blocks for Gujarat earthquake victims in India, at Civil and Lion's Hospital, Mehsana district.\n\n【2】Most of the patients had pelvic and lower-limb fractures and were in much pain and shock and were waiting for operations. I proposed the possibility of giving mass continuous epidural block, which gave instant pain relief and was subsequently used for surgery as well as for postoperative pain relief for the next 24–48 h.\n\n【3】Upper-limb operations (fewer in number) were frequently done under brachial plexus block. Many children were given caudal blocks for crush injuries of the leg requiring amputations or reconstructions. In some cases, epidural catheters were kept in for 5–7 days for repeated surgery. No patient had epidural infection despite the environment. General anaesthesia was rarely used.\n\n【4】There are several advantages of mass epidural blocks over other anaesthesia techniques in such situations. Pain is prevented after trauma and surgery. The stress response is suppressed. Mass epidural blocks are effective in long and complex operations and multiple and repeat operations are possible. The analgesic requirement is kept to a minimum in the perioperative period, as are postoperative monitoring and anaesthesia complications. Mobilisation and initiation of oral feed can be started early after surgery. Patients undergo operations with low circulating catecholamines (stress response) and surgery is well tolerated with minimum intraoperative and postoperative complications. Time in the operating room taken up by anaesthesia procedures are kept to a minimum since patients arrive with an established block; therefore, more time is allowed for surgery and more people can be operated on, and surgery schedules can be kept flexible. Patients remain comfortable while awaiting surgery or being moved to the operation room or other wards.\n\n【5】I believe that mass epidural blocks can be an ideal technique in managing victims of disasters of large magnitude. Epidural infection can be a risk in such emergency disaster-control medical camps, but given the extent of need, workload, and benefits, the risk of infection can be seen as negligible. I suggest that epidural should be used more routinely and in every possible case, general anaesthesia should be combined with epidural simply for its unique ability to maintain normal physiological status during and after surgery (ie, iatrogenic trauma).\n\n【6】I thank E J deSouza, Director (Research), Holy Family Hospital, Mumbai, for his assistance in drafting this letter, and colleague friends for their support and faith in forging ahead with mass epidural in a large disaster area.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Almost four decades later, he is helping to establish Rwanda's first medical school as Principal of the newly created College of Medicine and Health Sciences in Kigali. The son of a bank clerk and a shopkeeper, Cotton failed to get the qualifications he needed to do medicine. But he did not give up. After studying biomedical sciences at St Andrews University he got into the University of Glasgow under an access scheme for mature students. From there he trained as a general practitioner and rose to become Professor of Learning and Teaching—education has been a lifelong passion—and developed a second passion for Africa, after first visiting Mozambique on a student elective 28 years ago. Now he has been handed the greatest challenge of all.\n\n【2】The creation of the medical school in Rwanda is part of a massive government project to merge seven public educational organisations, including what was formerly known as the Kigali Health Institute, into a new University of Rwanda, on the model of the University of California in the USA. “Our ambition is to be one of the top universities in Africa within 10 years. I think we are going to see Rwanda setting the standard for health care across east Africa”, Cotton said. The task is immense. It involves the wholesale restructuring of hospitals across the country. Cotton took up his post in October, 2013. Projects are already underway to reduce overcrowding in Kigali's teaching hospital by discharging patients back to their local district hospitals and reallocating offices to reduce traffic in the corridors. Trolleys and beds have also been removed. “We have reduced crowding massively”, he said. The medical school has an intake of 100 students, but only in the past year has Rwanda established a programme of specialty training. Five nursing schools, which train students from the age of 12 years to nursing auxiliary level, also come under his auspices. “My task is to upgrade the nurses and the programmes. We need to raise their quality, number, and status.” A dental school has been opened and the first 15 students admitted.\n\n【3】As elsewhere in Africa, Cotton faces the problem of well meaning benefactors who decide what they want to give before asking what the country needs. “We have locked rooms in which you find dialysis machines that have never been used. We have western academics who come for 2 weeks, give a series of lectures that disrupts the curriculum and disorients students and staff, and then leave.” He had just written to one university thanking them for their offer of assistance but telling them that he would decide when they would come and what they would teach. On the dialysis machines he said: “Now we have doctors and nurses interested we can create a renal unit.”\n\n【4】Cotton is a supporter of President Paul Kagame, who has been accused of political repression and criticised for his authoritarian regime. Yet his supporters point to the doubling of life expectancy in the past decade, the vaccination rate for children of about 90%, and the spread of health facilities to villages. “He established security and he stamped out corruption. What I see is a President steering a steady course. He drives the changing culture. He is the thinnest man I have seen and moves faster than anyone. He challenges his ministers in public, telling them ‘Stop talking like a politician and explain why that road building project is delayed’. When you get a country that has done what Rwanda has done, does that come from authoritarian rule or from a desire to be recognised as a leader on the world stage?”\n\n【5】He dates his understanding of what Africa needed from an epiphany during a student elective in Maputo, Mozambique during his 20s. “I was sitting outside the outpatient department with the Maputo peer student who translated for me and he said: ‘Great white doctors like you—we don't need them. What we need is a way to earn money so we can clothe and feed our children. Otherwise we are not interested.’” The experience was deflating for a young medical student on the brink of his career. But Cotton returned to the UK and set up a Fair Trade organisation, Rainbow Turtle, which provided business grants to women's cooperatives to enable them to find international markets for their goods, which he has chaired for more than two decades. He is also director of St Andrews Clinics for Children, a charity that supplies medicines to Africa, a volunteer doctor for Freedom from Torture (formerly the Medical Foundation for the Victims of Torture), and cooks 2 days a year for groups of medical students to raise money for an orphanage in Malawi. Part of his motivation for these projects comes from his faith. A Methodist preacher, Cotton was accepted a year ago for ordination training. “Methodism and its socialist gospel inform what I do”, he said.\n\n【6】Cotton is currently on secondment—unpaid—from the University of Glasgow, earning less than half his UK salary from the Rwandan Government. His two children are both at university in the UK. His secondment is for 3 years but he says he would “dearly love” to see the conclusion of a 7-year scheme under which more than 100 doctors and nurses from the USA come to Rwanda each year to boost the country's human resources. It started last year. “I don't know how long Glasgow will tolerate my absence”, he said. Rwanda must be praying that they will.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 29 March 2014\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60553-5</u>\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This Review aims to characterise the statistical analysis of PRO data from pivotal lung cancer trials submitted to support FDA drug approval between January, 2008, and December, 2017. For each trial and PRO instrument identified, we evaluated prespecified PRO concepts, statistical analysis, missing data and sensitivity analysis, instrument completion, and clinical relevance. Of the 37 pivotal lung cancer trials used to support FDA drug approval, 25 (68%) trials included PRO measures. The most common prespecified PRO concepts were cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain. At the trial level, the most common statistical analyses were descriptive (24 trials \\[96%\\]), followed by time-to-event analyses (19 trials \\[76%\\]), longitudinal analyses (12 trials \\[48%\\]), and basic inferential tests or general linear models (10 trials \\[40%\\]). Our findings indicate a wide variation in the analytic techniques and data presentation methods used, with very few trials reporting clear PRO research objectives and sensitivity analyses for PRO results. Our work further supports the need for focused research objectives to justify and to guide the analytic strategy of PROs to facilitate the interpretation of patient experience.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet Oncology_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

This fact is evident from the characteristics of patients entered: all had the licensed indications for donepezil—ie, DSM IV diagnosis of mild-to-moderate (MMSE 10–26) Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【2】The attrition rate was in fact lower than in any previous study, with only 13% of the 486 patients randomised to long-term donepezil or placebo stopping protocol treatment in the first 48 weeks, 14% opting not to continue into a second year of treatment, and 2% stopping during year 2. The attrition rates cited by Latif Akintade and colleagues are misleading, since they include patients who did not complete the run-in as well as those who were institutionalised, dead, or censored. Similarly, there was less missing data than in any previous study, thereby minimising drop-out bias; an issue in many of the reports cited.\n\n【3】To clarify data queries, the flow chart lists deaths on treatment; the death analysis also includes deaths after stopping treatment, institutionalisation, and centre withdrawal.\n\n【4】Although AD2000 did not meet its original pragmatic recruitment target—mainly because of difficulties arranging funding for treatment and research support—the study is the largest study of donepezil in person-years of placebo-controlled treatment. The numbers randomised provided greater than 90% power to detect, or refute, the 50% reduction in institutionalisation needed for cost neutrality, and greater than 95% power, at p<0·01, to detect an effect size of 0·3 SD on the secondary outcome measures. The results thus provide statistically convincing evidence to refute the primary cost-effectiveness hypothesis that donepezil use is cost-neutral, and to rule out minimally clinically relevant improvements in the secondary outcome measures—ie, AD2000 has not produced a false negative result.\n\n【5】The negative findings are not explained by an irreversible loss of benefit after the washout periods—for example, patients who entered a second year of treatment declined 1·45 MMSE points more in the donepezil group than in the placebo group during the preceding 6-week washout, but then improved 2·84 MMSE points more than controls after 12 weeks of re-treatment. Similar post-washout recovery has been seen in other studies. Results would have been little different if all patients had received 10 mg of donepezil given the small, non-significant difference between doses. We would also anticipate similar findings with other cholinesterase inhibitors. Indirect comparisons show similar benefits on cognitive, functional, and behavioural outcomes, as do the few direct randomised comparisons between different cholinesterase inhibitors.\n\n【6】The results of AD2000 are anomalous when compared with methodologically unsound studies, such as those cited by Akintade and colleagues as supporting a delay in institutionalisation with cholinesterase inhibitors, which have been rightly criticised. The apparent benefits from long-term treatment in these non-randomised, open treatment studies are refuted by AD2000, and must be explained by selection and other bias—eg, doctors and carers stop treatment of patients who do not seem to be benefiting. Our findings are, however, typical of those seen in the randomised double-blind trials with a small improvement in functional ability equivalent to the average patient's decline in 10 weeks. This improvement is too small to be noticeable in an individual patient and can only be measured statistically through methodologically rigorous studies such as AD2000.\n\n【7】We concur with Nick Clarke that trials comparing cholinesterase inhibitors against other drugs such as memantine, and against combinations of cholinesterase inhibitors with other drugs, are needed—these could be undertaken now if publicly funded. As noted by Clive Holmes and colleagues, the main contribution of cholinesterase inhibitors to people with Alzheimer's disease has been the welcome expansion of dementia services, making independent clinical trials such as AD2000 more feasible. On present evidence, however, we believe that cholinesterase inhibitors are over-priced considering their minimal benefits.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The personal, regional, and temporal factors influencing place of death in dementia are unknown.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Office for National Statistics mortality data were used for whole population cross-sectional analysis of deaths from dementia in England, 2001–10. Place of death (home, hospice, care home, hospital) was the outcome variable. Explanatory variables included demographic, social, and regional factors. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis was used to provide an independent relative risk of place of death for each of the variables studied. The change in place of death over time was studied using linear regression.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】387 004 deaths were included. Most patients died in care homes (55·3%) or hospital (39·6%). Home deaths (4·8%) and hospice deaths (0·3%) were rare. Hospital deaths were less likely with increasing affluence (relative risk \\[RR\\] 0·83, 95% CI 0·81–0·85), and increasing provision of a care-home bed (0·61, 95% CI 0·58–0·63). Lack of social support (marital status) reduced home deaths (RRs 0·45–0·60). Hospice deaths were increased in areas with greater hospice bed provision (RR 4·23, 95% CI 2·14–8·35) and in patients whose underlying cause of death was cancer (19·0, 95% CI 16·2–22·3). Deaths in care homes were more common with increasing affluence (RR 1·28, 95% CI 1·24–1·32) and increased provision of a care-home bed (2·02, 95% CI 1·97–2·08). Time-trend analysis showed a recent decrease in hospital deaths and reciprocal increase in care-home deaths.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Governments and policy makers recognise the urgent need for public health planning in dementia. Reducing the number of deaths in hospital, and increasing those at home, in dementia has both societal and economic benefits. Social support, deprivation, and service provision are key targets for policy.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Institute for Health Research.\n\n【10】</u>Article info\n------------\n\n【11】### Publication history\n\n【12】Published: 27 February 2013\n\n【13】### Identification\n\n【14】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60541-3</u>\n\n【15】### Copyright\n\n【16】© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The original publication reported no statistically significant difference in the safety endpoint of overdose. We reanalysed the trial using the public dataset and replicated most findings. However, we identified six additional overdose events that the original analysis missed. Five of these additional events were in the naltrexone group, and one was in the buprenorphine group.\n\n【1】Assuming similar efficacy, inclusion of these originally misclassified cases fundamentally alters the clinical risk–benefit: 19 (7%) of 283 participants had overdoses in the naltrexone group compared with 9 (3%) of 287 in the buprenorphine group 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. In addition to correcting the misclassification, our reanalysis accounted for timing of safety outcomes. The hazard ratio (HR) for overdose in the naltrexone group, relative to buprenorphine, becomes 2·40 删除2:<u>(95% CI 1·09–5·30, p=0·03; appendix )</u> with misclassification corrected. After we published our reanalysis, the presence of additional overdoses was confirmed by the original authors.\n\n【2】Unlike other schema, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) codes resemble English words. The original study identified cases through a verbatim exact match for the term “overdose” in the column containing MedDRA codes for the safety endpoint (variable PT in public file AD1.csv). However, Joshua D Lee and colleagues did not tally overdoses when mentioned in associated columns (variables A1AEPSP and A1DESCPT) describing the adverse event's aetiology. Cases with a clinically described cause of opioid overdose but MedDRA-coded as respiratory depression were not counted—respiratory depression is a sign of opioid overdose. Another event with stated cause of “narco overdose” was assigned a MedDRA code of drug abuse and similarly excluded.\n\n【3】The coding discrepancy arises from MedDRA preferred terms containing both diagnoses and symptoms. A single complex event results in multiple MedDRA codes; it is long-standing practice to use combinations of diagnoses and symptoms, called structured MedDRA queries. The study protocol did not specify this convention for case identification, instead relying on statistics derived from a single-column, literal text match for comparative safety claims.\n\n【4】In the Summary of the X:BOT study, Lee and colleagues claimed that “overdose did not differ between treatment groups”. In the Results, the authors stated that “The proportions of participants reporting any overdose event or with a fatal overdose did not differ”. In the Discussion, they concluded that “non-fatal overdose, and other serious adverse events did not differ”. We believe these statements are not supported by the public dataset and must be updated to accurately reflect risk–benefit.\n\n【5】The risk of overdose with naltrexone results when patients try to overcome μ-opioid receptor antagonism by taking increasingly high doses of unregulated drugs. Concerns about overdose misclassification in naltrexone trials have also been raised. Large epidemiological studies have found naltrexone to be less protective against overdose than buprenorphine, consistent with known pharmacology. Post-marketing data suggest waning protection with the monthly extended-release injectable naltrexone formulation used in X:BOT, although this is contested by the manufacturer.\n\n【6】The original report found that induction failures affected the naltrexone group differentially: 28% for naltrexone versus 5·9% for buprenorphine. In a commentary from 2022, Lee and colleagues correctly acknowledge that the corresponding per-protocol analysis might, therefore, not represent a sample with treatment assigned at random. Statistical methods accounting for induction failures substantiate differential overdose risk. Lee and colleagues also suggest focusing on the maintenance period (ie, study days 22–168, after induction and before therapy discontinuation), when most overdoses (61%) occurred. Doing so, we found HR 3·77 删除2:<u>(95% CI 1·23–11·57; Wald p=0·02; appendix )</u> for intention-to-treat analysis, and 3·81 (95% CI 1·01–14·36; p=0·05) for per-protocol analysis. X:BOT shows increased risk of overdose with naltrexone than buprenorphine even during therapy. In X:BOT, Lee and colleagues concluded that “once initiated, both medications were equally safe”. We believe this statement is not supported by the public data. Although we think it is important to acknowledge that the number of participants experiencing an overdose in X:BOT could appear small from a statistical perspective (28 \\[5%\\] of 570), the other major trial comparing these two medications had only one overdose among 143 participants in Norway.\n\n【7】Over the past decade drug overdoses in the USA have increased substantially. Given the demonstrated safety risk, naltrexone should not be presented as the only option for opioid dependence treatment, as is the case in many prisons and drug courts. With more than 100 000 overdose deaths annually, clinicians must make treatment decisions based on accurate information. We believe the original X:BOT report should be retracted or corrected quickly.\n\n【8】删除9:<u>ND is a scientific adviser on matters of overdose epidemiology to the non-profit Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance System of Denver Health and Hospitals Authority, and the US Food and Drug Administration, neither of which had any knowledge of or involvement in this research.

Although children younger than 15 years constitute more than 25% of the worldwide population, the global incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis disease in children has never been quantified. We aimed to estimate the regional and global annual incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in children.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We developed two models: one to estimate the setting-specific risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among child cases of tuberculosis, and a second to estimate the setting-specific incidence of tuberculosis disease in children. The model for risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis among children with tuberculosis needed a systematic literature review. We multiplied the setting-specific estimates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis risk and tuberculosis incidence to estimate regional and global incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis disease in children in 2010.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We identified 3403 papers, of which 97 studies met inclusion criteria for the systematic review of risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. 31 studies reported the risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in both children and treatment-naive adults with tuberculosis and were used for evaluation of the linear association between multidrug-resistant disease risk in these two patient groups. We identified that the setting-specific risk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis was nearly identical in children and treatment-naive adults with tuberculosis, consistent with the assertion that multidrug-resistant disease in both groups reflects the local risk of transmitted multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. After application of these calculated risks, we estimated that around 999 792 (95% CI 937 877–1 055 414) children developed tuberculosis disease in 2010, of whom 31 948 (25 594–38 663) had multidrug-resistant disease.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Our estimates underscore that many cases of tuberculosis and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis disease are not being detected in children.

However, we know little about how to harness them in health behaviour change interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of social network interventions for health behaviour change.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Eight databases (Medline, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, PsycINFO, ERIC, IBSS, and Sociological Abstracts were searched independently by two reviewers for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2000, and March 1, 2017. Eligibility criteria included a social network intervention for health behaviour change, a primary outcome measure of health behaviour change, and a comparator group. Evidence was synthesised by the network intervention approach based on a predefined taxonomy (Individual—using network data to identify certain individuals; Segmentation—directed towards groups of people clustered in a network; Induction—activation of existing social ties to diffuse healthy behaviours; Alteration—changing the structure of the network by the addition of new members or breaking existing ties. Studies were described as providing strong evidence if at least 80% of included studies demonstrated a significant intervention effect (p<0·05 vs control).\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of the 23 234 publications identified, 39 were included. Overall, there was strong evidence for a significant intervention effect (82%, 32 of 39 studies) and maintained intervention effect (88%, 29/33) for social network interventions. There was strong evidence demonstrating a significant intervention effect and maintained intervention effect for the Individuals (8/8 studies), Segmentation (5/5), and Alteration (3/3) network approaches, and promising evidence to support an intervention effect (68%, 15/22) for Induction approaches.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】This review provides strong evidence of the effectiveness of social network interventions for health behaviour change and maintenance. Most existing interventions continue to focus on individual-level behaviour and fail to address the influential role of individuals' social systems and environments. There has been a parallel and growing interest in understanding the effects of social networks on health-related behaviour and the reframing of non-communicable conditions as being socially transmitted; a particular backdrop to this has been the emerging prominence of complexity science public health.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】RH is funded by a Career Development Fellowship from the National Institute for Health Research.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】RFH conceived the idea for the study and led the development of the writing for the study protocol and abstract.

The importance of proper nutrition was recognised early: Hippocrates advised, “let your food be your medicine and your only medicine be your food”—an idea that has echoes in the modern expression “you are what you eat”. The word is rarely used figuratively, although the idea of “spiritual nutrition” appears in religious writings of the 16th and 17th centuries. Nutrition was also used from an early period for the nutritive contents or properties of food itself.\n\n【1】Although foods and diets have been central to medical treatments since ancient times, only in the 19th century was research begun into specific nutritive properties. It has been said that James Lind's 18th-century researches into the treatment of scurvy initiated the modern scientific era of nutrition and its clinical investigation, but there was a long gap after Lind before the science of nutrition was begun.\n\n【2】From the late 19th century nutrition began to acquire two further meanings. First, it was applied to the condition of being well or badly nourished. By the later 20th century, it was overlaid with economic notions of global division and was modified to “malnutrition” and “over-nutrition”. Second, nutrition came to mean the study of food and diet, the branch of science that deals with nutrition. It was first used in this disciplinary sense in the journal _Science_ in 1903. After the discovery of vitamins in the early 20th century, nutrition research became more sophisticated. The concept of “proper” nutrition, which had simply involved a full belly, now became complex.\n\n【3】Nutrition also became a political issue during the depression of the 1930s, and has remained so, whether the concern is healthy school meals in the UK or food aid in developing countries. The weight of its political importance has, of course, changed over time, as have medical understandings of “proper”. By the 1990s, “proper” nutrition seemed to be significant in preventing a range of important illnesses, including heart disease and several cancers, although the quantification of the nutrients that “should” be eaten by each person, accommodating individual variation, remains problematic.

This study aims to evaluate HCV burden in 2020, and forecast HCV burden by 2030 given current trends.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This analysis includes a literature review, Delphi process, and mathematical modelling to estimate HCV prevalence (viraemic infection, defined as HCV RNA-positive cases) and the cascade of care among people of all ages (age ≥0 years from birth) for the period between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2030. Epidemiological data were collected from published sources and grey literature (including government reports and personal communications) and were validated among country and territory experts. A Markov model was used to forecast disease burden and cascade of care from 1950 to 2050 for countries and territories with data. Model outcomes were extracted from 2015 to 2030 to calculate population-weighted regional averages, which were used for countries or territories without data. Regional and global estimates of HCV prevalence, cascade of care, and disease burden were calculated based on 235 countries and territories.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Models were built for 110 countries or territories: 83 were approved by local experts and 27 were based on published data alone. Using data from these models, plus population-weighted regional averages for countries and territories without models (n=125), we estimated a global prevalence of viraemic HCV infection of 0·7% (95% UI 0·7–0·9), corresponding to 56·8 million (95% UI 55·2–67·8) infections, on Jan 1, 2020. This number represents a decrease of 6·8 million viraemic infections from a 2015 (beginning of year) prevalence estimate of 63·6 million (61·8–75·8) infections (0·9% \\[0·8–1·0\\] prevalence). By the end of 2020, an estimated 12·9 million (12·5–15·4) people were living with a diagnosed viraemic infection. In 2020, an estimated 641 000 (623 000–765 000) patients initiated treatment.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】At the beginning of 2020, there were an estimated 56·8 million viraemic HCV infections globally. Although this number represents a decrease from 2015, our forecasts suggest we are not currently on track to achieve global elimination targets by 2030. As countries recover from COVID-19, these findings can help refocus efforts aimed at HCV elimination.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】John C Martin Foundation, Gilead Sciences, AbbVie, ZeShan Foundation, and The Hepatitis Fund.\n\n【11】• View related content for this article\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【12】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【13】Already registered?\n\n【14】Log in to existing account\n\n【15】Forgot password?\n\n【16】One-time access price info\n\n【17】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【18】Not yet registered?\n\n【19】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The lack of end-of-life care education has been identified as a key barrier to the improvement of the discipline. The aim of this study is to assess the status of end-of-life care education for medical students in mainland China.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We obtained a list of all medical schools from the website of the Ministry of Education. We did a telephone survey of associate deans for medical education at all 282 medical schools in mainland China in May, 2019, following a standardised protocol. Telephone interviews focused on attitudes to end-of-life care teaching, and the extent and manner in which end-of-life care is incorporated into the curriculum. Schools that did not reply were contacted again after 1, 3, and 7 days. We obtained ethical approval from Zhejiang University Research Ethics Committee.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Among the 282 medical schools, associate deans from 120 (43%) schools completed the interview; 53 (19%) schools declined to answer questions related to end-of-life care. 92 (77%) of 120 associate deans regarded end-of-life care education as very important, but only 11 (9%) provided specific teaching about end-of-life care. One dean said that such a course was being planned. 18 schools have integrated end-of-life education within required curricula, such as medical ethics. The main reason reported for not providing end-of-life care was that the medical curriculum dictated by the Chinese Ministry of Education does not require it.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】A minority of medical schools in mainland China provide any formal teaching about end-of-life care.

Whether tuberculosis case finding and preventive interventions among previously treated people are cost-effective has not been established. We aimed to estimate costs and health benefits of annual post-treatment follow-up examinations and secondary preventive therapy for tuberculosis in a tuberculosis-endemic setting.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We developed a transmission-dynamic mathematical model and calibrated it to data from two high-incidence communities of approximately 40 000 people in suburban Cape Town, South Africa. We used the model to estimate overall cost and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) associated with annual follow-up examinations and secondary isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), alone and in combination, among individuals completing tuberculosis treatment. We investigated scenarios under which these interventions were restricted to the first year after treatment completion, or extended indefinitely. For each intervention scenario, we projected health system costs and DALYs averted with respect to the current status quo of tuberculosis control. All estimates represent mean values derived from 1000 epidemic trajectories simulated over a 10-year period (2019–28), with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) calculated as the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile values.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We estimated that a single follow-up examination at the end of the first year after treatment completion combined with 12 months of secondary IPT would avert 2472 DALYs (95% UI −888 to 7801) over a 10-year period and is expected to be cost-saving compared with current control efforts. Sustained annual follow-up and continuous secondary IPT beyond the first year after treatment would avert an additional 1179 DALYs (−1769 to 4377) over 10 years at an expected additional cost of US$18·2 per DALY averted. Strategies of follow-up without secondary IPT were dominated (ie, expected to result in lower health impact at higher costs) by strategies that included secondary IPT.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In this high-incidence setting, post-treatment follow-up and secondary preventive therapy can accelerate declines in tuberculosis incidence and potentially save resources for tuberculosis control. Empirical trials to assess the feasibility of these interventions in settings most severely affected by tuberculosis are needed.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Institutes of Health, Günther Labes Foundation, Oskar Helene Heim Foundation.\n\n【10】</u>Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Considerable effort will be required to accelerate declines in tuberculosis incidence and mortality worldwide and ensure progress towards the global tuberculosis elimination targets. Although estimates of tuberculosis incidence and mortality indicate declining trends in many high-burden countries over the past few years, progress remains slow in settings with the highest incidence. Additional interventions to interrupt transmission and prevent disease progression might be necessary to effectively reduce tuberculosis in these settings.\n\n【12】While population-level interventions such as intensified case finding and preventive treatment are costly and have not yielded anticipated benefits, novel approaches that focus on groups at the highest risk of tuberculosis could be attractive alternatives. Whether targeting tuberculosis control interventions towards high-risk groups will be effective at the population level will depend on whether these groups are identifiable and accessible, and on the extent to which these groups contribute to transmission of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and overall tuberculosis burden.\n\n【13】Individuals who have previously completed an episode of tuberculosis treatment remain at high risk of developing tuberculosis again. This risk is usually highest in the first year after treatment completion, where endogenous reactivation (relapse) is the main mechanism of disease recurrence. In settings with a high force of infection, persistently high rates of recurrent tuberculosis after the first year, commonly due to exogenous reinfection, have been observed, which suggests that previously treated people might be especially susceptible to tuberculosis. In these settings, tuberculosis among previously treated people contributes substantially to the overall incidence and prevalence of active tuberculosis. Using a mathematical model of tuberculosis and HIV in suburban Cape Town, South Africa, we projected that targeting tuberculosis case finding and secondary prevention to previously treated people could yield substantial population-level reductions in tuberculosis incidence and mortality. However, it is not yet clear whether these types of targeted intervention are cost-effective options for tuberculosis control in a high-incidence setting.\n\n【14】**Research in context**\n\n【15】**Evidence before the study**\n\n【16】High rates of recurrent tuberculosis after completion of standard antituberculosis treatment have been reported from several settings with high tuberculosis incidence. To our knowledge, no empirical studies have been done to measure the population-level effect of interventions that aim to prevent recurrent disease or more rapidly detect tuberculosis in previously treated people. In a modelling study of a South African community with high tuberculosis incidence, we projected that targeting active case finding and preventive therapy among individuals who had previously completed a course of tuberculosis treatment could accelerate reductions in tuberculosis incidence and mortality. However, whether such interventions would be cost-effective remains unaddressed.To establish whether other population-based mathematical models have been employed to estimate the effect of tuberculosis interventions targeted to previously treated people, we updated an earlier PubMed search of relevant articles published in any language up to June 1, 2020, using the following search: (tuberculosis) AND (recurren\\* OR relapse OR reinfection OR re-infection OR re-treatment OR previous treatment) AND (model\\* OR simulation). We found no other modelling study has addressed the population-level effects and cost-effectiveness of interventions targeted to people previously treated for tuberculosis.\n\n【17】**Added value of this study**\n\n【18】We used a calibrated transmission-dynamic mathematical model of tuberculosis among treatment-naive and treatment-experienced people in a high-incidence setting in suburban Cape Town, South Africa, to understand whether two targeted interventions—post-treatment follow-up examinations and secondary isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT)—among people who had completed tuberculosis treatment would be cost-effective if implemented alongside existing tuberculosis control efforts. We found that a strategy combining targeted follow-up examinations and secondary IPT for 1 year after treatment completion would both improve health (estimated as disability-adjusted life years \\[DALYs\\] averted) and reduce tuberculosis control costs. Compared with this strategy, annual follow-up with continuous secondary IPT is expected to cost an additional US$18·2 per DALY averted. Follow-up examination alone, whether limited to or extended beyond the first year after treatment was dominated (ie, expected to result in lower health impact at higher costs compared to the other strategies modelled). The comparative performance of these strategies in terms of cost and health benefits is expected to be maintained even at reduced uptake (50%) of or high dropout (25% per year) from the targeted interventions.\n\n【19】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【20】This study shows that, in tuberculosis-endemic and HIV-endemic settings, former patients with tuberculosis constitute an important risk group that would derive substantial health benefits from targeted interventions, at comparatively low cost. Our results suggest that post-treatment follow-up and secondary preventive therapy offered to people who have completed tuberculosis treatment would be cost-effective and potentially cost-saving for tuberculosis control. Empirical trials of these targeted interventions are now needed to assess their feasibility and benefits in populations most severely affected by tuberculosis.\n\n【21】In this analysis, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of targeted tuberculosis control strategies to find and prevent tuberculosis among people who have previously completed tuberculosis treatment. We considered targeted active case finding, implemented as annual post-treatment follow-up examinations, alone and in combination with secondary isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT). We also examined how variations in uptake and duration of follow-up examinations and secondary IPT affect the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Modelling approach\n\n【24】We developed and calibrated a stochastic compartmental model of the tuberculosis and HIV epidemic in a high-incidence setting of approximately 40 000 residents of two adjacent communities in suburban Cape Town, South Africa 删除2:<u>(see appendix p 2 for details on the study setting)</u>. The transmission-dynamic model is an extension of a model that we previously used to explore the impact of targeted active case finding and secondary IPT after tuberculosis treatment completion in the same study setting. The tuberculosis component of the model follows the conventions of earlier models with additional structure to distinguish between individuals who have never been treated for tuberculosis (treatment naive) and those who have previously been treated for tuberculosis 删除2:<u>(treatment experienced; figure 1 )</u>. Model transitions are fully described in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 2–3)</u>. Briefly, treatment-naive susceptible adults transition from the susceptible state to the latently infected state or directly into the infectious tuberculosis state after primary infection. If diagnosed, infectious adults move into one of two treatment compartments: incomplete or completed treatment. Adults in the incomplete treatment state move into a treatment-experienced latently infected state or, upon persistent disease, an infectious tuberculosis state. Infectious adults transit, after passive case detection, back into one of the two treatment compartments. Adults who complete their treatment are allocated to an intervention arm or non-intervention arm. In the non-intervention arm, the transitions are similar to those for adults in the incomplete treatment state, and infectious adults can once again be passively detected and transition into either of the treatment compartments. Similar transitions apply to adults in the intervention arm; however, an additional case-detection rate, incremental to passive case finding, is implemented to model case detection during post-treatment follow-up. Furthermore, we allow rates of relapse and disease progression following reinfection to differ from those in the non-intervention arm to account for the effect of secondary preventive therapy. Adults with completed treatment who drop out of the intervention arm move into the non-intervention arm, with its respective case-detection, relapse, and reinfection rates.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Structure of the mathematical model</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【25】Mortality rates are not shown.

Our model includes substructure for people living with HIV, who represent an important high-risk group for tuberculosis. The HIV component of our model accounts for HIV infection, progression to a state of immunocompromised HIV infection, and antiretroviral treatment 删除2:<u>(ART; figure 1 )</u>. The model also includes a subcomponent for children aged 0–14 years 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 2–3 )</u>. A detailed description of our modelling approach, including model structure, parameterisation, implementation, model calibration, and parameter estimation, can be found in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 2–13)</u>.\n\n【27】### Key model assumptions\n\n【28】We made the following six key model assumptions about differences between treatment-experienced and treatment-naive people. (1) Individuals who complete tuberculosis treatment revert to a latently infected stage that is distinct from latent infection among treatment-naive individuals. Subsequent tuberculosis is either due to endogenous reactivation (relapse) or exogenous reinfection. (2) We allow for a higher risk of tuberculosis reactivation in individuals who have completed tuberculosis treatment compared with those who are treatment naive and latently infected. We assumed that the rate of relapse after completion of tuberculosis treatment is highest in the first year and lower in subsequent years after treatment, consistent with observations from the study setting and a review of clinical trial data. (3) Due to the uncertainty about the degree to which previous tuberculosis disease is associated with immunity, we allow for previously treated people, when reinfected, to be equally protected against tuberculosis compared with treatment-naive latently infected people, and up to twice as susceptible compared with previously uninfected, treatment-naive people. (4) We allow for treatment-experienced people with tuberculosis to be more infectious than treatment-naive people with tuberculosis, consistent with local tuberculosis prevalence survey data showing that people with previously treated tuberculosis were more likely to report cough and to be smear positive. (5) We allow for differential rates of passive tuberculosis case finding among individuals with and without history of tuberculosis treatment. (6) Among individuals with incomplete tuberculosis treatment, we assumed that between 0% and 20% remained infectious, effectively resulting in higher rates of tuberculosis after incomplete treatment, consistent with findings from the study setting.\n\n【29】### Model initialisation and parameter estimation approach\n\n【30】We specified an initial population size of 32 889 people (25 903 adults and 10 427 children aged 0–14 years), intended to reflect the population size in 1992 and informed by local census data and projections of population growth. Model simulations were initiated in 1992, allowing for a 10-year burn-in period before the availability of local data for calibration, which were obtained between Jan 1, 2002, and Dec 31, 2008 (with prevalence estimates for 2002 only). This calibration period was chosen because of the availability of high-quality data. Because the values of many parameters in tuberculosis and HIV co-epidemic models are not known with certainty, we adopted a Bayesian calibration approach to identify parameter sets that resulted in simulated trajectories with good fit to demographic, programmatic, and observational study data available for our setting 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 10–11 )</u>. To implement this approach, we used a sampling-importance-resampling algorithm under which uniform prior distributions were specified for each parameter, and multiple parameter sets were then randomly and independently selected from these distributions (sampling). We measured the goodness of fit for 20 000 simulated trajectories against the calibration targets (importance).

Under this base-case scenario, treatment-naive and treatment-experienced adults with infectious tuberculosis are passively detected and treated for tuberculosis with no additional interventions implemented. Rates of passive case detection were estimated through model calibration; percentages of patients completing tuberculosis treatment were informed by programmatic data from the local tuberculosis register.\n\n【34】We assumed that two targeted interventions—follow-up examinations and secondary IPT—were implemented complementary to routine tuberculosis services provided under the base-case scenario in the study setting. For follow-up examinations, we assumed that patients with tuberculosis who are completing tuberculosis treatment are requested to return to the clinic once at the end of every year to be re-evaluated for tuberculosis. At follow-up, individuals are asked to produce a single sputum sample for bacteriological testing (spontaneous or induced). We assumed that mycobacterial culture is used as the single diagnostic screening test, given the high false-positive rate of Xpert MTB/RIF in people with a recent history of tuberculosis treatment. Additional considerations about the use of the screening test are provided in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 14–16)</u>. We modelled the effect of follow-up examinations as an additional rate of case finding 删除2:<u>( figure 1 )</u>. Follow-up thus leads to more rapid initiation of tuberculosis treatment and reductions in the average diagnostic delay and expected period of infectiousness. For secondary IPT _,_ we assumed that patients who complete tuberculosis treatment are offered isoniazid (300 mg daily) as preventive therapy. We modelled the effect of preventive therapy by reducing the rate of tuberculosis reactivation and the risk of progression to disease following reinfection. A preventive effect of 65% (uncertainty interval \\[UI\\] 45–85) was assumed, informed by two previous studies. These estimates consider the possibility that secondary IPT might be ineffective in a small fraction of individuals who acquired drug resistance during their first tuberculosis treatment episode.\n\n【35】The relative effect of preventive therapy was assumed to be independent of HIV infection, but the absolute rate and risk reduction associated with this intervention remains greater for those with HIV given their higher reactivation rate and risk of progression. We also assumed that the protective effect does not extend beyond the cessation of preventive therapy.\n\n【36】When modelling intervention scenarios, we considered a 2 × 2 factorial design of either annual follow-up examination alone or combined with secondary IPT and their intended duration after completion of treatment 删除2:<u>(restricted to the first year after treatment or unlimited; appendix p 20)</u>. We modelled the uptake of the interventions as a probability after tuberculosis treatment completion 删除2:<u>( figure 1 )</u>. In our primary analysis, we assumed that 75% of patients with tuberculosis completing treatment would agree to receive the intervention. We allowed for dropout from the interventions by enabling transitions from the intervention into the non-intervention compartments at varying rates 删除2:<u>( figure 1 )</u>. We assumed that, on average, 15% of people currently enrolled in the interventions drop out every year (resulting in an expected duration of preventive therapy of 6·6 years). Both uptake of and dropout from the interventions were varied in secondary analyses. Individuals who were re-treated for tuberculosis were able to re-enter the interventions upon treatment completion.\n\n【37】### Cost-effectiveness analysis\n\n【38】We estimated the costs for the base-case and intervention scenarios in 2018 US dollars, adopting a South African health-care system perspective 删除2:<u>( table 1 )</u>. Average costs reflect 2018 estimates for tuberculosis health-care and diagnostic services in Cape Town that were obtained through review of the published literature and the official price list of the National Health Laboratory Service, South Africa. Cost estimates from previous years were converted into US dollars (where applicable) and adjusted for inflation using an average annual South African gross domestic product deflator rate of 5·71%. Costs for basic tuberculosis services reflect resources for standard tuberculosis diagnostic evaluation among individuals self-presenting to primary health care, HIV testing and ART, and tuberculosis treatment. Costs for annual follow-up examinations reflect those for follow-up visits to the local clinic and culture-based screening for active tuberculosis 删除2:<u>( table 1 )</u>. Costs for secondary IPT reflect drug supply and dispensing during monthly follow-up visits as well as the evaluation and management of potential drug-induced toxicity events 删除2:<u>( table 1 )</u>. We assumed that 3·0% (UI 0·2–15·0) of individuals enrolled in secondary IPT would experience drug-induced liver injury, of which 1·4% (0·005–2·5) would be severe events requiring hospitalisation, and of the latter 5·2% (0·01–10·0) would lead to death.\n\n【39】Table 1 Parameters for costs and disability weights\n\n|  |  | **Value** | **Source** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Costs** | **Costs** | **Costs** | **Costs** |\n| Standard diagnostic evaluation (passive case finding) | Standard diagnostic evaluation (passive case finding) | Standard diagnostic evaluation (passive case finding) | Standard diagnostic evaluation (passive case finding) |\n|  | Clinic visit for initial diagnosis (excluding tests) | $14·36 | Sinanovic et al (2015) |\n|  | Xpert MTB/RIF (treatment naive only) | $14·80 | NHLS state price list |\n|  | _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ culture (treatment experienced only) | $7·58 | NHLS state price list |\n|  | Drug-susceptibility testing | $14·99 | NHLS state price list |\n|  | Smear microscopy | $1·34 | NHLS state price list |\n|  | Chest x-ray | $23·84 (16·22–33·85) | Menzies et al (2012) |\n| Tuberculosis or HIV treatment | Tuberculosis or HIV treatment | Tuberculosis or HIV treatment | Tuberculosis or HIV treatment |\n|  | Drug-susceptible tuberculosis, full course | $708·15 (477·30–939·00) | Vassall et al (2011), Pooran et al (2013) |\n|  | Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, full course | $5446·85 (3225·68–7669·57) | Vassall et al (2011), Pooran et al (2013) |\n|  | ART, per month | $151·98 (122·47–184·44) | Menzies et al (2012) |\n| Post-treatment follow-up examination | Post-treatment follow-up examination | Post-treatment follow-up examination | Post-treatment follow-up examination |\n|  | Follow-up clinic visit | $6·46 | Sinanovic et al (2015) |\n|  | _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ culture screening for tuberculosis | $7·58 | NHLS state price list |\n| Secondary IPT | Secondary IPT | Secondary IPT | Secondary IPT |\n|  | IPT including monthly outpatient follow-up, per year | $20·25 (11·97–34·11) | Kim et al (2018), Johnson et al (2018) |\n|  | Management of drug-induced liver injury, per event | $35·86 (24·22–90·06) | Kim et al (2018) |\n|  | 7-day hospitalisation costs per severe drug-induced liver injury event | $813·05 (334·60–886·48) | Kim et al (2018) |\n| **Disability weights** | **Disability weights** | **Disability weights** | **Disability weights** |\n| Latent tuberculosis infection | Latent tuberculosis infection | 0 | . |\n| Untreated active tuberculosis, HIV negative | Untreated active tuberculosis, HIV negative | 0·333 (0·224–0·454) | GBD 2016 |\n| HIV positive, non-immunocompromised | HIV positive, non-immunocompromised | 0·012 (0·006–0·023) | GBD 2016 |\n| HIV positive, immunocompromised | HIV positive, immunocompromised | 0·428 (0·274–0·582) | GBD 2016 |\n| HIV positive, on ART | HIV positive, on ART | 0·078 (0·052–0·111) | GBD 2016 |\n\n【41】Data in parentheses are uncertainty intervals.

Tuberculosis incidence was 1218 cases (691–2098) per 100 000 treatment-naive people and 7551 cases (3931–12 531) per 100 000 treatment-experienced people. Among incident tuberculosis cases who had previously completed tuberculosis treatment, 48% (32–62) were due to reactivation of tuberculosis (as opposed to reinfection).

We estimated an expected annual decline in tuberculosis incidence between 2019 and 2028 of 1·32% (95% UI −2·07 to 3·84) under the base-case scenario (no targeted intervention), of 2·28% (−0·24 to 4·61) under follow-up examinations limited to the end of the first year after treatment, and of 2·44% (−0·06 to 4·79) under continuous annual follow-up. The expected annual decline in tuberculosis incidence would be 2·91% (0·64 to 5·12) under combined follow-up and secondary IPT restricted to the first year, and 3·79% (1·73 to 5·62) under annual follow-up and continuous secondary IPT.\n\n【52】A combination of follow-up and secondary IPT limited to the first year is expected to avert 14·3% (95% UI 0·1 to 28·0) of incident tuberculosis cases and 12·2% (−3·9 to 27·1) of tuberculosis deaths estimated to occur under the base-case scenario over the 10-year period 删除2:<u>( figure 3 )</u>.

Higher dropout rates (25% _vs_ 15% per year in the primary analysis) would reduce impact and costs of the lifelong combined strategy but have little impact on the first-year combined strategy 删除2:<u>( appendix p 22 )</u>.\n\n【63】Discussion\n----------\n\n【64】In this study, we used a calibrated transmission-dynamic model of tuberculosis in a high-incidence setting to estimate whether interventions targeted to previously treated people would be cost-effective for tuberculosis control. Our analysis suggests that a combined strategy of annual post-treatment follow-up examinations and secondary preventive therapy among individuals who completed their tuberculosis treatment has a high probability of being cost-saving for tuberculosis control if implemented in addition to current tuberculosis control efforts in this setting. With a cost-effectiveness threshold greater than $18·2 per DALY averted, sustained annual follow-up coupled with continuous secondary IPT is expected to be the optimal strategy.\n\n【65】While follow-up and secondary IPT limited to the first year after treatment is expected to minimise tuberculosis control costs and produce health gains relative to the status quo, sustained annual follow-up with continuous secondary IPT will result in the greatest health impact for a relatively low additional cost. Our projection that the combined intervention is cost-effective even when extended beyond the first year after treatment relates to the observation that, in this high-incidence setting, the risk of tuberculosis among those completing tuberculosis treatment remains elevated beyond the first year after treatment due to exogenous reinfection.\n\n【66】To our knowledge, our study is the first to estimate the cost-effectiveness of interventions targeted to people with a history of previous tuberculosis treatment in a high-incidence setting. It extends findings of an earlier modelling study, in which we found that offering tuberculosis case finding and secondary IPT to people previously treated for tuberculosis could greatly accelerate declines in tuberculosis incidence and mortality in this setting. Both studies support the proposition that in settings with a high incidence of tuberculosis, previously treated people constitute an important group that might be especially attractive for targeted interventions given their high risk of recurrent tuberculosis and their probable role in transmission of _M tuberculosis_ in the population.\n\n【67】Rigorous implementation of case finding and secondary prevention is necessary to maximise population-level benefits of these targeted interventions. However, the results from our sensitivity analysis suggest that these interventions might be cost-effective even with lower uptake or retention, given that resources for individuals declining to participate or dropping out over time could be saved.\n\n【68】We note the following limitations to our study. Uncertainty around parameters of the natural history of tuberculosis, particularly those determining reinfection, disease progression, and mortality among previously treated individuals, as well as the quality of future case finding and tuberculosis care in our setting, leads to substantial uncertainty in the modelled outcomes. We aimed to reduce this uncertainty by calibrating our model to several targets based on observational data from our study setting including rates of recurrent tuberculosis due to reactivation (relapse) and reinfection as estimated in a large cohort analysis. While we allowed for differential susceptibility to tuberculosis among treatment-experienced and treatment-naive individuals, we did not explicitly model differential risk of exposure as a possible driver for recurrent disease.\n\n【69】As noted for our previous modelling study, this study was based on a high-incidence setting; therefore, estimates of population-level impact and cost-effectiveness might not be readily generalisable to other settings. We expect interventions among previously treated people to be less cost-effective in settings with lower tuberculosis incidence, and where a smaller proportion of the tuberculosis burden and transmission is attributable to people who have previously had tuberculosis. In particular, sustaining annual follow-up and continuous secondary IPT might be less attractive in lower-transmission settings, where reinfection after tuberculosis treatment might be less common.\n\n【70】We were unable to address several practical aspects that could represent challenges to successful implementation of follow-up examinations and secondary IPT. For example, given the low specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF for the diagnosis of recurrent tuberculosis in recently treated people, we considered the use of _M tuberculosis_ culture as the screening test at follow-up. The expected duration between follow-up and confirmation of tuberculosis via culture result (usually 2–3 weeks) means that culture-positive individuals would have to be contacted to start their re-treatment. Initiation of presumptive re-treatment might be considered for individuals with a high clinical suspicion of recurrent tuberculosis. However, re-treatment would have to be discontinued in the event of a negative culture result. More complex screening algorithms—for example ruling in possible tuberculosis cases via Xpert MTB/RIF and ruling out via culture—might prove more practicable but come with increased costs.\n\n【71】There is uncertainty about the extent to which risk factors for isoniazid-induced toxicity events such as alcohol abuse, malnutrition, or a past history of toxicity might affect eligibility for preventive therapy after treatment, which would reduce uptake. Also, implementing these interventions requires that drug toxicity events be successfully detected and managed.\n\n【72】Finally, our study did not take into account potential additional disability related to the burden of post-tuberculosis lung disease. There is consistent evidence from studies for an association between repeated episodes of tuberculosis and deteriorating lung function or chronic lung disease. Preventing recurrent and first-time tuberculosis through targeted interventions might therefore produce additional health benefits not accounted for by our study.\n\n【73】In conclusion, our analysis suggests that interventions to detect and prevent recurrent tuberculosis among previously treated people would be cost-effective for tuberculosis control, and that practical efforts to assess their feasibility in high-incidence settings are warranted. Empirical trials of the feasibility, impact, and cost-effectiveness of follow-up examinations and secondary preventive therapy are needed to assess whether these targeted interventions could support tuberculosis control in populations most severely affected by tuberculosis. Efforts to better understand the factors that predispose patients with tuberculosis to a high risk of recurrent tuberculosis after completion of treatment could help to prioritise those who would benefit the most from interventions after completing treatment. Additional research is also needed to identify more sensitive, specific, and rapid diagnostic algorithms to detect recurrent tuberculosis. Other treatment regimens and strategies to prevent recurrent tuberculosis, including the recently recommended shorter preventive treatment regimens (eg, daily rifampicin for 4 months, weekly rifapentine/isoniazid for 3 months ), could be considered. Preventing and detecting recurrent tuberculosis should become part of an integrative post-tuberculosis care strategy that also addresses other long-term adverse health consequences including the burden of post-tuberculosis lung disease.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【74】FMM, TC, and RY conceived the study.

Today, more than 1·5 million platelet products are transfused in the USA each year, 2·9 million products in Europe. However, platelet transfusion can transmit infections and trigger serious immune reactions and they can be rendered ineffective by alloimmunisation. There are several types of platelet components and all can be modified to reduce the chances of many of the complications of platelet transfusion. Transfusion practices, including indications for transfusion, dose of platelets transfused, and methods of treating alloimmunised recipients vary between countries, and even within countries. We review commonly used platelet components, product modifications, transfusion practices, and adverse consequences of platelet transfusions.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

Functional syndromes are commonly regarded as the patient's problem; but they can also be thought of as a problem of the health-care system because of a gap between patients' expectations and health professionals' answers to these expectations. The amount of discrepancy between somatic pathology and patients' reactions is a complex phenomenon with multiple factors. For example, in non-western cultures, many individuals with mental disorders spontaneously express their experience not in psychological symptoms, but as somatic complaints. Thus, cultural factors not only influence representations of health and disease, but directly affect illness behaviour.\n\n【2】Patients with functional somatic syndromes challenge the theoretical models of psychiatry and medicine, with the possibility that their case might be rejected by both. Abnormal illness behaviour can be a useful concept for putting the debate into perspective: distressed patients with somatic conditions who have repetitive or inappropriate medical demands show abnormal illness behaviour.

Although the infection is symptomless in most instances, it can cause mild symptoms and be responsible for encephalitis or meningitis in individuals with some degree of immunodeficiency, including elderly people. In 2002, more than 200 deaths associated with West Nile virus were reported in the USA.\n\n【2】Until recently, the virus was considered transmissible to human beings exclusively by mosquito bites. However, the rapidly extending North American epidemic has revealed that the virus could also be transmitted by organ transplantation and by transfusion of blood or blood components. Such transmission can only take place in the initial window of infection during which fairly high degrees of viraemia are observed. After 2–3 weeks post-contact, IgM and IgG antibodies are produced that make the virus no longer infectious and ultimately lead to recovery.\n\n【3】Since most infected individuals remain symptomfree they are eligible as blood donors. Similar to hepatitis C virus, West Nile virus can be inactivated by solvent-detergent treatment to prevent contamination of plasma derivatives. However, transmission of the virus by cellular blood products has been reported. To prevent further contamination of cellular blood products, the US Food and Drug Administration has decided to implement nucleic acid testing of the virus in blood banks from July, 2003.\n\n【4】Occasional and limited outbreaks of West Nile virus have been reported in horses and in people in Europe. ' In the aftermath of the epidemic in Tuscan horses in 1998, no clinical cases were reported in human beings, although about 4% of individuals in close contact with these animals seroconverted (L Nicoletti, personal communication). The virus is, therefore, considered endemic. This case seems to be true even in the UK, where West Nile virus was previously thought to be absent. Western Europe is not in an epidemic situation, the likelihood of widespread infection is small, and specific nucleic acid testing of stored blood is, therefore, not justified.\n\n【5】However, during the 2–3 weeks after a potential mosquito bite, blood taken from individuals travelling from an epidemic area such as the USA or Canada should be considered at risk of contamination. Hence, we suggest that North Americans travelling to Europe and Europeans returning from North America, in particular during spring to autumn, should be excluded from blood donation. Since the duration of viraemia in West Nile virus infection is short, this exclusion period should be transient (no longer than 2 months).\n\n【6】In the UK, only about 8% of adults (eligible as blood donors) travel to North America every year, so the effect on blood banks would be negligible; about 0–7–1–3% decrease in donors. Furthermore, though about 3 million North Americans visit the UK every year, few are expected to become blood donors. In the rest of Western Europe, these figures should be much lower.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Initially developed for couples with severely diminished sperm counts, it is increasingly used as the method of choice for couples with fertility problems who are undergoing in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment, despite the available data suggesting that IVF is superior to ICSI in couples with normal sperm counts. ICSI differs from IVF in that a single sperm is selected by a trained embryologist and directly injected into the oocyte, rather than letting fertilisation take place unaided after adding a few thousand motile sperm to a single oocyte. Traditionally, sperm selection is done by visual inspection at about 200 times magnification; sperm that show progressive motility and normal morphology are selected for injection. An alternative method to select sperm for ICSI is the so-called physiological, hyaluronan-based selection (PICSI) method, in which processed semen is allowed to bind to hyaluronan, and sperm that bind to hyaluronan are selected for injection. Hyaluronan is a biologically active molecule that is also a major component of the extracellular matrix surrounding the oocyte-cumulus complex. The biological rationale behind PICSI is that sperm that bind to hyaluronan are of better quality than those that do not, resulting in better quality embryos when used for ICSI and thus an increased chance of livebirth. However, robust clinical trials showing this clinical benefit of PICSI are lacking.\n\n【1】In _The Lancet_ , David Miller and colleagues report the results of a randomised clinical trial comparing PICSI with standard ICSI. The trial, which randomly allocated 2772 couples in 16 fertility clinics in the UK to either PICSI or ICSI, showed no difference between groups in livebirth rate after the first embryo transfer (27·4% \\[379/1381\\] for PICSI _vs_ 25·2% \\[346/1371\\] for ICSI; odds ratio 1·12, 95% CI 0·95–1·34; p=0·18). Additionally, the authors found that the miscarriage rate, a secondary outcome of their trial, was significantly lower after PICSI than after ICSI (4·3% \\[60/1381\\] _vs_ 7·0% \\[96/1371\\]; 0·61, 0·43–0·84; p=0·003). Given that the authors did not provide data on the number of embryos generated or embryo quality, it is unclear whether and how this effect on miscarriage was mediated by PICSI. A potential alternative explanation, although purely hypothetical, is that the embryologists, who were not masked to the allocated treatment for obvious reasons, had a preference or belief in PICSI that led them to be less precise when selecting the right sperm to be injected in the standard ICSI group.\n\n【2】Despite these reservations, the authors should be applauded for doing such a well designed trial, which yet again shows the lack of clinical benefit for a so-called add-on to IVF treatment. Robust clinical trials have previously reported no benefit for other promising IVF add-ons, such as preimplantation genetic screening and endometrial scratching (ACTRN12614000626662). In fact, as evidenced by two reviews of available treatments for subfertility, data demonstrating benefit are lacking for the vast majority of fertility treatments, thus calling into question their routine clinical use.\n\n【3】So why are these treatments offered? The answer is not a pretty one. Increasingly, the field of assisted reproductive technologies is a commercial endeavour wherein couples who are unable to become pregnant are lured into treatments that are of claimed benefit for them. Websites of fertility clinics claim benefits but do not provide data or references that support these claims. Moreover, websites often display so-called success rates, but the way that these are presented is far from uniform and allows for substantial selective reporting. Increasing investment in assisted reproduction comes from venture capital, and multibillion companies are buying clinics and suppliers of pharmaceutical drugs and laboratory products. And of course, these companies and their shareholders want a return on their investment.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2019 Burger/Phanie/Science Photo Library</u>\n\n【4】So how to proceed? The way forward is simply to do more randomised clinical trials, such as now performed for PICSI. Now more than ever, we need to apply the principles of evidence-based medicine to reproductive medicine to allow for “the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients”. Additionally, governing bodies, such as the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, should increase their efforts to force clinics to present accurate information and to protect patients from treatments of unknown benefit and, even more important, from treatments of no known benefit. In countries with national health-care insurance that covers fertility treatments, insurance companies should refrain from subsidising treatments that are of unknown benefit unless such treatments are offered in the context of a properly designed clinical trial. Only in this way will couples be safeguarded from those with a commercial interest who strive for a return on investment above a proven benefit for patients.\n\n【5】删除9:<u>I declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The Conservative party's biggest electoral victory since the 1980s, predominantly based on the promise to “get Brexit done”, raises a number of questions about the UK's future.\n\n【1】In their election campaign manifesto , the Conservative party made several funding pledges for clinical health services (eg, extra funding for the National Health Service \\[NHS\\], 50 000 more nurses, and 50 million more general practitioner surgery appointments a year) but their plan for public health is less easy to discern. There was a welcome commitment in the manifesto for an extra £1 billion per year for social care and a pledge to bring into legislation the NHS Long-Term Plan that includes a focus on prevention through primary care services and greater use of digital technologies. However, the government's commitment to a wider and ambitious public health approach remains unclear. The reports published in _The Lancet Public Health_ urge the new government to commit and invest in public health to safeguard the most vulnerable in our society and address deepening inequalities in health and life outcomes.\n\n【2】Homelessness—a barometer of the increasing social injustices in UK society, as notes Rob Aldridge in his Comment—should be a source of concern for the government. A family becomes homeless every 13 min and a child becomes homeless every 8 min in Great Britain, according to the charity Shelter. In England, the number of homeless people has increased from around 1700 in 2010, to about 4700 in 2018. Aldridge advocates ending unsafe discharge of homeless people from hospital care, reinvesting in specialist integrated homeless health schemes, and providing more intermediate care facilities for those with chronic conditions. A systematic review and meta-analysis by Jacob Stubbs and colleagues highlights the increased health risk for homeless and marginally housed people, who have a much higher incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI). In a linked Comment, Jesse Young and Nathan Hughes note that people's first experience of homelessness and TBI tended to occur in adolescence, which stresses the importance of providing stable housing to young people in particular.\n\n【3】The rise in homelessness is one example of increasing inequalities in the UK. A study by Dan Lewer and colleagues reports the highly pattered and preventable social disadvantage that characterises England today. The authors examined the gap in premature mortality (before the age of 75 years) between English regions according to various measures of socioeconomic disadvantage. They estimated that 35·6% (877 082) of premature deaths between 2003–18 might be attributable to socioeconomic inequalities and would equate to an average of 1·2 years of life lost due to socioeconomic inequality. Inequality was greater among men, but worryingly the proportion of deaths attributable to inequality increased for women. That an estimated one in three premature deaths could be attributable to socioeconomic inequality make this “our most important public health challenge”, Lewer and colleagues concluded. For John Newton, such findings highlight the need for place-based policies and investment that tackle the underlying determinants of these social and geographical health inequalities.\n\n【4】Adding to this evidence, the study by Aline Dugravot and colleagues, also published in this issue, explored how socioeconomic inequalities might playout over the life course. Their 24-year follow-up study of the Whitehall II cohort of British civil servants found that socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with higher odds of transitioning into frailty, disability, or multimorbidity in older age, after which the odds of mortality were much higher—suggesting that primary prevention would be key here to reducing inequalities in mortality.\n\n【5】After a decade of austerity and the erosion of public services, short-term cash injections into clinical care are not going to address the country's growing health inequalities. Evidence from public health research documenting the links between poverty and health outcomes is unequivocal. Just 1 year ago, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, Philip Alston, concluded his visit in the UK with the damning statement “poverty is a political choice. Austerity could easily have spared the poor, if the political will had existed to do so”. The newly elected government needs to grasp the opportunity to rethink austerity and social justice in the UK—tackling upstream determinants of health should be the priority.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2020 REUTERS/Toby Melville</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: December 18, 2019\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(19)30255-5</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2019 The Author(s).

Cigarette smoke activates innate immune cells such as epithelial cells and macrophages by triggering pattern recognition receptors, either directly or indirectly via the release of damage-associated molecular patterns from stressed or dying cells. Activated dendritic cells induce adaptive immune responses encompassing T helper (Th1 and Th17) CD4+ T cells, CD8+ cytotoxicity, and B-cell responses, which lead to the development of lymphoid follicles on chronic inflammation. Viral and bacterial infections not only cause acute exacerbations of COPD, but also amplify and perpetuate chronic inflammation in stable COPD via pathogen-associated molecular patterns. We discuss the role of autoimmunity (autoantibodies), remodelling, extracellular matrix-derived fragments, impaired innate lung defences, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and dysregulation of microRNAs in the persistence of the pulmonary inflammation despite smoking cessation.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "946b72be-cd3e-4238-8785-0acd85d7584e", "title": "Joseph Rotblat's conscientious life in science and politics", "text": "【0】To the world at large, the late Joseph Rotblat is known as the Polish-born, British-based, scientist who worked on the Manhattan Project to build the atomic bomb, and for the rest of his life campaigned for the abolition of nuclear weapons. He, and the unofficial federation of European, American, Soviet, and other scientists that he founded, known as Pugwash, were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1995. To physicians, Rotblat is also known as a physicist who specialised in understanding the effects on living tissue of radiation and radioactive fallout and in developing nuclear medicine, through his long-held professorship of physics at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London.\n\n【1】_Keeper of the Nuclear Conscience_ , the first major biography of Rotblat, naturally devotes more space to the first, political, role than to the second, medical, one. But since the book's author, Andrew Brown, is himself a physician who practised for two decades as a radiation oncologist, Rotblat's lifelong interest in medicine runs as a thread through the narrative. Indeed, Brown is ideally matched with his subject, having previously written biographies of two scientists heavily involved in the cold war: the nuclear physicist James Chadwick (a key influence on Rotblat), and the biologist and Communist J D Bernal. The result is a thorough study of a modest, humane, and public-spirited individual—based on Rotblat's personal papers and the Pugwash archives, as well as personal interviews with Rotblat's circle.\n\n【2】War formed Rotblat. “As a boy Jo experienced the fear, poverty, and disruption of war, and he never forgot them”, writes Brown. Rotblat himself, interviewed at the age of 91 for the British Library Sound Archive, shied away from any discussion of his childhood in Warsaw during World War 1. By 1918, he said, his once-prosperous Jewish family was reduced to a state of “complete and abject penury, real hunger, disease and squalor”. For the rest of his life, he rejected potatoes because they reminded him of the bitter taste of frost-damaged tubers in his wartime diet. There was no money to complete his schooling and he was forced to work as an electrician, while attending Warsaw's Free University at night. He left Poland for Britain in 1939, just in time to avoid the Nazi invasion.\n\n【3】During World War 2, Rotblat worked on a meagre salary as a nuclear physicist in heavily bombed Liverpool, while his desperate family in Poland struggled to survive Hitler's Holocaust; his wife was an early victim, although he did not learn her probable fate until the autumn of 1945. Recruited by Chadwick to Los Alamos in early 1944, within months he learned that the Nazi project to build an atomic bomb had failed. He therefore resigned from the Manhattan Project—the only physicist to do so on ethical grounds—and returned to Liverpool. That decision brought him to the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a potential spy—a trunk containing his personal and scientific papers mysteriously vanished from the train carrying Rotblat from Washington, DC, to New York.\n\n【4】The dropping of the atomic bombs in August, 1945, and grief at the death of his wife, brought about a personal crisis. Rotblat decided not to return to Poland; to move into medical physics, so as to investigate techniques that might be of immediate benefit to human beings; and to devote his energy to ensuring that the atomic bomb would never again be used in a war. He even considered qualifying as a physician, but was advised by a medical collaborator that it would take too many years to attain a senior position. From 1950, when he moved to St Bartholomew's Hospital, Rotblat began to establish a talented team of medical physicists to undertake research in medical electronics and the biophysics of living cells, and to invent new ways to monitor patients undergoing surgery. But there were continual administrative problems: “the atmosphere surrounding \\[Rotblat's\\] department at Bart's was one of constant tension spiked with pettiness”, notes Brown, without fully explaining the source of the disagreement. No doubt part was the friction inevitable between established disciplines compelled to work closely together. However, Rotblat's driving personality may also have been a factor. A British Pugwash admirer told Brown that Rotblat resembled a great Russian general, with the qualities of “considerable charm combined with ruthlessness in a good cause, amazing stamina, and a tendency to megalomania”.\n\n【5】Rotblat's stamina emanates from each page of this engrossing biography. When he was 95, he wrote a vigorous piece for a book of mine on Albert Einstein, concerning Einstein's search for world peace—an inspiration for Pugwash in 1955. Well into his eighties, Rotblat would run down escalators in the London Underground. Once, a group of idling teenagers was in the way and told him: “What's the hurry? You're an old man.” An impatient Rotblat replied: “Don't you see? It's because I'm an old man that I'm in a hurry.”\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: 28 January 2012\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60131-7</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The incidence of diabetes is escalating to epidemic proportions and by 2025, the figure is expected to reach 380 million. The inexorable rise of diabetes parallels that of the obesity pandemic spreading throughout both industrialised and developing countries. In 2005, about 400 million adults were obese; it is anticipated that this will almost double by 2015. Diabetes accounts for around 6% of total global mortality, with 50% of diabetes-associated deaths being attributed to cardiovascular disease. Although the impending burden faced by health-care providers and services is immense, with appropriate management programmes and prevention strategies targeting high-risk individuals, much of the morbidity and mortality of diabetes are preventable.\n\n【3】Addressing diabetes in different subpopulations poses numerous clinical dilemmas. Notably, the predisposition to develop diabetes and the course of the disease varies by ethnic group. In today's _Lancet_ , Srikanth Bellary and colleagues describe findings from the United Kingdom Asian Diabetes Study, which highlights particular problems faced when managing diabetes among the UK south Asian population. For example, compared with white Europeans, individuals of south Asian origin tend to present with earlier onset type 2 diabetes and have a higher morbidity and mortality. Similarly, in the USA, Hispanics and African-Americans are disproportionately affected by diabetes, and experience more complications and higher mortality than white people.\n\n【4】Another emerging high-risk group includes children and young people. In today's _Lancet_ , Valma Harjutsalo and colleagues show that the incidence of type 1 diabetes in Finnish children is rising at such an accelerated rate that estimates for 2010 were surpassed by 2000. But it is not only type 1 diabetes that is becoming more prevalent in young people. An estimated 22 million children worldwide are obese or overweight, and, unsurprisingly, the greater occurrence of obesity in young people has been accompanied by an increase of early onset type 2 diabetes. This form of diabetes might have a more aggressive phenotype than that of adult onset, and although the longer-term health consequences of early onset diabetes have not been fully elucidated as yet, it seems inevitable that paediatricians could in future face the unenviable prospect of managing cardiovascular disease in this vulnerable group.\n\n【5】The risk for children can begin as early as in utero, with evidence suggesting that the offspring of women with gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing glucose intolerance and diabetes in later life. Mirroring the upward trend of diabetes and obesity, and worryingly for women and their children, the incidence of gestational diabetes is also spiralling upwards, now affecting up to 5% of pregnancies.\n\n【6】As the global burden of diabetes steadily escalates, there is a need for novel treatments to slow disease progression and achieve metabolic control. Research into newer ways to use established drugs, such as insulin and metformin, is underway. For example, in today's issue, Jianping Weng and colleagues show that early insulin therapy in type 2 diabetes has the potential to alter the disease course. Insulin is also being investigated in the prevention of type 1 diabetes in high-risk populations. Earlier this month the results from a large randomised open-label trial showed that perinatal outcomes following the use of metformin in gestational diabetes were no worse than when insulin was used, thereby offering these women increased treatment options. But it is not only the traditional medical aspects of diabetes that are the subject of intense scientific study; diabetes is also at the forefront of cutting edge research. Islet-cell transplant is now a clinical reality in ameliorating type 1 diabetes, and recent advances in stem cell research offer the hope of even a potential cure in the future.\n\n【7】We are continually learning more about the pathogenesis and management of diabetes, and its intertwining association with obesity and cardiovascular disease. Diabetes—a disease recognised centuries ago—has entered an era of exciting scientific research, discovery, and controversy. The challenge is to translate research findings into substantial clinical improvements for patients. Although prospects are hopeful, they are not assured.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【8】### Publication history\n\n【9】Published: 24 May 2008\n\n【10】### Identification\n\n【11】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60733-3</u>\n\n【12】### Copyright\n\n【13】© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of gentamicin as an alternative to ceftriaxone (both combined with azithromycin) for treatment of gonorrhoea.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】G-ToG was a multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic, randomised, non-inferiority trial comparing treatment with gentamicin to treatment with ceftriaxone for patients with gonorrhoea. The patients, treating physician, and assessing physician were masked to treatment but the treating nurse was not. The trial took place at 14 sexual health clinics in England. Adults aged 16–70 years were eligible for participation if they had a diagnosis of uncomplicated genital, pharyngeal, or rectal gonorrhoea. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single intramuscular dose of either gentamicin 240 mg (gentamicin group) or ceftriaxone 500 mg (ceftriaxone group). All participants also received a single 1 g dose of oral azithromycin. Randomisation (1:1) was stratified by clinic and performed using a secure web-based system. The primary outcome was clearance of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ at all initially infected sites, defined as a negative nucleic acid amplification test 2 weeks post treatment. Primary outcome analyses included only participants who had follow-up data, irrespective of the baseline visit _N gonorrhoeae_ test result. The margin used to establish non-inferiority was a lower confidence limit of 5% for the risk difference. 删除8:<u>This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN51783227.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of 1762 patients assessed, we enrolled 720 participants between Oct 7, 2014, and Nov 14, 2016, and randomly assigned 358 to gentamicin and 362 to ceftriaxone. Primary outcome data were available for 306 (85%) of 362 participants allocated to ceftriaxone and 292 (82%) of 358 participants allocated to gentamicin. At 2 weeks after treatment, infection had cleared for 299 (98%) of 306 participants in the ceftriaxone group compared with 267 (91%) of 292 participants in the gentamicin group (adjusted risk difference −6·4%, 95% CI −10·4% to −2·4%). Of the 328 participants who had a genital infection, 151 (98%) of 154 in the ceftriaxone group and 163 (94%) of 174 in the gentamicin group had clearance at follow-up (adjusted risk difference −4·4%, −8·7 to 0). For participants with a pharyngeal infection, a greater proportion receiving ceftriaxone had clearance at follow-up (108 \\[96%\\] in the ceftriaxone group compared with 82 \\[80%\\] in the gentamicin group; adjusted risk difference −15·3%, −24·0 to −6·5). Similarly, a greater proportion of participants with rectal infection in the ceftriaxone group had clearance (134 \\[98%\\] in the ceftriaxone group compared with 107 \\[90%\\] in the gentamicin group; adjusted risk difference −7·8%, −13·6 to −2·0). Thus, we did not find that a single dose of gentamicin 240 mg was non-inferior to a single dose of ceftriaxone 500 mg for the treatment of gonorrhoea, when both drugs were combined with a 1 g dose of oral azithromycin. The side-effect profiles were similar between groups, although severity of pain at the injection site was higher for gentamicin (mean visual analogue pain score 36 of 100 in the gentamicin group vs 21 of 100 in the ceftriaxone group).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Gentamicin is not appropriate as first-line treatment for gonorrhoea but remains potentially useful for patients with isolated genital infection, or for patients who are allergic or intolerant to ceftriaxone, or harbour a ceftriaxone-resistant isolate. Further research is required to identify and test new alternatives to ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】UK National Institute for Health Research.\n\n【10】</u>Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Each year gonorrhoea accounts for over 40 000 infections in the UK and around 78 million infections globally, with a disproportionate burden in young adults, men who have sex with men, and specific ethnic groups. Infection leads to local inflammation causing genital pain and discomfort, and localised immune activation that facilitates the acquisition and transmission of HIV. For women, infection can spread to the fallopian tubes and ovaries causing pelvic inflammatory disease with resultant tubal scarring, infertility, chronic pelvic pain, and an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. For men, infection can spread to the testicles leading to epididymo-orchitis, and men who have sex with men are at an increased risk of proctitis, which can lead to abscess and fistula formation.\n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【14】Two systematic reviews evaluated the efficacy of gentamicin for the treatment of gonorrhoea. They included randomised trials, quasi-randomised trials, and prospective studies with concurrent controls published between Jan 1, 1950, and June 2, 2014. We also searched MEDLINE and Embase for studies published between Jan 1, 2013, and Dec 12, 2017, using the terms “gonorrhoea/gonorrhea/Neisseria gonorrhoeae” and “gentamicin”. In total, six studies assessed single-dose gentamicin treatment, of which three were randomised trials, one was quasi-randomised, and two were non-randomised. Cure rates of 62% to 100% were reported with gentamicin treatment. Methodology was poorly described and there was a high risk of bias within most studies. The largest and best quality study was a non-comparative evaluation of 157 patients, which reported that gentamicin cured 100% of infections. This study used a relatively less sensitive culture technique to diagnose and assess cure, and included few extra-genital gonorrhoea infections (ten pharyngeal, one rectal). Gentamicin was administered with a 2 g dose of azithromycin. The combined regimen was poorly tolerated, causing nausea in 26% of patients and vomiting in 10%.\n\n【15】**Added value of this study**\n\n【16】Because of antibiotic resistance, treatment options for gonorrhoea are diminishing. G-ToG is the first randomised trial to compare gentamicin with the current first-line treatment, ceftriaxone, for gonorrhoea. We were unable to conclude that gentamicin was non-inferior to ceftriaxone, and treatment failure with gentamicin was higher than with ceftriaxone for patients with extra-genital infections. Cure rates for genital infections were similar between groups, so for these patients gentamicin might be a candidate for second-line therapy. Single-dose gentamicin was safe and well tolerated.\n\n【17】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【18】Ceftriaxone should remain the first-line treatment for gonorrhoea, with gentamicin as an alternative particularly for patients with genital infections, and those who are allergic or intolerant to ceftriaxone, or harbour ceftriaxone-resistant gonococci. Further research is required to identify and test new alternatives to ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea.\n\n【19】The causative organism, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae,_ readily develops resistance to antibiotics. High-level resistance to penicillins, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, and quinolones has led to these no longer being recommended as treatment. Current guidance is to treat with intramuscular ceftriaxone, either as monotherapy or as dual therapy combined with azithromycin. Surveillance data in the UK show a reduction in susceptibility to ceftriaxone over time, with an upward drift in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). A similar reduction in susceptibility to other antimicrobials used for gonorrhoea was followed by widespread treatment failure, and sporadic clinical failure of cephalosporins has been reported. If ceftriaxone becomes ineffective, options for treatment are limited. With the exception of gentamicin, alternative drugs have either not been assessed in patients (eg, ertapenem, piperacillin-tazobactam), are still in development before licensing (eg, zoliflodacin, gepotidicin), are reserved for other infections (eg, rifampicin for tuberculosis), or have the potential for resistance to develop rapidly (eg, azithromycin, spectinomycin). Untreatable, multidrug-resistant gonorrhoea is a real possibility, and new clinical trial data are needed to inform treatment guidelines. WHO and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control have called for urgent research into the efficacy of new regimens to treat gonorrhoea, including combination regimens and the assessment of antimicrobial efficacy at extra-genital sites. Effective, safe, and low-cost treatment in low-income and middle-income countries is particularly needed; many of these countries have a high burden of gonorrhoea infection.\n\n【20】Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that inhibits protein synthesis by irreversibly binding to 30S ribosomal subunits. Studies in the 1970s and 1980s assessed gentamicin for treatment of gonorrhoea, but all studies were small and had a high risk of bias. The dose used in these studies was usually 240 mg (ranging from 160 mg to 5mg/kg), with no apparent dose response effect across studies and no reported adverse events associated with the drug. In-vitro susceptibility testing suggests that _N gonorrhoeae_ remains susceptible to gentamicin although the in-vivo response and associated susceptibility breakpoints have been poorly characterised. Gentamicin can cause ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity, but the frequency and severity of these adverse events following a single dose is not known.\n\n【21】Recent systematic reviews of gentamicin for the treatment of (mostly urogenital) gonorrhoea report its clinical and microbiological cure rate to be around 62–98%. Data on its efficacy when treating pharyngeal or rectal gonorrhoea are scarce, although antibiotics for gonorrhoea are sometimes less effective at these sites. A large randomised non-comparative trial reported a 100% cure rate when gentamicin was combined with 2 g oral azithromycin, but a high incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects reduced the tolerability of this regimen.\n\n【22】The aim of our study was to assess whether single-dose gentamicin therapy is an acceptable alternative to ceftriaxone for the treatment of gonorrhoea, when both antibiotics are combined with azithromycin.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Study design and participants\n\n【25】G-ToG was a multicentre, parallel-group, pragmatic, randomised, non-inferiority trial comparing treatment with gentamicin to treatment with ceftriaxone for patients with gonorrhoea. The trial took place at 14 sexual health clinics in England. Ethics approval was obtained from the Health Research Authority South Central–Oxford C Research Ethics Committee (14/SC/1030). The study protocol is available online.\n\n【26】Adults aged 16–70 years were eligible for participation if they had a diagnosis of untreated genital, pharyngeal, or rectal gonorrhoea (ie, they had not received any antibiotic in the previous 28 days that could have treated gonorrhoea, either partially or completely). To reflect normal practice, all patients who had an initial positive test for gonorrhoea and presented for treatment were eligible for inclusion. Diagnosis was based on detection of intracellular Gram-negative diplococci by microscopy (urethral, cervical, vaginal, or rectal specimens), or by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) from first void urine, urethral, endocervical, vulvovaginal, pharyngeal or rectal swabs. Any licensed NAAT test platform result was accepted for assessing eligibility for inclusion into the trial. Exclusion criteria were known concurrent bacterial sexually transmitted infections apart from chlamydia; known bacterial vaginosis or _Trichomonas vaginalis_ infection; known contraindications or allergy to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, or lidocaine; complicated gonorrhoea infection, for example pelvic inflammatory disease or epididymo-orchitis; and patient weight being less than 40 kg. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were also excluded. Patients were only eligible to participate in the trial once. They provided written informed consent at their initial consultation.\n\n【27】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【28】Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a single intramuscular dose of either gentamicin 240 mg (gentamicin group) or ceftriaxone 500 mg (ceftriaxone group). All participants also received a single 1 g dose of oral azithromycin. Randomisation was stratified by clinic and performed with a secure web-based system. We used a computer-generated pseudo-random code with permuted blocks of randomly varying size created by the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit in accordance with their standard operating procedure. The allocated treatment was administered from routine clinic stock. To maintain blinding the system confirmed that randomisation had been successful when a member of the research team randomised a participant, but did not reveal the allocated treatment. A nurse who was trained only in the trial's treatment administration procedure and not involved with any other trial procedures then logged onto the randomisation system to determine which treatment had been allocated, and administered the injection and oral azithromycin. The nurse who gave the injection did not reveal the treatment allocation to participants, research staff or investigators, who all remained masked to treatment. The allocation sequence remained concealed until the database was locked at the end of the trial.\n\n【29】### Procedures\n\n【30】Ceftriaxone 500 mg in powder formulation was dissolved in 1% lidocaine and administered as a single 2 mL intramuscular injection. Gentamicin 240 mg (3 × 80 mg in 2 mL vials) was administered as a single 6 mL intramuscular injection. All participants also received a single oral dose of 1 g azithromycin. All participants were asked to avoid sexual contact until review after 2 weeks.\n\n【31】Participants provided samples for _N gonorrhoeae_ testing before treatment. These samples varied by gender and sexual orientation: for heterosexual men, NAAT and culture testing were done from urethra samples (a first pass urine sample could be taken as an alternative to the urethra for NAAT); for men who have sex with men, NAAT and culture testing were done from urethra, pharynx, and rectum samples (a urine sample could be taken as an alternative to the urethra for NAAT); for women, NAAT and culture testing were done from cervix, pharynx, and rectum samples (a vaginal sample could be taken as an alternative to the cervix for NAAT). Follow-up was 2 weeks after treatment, when NAAT and culture testing for _N gonorrhoeae_ was repeated for sites that had been positive at baseline. All baseline and post-treatment samples were required to be tested with NAAT (Aptima Combo 2, Hologic, MA, USA). If the local laboratory did not use Aptima Combo 2 NAAT, additional samples were tested at Public Health England (London, UK). Culture specimens were processed according to local laboratory procedures, and pure viable cultures confirmed to be _N gonorrhoeae_ were frozen to −70°C or below and shipped to Public Health England for antimicrobial sensitivity testing. Blood samples for creatinine measurement (allowing calculation of the estimated glomerular filtration rate) were taken at baseline and at follow-up 2 weeks after treatment.\n\n【32】### Outcomes\n\n【33】The primary outcome was clearance of _N gonorrhoeae_ at all initially infected sites, defined as a negative NAAT 2 weeks after treatment. Secondary outcomes were clinical resolution of symptoms, change in renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) and comparative cost-effectiveness at 2 weeks. The relationship between clearance of _N gonorrhoeae_ and in-vitro measurement of antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was also investigated as a secondary outcome, using Etests (BioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) on GC base agar (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) with 1% Vitox (Oxoid, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Basingstoke, UK). Safety outcomes were the frequency of known side-effects (nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, dizziness, rash), frequency of any other adverse events reported by participants, and tolerability of the treatment injection measured on a visual analogue scale, where 0 represented no pain and 100 the worst imaginable pain. The results of the cost-effectiveness analyses will not be presented in this paper.\n\n【34】### Statistical analysis\n\n【35】Based on 96% clearance for the ceftriaxone regimen, a total sample size of 646 participants (323 in each group) was required to detect non-inferiority with a lower confidence limit of 5% for the risk difference, with 90% power and 0·025 one-sided significance. To allow for loss to follow-up of 10%, the trial had a target recruitment of 720 participants.\n\n【36】The primary approach to between-group comparisons was to analyse participants according to randomised allocation without imputation of missing outcome data. Planned analysis of the primary outcome was modified, before the database was locked and treatment codes revealed. The initial analysis plan in the protocol was to compare gentamicin with ceftriaxone with a general linear model for binary outcome adjusted by clinic site, with the primary efficacy parameter being the risk difference in the proportion of participants clear of infection at follow-up, along with the 95% confidence interval. However, additional clinics joined the trial, some of which recruited small numbers of participants. This meant that there was the chance that some clinics would have no participants whose infection had not cleared, making the inclusion of clinic as a fixed effect inappropriate. Therefore, we modified the between-group comparative analyses to use generalised estimating equations for binary outcomes adjusted by recruiting clinic as a random effect with robust standard errors. The generalised estimating equation model used an identity link function to enable estimation of adjusted risk difference. Gentamicin was to be regarded as non-inferior if the lower 95% confidence limit for the risk difference (gentamicin group _vs_ ceftriaxone group) in confirmed clearance was −5 percentage points or greater (ie, closer to zero). Analysis of the primary outcome included only participants who had follow-up data, irrespective of the baseline visit _N gonorrhoeae_ test result (since this was a pragmatic trial). Sensitivity analyses were done to assess the robustness of the primary outcome analysis, and included multiple imputation using chained equations, assuming all missing data were cleared and not cleared, excluding participants who did not have any positive baseline samples, excluding those who had not received their allocated treatment, and excluding those who did not have a full set of baseline samples.\n\n【37】Secondary outcomes were similarly analysed using appropriate regression models dependent on data type, adjusted for clinic site and baseline value of the outcome variable if collected. All participants who had follow-up data were included in the analyses of secondary outcomes. Clearance at each site was investigated separately for each infection site. MIC data were summarised per participant. The relationship between clinical effectiveness and MIC was examined by plotting the distribution of the highest MIC detected per participant categorised by clearance at all sites at 2 weeks.\n\n【38】Safety and tolerability analyses were descriptive; all participants who received treatment were included in the safety analyses. Frequency counts and percentages of the pre-specified main categories of side-effects were presented by treatment group. Adverse events were coded using MedDRA (version 17.1) and summarised by system organ class.\n\n【39】All analyses were done with Stata/SE 13.1. Full details of the analysis are documented in the statistical analysis plan, which was finalised before database lock and release of treatment allocation codes for analysis. An independent data monitoring committee oversaw the trial and had access to unblinded data by treatment group, prepared by a statistician who was independent to the trial team. 删除8:<u>This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN51783227.</u>\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【40】The study was funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme.

The main reasons for exclusion were participants not being interested, the trial taking too much time, a belief that the standard treatment would be successful and the trial taking too many extra or intrusive samples. 14 participants did not receive their allocated medication; four in the ceftriaxone group and ten in the gentamicin group 删除2:<u>( figure 1 )</u>. 96 participants did not return for their follow-up visit. 26 participants who returned for their follow-up visit did not have primary outcome data because of incorrect sampling. Primary outcome data were therefore available for 306 (85%) of 362 participants allocated to ceftriaxone and 292 (82%) of 358 participants allocated to gentamicin.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Trial profile</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【43】Baseline characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups 删除2:<u>( table 1 )</u>.

The trial was not designed to assess superiority, but the 6·4% greater clearance of infection in the ceftriaxone group and the consistency of the findings on sensitivity analyses suggest that ceftriaxone is than gentamicin for the microbiological cure of gonorrhoea. Clearance of infection with gentamicin was markedly lower for pharyngeal and rectal gonorrhoea, although gentamicin performed better for genital gonorrhoea, achieving microbiological cure in 94% of infections compared with 98% of infections for ceftriaxone.\n\n【68】Two systematic reviews have reported wide variation in the efficacy of gentamicin for the treatment of gonorrhoea and noted a substantial risk of bias in previous studies. A more recent study evaluating intramuscular gentamicin 240 mg combined with oral azithromycin 2 g reported a 100% cure rate (95% CI 97·6–100). This study differed from G-ToG by including few women and only a small number of participants with pharyngeal and rectal infections, and by using cultures to diagnose gonorrhoea and a 2 g dose of azithromycin. The large number of extra-genital sites of infection analysed in G-ToG, with their associated lower cure rates, provides a partial explanation for the different treatment efficacies reported in previous studies.\n\n【69】Dual therapy with azithromycin 1 g did not prevent treatment failure in a substantial proportion of participants receiving gentamicin. Azithromycin monotherapy as a single dose of either 1 g or 2 g has been previously shown as an effective treatment for gonorrhoea, when culture was used to diagnose infection and assess cure. However, a reduced in vitro sensitivity to azithromycin has been reported in many geographical locations and occurs in 5% of gonorrhoea infections in England and Wales; an outbreak of high-level resistance was recently reported in England.\n\n【70】Most gonococcal isolates from participants in G-ToG (262 \\[96%\\] of 274) had azithromycin MICs of 0·5 mg/L or lower. Two (17%) of the 12 azithromycin-resistant isolates with MICs greater than 0·5 mg/L were from patients who had treatment failure, but the majority of treatment failures (11 \\[69%\\] of 16) occurred in participants who had isolates with a MIC of 0·25 mg/L or lower, with the remaining three \\[19%\\] harbouring azithromycin MICs of 0·5 mg/L (intermediate susceptibility). Thus, we found in vitro azithromycin resistance did not reliably predict treatment failure with the 1 g azithromycin dose if we assume gentamicin had failed to treat the infection. A poor association between pre-treatment azithromycin MIC and cure has been reported by others, with emergence of in vivo resistance. A higher dose of azithromycin than the 1 g dose used in G-ToG (eg, 2 g) might be more effective, but without a direct comparative study this is speculative, and a 2 g dose is also poorly tolerated leading to nausea in 26% and vomiting in 10% of patients in a recent study. An extended-release formulation of azithromycin with lower peak drug concentrations might reduce the incidence of side effects and improve tolerability compared with the immediate-release formulation, but there are limited data comparing these formulations.\n\n【71】Current treatment guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO recommend dual therapies which incorporate azithromycin 1 g, to reduce the development of resistance in _N gonorrhoeae_ by providing additional microbiological cover. In GToG we found substantial microbiological failure when 1 g of azithromycin was used as part of the dual therapy, suggesting that azithromycin component might not be achieving this microbiological cover, particularly in patients with extra-genital infections.\n\n【72】Both ceftriaxone and gentamicin were well tolerated when combined with azithromycin. Nausea was the most common side effect, occurring in 12% of participants receiving ceftriaxone plus azithromycin and in 14% of participants receiving gentamicin plus azithromycin. Nausea and vomiting are uncommon side-effects of ceftriaxone (incidence ≥1/1000 to <1/100 exposures) and have been reported in association with gentamicin, but are common following use of oral azithromycin (≥1/100 to <1/10 exposures). The gastrointestinal side-effects reported in G-ToG were likely principally caused by azithromycin, although the higher reported frequency of vomiting in those receiving gentamicin suggests that gentamicin might also have been a contributing factor. Gentamicin was associated with more injection site pain than ceftriaxone (mean pain score was 36 with gentamicin compared with 21 with ceftriaxone) and it took longer to resolve (median 1·5 h with gentamicin compared with 1 h with ceftriaxone); probably related to the larger volume of injection administered (6 mL for gentamicin _vs_ 2 mL for ceftriaxone) and the local anaesthetic effect of lidocaine as the dissolving agent for ceftriaxone.\n\n【73】Gentamicin is potentially vestibulotoxic and can cause dizziness, ataxia, and nystagmus. Most previous gentamicin studies have evaluated a prolonged course of treatment and the safety of a single dose is less well characterised, but a recent systematic review of single dose therapy found vestibulotoxicity to be rare, which is consistent with our findings. Gentamicin can also cause renal impairment following reuptake of the drug in the proximal renal tubule where it is concentrated. A transient rise in creatinine is common when single dose gentamicin is used as antibiotic prophylaxis in elderly, surgical patients, but this rise is less likely to occur in younger, healthier individuals and the estimated glomerular filtration rate did not significantly change in G-ToG participants (mean difference −1·4 mL/min).\n\n【74】The mechanisms for development of gentamicin resistance are not fully understood but might include decreased cell membrane permeability and modification of the drug by cellular enzymes. In vitro measurement of the MIC provides a phenotypic assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility, but the breakpoint MIC value (below which clinical cure occurs and above which gentamicin is ineffective) has not been established. The extent to which gentamicin penetrates into rectal and pharyngeal tissue is not known but has been reported to be suboptimal in the pharynx for spectinomycin, which belongs to a similar antibiotic class. It has been tentatively suggested that an isolate with a MIC lower than 8 mg/L is susceptible, with a MIC of 8 to 16 mg/L has intermediate susceptibility, and a MIC greater than 16 mg/L is resistant. The European Network for Sexually Transmitted Infection Surveillance found that 95% of gonococcal isolates had gentamicin MICs in the range of 4 to 8 mg/L, similar to GToG participants after accounting for differences in testing methodology. The MIC in G-ToG participants was not, however, predictive of treatment failure; only three isolates had a MIC greater than 4 mg/L and all three participants were cleared of infection. Of those isolates with a MIC of 4 mg/L treated with gentamicin, 12 (13%) failed therapy compared with 81 (87%) which were cleared. It is possible that a higher dose of gentamicin would be more effective, although the limited association between gentamicin MIC and clinical response does not directly support this.\n\n【75】An antagonistic interaction between gentamicin and azithromycin could potentially reduce the efficacy of this drug combination; in vitro testing does not suggest either antagonism or synergy, and the potential for a high cure rate with this regimen for genital infections diagnosed by culture has been shown. A clinically important interaction between both drugs is therefore unlikely.\n\n【76】The robust design of the G-ToG trial resulted in well-balanced treatment groups and a low risk of bias. The trial was appropriately powered, pragmatic in design, and likely to be relevant to clinical practice in the UK and other countries with similar health-care systems. It included symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, a wide age range, HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals, men and women, heterosexual men and men who have sex with men, cases of genital and extra-genital infections, and a wide variety of ethnic groups. The distribution of age, gender, ethnicity, and sites of infection for participants in G-ToG were comparable to those in the UK Gonoccocal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme suggesting that our results are widely applicable.\n\n【77】Unexpectedly, a number of participants who were recruited to the trial were found to have a negative NAAT at their baseline visit (50 \\[14%\\] of 358 participants in the ceftriaxone group and 44 \\[12%\\] of 353 in the gentamicin group) despite having been tested previously and found to be positive, and being recalled to the clinic to be given antibiotic treatment. In routine clinical practice a NAAT would not be repeated before treatment. The apparent spontaneous reversion from positive to negative NAAT observed in these trial participants could have resulted from an initial false positive NAAT before trial entry, a false negative NAAT at the baseline trial visit, or natural clearance of gonorrhoea without antibiotic therapy. A previous large study has reported spontaneous clearance of pharyngeal gonorrhoea in 139 (6%) of 2204 of patients, which would be consistent with our findings. However, although NAATs for _N gonorrhoeae_ have high sensitivities and specificities we cannot exclude the possibility of some false positive or false negative results, especially when testing a low-prevalence population. The occurrence of negative tests in some patients at their baseline visit does not bias our results since they were equally distributed between the treatment groups, and a secondary sensitivity analyses excluding these participants (adjusted risk difference −7·1%, 95% CI −11·4% to −2·8%) was consistent with the primary intention-to-treat analysis. The NAAT test can remain positive for several days following effective treatment of gonorrhoea, but the test of cure was taken at least 14 days after receiving antibiotics in accordance with UK national guidance to minimise this possibility. Additionally, because of the randomised trial design, a false positive test-of-cure would not bias our results.\n\n【78】In conclusion, we found that gentamicin plus azithromycin cannot be considered non-inferior to ceftriaxone plus azithromycin, with a relatively higher frequency of treatment failure occurring in patients with extra-genital gonorrhoea who were treated with gentamicin. Gentamicin cannot therefore be recommended to replace ceftriaxone as first-line therapy for gonorrhoea. However, gentamicin combined with 1 g azithromycin achieved a cure rate of 94% for genital gonorrhoea and its use might be appropriate in patients who are allergic, intolerant, or harbour a ceftriaxone-resistant infection. A 1 g dose of azithromycin as a component of dual therapy for gonorrhoea had limited efficacy in treating gentamicin-resistant infections and this suggests that its widespread use to prevent development of resistance requires review.\n删除4:<u>\n**This online publication has been corrected.

Our primary aim was to find out whether recombinant interferons reduced the number of patients who had clinical exacerbations and disease progression, compared with placebo.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】The seven trials that met our criteria included 1215 randomised patients: data from 667 (55%) were available for analysis at 1 year's and from 919 (76%) at 2 years' follow-up. Interferon seemed to reduce the number of patients who had exacerbations during the first year of treatment (relative risk 0·73, 95% CI 0·54–0·99), but results at 2 years' follow-up were not robust and were difficult to interpret because of the many dropouts. Although the number of patients who had exacerbations (0·81, 0·74–0·89) or progressed (0·70, 0·55–0·88) during the first 2 years fell significantly in the protocol analysis, results were inconclusive after sensitivity analyses for exacerbations (1·11, 0·73–1·68) and disease progression (1·31, 0·60–2·89). Data were insufficient to establish whether steroid use and admissions to hospital were reduced in the interferon group. Similarly, MRI outcome data could not be analysed quantitatively. Side-effects were common, and acute toxic effects adversely affected quality of life.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Recombinant interferons slightly reduce the number of patients who have exacerbations during first year of treatment. Their clinical effect beyond 1 year is uncertain and new trials are needed to assess their long-term effectiveness and side-effects.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【9】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【10】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【11】One-time access price info\n\n【12】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【13】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【14】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【15】### Subscribe:\n\n【16】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【17】Already a print subscriber?

Patients surviving the commonest subtype of intracranial haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage, are at risk of both haemorrhagic and occlusive vascular events, but whether antiplatelet therapy can be used safely is unclear.

Computerised randomisation incorporating minimisation allocated participants (1:1) to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy. We followed participants for the primary outcome (recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage) for up to 5 years.

The risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage is probably too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】British Heart Foundation.\n\n【10】</u>Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Adults with stroke due to spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage often have a history of occlusive vascular disease, such as myocardial infarction or ischaemic stroke. Consequently, at least a third of adults in high-income countries are taking oral antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) drugs at the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage. Generally, antithrombotic drugs are immediately discontinued because of the risk of early haematoma growth. Discontinuation of these drugs is often permanent because of the perceived risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage. However, the risk of occlusive vascular events might be higher, so resumption of antithrombotic therapy might be beneficial overall.\n\n【12】Results of randomised trials have found a favourable balance of the benefits and risks of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular disease for a variety of conditions, but these trials excluded people with a history of major bleeding. Therefore, no published randomised trials are available on whether long-term antithrombotic therapy is safe or beneficial for survivors of intracerebral haemorrhage overall, or in subgroups who are at higher risk of bleeding, such as people with lobar intracerebral haemorrhage.\n\n【13】The use of antiplatelet therapy for about 2 days did not result in adverse effects for patients who had been enrolled in randomised trials of aspirin, without knowing their stroke was due to intracerebral haemorrhage. In the longer term (months to years), findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies of patients with any type of intracranial haemorrhage (ie, intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural haemorrhage) showed lower risks of occlusive vascular events and no difference in haemorrhagic events associated with resumption compared with avoidance of antiplatelet therapy. Small, non-randomised observational studies of patients with intracerebral haemorrhage have reported similar associations with starting antiplatelet therapy compared with its avoidance. Because of the paucity of evidence, no guidelines with strong recommendations about long-term antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage are available, so variations in clinical practice occur. Therefore, randomised controlled trials are needed to establish whether to use antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage.\n\n【14】**Research in context**\n\n【15】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【16】The Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials found that aspirin use for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular disease reduces risk of major vascular events, even though it might increase the risk of intracranial haemorrhage (a composite of intracerebral, subarachnoid, or subdural haemorrhages). However, these trials excluded patients with intracerebral haemorrhage, the commonest subtype of intracranial haemorrhage with the worst outcome. We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE (from 1948), Ovid Embase (from 1980), online registries of clinical trials, and bibliographies of relevant publications on Jan 28, 2019, 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u> for randomised controlled trials of starting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage, from database inception until Jan 28, 2019, without language restrictions. We found no completed randomised controlled trials. A meta-analysis of observational studies found no difference in the risk of haemorrhagic events and a lower risk of occlusive vascular events associated with antiplatelet therapy resumption after any type of intracranial haemorrhage.\n\n【17】**Added value of this study**\n\n【18】The REstart or STop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial (RESTART) is the first randomised controlled trial comparing the effects of starting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy for patients with previous intracerebral haemorrhage that occurred while taking antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) therapy. Participants allocated to start antiplatelet therapy experienced proportionally (but not statistically) fewer recurrences of intracerebral haemorrhage (adjusted hazard ratio 0·51 \\[95% CI 0·25–1·03\\]; p=0·060), fewer major haemorrhagic events (0·71 \\[0·39–1·30\\]; p=0·27), and similar numbers of major occlusive vascular events (1·02 \\[0·65–1·60\\]; p=0·92), compared with participants allocated to avoid antiplatelet therapy. These results exclude all but a very modest increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy. The risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage is probably too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular disease.\n\n【19】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【20】RESTART's findings provide reassurance about the safety of antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage that occurred while taking antithrombotic therapy. Replication of these findings and investigation of the possibility that antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage require further investigation in ongoing randomised trials (RESTART-Fr NCT02966119 and STATICH NCT03186729), a subsequent meta-analysis of RESTART, and an adequately powered definitive randomised controlled trial.\n\n【21】We initiated the REstart or STop Antithrombotics Randomised Trial (RESTART) with the aim of estimating the relative and absolute effects of starting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy on recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage and whether this risk might exceed any reduction of occlusive vascular events.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Study design\n\n【24】RESTART was an investigator-led, pragmatic, multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded endpoint, parallel-group trial in 122 hospitals in the UK. The Scotland A Research Ethics Committee approved the trial protocol (Nov 2, 2012). The trial co-sponsors were the University of Edinburgh and National Health Service Lothian Health Board. The patient reference group for the Research to Understand Stroke due to Haemorrhage ( RUSH ) programme reviewed the study materials and progress. The trial steering committee and co-sponsors approved the trial protocol and the statistical analysis plan. \n\n【25】### Participants\n\n【26】We included adults (≥18 years) who had survived at least 24 h after spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage confirmed by brain imaging and were taking antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) therapy for the prevention of occlusive vascular disease at the onset of intracerebral haemorrhage, after which therapy was discontinued. Patients were ineligible if the intracerebral haemorrhage was attributable to preceding head injury, haemorrhagic transformation of an ischaemic stroke, or intracranial haemorrhage without intracerebral haemorrhage; if they were still taking antithrombotic therapy at the time of consent (ie, after intracerebral haemorrhage); if they were pregnant, breastfeeding, or of childbearing age and not taking contraception; or if they or their carer was unable to understand spoken or written English. Patients, or their nearest relative or representative if the patient did not have mental capacity, provided written informed consent in inpatient or outpatient hospital settings. Participants could be enrolled if they or their nearest relative, and their physician in secondary care, were uncertain about whether to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy and had consented, in which case randomisation was done at least 24 h after stroke symptom onset.\n\n【27】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【28】Investigators supplied complete information about participants' demographics, comorbidities, functional status, previous antithrombotic therapy, intracerebral haemorrhage, and their preferred antiplatelet therapy into a database via a secure web interface with in-built validation to ensure complete baseline data before randomisation. A central computerised randomisation system incorporating a minimisation algorithm randomly assigned participants (1:1) to start or avoid antiplatelet therapy. The algorithm randomly allocated the first participant with a probability of 0·5 to one group of the trial. Thereafter, adaptive stratification (ie, minimisation) allocated each subsequent participant with a probability of 0·8 to the group that minimised differences between the two groups of the trial with respect to five baseline variables: qualifying intracerebral haemorrhage location (lobar _vs_ non-lobar); time since symptom onset (1–6 days, 7–30 days, >30 days); antiplatelet therapy preferred by the patient's physician if allocated to start (aspirin alone _vs_ other antiplatelet therapy); participant age at randomisation (<70 years _vs_ ≥70 years); and predicted probability of being alive and independent at 6 months (<0·15 _vs_ ≥0·15). The five variables were weighted equally, and the weights were constant over the duration of recruitment. The web interface displayed each participant's unique study identification number and their allocation to either starting or avoiding antiplatelet therapy, which was also sent in an email to all investigators at the hospital site, having been concealed until that point. If the participant was allocated to start antiplatelet therapy, the system reminded investigators to prescribe the prespecified preferred antiplatelet therapy within 24 h.\n\n【29】Treatment allocation was open to participants, the clinicians caring for them in primary and secondary care, and local investigators. Staff following up the participants at the trial coordinating centre were masked to treatment allocation. Outcome event adjudicators were masked to participant identity, treatment allocation, and drug use.\n\n【30】### Procedures\n\n【31】Participants who had not already been imaged with MRI but complied with the trial's MRI protocol, and who were able and willing to undergo brain MRI, provided informed consent and had a brain MRI scan before randomisation. After randomisation, anyone of a panel of consultant neuroradiologists (PMW, DPM, DM, PB, JCduP, or YJ), who was masked to treatment allocation, used the web-based Systematic Image Review System tool to review anonymised DICOM images of diagnostic brain CT or MRI to confirm or refute eligibility and to support the adjudication of cerebral outcome events.\n\n【32】The intervention of starting antiplatelet therapy was restricted to the use of one or more of oral aspirin, dipyridamole, or clopidogrel, begun within 24 h of randomisation with doses determined at the discretion of the consultant responsible for the participant. The comparator was a policy of avoiding antiplatelet therapy (ie, no placebo group). Participants were permitted to start or discontinue antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy if clinically indicated by events during follow-up, regardless of treatment allocation. We measured adherence after randomisation regardless of treatment allocation by recording antiplatelet therapy use before the first outcome event according to the preceding clinic or hospital discharge form or follow-up questionnaire. We collected information about blood-pressure lowering drugs and blood pressure control at discharge and during follow-up.\n\n【33】We followed up participants by sending a postal questionnaire to their primary care practitioners (who hold a comprehensive lifelong medical record for each patient registered with them), followed by a postal questionnaire to surviving participants (or carers) who had not withdrawn, to check vital status, medication use, modified Rankin scale score, and the occurrence of outcomes. We sent questionnaires at set intervals after randomisation (6 months or 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, and 5 years). Participants who did not respond to the questionnaire were interviewed by phone. \n\n【34】We recorded serious adverse events (that were neither an outcome event nor an expected complication of stroke) via investigators if they occurred before hospital discharge or via primary care practitioners' annual reports of hospital admissions. Investigators reported protocol deviations and violations to the trial coordinating centre and the sponsor.\n\n【35】Monitoring included central statistical monitoring of trial conduct, data quality, and participant safety, supplemented by triggered onsite monitoring visits if required and detailed source data verification at the trial coordinating centre. All baseline and outcome data underwent completeness, range, consistency, validation, and logic checks within the web-based case report forms.\n\n【36】### Outcomes\n\n【37】The primary outcome was fatal or non-fatal radiographically or pathologically proven recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage assessed in all participants (except one participant who withdrew before the first follow-up). The secondary outcomes were a composite of all major haemorrhagic events and a composite of all major occlusive vascular events. Major haemorrhagic events included recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (primary outcome), other forms of symptomatic spontaneous or traumatic intracranial haemorrhage, and symptomatic major extracranial haemorrhage at any site (requiring transfusion or endoscopic treatment or surgery, or resulting in death within 30 days). Major occlusive vascular events were ischaemic stroke; myocardial infarction; mesenteric ischaemia; peripheral arterial occlusion; deep vein thrombosis; pulmonary embolism; and carotid, coronary, or peripheral arterial revascularisation procedures. The composite secondary outcome of all major haemorrhagic or occlusive vascular events combined these two composite outcomes. In the protocol, we had specified a composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events defined by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke \\[ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or uncertain cause\\], or death from a vascular cause). \n\n【38】Two consultant neurologists (WNW and MRM) at the trial coordinating centre were internal assessors of reports of every outcome event, masked to treatment allocation and use of antithrombotic therapy, using all available source documentation including clinical records, death certificates, autopsy reports, imaging reports, outpatient clinic letters, and hospital discharge summaries. One consultant neurologist (TG) was an external assessor and reviewed the same information on a random sample of 25 internally assessed events. He agreed with the internal assessors for 24 (96%) events 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u> and, therefore, the internal assessors' categorisations remained final. Standardised definitions guided the final categorisation of outcomes. \n\n【39】### Statistical analysis\n\n【40】We aimed to recruit 720 participants and follow them up for at least 2 years to cover several combinations of published estimates of the primary outcome event rate in cohort studies (1·8–7·4% per year) and an up to four-times proportional increase in the absolute risk of the primary outcome with the use of antiplatelet therapy in observational studies. For example, at the 5% significance level, the trial would have 90% power to detect a doubling of a primary outcome event rate of 4·5% per year, or 93% power to detect a four-times increase of a rate of 1% per year.\n\n【41】Throughout the recruitment period, unmasked trial statisticians supplied the independent data monitoring committee with analyses of the accumulating baseline and follow-up data in strict confidence at least once every year, so that they could assess trial conduct, safety, and efficacy, and make recommendations to the trial steering committee. No formal fixed schedule of interim analyses was followed, but the data monitoring committee could advise the chairman of the trial steering committee if they thought the randomised comparisons provided proof beyond reasonable doubt that, for some patients, antiplatelet therapy was clearly indicated or contraindicated in clinical practice.\n\n【42】Without reference to data by randomised allocation or input from the unmasked trial statistician, the masked trial statistician (GDM) and chief investigator (RA-SS) prepared a statistical analysis plan that was approved by the trial steering committee before database lock, and then published.\n\n【43】We estimated the survival function in each treatment group using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of time to first occurrence of a primary or secondary outcome event during all available follow-up after randomisation, censored at death unrelated to an outcome event or last available follow-up. We quantified completeness of follow-up as the proportion of participants with a complete follow-up questionnaire at each planned interval after randomisation, and as the proportion of the planned duration of follow-up that was observed. We quantified absolute differences in annual event rates. After assessing the proportional hazards assumption graphically and including a treatment by log(time) interaction, we compared the survival functions by allocated treatment using the log-rank test. We constructed an unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model and a second model adjusted for all five covariates included in the minimisation algorithm (which was the primary method of analysis) to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs). We prespecified a hierarchical testing of the primary outcome, key secondary outcomes, and other secondary outcomes, so we did not adjust the threshold of statistical significance for multiplicity. We used the Mann–Whitney test to compare group summaries of modified Rankin scale scores by randomised group.

In a sensitivity analysis, antiplatelet therapy did not reduce the cumulative incidence of all major haemorrhagic or occlusive vascular events (p=1·0). For the composite secondary outcome of all major vascular events specified in the trial protocol, antiplatelet therapy seemed to reduce the risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke (ischaemic, haemorrhagic, or uncertain cause), or death from a vascular cause 删除2:<u>(adjusted HR 0·65 \\[95% CI 0·44–0·95\\]; p=0·025; table 3 , appendix )</u>. We found no evidence of heterogeneity of the effects of antiplatelet therapy on these secondary outcomes in prespecified exploratory subgroup analyses 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u> or in the distribution of the modified Rankin scale score during follow-up 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. Few serious adverse events occurred (n=11), which were neither outcomes nor expected complications of stroke 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>.\n\n【71】Discussion\n----------\n\n【72】In this randomised trial of 537 survivors of an intracerebral haemorrhage while on antithrombotic therapy, starting antiplatelet therapy might have reduced the risk of recurrent symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage. The results exclude all but a very modest increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy, which seems too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention. Therefore, starting antiplatelet therapy seems to be safe and might be beneficial in patients who survived a median of 76 days after intracerebral haemorrhage, most of whom had good functional ability at baseline and a higher probability of good functional outcome at 6-month follow up 删除2:<u>( table 1 , appendix )</u>. Our findings, alongside published observational studies, provide reassurance about the use of long-term antiplatelet therapy in a range of patients after intracerebral haemorrhage associated with antithrombotic therapy.\n\n【73】RESTART is the first randomised trial comparing starting versus avoiding antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral haemorrhage, and provides more reliable estimates of the effects of antiplatelet therapy than previous observational studies. We minimised selection bias by using central, computerised random sequence generation and concealing allocation on the web application until all baseline data were entered. The recruited participants were comparable to European hospital-based and population-based cohorts of survivors of intracerebral haemorrhage who had previously taken antithrombotic therapy. Blood pressure was controlled for both groups throughout follow-up: half of the participants had a systolic blood pressure below the recommended target in the UK national stroke guideline and antihypertensive drug use was similar between groups. We minimised attrition bias by achieving 99·3% completeness of follow-up. The risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage was at the lower end of the ranges reported in cohort studies, but similar to the 0·61–1·20% annual rates observed with cilostazol or aspirin use in the recent PICASSO trial. The risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage was low 删除2:<u>( table 2 )</u>, possibly due to the prevalence of proton pump inhibitor use in a contemporary population of older stroke survivors. We masked outcome assessors to treatment allocation group and receipt of antithrombotic therapy, and used objective definitions of major outcomes and independent verification, to reduce misclassification of haemorrhagic and occlusive vascular events, and reduce bias that can arise in outcome assessment when treatment allocation is open. We prespecified our outcomes and methods of analysis, and report these according to our protocol and statistical analysis plan. We also did prespecified exploratory analyses to investigate the effects of antiplatelet therapy according to brain imaging biomarkers that are often observed in clinical practice, which we report separately.\n\n【74】RESTART has some limitations. We intended to recruit 720 participants and follow them up for 2 years, but we recruited only 537 people (75% of our target). Investigators managed to recruit only one in 12 eligible patients; the remainder were not randomised because 28% of patients were too unwell when approached, 26% of patients' physicians were certain about whether or not to use antiplatelet therapy, 9% of patients declined, 7% of patients were started on oral anticoagulation, and 30% were not recruited for other reasons. Because of slow recruitment, we did a stepped wedge cluster randomised study within this trial at 72 of the sites to investigate whether stroke audit data extracts could boost recruitment; however, this strategy was not successful.\n\n【75】As in many other randomised trials of intracerebral haemorrhage, most participants were male, which might be because of their propensity to be invited or consent rather than differences in incidence or outcome of intracerebral haemorrhage compared with women. Although we did not mask the assigned treatment to participants and physicians, the outcomes were objective and adjudicated masked to treatment allocation, which minimises bias. Antiplatelet regimens used were mostly monotherapy, so the effects of dual antiplatelet therapy remain uncertain. Adherence to the allocated treatment declined over time but was more than 80% even after 4 years of follow-up. Although the sample size was smaller than intended and multiple statistical comparisons were done, we prespecified our primary outcome and main hypothesis, and regarded analyses of secondary outcomes and effects in subgroups as exploratory.\n\n【76】Platelets are the dominant contributor to thrombus formation in the arterial circulation, so antiplatelet therapy predominantly prevents arterial thrombosis. We included venous occlusive events in our composite secondary outcome of all haemorrhagic or occlusive vascular events because randomised trials suggested that antiplatelet therapy might prevent venous occlusive events, but this benefit was not evident in this trial. However, in this trial, antiplatelet therapy did reduce a composite of major vascular events used by the Antithrombotic Trialists' Collaboration (that did not include venous occlusive events), with a proportionate reduction similar to the effects of aspirin for secondary prevention in their meta-analysis.\n\n【77】Our finding that antiplatelet therapy might have reduced the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage was unexpected. Although we cannot rule out a random effect, this observation might not be as counterintuitive as it first seems. First, arterial thrombosis can trigger haemorrhage. Second, more spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhages than expected might be due to haemorrhagic transformation of ischaemic stroke. Finally, inflammation might be a key mechanism underlying intracerebral haemorrhage (as is thought to be the case for intracranial aneurysms). These potential mechanisms underlying RESTART's findings merit further investigation.\n\n【78】Our findings have several implications for future research. We will continue follow-up of the surviving participants in RESTART for another 2 years to improve precision of effect estimates, especially after 2 years of follow-up, and observe whether adherence changes after the trial result is known. Ongoing randomised trials, such as RESTART-Fr (NCT02966119, intended sample size 280) and STATICH (NCT03186729, intended sample size 250), might help to confirm or refute the effects of antiplatelet therapy seen in RESTART. A prospectively planned individual patient data meta-analysis of RESTART and these trials, and in due course a larger randomised trial, could increase power to detect the overall effects of antiplatelet therapy in these patients and in subgroups of interest with further investigation at earlier times after intracerebral haemorrhage and of heterogeneity of treatment effect by imaging features. RESTART's findings also support the conduct of randomised trials of oral anticoagulation for survivors of intracerebral haemorrhage with atrial fibrillation, for whom there is some justification for the use of antiplatelet therapy as a comparator.\n\n【79】In summary, RESTART excluded all but a very modest increase in the risk of recurrent intracerebral haemorrhage with antiplatelet therapy, which seemed too small to exceed the established benefits of antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of major vascular events ( video ). Antiplatelet therapy might have reduced the recurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage. These findings provide reassurance about the use of antiplatelet therapy for similar patients in clinical practice. Ongoing randomised trials, their meta-analysis with RESTART, and an adequately powered definitive randomised trial should be done to strengthen the evidence.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【80】RA-SS (chief investigator) and MSD conceived the idea for the study.

We investigated whether early 80/81 isolates had the genes for Panton-Valentine leucocidin, a toxin associated with virulence in healthy young people. Multilocus sequence analysis suggested that descendants of 80/81 have acquired meticillin resistance, are re-emerging as a community-acquired meticillin-resistant _S aureus_ (MRSA) clone, and represent a sister lineage to pandemic hospital-acquired MRSA.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

But ensuring people have long-term help is likely to be a challenge in the country, where community-based mental-health care is still in a fledgling state. Barbara Fraser reports.\n\n【1】When psychologist Edgar Bellido arrived in Pisco after a magnitude 8·0 earthquake virtually levelled the southern Peruvian city on Aug 15, 2007, he spent 2 days without eating or sleeping. But he had only one request “I asked them to please find me a computer”.\n\n【2】Bellido, a member of the Peruvian Ministry of Health's national mental-health technical team, was in Pisco to head the mental-health response to the disaster. Setting up shop in the hospital's only undamaged wing, he set to work gathering data about the scope of the crisis, as well as counselling the rescue teams searching for victims under the rubble.\n\n【3】Now he is planning for the long term. Some 25 tent cities housing at least 20 000 people have sprung up, and this number could swell to 50. Now that the immediate crisis is past, people are seeing “their entire lives being swept away by the machines that are clearing the debris”, he said.\n\n【4】Unlike a hurricane, an earthquake gives people no time to prepare. In and around coastal Pisco, some 30 000 families saw their homes collapse around them in 2 minutes when the earthquake struck.\n\n【5】The disaster killed over 500 people, injured 2000, and created a mental-health emergency. Rescue crews needed psychological support, patients who were receiving treatment lost their medications, and people with stress or anxiety saw their symptoms magnified.\n\n【6】Psychologists from public and private agencies headed to the scene, but there was an initial lack of coordination, said Bellido. Their work was further complicated by lack of access to patients' records because of damage to the hospital, according to Luis Encinas, emergency coordinator for Médecins Sans Frontières. The situation highlights the need for a backup system for patients' records in case originals are damaged or destroyed in disasters, says Encinas.\n\n【7】However, in Pisco, the community organisation system—typical of Peru's low-income urban neighbourhoods—was an asset, as community leaders quickly identified people who needed medications or special care, Encinas said. That spontaneous organisation “greatly facilitated the delivery of aid” and with specific training, he believes, such leaders could become the front line in a medical emergency response.\n\n【8】Although it may be too early to identify all the lessons to be learned from this disaster, some have emerged 删除2:<u>( panel )</u>. One of the biggest challenges now is providing long-term mental-health assistance in the country, where community-based mental-health care is still in a fledgling state.\n\n【9】Panel\n\n【10】**Early mental-health lessons from the Peru earthquake**\n\n【11】**Before an emergency:**\n\n【12】*   •\n\n【13】    Planning is crucial and should include detailed information about human resources, steps for mobilising them quickly, and guidelines for different scenarios.\n\n【14】*   •\n\n【15】    If other countries send mental-health teams, there must be a clear chain of command and criteria for determining whether they are culturally sensitive and where they will work.\n\n【16】*   •\n\n【17】    A backup system for patients' records is needed in case originals are damaged or destroyed.\n\n【18】*   •\n\n【19】    Emergency kits containing a month's worth of essential medications for people with chronic illnesses can be prepared in advance.\n\n【20】*   •\n\n【21】    A system for delivering medications to patients in a disaster situation is needed.\n\n【22】*   •\n\n【23】    Planners must remember that local service providers may also be affected.\n\n【24】**When disaster strikes:**\n\n【25】*   •\n\n【26】    Immediate support should be provided to rescuers as well as the general public.\n\n【27】*   •\n\n【28】    Those responsible for organising services need accurate, updated information about the number of affected people, their ages and location, and shelters and outside aid organisations that are assisting, so as to plan a targeted response.\n\n【29】*   •\n\n【30】    Initial psychological support for people who have lost homes or family members should be done in group sessions broken down by age.\n\n【31】**Looking to the future:**\n\n【32】*   •\n\n【33】    Some people will need long-term assistance to recover or to deal with additional stresses, such as those related to overcrowding in the tent cities where earthquake victims will live until their homes are rebuilt.\n\n【34】*   •\n\n【35】    Community leaders could be trained to assist in emergency medical situations.\n\n【36】“In Peru, 70% of the population does not know what mental health means”, said Hugo Lozada Rocca, a psychiatrist who serves as adviser on mental-health issues to the minister of health. And, only a quarter of the people who need mental-health care get attention.\n\n【37】This “treatment gap” is not peculiar to Peru. Despite advances in mental-health care throughout Latin America, overall, at least half the people who need care go untreated because of lack of access to services, stigma, discrimination, economic problems, or lack of awareness, according to Jorge Rodriguez, who heads the Pan American Health Organization's mental-health unit.\n\n【38】Until recently in Peru, as in most of Latin America, the emphasis was on mental illness rather than mental health, and care revolved around psychiatric hospitals. This focus changed with a national mental-health plan that was launched in 2006, but implementation requires changing the mindset of patients, their families, health-care providers, and politicians.\n\n【39】In one sense, the lack of emphasis on mental-health care in developing countries such as Peru is understandable. “While in Europe, there is concern about more subtle aspects, we have had to be concerned about children who are dying from malnutrition and lack of antibiotics”, said Jaime Saavedra, who heads the research unit at the Honorio Delgado-Hideyo Noguchi National Institute of Mental Health in Lima, the Peruvian capital.\n\n【40】But, as well as affecting physical conditions, poverty also has an effect on mental health, and vice versa, according to a study done this year in Lima. The study found that depression was twice as high in poor people as in the well-off. The same was true of mental-health indicators such as child abuse, domestic problems, and suicide attempts.\n\n【41】This situation creates a vicious circle, according to Saavedra, who was the lead researcher for the study. Poverty brings a higher frequency of mental-health problems, and those problems make it more difficult for a person to hold a job, perpetuating the poverty.\n\n【42】This problem suggests that anti-poverty programmes must take mental health into consideration, whereas mental-health programmes should include elements such as occupational training.\n\n【43】Peru's national mental-health plan points in this direction. It calls for mental health to be seen as a fundamental right and for universal access to community-based mental-health care.\n\n【44】Lozada's goal is to create a system of community-based mental-health care in which primary-care facilities would resolve some 80% of cases. Local or regional public hospitals would set aside about 5% of their beds for people requiring admission to hospital, and specialised facilities would be used as a last resort.\n\n【45】To implement such a model, primary-care physicians would need continuing education and the university curriculum must be refigured to ensure that doctors and nurses can manage and refer people with mental-health problems appropriately.\n\n【46】Human resources must also be decentralised. With a population of more than 23 million people, Peru has only about 500 psychiatrists, and at least half are in Lima, where a third of the population lives.\n\n【47】But financing these changes could be problematic. “The budget for mental health actions is zero”, said Lozada, who would like to see a separate mental-health office established in the health ministry. Although about US$2 million has been cobbled together for mental-health services from donations and funds from international agencies, “the big problem is sustainability”, he said. Local governments should pick up at least part of the tab for setting up community-based programmes, but “municipalities do not want to invest”, said Lozada.\n\n【48】However, Lozada is realistic about his limitations. “I cannot pretend to solve in a few months a problem that has existed for years”, he said a week and a half after the earthquake, as he prepared to go to Pisco to meet with local government officials about organising a community-based mental-health response.\n\n【49】Hard lessons from disasters, such as the recent earthquake, are helping Peru to cast mental health into a new light, but there is still a long road ahead.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【50】### Publication history\n\n【51】Published: 08 September 2007\n\n【52】### Identification\n\n【53】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61396-8</u>\n\n【54】### Copyright\n\n【55】© 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Patients who present with tumours with the major oncogenic driver mutations— _EGFR_ mutation and _ALK_ rearrangement—have viable treatment options, such as use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (erlotinib or gefitinib for patients with _EGFR_ mutations and crizotinib for those with _ALK_ rearrangements), selection of more efficient cytotoxic drugs (pemetrexed for _ALK_ rearrangements ), and, hopefully in the future, selection of optimum locoregional treatments. Many other molecular abnormalities exist and could be targeted for personalised selection of specific therapies—eg, _HER2, FGFR1_ , _RET, ROS_ , _PIK3CA_ , _BRAF_ . Nevertheless, even with modern techniques for identification of mutations, more than half of patients with NSCLC have no actionable molecular driver event, and the dream of personalised medicine falls short.

She was talking about biographies, but she might have meant instead the qualities needed for a great work of anatomy. It is not enough for structures to be portrayed with precision—they have to have art as well, to dance from the page and embed themselves as living images in the mind of the reader. Hence at least the original success of _Gray's Anatomy_ ; its illustrations did exactly that.\n\n【5】_Gray's Anatomy_ is now one of the world's best known medical books, having been constantly in print since its birth 150 years ago. Celebrating the anniversary, the Royal College of Surgeons of England has a small display of some original editions of the book, along with contemporary reviews (some kind, one damning) and original pictorial proofs. They are vibrant and accurate in equal measure, and although the exhibition is possibly too small to warrant a visit on its own account, it makes for a good excuse to revisit the beautiful Hunterian Museum beside it.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2008 The Royal College of Surgeons of England</u>\n\n【6】The birthday of _Gray's Anatomy_ is being marked by a new edition, the 40th, which will be published later this year, along with the historian Ruth Richardson's account of the book's creation and history. In the meantime, the American Bill Hayes has written _The Anatomist: a True Story of Gray's Anatomy_ . Neither a medic nor a historian, Hayes sets out to bring the book's authors to life—with facts, but also with imagination.\n\n【7】There were two authors, not one. Henry Vandyke Carter was a few years younger than Henry Gray. He regarded himself, sometimes with a little help from Gray, as belonging to a lower “genus” of humanity, fit only to hold the worldly ladder while his ambitious colleague climbed. Their joint book won immediate popularity as a study aid for doctors in training. Clear limpid prose was put together by Gray, who characteristically failed to credit the competing anatomy books he raided in the process. Fine woodcuts were created by Carter, whose middle name reflected the artistic interests of his provincial upbringing. Carter even taught himself to draw directly onto wood in preparing the book, removing the possibility than an intermediate might degrade the clarity of his images when preparing the prints. Innovatively, Carter's labels were not adjacent to his pictures, forcing the reader's eye into distracting efforts at cross-checking. Instead, his nomenclature appeared on the flesh itself. The names of muscles, nerves and bones—all perfectly hand cut in elegant lettering—were written into the body. Nature appeared to be labelling herself.\n\n【8】Beyond this, _Gray's Anatomy_ introduced no revolutionary way of looking at the world. Contemporary editions might remain very good textbooks, but so are many others. Like modern editions of _Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management_ , what chiefly sets _Gray's Anatomy_ apart today is the success of its branding. Facsimile editions of early copies continue to sell well in discount bookstores, easy and attractive gifts. We have one on our own shelves, given to my wife when she started medical school. Its pages have rested in untroubled peace ever since.\n\n【9】Hayes's interest, however, is more the men than their book. Gray is a problem, his life too sparsely documented to become palpable. In 1861, at the age of 34 years, he died of smallpox. His personal papers were probably burnt to prevent contagion. Carter, by contrast, left riches. A keen diarist and letter writer, he kept accounts not only of his worldly career but also of his agonisingly uncertain inner life. Lonely, neurotic, and worried about his tendencies towards “sensuality”, he makes a sympathetically miserable figure. Hayes constructs his book around accounts of reading Carter's journals. At the same time, he tells us of enrolling in anatomy courses at the University of California in San Francisco; he attempts to breathe life into his reconstruction of Carter by sharing in his experience of human dissection.\n\n【10】It says something intriguing about biography that these efforts often fall flat: dipping a toe into Carter's profession seems too bluntly mechanical a device to set the book blazing into inspired life. Hayes is far more successful when he comes at his subject from fresher angles, as when he contrasts his own experience of being homosexual with Carter's anxious isolation consequent to his Dissenting religious beliefs. Hayes flicks between his own experiences and Carter's, sometimes with superbly judged delicacy and sometimes with clunking failure.\n\n【11】There is something curious about journeying to 19th-century London in the company of an obtrusively modern Californian. Hayes mainly pursues Carter and Gray from the physical and cultural environs of his San Francisco home. At times these contrasts bring vividly to life not only the anatomists but also their biographer, and the book takes flight. Elsewhere, though, Hayes becomes a chatty rather than revealing companion. Then his autobiography feels superficial and his prose's punches glance off. Hayes protests a great deal of emotional engagement; only intermittently does it come persuasively across.\n\n【12】_The Anatomist_ is enjoyable but inconsistent. It is also a reminder that when it comes to tracing the lines of life in the records of the dead, it is not the balance of dream and reality that matters, not the proportion of fancy and fact. Instead, it is the spirit with which rainbow is imaginatively married to granite. It is a spirit that battles with varying fortune through Hayes's book, even while it gleams triumphantly from what adorns its pages: the beautiful anatomical drawings of Henry Vandyke Carter.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【13】### Publication history\n\n【14】Published: 19 April 2008\n\n【15】### Identification\n\n【16】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60579-6</u>\n\n【17】### Copyright\n\n【18】© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

US CDC COVID-19 mask guidance reveals the moral foundations of public health", "text": "【0】Your health is in your hands? US CDC COVID-19 mask guidance reveals the moral foundations of public health\nIn the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, US public health policy remains at a crossroads. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) May 28, 2021 guidance 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, which lifted masking recommendations for vaccinated people in most situations, exemplifies a troubling shift—away from public health objectives that center equity and toward a model of individual personal responsibility for health. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky emphasized that “your health is in your hands” 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, undermining the idea that fighting COVID is a “public” health responsibility that requires the support of institutions and communities. The social impacts of this scientific guidance, combined with the emergence of new variants, have exposed the fallacy of this approach, with most local mask restrictions lifted and infections rising dramatically among disadvantaged populations 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Rapidly rising cases prompted the CDC on July 27th to recommend resuming indoor masking even for vaccinated people in “areas of substantial or high transmission” 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, but US policy continues to frame the pandemic largely as a matter of individual responsibility—to the detriment of public health. As public health professionals and advocates, we call for a renewed commitment to core public health principles of collective responsibility, health equity, and human rights.\n\n【1】Public health implicates government obligations to realize the health of populations, focusing on “what we, as a society, do collectively to assure the conditions for people to be healthy” 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Securing public health does not merely reflect the health of many individual persons, rather a collective “public” good that is greater than the sum of its parts. Public health actions protect and promote the health of entire populations through multi-sectoral interventions to address underlying determinants of health. This focus on social determinants of health has gained consensus among public health scholars, yet many US public health efforts continue to center individual responsibility for personal benefit, rather than collective responsibility for public benefit.\n\n【2】Individualistic approaches to health, exemplified by the CDC's May 2021 mask guidance, ignore the impacts on health inequities, which have been exacerbated by the pandemic and continue to hinder vaccination access 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Black, Indigenous and People of Color because of structural racial inequities 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Many are essential workers with high exposure risks and limited workplace protections, who face vaccination barriers due to a lack of sick leave and existing caretaking responsibilities. These inequities compound vulnerabilities for those at high risk for infection and severe outcomes, including older and disabled or chronically-ill adults and children, and institutionalized populations. Overlooked inequities yield disproportionate COVID-19 disease, disability, and death in oppressed and excluded communities—even where there is overall disease reduction. Yet, such groups have often been omitted from discussions of public health policy, with their lives treated as expendable.\n\n【3】Public health protection is inextricably linked with human rights promotion. The right to health has provided normative clarity in public health policy and legal accountability for public health outcomes, focusing on the need to prevent disease at the population level to ensure the highest attainable standard of health for all 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In promoting individual rights to protect public health, the pandemic has shown the need for a response that prioritizes community trust and cooperative engagement. The CDC's decision to prioritize individual autonomy over public health ignores disease vulnerability, not only for at-risk individuals but the community.\n\n【4】Ongoing debates about CDC's mask guidance raise foundational questions about the meaning, purpose, and role of public health. Even as public health often seeks to project itself as “apolitical”, moral values permeate public health practice. Purportedly apolitical public health decisions, manifested in policy decisions that rationalize economic “reopening”, employ a cost-benefit analysis that prioritizes some lives over others and makes loss of life, sickness, and isolation seem acceptable, obscuring the reality that morbidity and mortality could be greatly decreased with appropriate structural mitigation.\n\n【5】The current US approach continues to undermine the fundamental notion that all people are equal in dignity and rights. When the CDC Director speaks of a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, this implicitly assumes that those who become ill are responsible for their own suffering and that their deaths are acceptable—because they could have been vaccinated. These moral deficiencies reflect a larger neglect of collective responsibility, equity, and human rights in US public health policy. CDC guidance must consider the moral foundations of public health, providing a normative framework to support public health policy and practice.\n\n【6】We can draw inspiration for an alternative moral vision of public health from Native American responses, which have centered community and existing networks of connections to successfully implement mitigation and vaccination measures 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Resuming masking indoors will be a critical step to reduce transmission and provide an opportunity to reorient the pandemic response to support the health of the public. Structural measures like enhanced workplace protections and sick leave, expanded support for unvaccinated communities, and consistent messaging focused on collective responsibility would buttress this approach. These constitute important steps towards realizing the collective benefits of public health, the need to support equity, and the right to health—in the US and throughout the world.\n\n【7】Author statement\n----------------\n\n【8】CT conceptualized the paper, with participation from all authors.

Surprisingly Romanian family doctors had survived in this structure—exceptional in central and east European countries—but their role in health care was minimum.\n\n【3】Under these circumstances a vanguard of family doctors founded, in 1990, a professional organisation, the Societatea Nationala de Medicina Generala in Romania (SNMGR) Also, exceptionally, in 1992, a non-compulsary, 3-year postgraduate training in family medicine was introduced.\n\n【4】In 1992, I was invited to give support to the development of Romanian family medicine. The Dutch Ministry of Health gave financial support. The Stichting Bevorderdering Kwaliteit Gezondheidszorg in Roemenië (Foundation for the Improvement of Quality in Romanian Health Care) was established, and developed a long lasting partnership with Romanian family doctors. The cooperation until now has so far consisted of three consecutive programmes.\n\n【5】From 1993–97, a group of about 200 doctors were taught in continuing educational courses, provided by experienced Dutch family doctors, covering different characteristics of family medicine. The most important result was that a group of Romanian family doctors became aware of the identity of family medicine. This realisation was a good starting position for a new programme.\n\n【6】From 1997 to 2000, the MATRA programme was executed. Aims were improvement of the family doctors' organisation and postgraduate education of a group of 54 selected Romanian family doctors as future trainers. Trainers were voluntary Dutch university staff teaching family medicine. During 3 years, each trainee had to attend two or three workshops a year and had to develop a programme in their region, monitored by the Dutch trainers. 12 participants were trained in research, 29 in management, and 13 in teaching. The teaching methods in all groups were interactive and oriented towards problem solving, which was completely new for the trainees who were used to frontal teaching. Trainees were accredited as teachers by the Romanian Institute for Postgraduate Training.\n\n【7】A third programme (2001–04) is in development. In a sentinel station programme, 100 Romanian family doctors, spread across the country, will collect representative data on morbidity and practice management. The participants will be trained by the trainees of the MATRA programme.\n\n【8】External assessment has shown that the MATRA programme is a good model by which to link two countries; the small-scale low-budget project is more sustainable than large-scale high-budget programmes. The commitment of people involved is high. The project has built-in flexibility and survives major health-policy changes with no disturbance. More than 8 years' duration has created a basis for cooperation and mutual trust.\n\n【9】Since the introduction of a social health-insurance system in 1998, the Romanian health-care system offers more opportunities for a better development of Romanian family medicine.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 26 May 2001\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04850-9</u>\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2001 Elsevier Ltd.

New findings on the genetics, the possible roles of the environment and the immune system, and intrinsic abnormalities in the endometrium of affected women and secreted products of endometriotic lesions have given insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder and serve as the background for new treatments for disease-associated pain and infertility. Affected women are at higher risk than the general female population of developing ovarian cancer, and they also may be at increased risk of breast and other cancers as well as autoimmune and atopic disorders. Clinicians should assess and follow up affected women for these and other associated disorders. There will probably be a new repertoire of approaches for treatment and perhaps cure of this enigmatic disorder in the near future.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "7edbe4aa-40fe-4f96-9bbf-3bf3fd8da6c3", "title": "Doctors criticise UN's approach to global drugs control", "text": "【0】A high-level UN meeting on international drug policy came to a close last week with doctors lamenting the lack of progress on health issues. Ed Holt reports from Vienna.\n\n【1】Growing numbers of doctors are calling for a health-based approach to be adopted as a cornerstone of global drugs policy as a high-level UN conference highlights what critics say are continued failings in international bodies' strategies for dealing with global drug problems.\n\n【2】The High-Level Review at the latest annual session of the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND)—the chief policy-making body for international drug control—in Vienna earlier this month assessed how the UN is meeting goals for dealing with the global drug problem ahead of a UN General Assembly Special Session on Drugs in 2016.\n\n【3】But a joint ministerial statement on that progress produced during the conference left civil society groups and doctors pushing for an overhaul of existing drugs policies bitterly disappointed. Failing to address issues such as the death penalty for drugs offences and with no inclusion of the term harm reduction—because it is unacceptable to countries like Russia which take a hard line approach to drugs—it did little but reaffirm past commitments.\n\n【4】Chris Ford, founder and clinical director of the non-governmental organisation International Doctors for Healthy Drug Policies (IDHDP) , told _The Lancet_ : “The statement was meant to be a new consensus \\[between UN member states\\] but sadly it was rubbish and showed that lots of work still needs to be done.”\n\n【5】Civil society groups working with people who use drugs have for years argued that organisations like the CND and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) are clinging to a traditional punitive criminal approach to global drug problems that scientific evidence shows to have failed.\n\n【6】Ford says: “We know the global war on drugs has failed and this has had devastating consequences for individuals and communities around the world. Large amounts of money have been spent on criminalisation and repressive measures have failed to curtail supply or consumption.”\n\n【7】“But these have harmed people who use drugs, impeded progress on public health measures to reduce HIV and hepatitis C, limited opioid substitution therapy, and prevented other harm reduction measures being available to all who need them. Drug policy is being used by many countries to justify people's and governments' moralistic and prejudiced opinions.”\n\n【8】The conference itself highlighted the fact that a number of individual member states think the same way and are breaking with standard UN policy on drugs. Some countries' delegates openly talked of the economic, human, and public health costs of what they see as a failed war on drugs.\n\n【9】The conference was also held against a backdrop of recently undertaken or planned fundamental reforms of individual states' drugs policies. In December last year, Uruguay became the first country in the world to legalise commercial sales of marijuana and regulate its production. Commercial sales of marijuana began in the US state of Colorado in January while sales of marijuana will begin in Washington state in June.\n\n【10】But the UN has slammed these reforms. Just days before the start of the Vienna conference, UNODC executive director Yury Fedotov said Uruguay's cannabis legalisation was “not a solution to dealing with world drug problems”.\n\n【11】Uruguay has defended its actions as being in the interests of its population. Speaking to _The Lancet_ , Diego Canepa, deputy secretary of the office of Uruguayan President Jose Mujica, said: “We believe that in terms of our health policies this is the best option for Uruguay. We think that prohibition is not the answer and overwhelming evidence has shown that it has been a mistake over the last 40 years.”\n\n【12】Opinion among the medical community on legalisation of drugs is divided. But Sebastien Saville, executive director of IDHDP, told _The Lancet_ during the CND conference, regardless of what individual doctors may think of that issue, what members of his organisation are agreed on is that global drug policy needs to be reformed with a health-based approach adopted at its heart.\n\n【13】The IDHDP, which is gaining new members every day and hopes to have 5000 by 2016, believes that a change in global drugs policy can be effected if enough medical professionals speak up. “Doctors and medical professionals are often well-respected and trusted in society and their opinions hold a certain degree of weight, both among people and policy makers”, said Saville.\n\n【14】“If they, the people who deal with the effects of drug use at a practical, clinical level, speak out with a strong voice, it will be more difficult for drugs policy makers to not take notice of the evidence showing that a health-based approach to drugs problems is more effective than current drug policies.”\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2014 Bloomberg via Getty Images</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【15】### Publication history\n\n【16】Published: 29 March 2014\n\n【17】### Identification\n\n【18】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60550-X</u>\n\n【19】### Copyright\n\n【20】© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the ramifications of this failed experiment, extend far beyond those for illicit use; the effect of these policies on access to controlled medicines for analgesia and anaesthesia has been devastating for patients in low-income and middle-income countries. 2 During this year's CND session, UN Member States allowed history to repeat itself, passing a resolution 3 calling for ketamine (an essential medicine, and the anaesthetic of necessity in many poor countries) to be placed under national control, against the advice of WHO.\n\n【30】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n\n【31】Hide Caption Download See figure in Article\n\n【32】Toggle Thumbstrip\n删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download .PPT</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

There are few data on the effect of vaccination on the disease or colonisation with pneumococci in the nasopharynx of children in this setting. The 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced into the routine infant immunisation schedule in Nepal in 2015. We aimed to investigate the effect of the introduction of PCV10 on pneumococcal carriage and disease in children in Nepal.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did an observational cohort study in children in Nepal. The hospital surveillance study took place in Patan Hospital, Kathmandu, and community studies in healthy children took place in Kathmandu and Okhaldhunga district. For the surveillance study, all children admitted to Patan Hospital between March 20, 2014, and Dec 31, 2019, aged between 2 months and 14 years with clinician-suspected pneumonia, were eligible for enrolment. For the community study, healthy children aged 0–8 weeks, 6–23 months, and 24–59 months were recruited from Kathmandu, and healthy children aged 6–23 months were recruited from Okhaldhunga. We assessed the programmatic effect of PCV10 introduction using surveillance for nasopharyngeal colonisation, pneumonia, and invasive bacterial disease from 1·5 years before vaccine introduction and 4·5 years after vaccine introduction. For the surveillance study, nasopharyngeal swabs, blood cultures, and chest radiographs were obtained from children admitted to Patan Hospital with suspected pneumonia or invasive bacterial disease. For the community study, nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from healthy children in the urban and rural settings. Pneumonia outcomes were analysed using log-binomial models and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) comparing each calendar year after the introduction of the vaccine into the national programme with the pre-vaccine period (2014–15), adjusted for calendar month, age, and sex.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between March 20, 2014, and Dec 31, 2019, we enrolled 2051 children with suspected pneumonia, and 11 354 healthy children (8483 children aged 6–23 months, 761 aged 24–59 months, and 2110 aged 0–8 weeks) to assess nasopharyngeal colonisation. Among clinical pneumonia cases younger than 2 years, vaccine serotype carriage declined 82% (aPR 0·18 \\[95% CI 0·07–0·50\\]) by 2019. There was no decrease in vaccine serotype carriage in cases among older unvaccinated age groups. Carriage of the additional serotypes in PCV13 was 2·2 times higher by 2019 (aPR 2·17 \\[95% CI 1·16–4·05\\]), due to increases in serotypes 19A and 3. Vaccine serotype carriage in healthy children declined by 75% in those aged 6–23 months (aPR 0·25 \\[95% CI 0·19–0·33\\]) but not in those aged 24–59 months (aPR 0·59 \\[0·29–1·19\\]). A decrease in overall vaccine serotype carriage of 61% by 2019 (aPR 0·39 \\[95% CI 0·18–0·85\\]) was also observed in children younger than 8 weeks who were not yet immunised. Carriage of the additional PCV13 serotypes in children aged 6–23 months increased after PCV10 introduction for serotype 3 and 19A, but not for serotype 6A. The proportion of clinical pneumonia cases with endpoint consolidation on chest radiographs declined from 41% in the pre-vaccine period to 25% by 2018, but rose again in 2019 to 36%.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The introduction of the PCV10 vaccine into the routine immunisation programme in Nepal has reduced vaccine serotype carriage in both healthy children and children younger than 2 years with pneumonia. Increases in serotypes 19A and 3 highlight the importance of continued surveillance to monitor the effect of vaccine programmes. This analysis demonstrates a robust approach to assessing vaccine effect in situations in which pneumococcal disease endpoint effectiveness studies are not possible.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organization.\n\n【10】**Research in context**\n\n【11】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【12】Nepal introduced the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) into its routine infant immunisation schedule in 2015 using a unique 2 + 1 schedule, with priming doses at 6 weeks and 10 weeks of age plus a booster at 9 months of age, and with no catch-up campaign in older age groups. The effect on pneumococcal carriage and disease with this form of vaccine implementation had not previously been tested. A systematic database search was not done before the study commenced. However, a recent WHO systematic review found multiple studies assessing vaccine effect against invasive pneumococcal disease caused by pneumococcal serotypes covered by the PCV10 vaccine, but none in Asian or low-income or middle-income settings. Studies reporting the effect of a 2+1 schedule on pneumococcal pneumonia were limited to children younger than 5 years; however, a large proportion of pneumococcal pneumonia in Nepal is in children aged 5 years or older.\n\n【13】**Added value of this study**\n\n【14】In 2014, before the introduction of the vaccine, we commenced a vaccine impact study. The study assessed the impact of the vaccine using the Nepali schedule with 2 initial doses at 6 weeks and 10 weeks of age followed by a booster at 9 months of age. This was not a schedule that had been used in other pneumococcal vaccine implementation programmes. In addition to measuring vaccine impact on carriage in healthy children, we also measured the impact on carriage of vaccine serotypes in children admitted to hospital with pneumonia. Blood cultures from admitted children were also serotyped for analysis.\n\n【15】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【16】PCV10 introduction in Nepal resulted in a substantial decrease in carriage of vaccine serotypes in healthy children younger than 2 years and in clinical pneumonia cases in children of the same age. Increases in carriage of serotypes 19A and 3, which are not included in the PCV10 vaccine, were also observed. These data on PCV effect are useful for the planning of pneumococcal vaccine introduction programmes using a 2+1 regimen, especially in Asian settings.\n\n【17】</u>Introduction\n------------\n\n【18】_Streptococcus pneumoniae_ (pneumococcus) is a common cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis, and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality from lower respiratory infections. Globally, it is estimated to cause more than a million deaths per year. \n\n【19】Although the incidence of pneumonia has decreased in recent decades, about 138 million cases were estimated to have occurred in 2015 in children younger than 5 years. In Nepal, pneumonia is a major health concern, with _S pneumoniae_ being the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in children. Although many different serotypes of pneumococcus cause infection globally, in Kathmandu, Nepal, invasive pneumococcal disease among those aged 14 years and younger is predominantly caused by serotypes 1 and 5. Additionally, in this setting, almost a third of all cases between age 2 months and 14 years occur in children aged 5–14 years, an age group that is not included in the WHO classification of childhood pneumonia and is therefore often excluded from many surveillance studies and global pneumonia statistics. \n\n【20】Nepal introduced the 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable _Haemophilus influenzae_ protein D-conjugate vaccine (PCV10) into its routine infant immunisation schedule in a phased manner in January, 2015, with support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. By August, 2015, the vaccine was being used in all areas of the country. For operational reasons, Nepal implemented a 2 + 1 schedule, with priming doses at 6 weeks and 10 weeks of age and a booster at 9 months of age, and with no catch-up campaign in older age groups.\n\n【21】In April–May, 2015, major earthquakes near Kathmandu led to more than 9000 deaths, internal displacement of populations, and damage to infrastructure. In winter 2015–2016 a shortage of fuel led to disrupted medical supplies and burning of low-quality fuel, worsening air pollution in the Kathmandu valley. Despite these difficulties, PCV10 was implemented into the Nepalese infant immunisation schedule with high coverage.\n\n【22】In March, 2014, before the introduction of the vaccine, we commenced an observational cohort study to assess the impact of the vaccine. This supplemented ongoing surveillance of invasive bacterial disease (including invasive pneumococcal disease) at Patan Hospital. To supplement the invasive pneumococcal disease surveillance and understand the broader effect of PCV10 on pneumococcal carriage, we also undertook surveys of nasopharyngeal carriage of _S pneumoniae_ among healthy children in urban and rural cohorts each year from Kathmandu Valley and Okhaldhunga district. We aimed to report the effect of the introduction of PCV10 on pneumococcal carriage and disease in children in Nepal, before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Study design and participants\n\n【25】We did an observational cohort study set in Patan Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal. Patan Hospital is the teaching hospital for Patan Academy of Health Sciences and, with more than 600 beds, is one of the largest hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley. The hospital provides a wide range of public and private inpatient and outpatient services for adults and children and serves as both the main hospital care facility for the local surrounding community and as a tertiary care facility for the Kathmandu Valley.\n\n【26】Vaccine impact on clinical and radiographic pneumonia in children younger than 14 years was measured prospectively at Patan Hospital, Kathmandu, in our hospital pneumonia surveillance part of the study. All children admitted to Patan Hospital between March, 2014, and December, 2019, aged between 2 months and 14 years with clinician-suspected pneumonia were eligible for enrolment. Study staff in the hospital identified eligible participants from daily admission logs. Written informed consent was obtained from parents or guardians at enrolment, followed by collection of basic demographic and clinical details.\n\n【27】In addition to the hospital surveillance study, community studies were undertaken to assess the effect of vaccine introduction on nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine-serotype _S pneumoniae_ in healthy children from one urban (Patan, Kathmandu) and one rural (Okhaldhunga) region. For the urban site in Patan, healthy children aged 0–8 weeks, 6–23 months, and 24–59 months were recruited at Patan Hospital following informed consent from parents or guardians. These were children attending outpatient vaccination clinics, routine check-ups, or visiting other relatives in hospital. Minor respiratory illness was not an exclusion criterion. In the rural Okhaldhunga district (eastern Nepal), healthy children aged 6–23 months were recruited through community clinics following informed consent from parents or guardians.\n\n【28】The study was approved by the Patan Academy of Health Sciences Ethical Review Committee, the Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC 04-2014 and 39-2014), and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC 05-14 and 28-14).\n\n【29】### Procedures\n\n【30】For the hospital pneumonia surveillance, nasopharyngeal swabs from patients aged between 2 months and 14 years with suspected pneumonia admitted to hospital were cultured and serotyped to assess the impact of the vaccine on nasopharyngeal carriage of _S pneumoniae_ in pneumonia cases. The presence of _S pneumoniae_ in the nasopharynx during pneumonia illness does not prove the pneumonia to be pneumococcal in origin. However, the serotype carried can be indicative of the serotype responsible for the infection, because invasive serotypes are carried more commonly in pneumonia cases than in healthy controls.\n\n【31】Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected from participants at enrolment using sterile nylon flocked swabs. Blood samples for routine clinical care were taken for bacterial culture in Bactec Peds Plus culture bottles (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA). Both sample types were processed in the microbiology laboratory at Patan Hospital with a randomly selected 10% of isolates also serotyped independently for quality control purposes in Oxford.\n\n【32】A digitalised chest radiograph taken as part of routine care at the time of enrolment was independently interpreted, using standardised WHO criteria, as primary endpoint pneumonia (consolidation or effusion); other infiltrate; or no consolidation, effusion, or infiltrate by two readers (a paediatrician and a radiologist). A second senior radiologist arbitrated upon all discordant results and reviewed 10% of other radiographs. Readers were masked to clinical data.\n\n【33】In addition to surveillance of children with pneumonia, all febrile patients in hospital younger than 14 years (including those enrolled in the hospital pneumonia surveillance) were eligible for enrolment in the WHO enhanced invasive bacterial disease surveillance programme for invasive bacterial diseases, and results from blood, pleural fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures or antigen tests were also available for inclusion in the analysis.\n\n【34】For the community carriage studies, nasopharyngeal samples were collected using sterile nylon flocked swabs for both the urban and rural study sites. Swabs were placed into tubes containing 1 mL skim milk tryptone glucose glycerol (STGG) transport medium. In the urban site, swabs were collected in the study room at Patan Hospital and transported to the microbiology laboratory within an hour of collection. In the rural site, swabs were transported to Okhaldhunga Community Hospital from the collection site and stored at –20°C. These swabs were transported to Patan Hospital in liquid nitrogen after up to a maximum of 4 days of storage in Okhaldhunga, before storage at Patan Hospital at –80°C.\n\n【35】For all swabs (from participants admitted to hospital and from both community carriage sites), aliquots of STGG media were made before freezing and transported to the UK on dry ice. The frozen nasopharyngeal samples (STGG) were thawed and cultured along with other recently collected swabs on Columbia agar containing 5% sheep blood and gentamicin and were incubated overnight at 37°C with 5% CO 2 . Pneumococci were identified by standard phenotypic methods before serotyping by the Quellung reaction. \n\n【36】### Statistical analysis\n\n【37】For the community carriage study, surveys of 1151 healthy children for each yearly urban cohort were planned in children aged 6–23 months to have 80% power (two-sided alpha level of 0·05) to detect an overall reduction of 5 percentage points in carriage prevalence of at least one vaccine type (from 22% to 17%) or an increase of 5 percentage points (from 38% to 43%) in carriage prevalence of at least one non-vaccine type serotype. Thus, each year was a standalone study with full power in the main age group of 6–23 months for the urban cohorts. Additionally, the study was designed to have 80% power to detect decreases in serotype-specific analyses for five serotypes in the vaccine that had been detectable in at least 1% of swabs taken in previous studies.\n\n【38】For the hospital pneumonia surveillance study, a sample size of 414 children would have 80% power to detect a 75% reduction in carriage of serotypes 1 and 5, the major serotypes isolated for invasive disease. There was no target for enrolment, as all eligible children within the age range were approached for recruitment and numbers varied from year to year depending on the number of pneumonia cases being admitted to the hospital. We expected that there would be enough participants for most years for the study to be fully powered to detect the difference specified. Further details on sample size assumptions are provided in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 1–2)</u>.\n\n【39】We assessed nasopharyngeal carriage prevalence of pneumococci for each study population, cohort, and year, and classified these as any PCV10 serotypes (PCV10: 1, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F), additional PCV13 serotype (PCV13+: 3, 6A, and 19A), additional PCV20 serotype (PCV20+: 8, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 22F, and 33F), or other non-vaccine types.\n\n【40】We calculated prevalence ratios by comparing each post-introduction year with the 2014–15 pre-vaccine years. Log-binomial regression models incorporating variables for sex, age, month of enrolment, and recent antibiotic use were fitted to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios. Models of carriage in healthy community children were adjusted for sex, age, and month of enrolment.\n\n【41】For chest radiographs of pneumonia cases, we calculated the prevalence of primary endpoint pneumonia in those with clinically diagnosed pneumonia and calculated adjusted prevalence ratios. We present point estimates with 95% CIs without p values and with no adjustment for multiplicity.\n\n【42】Data were entered into Microsoft Access or OpenClinica databases by staff at Patan Hospital. Data were queried and cleaned regularly with a further review at the end of each year. All analyses were done with SAS (version 9.4).\n\n【43】All participants with available data from nasopharyngeal swabs were included in the analysis. The analysis of primary endpoint pneumonia included only those with interpretable radiographs and missing outcome data were not imputed.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【44】The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.\n\n【45】</u>Results\n-------\n\n【46】There were 2051 cases of suspected pneumonia in children aged between 2 months and 14 years enrolled between March 20, 2014, and Dec 31, 2019, at Patan Hospital: 477 during the pre-vaccination period (2014–15) and 1574 in the 4 years post vaccine introduction.

Year-on-year declines in vaccine-type carriage in children younger than 2 years were observed both in urban and rural communities. Carriage of PCV10 serotypes was almost eliminated among clinical pneumonia cases, with only four clinically diagnosed pneumonia cases younger than 2 years having nasopharyngeal swabs positive for a vaccine serotype in 2019. Additionally, some evidence of indirect (herd) effects was seen in the reduction in carriage in healthy children who had not yet been vaccinated by at least 8 weeks of age.\n\n【69】These data on PCV effect are useful for planning of pneumococcal vaccine introduction programmes in Asia, where disease burden is high and where several countries have not yet introduced the vaccine. \n\n【70】Cross-sectional studies of PCV effect on pneumococcal carriage in the community have been conducted in multiple low-income and middle-income country settings. However, serotype distribution in disease can be markedly different from serotypes circulating in healthy populations, and substantial geographic variation exists. Our study is the first to extend beyond community surveillance in a low-income Asian setting, to quantify the effects of PCV on vaccine-serotype-specific disease, as assessed by carriage of vaccine serotypes in those who were admitted to hospital with pneumonia. In our comprehensive 6-year programme of surveillance, we investigated the effect of PCV10 introduction in urban and rural settings, enrolling both patients with pneumonia who had been admitted to hospital, as well as healthy community-based children, in one of the world's lowest-income countries.\n\n【71】There is a paucity of data on the effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines on vaccine serotype pneumococcal pneumonia, due to difficulties in measuring this outcome. Determining the true cause of pneumonia is challenging given the limitations of diagnostic tools.\n\n【72】A recent WHO systematic review found multiple studies assessing vaccine effect against vaccine type invasive pneumococcal disease, but none in Asian or low-income or middle-income settings. Only four studies reported the effect of the 2 + 1 schedule on pneumococcal pneumonia using pre-vaccine and post-vaccine introduction study designs. These studies were limited to children younger than 5 years. All four studies reported reductions of between 70% and 75% for overall pneumonia caused by all pneumococcal serotypes combined. However, serotype-specific estimates or vaccine-serotype estimates were unavailable due to the lack of available serotyping data, and studies were not done in low-income or middle-income countries.\n\n【73】To overcome this gap in serotype-specific estimates for pneumococcal pneumonia from low-income or middle-income settings, we assessed vaccine-serotype pneumococcal nasopharyngeal carriage from patients with pneumonia. Carriage of _S pneumoniae_ in children diagnosed with pneumonia is not proof that the pneumonia is pneumococcal in origin. However, carriage of serotypes that are rarely detected in healthy controls, but are common in pneumonia cases, is more likely to be indicative of a pneumococcal infection. In 2019, serotype 1 was most often detected in invasive pneumococcal disease, and was found in nasopharyngeal swabs in 12·8% of patients with pneumonia aged 5 years or older, but was not detected at all in healthy children older than 2 years. Notably, the distribution of carried serotypes in those with pneumonia in our study differed from the distribution of serotypes carried in healthy child cohorts, but was similar to the distribution of serotypes found in invasive pneumococcal disease. These findings confirm the benefits of this approach in which nasopharyngeal samples are taken in pneumonia patients to measure the effect of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against pneumococcal pneumonia. These data also highlight the unusual age distribution of disease caused by serotype 1 in this setting.\n\n【74】Indirect vaccine effects were not observed in older children in our urban community cohort, nor in those admitted to hospital with pneumonia, possibly due to the smaller sample size. However, in infants younger than 8 weeks of age, a decrease in vaccine type carriage was seen in 2019. There is variable evidence of indirect vaccine effects when PCV10 is introduced without a catch-up campaign. In Mozambique, PCV10 was introduced using a 3 + 0 schedule with no catch-up campaign and no effect was seen in children aged 2–5 years. By contrast, a significant effect in those aged 2–6 years was observed in Fiji as early as 1 year after vaccine introduction using a 3 + 0 schedule without a catch-up campaign, but was no longer significant after 3 years. In Kilifi, Kenya, PCV10 was introduced using a 3 + 0 schedule with catch-up to 5 years and a large decrease in vaccine type carriage in those 5 years and older was observed. In Ghana, the introduction of PCV13 with a 3 + 0 schedule and no catch-up campaign resulted in decreased incidence of vaccine type pneumococcal meningitis in children younger than 5 years of age. However, 4 years after vaccine introduction, serotype 1 remained the major cause of pneumococcal meningitis in older children and adults, showing an absence of established herd effects.\n\n【75】In our community cohorts, detection of indirect vaccine effects was limited by the small sample size targeted for children aged 2–5 years: 150 children per year. In pneumonia surveillance, the number of children admitted with pneumonia was also low in the older age groups; between 58% and 70% of children with pneumonia each year were younger than 2 years, and the median age each year was between 12 months and 19 months. A catch-up campaign in older children might still be required to see effect on disease caused by this serotype which disproportionately affects older children.\n\n【76】Our 6-year follow-up programme enabled the detection of delayed vaccine effects. The long length of this study is of particular value in the Nepalese setting because the vaccine was introduced using a unique 2 + 1 schedule, without a catch-up campaign, in a setting with an older age distribution of pneumococcal pneumonia cases. A reduction in vaccine type carriage in children with pneumonia aged 2–5 years can be seen by mid-2019, when most of this age group would have been vaccinated, showing direct protection provided by the vaccine, 2–3 years after the booster dose.\n\n【77】Widespread use of any serotype-specific polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines is often followed by increases in other serotypes not contained in the vaccine. In patients admitted to hospital with pneumonia, we observed a rise in carriage of serotypes 3 and 19A, yet no rise in the carriage of 6A. A similar pattern was seen in community children younger than 2 years, for whom a decrease in carriage of 6A was observed, suggesting cross protection from serotype 6B in the vaccine.\n\n【78】Serotypes 19A and 6A are contained in the PCV13 vaccine and in the newer 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Pneumosil, Serum Institute of India); thus, a change of vaccine product might prevent further increases in these serotypes. However, to gain control of the current high proportion of serotype 1 disease in older children, a catch-up campaign might be considered by policy makers. Modelling of different catch-up campaigns in Viet Nam before vaccine introduction concluded that catch-up campaigns can reduce the time to elimination of vaccine serotypes in the Vietnamese context. However, similar modelling is not available for Nepal and the effect of commencing a catch-up campaign after routine vaccination programmes is unknown.\n\n【79】Consolidation of effusion on chest radiographs might indicate a pneumonia that is bacterial in origin. We observed a decline in the proportion of radiographs that showed primary endpoint pneumonia until 2018. However, the proportion of radiographs showing primary endpoint pneumonia in 2019 was higher than in previous years and, when broken down by age groups, age-specific trends varied and were not more pronounced in the youngest, most vaccinated age group. The proportion of children with endpoint consolidation can be affected by other circulating pathogens with prevalence varying from year to year. Detecting vaccine effects using this method is harder as it is a less specific outcome. Furthermore, several external factors such as air pollution and internal population migration might have affected the observations in this study.\n\n【80】There are limitations to our study. We had 1·5 years of surveillance before the vaccine introduction and thus the amount of year-to-year variation in case numbers that might exist in the absence of vaccination remains unclear. The planned 5-year follow-up after vaccine introduction was curtailed by 1 year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data for 2020 are not presented due to the influence of the pandemic on case numbers and social mixing. Because the study was powered to detect differences in each yearly cohort, the loss of 1 year of data does not affect power, and the original funding was for 3 years after vaccine introduction. Decreases in vaccine type carriage observed in the study were in keeping with the target effect sizes allowed for in the sample size calculations. Observational cohort studies can be influenced by temporal changes in disease due to non-vaccine causes and we cannot rule out some form of bias or confounding due to unknown or unmeasured factors on study outcomes, and our population might not be representative of the general population or children in other geographic regions. Vaccinations were not given as part of the study and vaccine history could only be elicited by caregiver recall and might not be correct, because vaccination rates were high by caregiver recall, including in older aged children who were ineligible for vaccination.\n\n【81】The inclusion of PCV10 given at 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 9 months of age in the Nepalese infant immunisation schedule resulted in reductions in carriage of vaccine serotypes, for both healthy children in urban and rural communities, and in admitted children with pneumonia younger than 2 years. Emerging increases in carriage of serotypes 19A and 3 in healthy children highlight the importance of surveillance to provide data to inform optimal vaccine policy and product choice.\n\n【82】PneumoNepal Study Group members\n\n【83】Imran Ansari, Krishna Govinda Prajapati, Rasmila Deshar, Tshering Yanyzon Gurung, Jyoti Kumari Yadav, Anshu Mallik, Kalpana Acharya, Subash Shrestha, Sonu Kumar Yadav, Diksha Nepal, Anushiya Kattel, Kushal Gautam, Roshan Jha, Shriya Bista, Swati Dhungel, Ruby Basi, Mamata Maharjan, Manisha KC, Jita Nepal, Laxmi Lama, Sabitri Bista, Arjun Kumar Budha, Shirty Raj Karnikar, Pallavi Gurung, Baikuntha Acharya, Saraswati Budhathok, Rupa Pudasaini, Tham Kumari Pun Magar (Patan Academy of Health Sciences, Kathmandu, Nepal); Sally Felle (Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK); Katie Gorham, Rose Weeks, Alexandra Michel (International Vaccine Access Center, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA); Kate Park, Matt Smedley (Oxford Children's Hospital, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, UK).\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n\n【84】AJP, DFK, ShS, KLO'B, ST, and DRM conceptualised the study and AJP, DFK, DRM, ShS, KLO'B, MDK, ST, and MV supervised the study.

This segregation shows Latin America's longstanding economic and social inequality, cemented by an economic framework that predicted that economic growth would lead to rapid formalisation of the economy. Today, the institutional setup that organises the social segregation in health care is perceived, despite improved life expectancy and other advances, as a barrier to fulfilling the right to health, embodied in the legislation of many Latin American countries. This Series paper outlines four phases in the history of Latin American countries that explain the roots of segmentation in health care and describe three paths taken by countries seeking to overcome it: unification of the funds used to finance both social security and Ministry of Health services (one public payer); free choice of provider or insurer; and expansion of services to poor people and the non-salaried population by making explicit the health-care benefits to which all citizens are entitled.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【2】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【3】Already registered?\n\n【4】Log in to existing account\n\n【5】Forgot password?\n\n【6】One-time access price info\n\n【7】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【8】Not yet registered?\n\n【9】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Follow-up continued until Jan 31, 2009. The primary endpoint was virological failure, defined as RNA more than 500 copies per mL after 6 months of treatment.

A global commitment has been made to provide universal coverage, but another 5 million people, mostly living in rural and semiurban areas, are estimated to need such treatment. Achievement of high coverage in these populations will be a challenge. Two major barriers to increasing coverage exist—a severe shortage of clinically qualified staff, which has reached crisis point in most of Africa, and difficulty for patients in accessing clinics because of high costs and poor availability of transport and low-cash incomes. \n\n【12】WHO proposes decentralised antiretroviral therapy delivery, and so far services for such therapy have been provided through nurse-led centres with simplified protocols in several settings, including in Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Botswana, and South Africa. Good patient outcomes have been reported from short-term assessments done in some sites, but interpretation of this evidence is difficult because of poor retention rates. Furthermore, nursing staff as well as doctors are in very short supply and care needs to be delegated to non-clinical workers, although evidence for use of non-clinical workers in HIV care is scarce. In Tororo, Uganda, a home-based programme with lay workers has achieved good outcomes, but it consisted of home visits made every week with good access to clinical staff when needed—a model that would be difficult to scale up. No direct comparisons of hospital-based HIV care versus any form of decentralised HIV care have been done in Africa. We assessed home-based HIV care, with lay workers delivering antiretroviral therapy and monitoring patients, versus facility-based HIV care.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】### Study setting and patients\n\n【15】We undertook a trial based at the AIDS Support Organisation (TASO) clinic in Jinja district, southeast Uganda. TASO is a large non-governmental organisation with 11 centres in the country, offering counselling and social and clinical services to people with HIV. The Jinja district and surrounding area is poor, with inhabitants on low-cash incomes. TASO clinic serves a predominantly rural and semiurban population from a radius of about 100 km. Most TASO clients are subsistence farmers, and very few work in the formal sector earning wages.\n\n【16】In accordance with guidelines from the Ugandan Ministry of Health, people with HIV were eligible to start antiretroviral therapy if they were assessed to be at WHO stage IV or late stage III disease, or if they had a CD4-cell count of fewer than 200 cells per μL. Eligible patients were prepared for therapy by TASO staff during three visits to clinic, which were usually spread over 4 weeks. Information and counselling were provided both in groups and in one-to-one sessions. Participants were given drugs for 28 days of treatment and issued with a pill box. A buffer supply for 2 days was provided. Patients were also strongly encouraged to identify a so-called medicine companion to provide support and reminders. Medicine companions were given information by TASO about the basic principles of antiretroviral therapy and adherence.\n\n【17】All TASO patients older than 18 years who were starting on antiretroviral therapy for the first time were invited to join the trial, apart from those living on islands, which were about 100 km away and where provision of home-based care was not possible. All patients provided written informed consent. The trial protocol was approved by the Ugandan National Council of Science and Technology and the Institutional Review Boards of the Uganda Virus Research Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Patients were informed about their rights to refuse to join the trial or withdraw subsequently. Those who did were offered facility-based HIV care (including antiretroviral therapy) from TASO Jinja.\n\n【18】### Study design\n\n【19】Recruitment began Feb 15, 2005, and ended Dec 19, 2006, and follow-up continued until Jan 31, 2009. Numbers of patients eligible for antiretroviral therapy were not known in advance—participants were identified after they were tested for CD4-cell counts and clinically assessed. The catchment area was divided into nine strata according to ratio of urban and rural participants and approximate distance from a central point to the TASO Jinja clinic. In every stratum, an even number of clusters (geographical areas) were defined for randomisation along subdistrict boundaries, or, in the case of a few large subdistricts, by known barriers within the subdistrict. Clusters in every stratum had a similar estimated number of people with HIV who were registered at TASO Jinja. Distribution of strata and clusters was as follows: (1) four clusters in urban areas or near the TASO Jinja facility; (2) eight in periurban intermediate distance; (3) eight in rural and far; (4) four in Kamuli district; (5) four in Mukono district near; (6) six in Mukono district far; (7) six in Mayuge district; (8) two in Iganga district near; and (9) two in Iganga district far. Strata and clusters were devised by two people with knowledge of the area (one TASO staff member and one researcher) and cross-checked independently by two other people on two separate occasions.\n\n【20】For all patients, antiretroviral therapy was started at the TASO Jinja clinic, and thereafter patients received care according to the treatment to which their residential area had been assigned. After giving consent, patients were enrolled into the study by research staff, and their addresses were confirmed from TASO records. At every clinic visit, research staff interviewed participants in privacy in a separate building soon after their arrival and before they saw TASO staff.\n\n【21】### Randomisation\n\n【22】Clusters in each strata were allocated to either home-based or facility-based care by drawing cards from a concealed box. The cards were sealed in advance and labelled with the stratum number by the trial coordinator and TASO senior medical officer who organised the allocation event and placed the cards into the box for each stratum. Cards were drawn by two patient representatives, a TASO medical officer, TASO counsellor, and TASO field officer, each taking turns. This process was done in the presence of senior TASO staff, researchers, and local public health representatives.\n\n【23】### Models of care\n\n【24】The trial was done in conditions similar to those of actual health services, with TASO staff responsible for service delivery. Numbers of counsellors, nurses, and laboratory and pharmacy staff in Jinja were similar to those at other TASO centres. The clinic had five medical officers but the number present usually varied between two and four, with some support from local part-time physicians during the trial. Most medical officers were newly qualified. Clinical staff were trained on antiretroviral therapy and supported by a senior medical officer.\n\n【25】For the home-based group, trained field officers travelling on motorcycles visited patients at home every month to deliver drugs, monitor participants with a checklist that included signs and symptoms of drug toxicity or disease progression, and provide adherence support. Most field officers had degree qualifications or college diplomas and underwent 4 weeks of intensive training at the start of the study and yearly refresher courses thereafter about the principles of antiretroviral therapy and adherence support. They were supported at the TASO clinic by counsellors and medical officers.\n\n【26】Field officers referred patients to a physician or counsellor at the TASO clinic when they judged referral to be necessary. They had mobile phones and could contact physicians when unsure about referral. At the end of every day, a medical officer reviewed the notes made by field officers and, when needed, asked officers to return to the patient's home to refer them. Patients who were not at home for their monthly appointment were visited again—usually the next day. If they were absent again, fieldworkers left a message for them to come to the clinic. All patients were invited to the clinic for routine reviews by a medical officer and a counsellor at 2 and 6 months after starting therapy and every 6 months thereafter. Drugs were not dispensed during clinic visits for those allocated to home-based case. Before antiretroviral therapy started, TASO offered free voluntary counselling and testing in the home to household members of participants. This offer was repeated during home visits for drug delivery for those who were absent previously.\n\n【27】In the facility-based group, patients obtained drugs every month from the clinic and had routine reviews with a medical officer and counsellor that were scheduled at 2 and 3 months after start of treatment and every 3 months thereafter. Apart from scheduled reviews, patients were assessed during clinic visits by a nurse and referred to a doctor when necessary. When an appointment was missed, patients were followed up at home by a field officer (if patients had given permission for home visits), usually after 2–3 days, and reminded to attend clinic. Participants were also given vouchers for their household for free voluntary counselling and testing at TASO Jinja. Patients in both groups were asked to come to the clinic any time that they felt unwell. They were also given a telephone number to call for advice. In exceptional cases, and when TASO resources allowed, home care was provided by a team, including a physician, to patients who were bedridden. No financial or other incentives were provided to patients or staff and TASO clinical management procedures were identical for trial and non-trial participants.\n\n【28】### Procedures\n\n【29】Independent research staff assessed adherence. Patients in both groups were interviewed during routine clinical and counselling visits at 2 months and 6 months after starting therapy and then every 6 months. Questionnaires were translated into the local language, Luganda, and then back into English by an independent person, and cross-checked by another researcher who was not involved with the trial.\n\n【30】Clinical data were transcribed from patient notes. A change to a second-line regimen was decided by a TASO case conference, consisting of physicians and counsellors, and was made when a patient had one of the following criteria: (1) new or recurrent WHO clinical stage IV or advanced stage III disease; (2) clinical deterioration (eg, weight loss) and two or more consecutive CD4-cell counts less than baseline, or a fall to 50% less than peak CD4-cell count attained after the start of antiretroviral therapy; or (3) CD4-cell counts persistently fewer than 100 cells per μL. Survival status was established through home follow-ups or hospital records, dependent on where deaths took place. We established the status of participants who withdrew from TASO records.\n\n【31】CD4-cell counts were monitored by TASO staff every 6 months for all patients as part of their clinical care. CD4-positive cells were measured with TriTEST reagents (Becton-Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), according to an inhouse dual-platform protocol and MultiSET and Attractors software (version 2.2) with a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Additional blood was taken to measure plasma viral load, but this testing was for research reasons and done in batches later. Plasma was separated within 2 h and stored immediately at −80°C. HIV-1 RNA was tested with the VERSANT RNA 3.0 (Bayer, Bayer HealthCare, NY, USA) assay (with a lower limit of detection of 50 copies per mL) for baseline samples, and the Amplicor MONITOR 1.5 (Roche, Roche Molecular Systems, NJ, USA) for other samples (400 per copies per mL). After we established close correlation between results of the two assays, the Amplicor assay was used to keep costs to a minimum.\n\n【32】Our economic analysis took a societal perspective and included recurrent and capital costs incurred by the provider, transport and other related costs, and income lost by patients while accessing care. We reported all costs in 2008 US$; the mean exchange rate from 2005 to 2008 was 1732 Ugandan shillings to $1. Cost data and all data for care provided by TASO were obtained from TASO accounts. We used three steps to allocate costs. First, we established the proportion of all TASO clients who were receiving antiretroviral therapy. Second, we calculated the percentage of TASO clients on therapy who entered the trial. Both percentages changed over time, rising initially as numbers of patients who were put on therapy increased, and then falling when recruitment stopped. To capture this dynamic situation, we gathered and aggregated monthly cost data every 6 months, and converted data to US$ with the prevailing exchange rate, with adjustment for inflation.\n\n【33】Third, we allocated costs to facility and home groups. When possible, we used actual service data—eg, information about numbers of doctor visits was used to allocate staff time. We assigned antiretroviral therapy costs proportionally by patient numbers in both groups for that period. Drug prices included purchase cost, insurance, and freight to Uganda and were adjusted to account for substantial price reductions that occurred early in the project. We established costs incurred by patients through a questionnaire.\n\n【34】Health-services costs consisted of: staff costs (doctors, field officers, cousellors, and other staff), transport (motorcycle and vehicle costs of fuel and maintenance, and other transport costs); all drugs; laboratory and clinical expenses (radiograph, ultrasound, and laboratory and CD4 tests); sensitisation (AIDS education via radio, other media, and drama); training, teambuilding, and workshops; utilities (electricity, telephone, postage, and security), supervision and overheads (stationery, repairs, overheads, and supervision costs), and capital costs (buildings, furniture, vehicles, equipment, and inventory). Buildings depreciated over 50 years and other elements 5 years (eg, The AIDS Support Organisation practice). Patient costs consisted of: cost of transport (including transport of medicine companion), childcare, and lunches, if applicable, median weighted by proportion ($2·88 for women and $3·46 for men); and lost work time, estimated 1 day for clinic visits and 0·5 days for home visits, valued at Uganda mean per head gross domestic product from 2005–08 (World Bank data) for 300 working days per year.\n\n【35】The primary endpoint was rate of virological failure, defined as time (starting from 6 months) to a plasma RNA viral load of more than 500 copies per mL. The secondary outcome measures were time to either detectable plasma viral load of more than 500 copies per mL at any visit from 12 months onwards in patients with viral loads of fewer than 500 copies per mL at 6 months, or an increase of 1000 copies per mL between two consecutive tests in those not achieving a viral load of fewer than 500 copies per mL at 6 months. Other secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality; virological failure as defined in the primary outcome or death; time to first admission; death, admission, or change to second-line antiretroviral therapy; outpatient attendance; adherence during the previous 28 days (measured with a standardised questionnaire); and costs incurred by the health service and patients.\n\n【36】### Statistical analysis\n\n【37】We designed the study as an equivalence trial. Virological failure time was taken as halfway between the last measure of RNA of 500 copies per mL or fewer and the first of more than 500 copies per mL. Testing was repeated in patients who had viral loads between 500 and 1000 copies per mL to exclude the possibility of small transient increases. We assumed that in one group the rate of virological failure during follow-up would be about 20%, and that the other group could be regarded as equivalent if the rate of virological failure did not exceed 20% by more than 9%—ie, 29% or less. Thus, the upper limit of our equivalence interval was 29/20 or 1·45, and by symmetry the lower limit was 20/29 or 0·69. A sample size of 20 clusters per group with a total of 1200 participants gave more than 95% power to show equivalence, on the assumption of a between-cluster coefficient of variation of 0·2.\n\n【38】Analysis was by intention to treat, in which all participants were regarded as randomly assigned to the group corresponding to the cluster in which they lived. Analyses were done for the individual by fitting generalised linear mixed models with a log-link and poisson distribution, with every patient contributing an outcome of 1 if they had virological failure and 0 if they did not. The model had fixed terms for study regions, baseline CD4-cell counts (categorised as a four-level factor with counts of 0–49, 50–99, 100–149, and 150 or more cells per μL), and study groups, with the log of exposure time included as an offset variable, and a random term for study cluster. The model was fitted with the assumption that the random cluster effects followed a γ distribution. For the primary endpoint, exposure time was calculated from the 6-month visit to midway between the last date on which the patient did not have virological failure and the date of virological failure. For other endpoints, exposure time was calculated from enrolment. Those who withdrew or were lost to follow-up before 12 months were excluded from the primary endpoint analysis, and for other endpoints they were censored on the last date seen.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【39】Sponsor staff had a role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report.

Much of this expense was for transport. After the first year, patient costs for the home-based group were fairly low but remained high for the facility-based group, showing the economic burden of monthly clinic visits. Overall, the median cost of a clinic visit was $2·30—about 13% of reported monthly cash incomes for men and 20% for women.\n\n【77】Discussion\n----------\n\n【78】We have shown that a home-based HIV-care strategy with trained lay workers supporting drug delivery and monitoring patients was as effective as was a nurse-led and doctor-led clinic-based strategy for prevention of virological failure, mortality, and other adverse outcomes. For our primary endpoint of virological failure, the adjusted RR was contained between the pre-specified equivalence limits of 0·69 to 1·45. Results were similar for other endpoints. The home-based strategy did not result in higher costs for the health service. Moreover, home-based care was slightly cheaper than facility-based care by about $45 per patient per year, or 6% of the total cost. Costs incurred by patients to access care were much less for those in the home group than for those receiving facility-based care.\n\n【79】We have identified a strategy to provide effective HIV care in the many settings in Africa in which clinical staff are scarce and patient access to clinics is difficult. Our findings were achieved in a standard resource-constrained health-service setting. Mortality rates in our facility-based group of about six deaths per 100 person-years and virological failure rates of nine per 100 person-years were better than or at least as good as were those reported from most other settings. Other researchers have reported mortality rates ranging from six to more than 15 deaths per 100 person-years and virological failure rates from 15% to more than 40% for 12–24 months. Thus, findings from our home-based care strategy were compared with a well functioning facility-based model and identified to be equivalent. Mortality rates in developed countries are about two deaths per 100 person-years and most of the increased mortality in Africa takes place during the first year of follow-up, as we identified. This mortality rate could be reduced through starting of antiretroviral therapy earlier than it is at present, but how people with HIV infection who need treatment can be identified early and encouraged to seek care is less clear, and needs to be investigated. Our study shows that community-based approaches would be important.\n\n【80】We transferred care from the clinic to trained lay workers visiting homes of patients. The costs of the home visits were offset by the savings from reduced attendence at clinic—thus, 75% fewer clinic visits were made by patients in the home-based group, and 50% fewer consultations with a doctor took place when a new clinical disorder was recorded. We recorded no negative effect on survival, plasma viral load, or other outcomes. Patients had regular counselling and adherence support, especially in the home group in which support was personalised and often provided by the same individual. This support could have had a major positive effect on outcomes. Such an approach should be achievable throughout Africa since counsellors and other support staff are more easily available and rapidly trained than are clinical staff and incur much less expense for health services. A large randomised trial at two sites in Uganda and one in Zimbabwe recorded health-service costs of $846 (2008 exchange rate) for a model of laboratory and clinical monitoring at a health facility, which is similar to $793 in our home group and $838 in our facility group.\n\n【81】Costs of access to care are a major burden for most African people, especially for those living in rural areas, because cash incomes are very low. In our study, one clinic visit was 15–20% of monthly earnings for most people. In Africa, high travel costs relative to income are major determinants of poor access to care, late presentation, poor adherence, and low retention of people in antiretroviral-therapy programmes. Our study shows that home-based care could substantially reduce costs for patients and this outcome might have a major beneficial effect on their long-term adherence and retention.\n\n【82】In our study, TASO changed treatment to second-line therapy for three people only, which was substantially fewer than those who had falls in CD4-cell counts to less than their baseline or virological failure, showing the major differences in the diagnostic accuracy of clinical and laboratory assessments. When to change HIV treatment is a dilemma in many settings in Africa because of poor availability and high costs of second-line regimens and the absence of information about resistance to antiretroviral therapy—a situation that is unlikely to greatly change in the near future. We should, therefore, identify means to achieve the best possible adherence to extend the life of existing drugs. Our results suggest that community-based support of patients receiving antiretroviral therapy could lead to high adherence.\n\n【83】Very few studies have been done in which models of care are randomly assigned because of strong preferences of some individuals for a specific method of care and the role of stigma, which might result from HIV status disclosure—eg, if a field worker from a known AIDS support organisation visits a patient in the community. We overcame these difficulties by developing a partnership with the service provider, the community, and with patients from the beginning when the research question was defined, and then held regular meetings with stakeholders to discuss difficulties and provide information. No monetary incentives were provided to either the service provider or patients. Only 41 (3%) of participants refused to join the trial or later withdrew and cited stigma as a reason. All received antiretrovirals from TASO or other providers. The importance and effects of stigma in the long term when patients have sustained improved health and, for example, resumed normal relationships, is unclear. However, we have shown that community-based HIV care is feasible and that stigma is probably not an impediment to increasing coverage in settings in which trust and good relations between service providers and the community are present.\n\n【84】Our study could have been affected by selection bias, but numbers of refusals and withdrawals were low and almost identical in both groups. Most people who withdrew were alive at the end of the study—survival status was unknown for just 51 (4%) of participants. More were recruited in the home group than in the facility group but many more in the home group were screened, suggesting that this imbalance arose by chance. Median baseline CD4-cell count was also lower in the home group than in the facility group, but again this finding was probably attributable to chance (and was adjusted for in the analysis). These imbalances show the weakness of cluster-randomised trials in achievement of balance through randomisation, even in trials such as ours in which a large number of clusters were randomised.\n\n【85】We have shown that home-based HIV care with antiretroviral therapy is an effective strategy, which relies less on clinical staff and hospital services than does facility-based care and provides large savings for patients. Such community-based strategies could enable improved and equitable access to HIV treatment—especially in areas in which clinical infrastructure is scarce and patient access to clinic-based care is poor.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【86】SJ, HG, AC, JM, and RB were the principal investigators, wrote the protocol, and supervised implementation of the study.

On the basis of the data presented, however, we believe this recommendation is premature.\n\n【2】Nowhere do the authors consider the cost-effectiveness of this treatment regimen. The 95% CI cited for the 2-year survival difference ranges from 1% to 12%, which equates to a number needed to treat (NNT) of between eight and 100. Assuming an approximate cost of, for example, UK£6000 for paclitaxel (£1000 per course for six courses), the cost per additional person alive at 2 years ranges from £48 000 to £600 000; even the lower figure is higher than the maximum acceptable cost threshold apparently used by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK, whereas the upper figure would not represent a worthwhile use of finite resources. So, although the treatment results are significant, their clinical importance is questionable.\n\n【3】We also question the indirect methods used to estimate survival benefits from hazard ratios, which assume a constant, persistent relative death rate. In advanced cancer, treatments rarely produce persistent benefits, with a delay in the time to death being more likely. The estimated overall and progression-free survival benefits are exaggerated by the methods. For example, the differences in 2-year and median overall survival seen in figure 2 of the article are about 3% and 2 months, respectively (not 7% and 5 months as estimated from the hazard ratio).\n\n【4】Finally, treatment allocation by minimisation should, by definition, maintain close balance between groups. However, an imbalance of 18 patients arose between treatment (n=392) and control (n=410) groups, mostly from the Italian component of the study. Could the authors provide more detail of the minimisation method used and confirm that no randomised patients were omitted from the analysis?\n\n【5】We all wish to see improvements in outcome for women with advanced ovarian cancer. However, whether extending survival by, at most, a few weeks, with no improvement in quality of life, is sufficient to justify the use of expensive new treatments is questionable. Resources might be better used elsewhere. Furthermore, overstating the benefits of treatments could detract from the search for more effective agents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The most recent data indicate that, by 2050, the prevalence of dementia will double in Europe and triple worldwide, and that estimate is 3 times higher when based on a biological (rather than clinical) definition of Alzheimer's disease. The earliest phase of Alzheimer's disease (cellular phase) happens in parallel with accumulating amyloid β, inducing the spread of tau pathology. The risk of Alzheimer's disease is 60–80% dependent on heritable factors, with more than 40 Alzheimer's disease-associated genetic risk loci already identified, of which the _APOE_ alleles have the strongest association with the disease. Novel biomarkers include PET scans and plasma assays for amyloid β and phosphorylated tau, which show great promise for clinical and research use. Multidomain lifestyle-based prevention trials suggest cognitive benefits in participants with increased risk of dementia. Lifestyle factors do not directly affect Alzheimer's disease pathology, but can still contribute to a positive outcome in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.

You note that “proponents of the ban \\[on DDT\\] have invoked the precautionary principle to push for this global ban on health grounds”.\n\n【1】We wish to clarify the meaning and application of precaution in this context. A ban is only one kind of precautionary action. Many who believe that actions of the international community should explicitly be guided by a precautionary approach understand the particular dilemma posed by DDT, because of its current use in controlling malaria. There is no inconsistency in insisting on precaution, globally banning DDT from agricultural use, and exploring effective alternatives to DDT, while accepting the limited need for DDT for malaria control in some countries.\n\n【2】The precautionary principle is a framework to guide thinking, especially in the face of scientific uncertainty. The principle requires that the possibilities of harm and the certainty or uncertainty of understanding be acknowledged before deciding how to act. It does not tell us what to do.\n\n【3】You cite the Wingspread statement (drawn up by international environment and public health experts in Wisconsin in January, 1998) as a commonly accepted definition of the principle. However, you do not acknowledge all the features of precautionary measures. One of the most important is that “the process of applying the Precautionary Principle must be open, informed and democratic and must include potentially affected parties”. Another is the consideration of alternatives.\n\n【4】An immediate ban on all uses need not be necessary for DDT.

A third of women attending specialist clinics are clinically depressed, and one in five have levels of anxiety that are similar to those in psychiatric outpatient populations. Many conventional beliefs about the cause and treatment of women with recurrent miscarriage have not withstood scrutiny, but progress has been made.

Researchers estimate 70% of premature deaths in adults can be linked to behaviors that start in adolescence. As noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) account for 71% of deaths globally, the World Health Organization specifically calls out the need to reduce modifiable risk factors and underlying social determinants through the creation of health-promoting environments in order to reach Sustainable Development Goal 3.4. In Vietnam, NCDs are responsible for approximately 80% of all deaths and 75% of disability-adjusted life years and are increasingly prevalent among youths (10 to 24 years old). The popularity of risky behaviors among youth such as unhealthy diets, lack of physical exercise, smoking, and alcohol abuse is leading to the growing burden of NCDs in adulthood and contributed to 20%, 11%, 20%, and 8% of deaths in Vietnam, respectively. A recent study found that 26% of secondary students in Vietnam were overweight or obese, and another survey found about 15% of students grades 8–10 have started smoking. The key to NCD prevention is education and behavior change, in line with the World Health Organization's “best buys” interventions for NCDs (i.e. cost-effective and feasible for implementation), during adolescent years to have a lasting impact on the health and wellness of future adult populations.\n\n【4】In January 2019, the Vietnam Prime Minister approved a national project for the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) to deploy an NCD prevention program within the education system. Considering its limitation of expertise and resources, MOET discussed with PATH, a global health nonprofit organization, a vision to develop an educational program about NCDs through a pilot project, then integrate it into the national education system to benefit millions of youths. Beginning in November 2021, with funding from Fondation Botnar, PATH and MOET have implemented the project “Fit for the Future: Leveraging Data and Frontier Technologies to Build an NCD Program for Youth, with Youth” to address NCD risk behaviors among adolescents in Vietnam 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Within the three-year life, this project not only serves to meet the growing needs of youth and their teachers, but also does so in an environment where there is increasing recognition that digital information and communication technologies can support health systems to cope with the growing disease burden. The Government of Vietnam has recently begun embracing digital innovations and is committed to adopting digital technologies across industries, including health care, as promoted by the Prime Minister.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Program design for “Fit for the Future”.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【5】Education model and digital application\n---------------------------------------\n\n【6】To address unhealthy behaviors among adolescents, the Fit for the Future project is developing the Educational Program on NCD Prevention. The program will include:\n\n【7】*   i)\n\n【8】    A mobile- and web-based application with artificial intelligence to provide students, parents, teachers, and school administrators with tailored knowledge, skills, and support to practice NCD prevention. Twenty e-lessons in the application will cover mental health disorders, associated risk behaviors for NCDs, and guidance on changing these risk behaviors. Additionally, the application will allow for Q&A with artificial intelligence–generated prompts, track risk behaviors of the users, and produce an NCD-related behavior report, along with notifications, tips, and indicators to encourage users. Users—mostly youth—will be able to access the app individually and learn about topics that interest them.\n\n【9】*   ii)\n\n【10】    A subject on NCD prevention to be incorporated into an offline school curriculum. The school teachers equipped with a teaching manual, developed by the project, will deliver 11 lessons to provide their students with basic knowledge on NCDs, associated risk behaviors, and guidance on changing these risk behaviors, as well as sources of support.\n\n【11】Under the educational program, and in collaboration with MOET, the application and curriculum will be combined as a blended intervention: schoolteachers will deliver 11 lessons from the program's teaching manual, while students will self-study relevant content from the mobile/web application prior to each class. During the classroom lesson, students will discuss a topic of NCD prevention and practice new skills under their teacher's facilitation. Along with the curriculum, the project will support schools in organizing regular communication and sporting events to promote NCD prevention. The events will involve not only students and teachers but also parents, community leaders, and local health authorities. The project expects the participation of these relevant stakeholders will create an enabling environment for youth to practice healthy behaviors.\n\n【12】From 2021 to 2023, the project will be piloted in 15 secondary and high schools in 3 provinces with more than 10,000 students ages 12 to 18 years. A baseline survey (June 2021) and a final evaluation (May 2023) will be conducted to measure the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of students on NCD prevention before and after implementing the educational program—as well as collect responses from parents, teachers, and education authorities about NCDs and the demand for NCD prevention education for young people.\n\n【13】The application's development, which began in December 2021 by Online Training Management, is expected to be completed by September 2022—at the beginning of the school year in Vietnam. Young people are also taking an important role in the development process. As youths are digital natives and some of the earliest adopters of new digital applications, the project will explore their technology behaviors to identify what resonates with them most and what features they would like to have in an application. The developers are consulting with youth throughout all components for each version of the application. After the testing phase is complete—which includes hundreds of students, teachers, and education authorities—the final version of the application will be handed to MOET to operate. Under the project's educational program, more than 10,000 adolescent students, along with 20,000 parents and family members, are expected to practice healthy behaviors of NCD prevention introduced through the application. The data generated from the program will indicate gaps in youth knowledge on NCDs and can be used to guide MOET on education policies and programs.\n\n【14】In order for the educational content and policies to resonate with youth, the project will further engage students, peer networks, and social media influencers in the design and advocacy of healthy behaviors to advance health equity goals and increase collective action. The final evaluation of the project in 2023 will review not only the educational program's results but also evidence of the application's effectiveness in promoting behavior change among youth. Based on that evidence, MOET will decide to integrate the application into their website to create a “digital educational ecosystem” that connects target audiences with relevant stakeholders and supports decision-makers in health education and school health programs for youth. Further, as Vietnam undergoes rapid technology advances, innovations such as e-health and artificial intelligence will be leveraged to address young people's health and well-being beyond the life of the project 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 Digital learning ecosystem of the app.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【15】Public health innovation\n------------------------\n\n【16】Digital technology is an integral part of daily life, particularly among youth, to access social media channels, games and entertainment, news outlets, and lifestyle apps, among others. Utilizing the digital platform for health education and NCD prevention is key for the Fit for the Future project and offers several advantages, such as the delivery of the intervention irrespective of space and time constraints, potential cost-effectiveness, special appeal to youth, and scalability. These advantages are significant in the context of Vietnam as they contribute to improving equitable access to health information, in this case for students with diverse socio-economic backgrounds.\n\n【17】Furthermore, internet- and mobile-based interventions have the potential to contribute to long-term behavioral changes because they can adapt to the needs of the individual or group, based on collected data and multiple assessments, and offer tailored solutions (made possible by artificial intelligence), especially when combined with behavioral change techniques and learning principles to help users gain knowledge and practice skills. To our knowledge, there have been very few research studies or initiatives with a specific focus on NCD-related risk factors among Vietnamese youth, resulting in limited data and understanding of their NCD-related behaviors. Hence, the ability to gather data and tailor solutions through internet- and mobile-based programs is a cost-effective and immediate way to offer evidence-based interventions.\n\n【18】The Fit for the Future project is the first-ever comprehensive NCD-prevention intervention applying frontier digital technologies with a school-based program in Vietnam. It will demonstrate how frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence and social media platforms can expand existing evidence-based tools to impact NCD-related risk behaviors in young people. This project takes a unique approach that brings together youth participation, human-centered design, artificial intelligence, and social media platforms to deliver an NCD prevention program that is both sustainable and scalable to benefit Vietnam's youth and beyond.\n\n【19】The e-learning program will provide education about the causes, symptoms, and long-term effects of NCDs, while the mobile/web app will integrate an animation component for youth to visually see the effects of risk behaviors on the body 删除2:<u>(e.g. following smoke inhalation through the body to see how it affects organs and how it shows externally)</u>. Using artificial intelligence, the app will collect user data to provide positive messages and timely suggestions to encourage and motivate activity, a balanced diet, and adoption of other healthy behaviors, as well as build a bank of questions and answers tailored to youth.\n\n【20】Data collected via the app will be de-identified (per the developer's privacy policy), and personal information of the users will not be visible to those with administrative access. Data will be aggregated and presented in count and percentage formats over a given time period at different managerial levels. Teachers will be able to see up-to-date numbers and percentages of the students from their class who registered for the application, completed the e-lessons, and provided information on risk behaviors and their declared risk behaviors—noting that usernames will not be visible. School managers will have access to such information but from the school level, while educational authorities at district, provincial, and ministry levels will see information at their respective levels. Educational authorities will also provide data regarding the programming progress, such as how many classes in a school are teaching the e-lessons, how many schools in a district are deploying the NCD prevention program, etc. Visible metrics will be made in real-time at the city and school levels, agreed upon by the government, to nudge participants to increase healthy behaviors.\n\n【21】In addition to delivering education in and outside of schools, the app can be integrated on social media platforms (e.g. Facebook, TikTok, and Zalo) to have maximum youth reach and access and collect data analytics. Built-in quizzes can also be used to assess youth knowledge of NCDs. The project leverages smartphones and wearable devices to deliver objectives and collect insightful data on the program's effectiveness. These learnings can be used to develop future policies to promote health among this age cohort.\n\n【22】The Fit for the Future project combines internet- and mobile-based interventions and formal health education at school to raise awareness about NCDs and risk factors, forming a comprehensive online and offline ecosystem. The project also recognizes the dynamic social environment around young people, as well as their potential to be the agent of change. The project hopes to not only improve youth's NCD literacy but also empower them to influence their families, peers, and others.\n\n【23】Projected impact\n----------------\n\n【24】The Fit for the Future project takes a user-centered design approach by enabling students who are, or could someday be, personally affected by NCDs to help shape appropriate and impactful health programs and interventions for today and for the youth of tomorrow. The project strategy is prevention-focused, aligning with the 2015–2025 Vietnam National Strategy on Prevention and Control of NCDs. The national strategy sets a target for adult hypertension prevalence to be below 30% and diabetes to be below 8% among individuals 30 to 69 years old. Because we know risky adolescent behavior is associated with increased risk of developing NCDs in adulthood, this can have a long-lasting impact on Vietnam's youth.\n\n【25】The anticipated immediate effects on the youth population include increased knowledge and awareness of healthy behaviors, increased physical activity (e.g. steps walked), improved youth vital statistics (e.g. blood pressure, body mass index, etc.), and increased engagement of youth and their support networks for activities promoting healthy behaviors. The initial results from data collected through the app and school assessments will also provide enhanced information on NCD-related behaviors among adolescents. As the program is sustained for the long term, we can expect to see improved health among youth and boosted confidence for healthy decision-making (i.e. healthier eating, more physical activity, and reduced tobacco and alcohol consumption) and a more interactive and effective youth physical education curriculum. Based on findings of the final project evaluation, as well as available resources, MOET will consider scaling up the educational program to a large population of youth at subnational and national levels. And although the information collected during this pilot project will be stored and utilized within the education sector, there is future potential to collaborate with the Ministry of Health to integrate the app with the existing health system.\n\n【26】The Fit for the Future project aims at reinforcing healthier behaviors and NCD knowledge during the critical adolescent period. However, as students graduate from school and transition into the workforce or undergraduate study, the range of their social interactions expands significantly beyond the basic family and school circles, thereby potentially exposing youth to other risky behaviors and situations. Therefore, to help them maintain healthy habits and behaviors for NCD prevention into adulthood, a more holistic approach is required. The following strategic interventions should be considered: (i) establishing policies and regulation systems specifically aimed at curbing risky behaviors among youth, (ii) modifying educational and workplace environments to enable youth to practice healthy behaviors, (iii) advocating for NCD prevention and including youth as agents of change, as well as connecting them to the larger community of shared interests (e.g. a support group for smoking cessation), and (iv) providing digital and/or outreach services for knowledge, support, and referral to health services.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【27】The project proposal was written by TNH, HNTH, and LNT.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is responsible for an estimated 700 000 deaths annually worldwide. The review on AMR, commissioned by the British Government and chaired by Jim O'Neill, estimates that, if current trends continue, annual fatalities from drug-resistant microbes could rise to more than 10 million by 2050, exceeding deaths caused by cancer.\n\n【1】The European Union (EU) has been committed to combating AMR since 1999, and has continued to prioritise research on AMR in its Horizon 2020 research programme. As part of this commitment, the EU has spent more than €1 billion on AMR research, developed a 12-point action plan on AMR, and launched the Joint Programming Initiative on AMR (JPIAMR) , which aims to increase the coordination of AMR research worldwide. After Japan and Argentina joined in 2015, JPIAMR now has 22 members, 12 of which have a national AMR strategy, a marked improvement since 2011, when none of these countries had an action plan on AMR.\n\n【2】A major achievement of the EU has been the inception of the world's biggest public–private partnership in the field of AMR: the New Drugs for Bad Bugs (ND4BB) programme. This programme was launched under the Innovative Medicines Initiative in 2012, and has contributed to increasing the number of large European pharmaceutical companies active in the research area from four to 11 in the past 5 years. As part of the ND4BB programme, €650 million have been invested across seven projects ranging from basic science to drug discovery, and the development of new business models. Through calls-for-research specifically targeted at small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), the European Commission has also strengthened European SMEs involved in AMR-related research. In the past decade, the number of SMEs working on AMR in the Biopharmaceutical companies from Europe innovating in Anti-Microbial resistance (BEAM) Alliance increased from just a few to around 50. Furthermore, the European Investment Bank, in cooperation with the Commission, developed INNOVFIN Infectious Diseases, a new financing initiative expected to bring new and innovative players to AMR research.\n\n【3】However, once new antimicrobials are developed, they still need to be used appropriately to safeguard their effectiveness for future generations, which underscores the importance of developing better diagnostics. In 2015, the European Commission launched a €1 million challenge prize to develop a rapid diagnostic test for upper respiratory tract infections that can be safely treated without antibiotics. Moreover, projects funded by previous EU research programmes are now delivering results. For instance, an antibacterial coating gel that prevents infections after surgical procedures, or the world's first clinical trial on phage therapy , a potential alternative to antibiotics. Another example is a network of more than 700 hospitals and 500 laboratories, which forms the basis for the efficient and cost-effective clinical evaluation of drugs and alternative interventions.\n\n【4】Through these investments in innovation, the EU has contributed to creating the momentum that has brought pharmaceutical companies—both large and small—back to researching antimicrobials. And, more importantly, these investments are starting to have a real impact in terms of new therapeutics and diagnostics. This positive momentum now needs to be sustained.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2016 Science Photo Library</u>\n\n【5】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Centres used their usual biopsy procedure. Operators who performed anaesthesia were trained in both techniques before the trial and were masked to the randomised allocation until the time of anaesthesia and were not involved in the subsequent biopsy procedure and any assessment or analysis. Other investigators and the patients were masked until trial completion. The primary outcome was the level of the worst pain experienced during the prostate biopsy procedure.

Although the perineal nerve block had a lower mean pain score at 1 h post-biopsy compared with the periprostatic block (0.23 vs 0.43, P = 0.042), they were equivalent at 6 h (0.16 vs 0.25, P = 0.389) and 24 h (0.10 vs 0.26, P = 0.184) respectively. For the change in vital signs during biopsy procedure, perineal nerve block was significantly superior to periprostatic block in terms of maximum value of systolic blood pressure, maximum value of mean arterial pressure and maximum value of heart rate. There are no statistical differences in average value of systolic blood pressure, average value of mean, average value of heart rate, diastolic blood pressure and breathing rate. Perineal nerve block was also superior to periprostatic block in external manifestations of pain (1.88 vs 3.00, P < 0.001) and anaesthesia satisfaction (8.93 vs 11.90, P < 0.001). Equivalence was shown for the detection rate of PCa (31.25% for perineal nerve block and 29.17% for periprostatic block, P = 0.753) or csPCa (23.96% for perineal nerve block and 20.83% for periprostatic block, P = 0.604). 33 (34.8%) of 96 patients in the perineal nerve block group and 40 (41.67%) of 96 patients in the periprostatic block group had at least one complication.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Perineal nerve block was superior to periprostatic block in pain control for men undergoing a transperineal prostate biopsy.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Grant 2019YFC0119100 from the National Key Research and Development Program of China.\n\n【10】</u>Keywords\n--------\n\n【11】*   Transperineal prostate biopsy\n*   Local anaesthesia\n*   Perineal nerve block\n*   Periprostatic block\n\n【12】Research in context\n\n【13】### Evidence before this study\n\n【14】The severe pain caused by transperineal prostate biopsy makes intolerability of the procedure. Although some local anaesthesia methods for this approach have been applied, the comparative trial between various anaesthesia forms was quite limited.\n\n【15】We searched PubMed up to March 1, 2023 without any language for evidence using the following key search terms: “transperineal prostate biopsy” and “local anaesthesia”. Five randomised trials were identified. However, none of these findings was externally validated.\n\n【16】### Added value of this study\n\n【17】In this prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of local anaesthesia reducing the pain of transperineal prostate biopsy procedure, we found that patients who underwent perineal nerve block, compared with periprostatic block, had a less painful feeling, assessed by the numerical pain score and the external manifestations of pain during the biopsy. Patients who underwent perineal nerve block had a higher level of satisfaction with anaesthesia. Cancer detection rate and adverse events were similar between groups.\n\n【18】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【19】This study provides level 1b evidence of the outcome that informs clinicians in making treatment choices and is suitable for broader implementation in clinical practice.\n\n【20】Introduction\n------------\n\n【21】Prostate biopsy is currently the most common way of diagnosing prostate cancer (PCa) following an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or a suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) finding. Since the biopsy technology was first proposed by Hodge et al. in 1989 under the guidance of transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) by a transrectal route, it has become widely accepted for its simplicity and efficiency. However, crossing the rectal mucosa during a biopsy can potentially transfer rectal flora into the prostate, putting the patient at risk of infection, even with antibiotic prophylaxis. The infectious complication rate after a transrectal biopsy ranged from 1 to 8%, with the risk of sepsis-related hospitalisation ranging from 0.8 to 4.1%. It leads urologists to rethink whether there is a more appropriate biopsy approach, especially as antibiotic resistance is emerging with increasing frequency.\n\n【22】Recently, the transperineal biopsy has gained more favour for its low infection rate due to its route bypassing the rectal vault. Also, the transperineal route has a lower risk of post-procedural rectal bleeding than the transrectal approach and a higher cancer detection rate in the anterior gland. The advantages of transperineal biopsy have led to the European Association of Urology (EAU) call for the transrectal approach replacement whenever the technique is feasible. While the transperineal approach has merits, the severe pain caused by this approach makes intolerability of the procedure, which has prevented its widespread use as the current transrectal approach.\n\n【23】Two aspects can be considered in dealing with pain during the transperineal route. The first is requiring sedation or general anaesthesia; though it is efficient in pain control, it increases anaesthetic risks and costs for the patient. In the United States, each patient who undergoes transperineal biopsy under sedation anaesthesia costs an additional $1246 and 12.8 procedure room time minutes more than a patient under local anaesthesia. The second is local anaesthesia; although one may wonder whether such an approach can apply enough efficacy to allow men to tolerate the pain and cooperate with the biopsy procedure (e.g. to reduce pain-induced muscle contractions or movements during the procedure that may make it more difficult for the urologist to perform the biopsy). In single-centre studies, some local anaesthesia methods for transperineal biopsy have been applied and showed efficacy in pain control. However, the comparative trial between various forms was quite limited. We describe a local anaesthesia method, the perineal nerve block, to reduce the procedural pain of transperineal biopsies; the method was developed based on an anatomical study, and then a single-centre randomised trial was conducted to verify its efficacy and safety preliminarily.\n\n【24】Building on previous studies, we present the results of the APROPOS trial, a prospective, multicentre, and randomised controlled trial that compares the perineal nerve block and periprostatic block, one of the most recommended and accepted methods, in patients undergoing a transperineal prostate biopsy.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Trial design and participants\n\n【27】We conducted this multicentre and randomised conrolled trial with blinded outcome assessment in 6 centres in China. Men were eligible if they had suspected prostate cancer with or without a previous prostate biopsy. Eligible men were aged between 18 and 80 years old, with an elevated PSA level between 4 and 20 ng/ml or/and suspicious rectal examination findings. Patients were excluded if they had a history of an allergy to the study drug, symptomatic acute/chronic prostatitis, and contraindications for a biopsy. The APROPOS protocol was approved by an ethics committee (shanghai east hospital ethics committee, approve number 2020050) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04501055). The original protocol has been published, and the full details of the protocol can be accessed in the supplementary appendix . All included patients provided written informed consent. The study was conducted in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines.\n\n【28】The trial was designed by the first author and the last author, and the first draft of the manuscript was written by the first author.\n\n【29】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【30】Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the perineal nerve block group or the periprostatic block group. The assignment sequence was generated by the PROC PLAN statement of the SAS program by using block randomisation. After the generation, the assignment numbers were sealed in envelopes, kept by the research nurse, blinded to the others, and revealed to operators who performed anaesthesia when a participant had already entered the operation room for anaesthesia and the prostate biopsy. This operator was not involved in the followed biopsy procedure, pain assessment, data collection and data analysis. In addition, both patients and the investigators involved in data analysis were blinded to the allocation.\n\n【31】### Procedures\n\n【32】Management was the same for all patients apart from their form of anaesthesia, which was either perineal nerve block or periprostatic block. Skin anaesthesia was first performed with 10 ml of 1% lidocaine with a 22-gauge 32 mm needle, and the followed block anaesthesia was used with 10 ml of 1% lidocaine with a 20-gauge and 80 mm needle under the guidance of a biplanar ultrasound transducer. The perineal nerve block site was located beside the perineal nerve bundle, while the periprostatic block site was located on the basal prostatic capsule, lateral to the location between the prostate and seminal vesicle. The operators performing the anaesthesia were trained in both block methods and confirmed by the principal investigator (HF Wang, done more than 1000 perineal nerve blocks and 500 periprostatic blocks) to ensure quality and complete at least 20 cases of each before this trial.\n\n【33】Biopsy was carried out by another urologist masked to the anaesthesia method. All biopsy procedures used a freehand approach via the transperineal route. 1–4 cores were obtained by cognitive fusion or software-based fusion targeted biopsy from each suspicious lesion shown on the mpMRI, and 8–24 cores were taken by systematic biopsy 删除2:<u>( Table S2 )</u>. The number and location of biopsy cores vary according to prostate volume and the standard of care for each centre. It is worth noting that the systematic biopsy protocol was set up as a uniform 12-core biopsy initially; the APROPOS members agreed after a meeting and were allowed to use their stand care of systematic biopsy as they do in routine clinic to make the results of the study more generalizable. Another research nurse blinded to allocation recorded the manifestations of the patients during the biopsy procedure.\n\n【34】The pathological results were reported by pathologists masked to the patient's condition according to the ISUP guidelines. Clinically significant cancer cases were defined as those with an ISUP score of 2 or higher.\n\n【35】### Outcomes\n\n【36】The primary outcome was the level of the worst pain experienced during the prostate biopsy procedure, which was measured by NRS (numerical rating scale) from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no pain, and 10 represents the worst pain imaginable. In addition, the pain experienced during the phlebotomising procedure and the pain experienced when the needle first touches the skin at the start of anaesthesia were measured as the baseline.\n\n【37】Secondary outcomes were pain (post-biopsy at 1, 6, and 24 h, assessed with the NRS), changes in blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate during the biopsy procedure, external manifestations of pain during biopsy (assessed by research nurse masked to the assignment with a 5-item questionnaire, including facial expression, activity, voice expression, pacification, and cooperation), anaesthesia satisfaction (assessed with 5-item patient report outcome questionnaire), the detection rate of PCa and clinically significant PCa.\n\n【38】### Statistical analysis\n\n【39】Details and descriptions of sample size calculation and statistical analysis are included in the appendix protocol. Assuming that the means (±standard deviation) of maximal VAS score was 2 ± 1 for patients who received a perineal nerve block and 2.5 ± 1 for patients who received a periprostatic block, we estimated that a sample size of 170 participants (85 per group) would give the trial at least 90% power to detect the difference between the two groups at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. The final sample size was increased to 190 participants (95 per group), accounting for a 10% dropout rate.\n\n【40】In baseline characteristics, categorical variables were described using frequencies and percentages. Normality of continuous variable was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed continuous variables were reported as means ± standard deviation, while non-normally distributed continuous variables were reported as medians (the first quartile, the third quartile). Continuous variables were described as means ± standard deviation for normally distributed variables or medians (the first quartile, the third quartile) for non-normal variables. Group comparisons were conducted using the Pearson χ2 test for categorical variables and Student's t-test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. Imbalanced baseline characteristics with P < 0.05 were considered potential confounders that were not fully balanced by randomisation. These confounders were age and PI-RADS score.\n\n【41】In the primary analysis, all patients were analysed according to their randomisation group based on the intention-to-treat principle. No missing value was recorded for primary outcomes, and planned sensitivity analysis on per-protocol (PP) set was not conducted after checking other criteria of PP set. For secondary outcomes, analyses included all randomisation patients with complete data. Missing data were not imputed, and 95% confidence intervals were not adjusted for multiple outcomes. Findings from secondary outcomes should be interpreted as exploratory to avoid potential multiplicity. Generalised linear mixed effect models were used for testing potential differences in continuous and binary outcomes between the two groups, with centre as the random effect and unstructured covariance structure. Proportional odds models with random effects were used for ordinal outcomes, and the proportional odds assumption was confirmed in the general proportional odds model. As appropriate, the results for safety outcomes were described using count (%) and were compared between the two groups using the Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test.\n\n【42】Raw differences and adjusted differences were estimated in the two models, respectively. In model 1, only the group variable was included. The least squared mean and corresponding 95% CI were estimated for each group; meanwhile, the raw differences and 95% CIs between groups were reported. In model 2, age and PI-RADS score were included for adjustment, and the adjusted differences were reported with 95% CI. For change scores as the outcome, its baseline value was further adjusted in model 2. Post-hoc subgroup analyses were conducted for the primary outcome according to age (<70 years vs ≥ 70 years), BMI (<24 kg/m2 vs ≥ 24 kg/m 2 ), PSA (<10 vs ≥ 10), prostate volume (<40 vs ≥ 40), digital rectal examination (positive vs negative), PI-RADS (0–2 vs 3 vs 4–5), ASA (1 vs 2 vs 3), number of biopsy cores (<18 vs ≥ 18). We introduced appropriate interaction terms into the generalised linear mixed-effect models to test potential modification effects. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of our primary analysis, and the number of biopsy cores was further adjusted for pain analysis. Data were analysed with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). All tests were 2-tailed with significance defined as P < 0.05.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【43】The funder BK Medical Holding Company provided the ultrasound instruments but was not involved in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

This difference was statistically significant, regardless of an adjustment. Patients who underwent perineal nerve block had a higher level of satisfaction with anaesthesia. Cancer detection rate and adverse events were similar between arms.\n\n【99】The appropriate clinical interpretation of changes on a numerical scale should consider not only statistical significance but also whether the observed change really matters to patients. A minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is the smallest difference in an outcome measure that would be noticeable to a patient and be of clinical relevance. The MCID in VAS of the comparison between different local anaesthesia for patients undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy was reported as 0.5 by Lv and his colleague. In this trial, the raw difference of 1.18 and the adjusted difference of 1.17 in the NRS exceed the threshold, indicating that the difference is statistically significant and meaningful to patients.\n\n【100】In addition, it is generally accepted that a pain NRS of 3, 6, and 10 indicates the upper boundaries of mild, moderate, and severe pain intensity. According to this criterion, the mean pain (2.8) in the perineal nerve block group and the mean pain (3.98) in the periprostatic block can be classified as mild pain and moderate pain, respectively. From the perspective of this classification, the difference is also considered clinically relevant.\n\n【101】For patients, achieving considerable pain control to be tolerated in the procedure is the most critical outcome of undergoing a transperineal biopsy under local anaesthesia.\n\n【102】Some local anaesthesia methods for transperineal prostate biopsy were developed and introduced previously, leading to the promising tolerability and feasibility of the subsequent biopsy procedure. However, studies that compared various methods of local anaesthesia for those undergoing transperineal biopsy were relatively rare, not to mention further external validated the findings, resulting in the insufficiently high level of evidence to guide clinical application.\n\n【103】The publication of results of these trials does not seem to have affected the consensus on the choice of technique in daily practice; however, the periprostatic block appears to be most widely used, as recommended by EAU guidelines, although it was first described for utilising in the transrectal biopsy. Thus, the periprostatic block was selected as the control arm for the current study to conduct a comparative analysis of transperineal prostate biopsy anaesthesia methods.\n\n【104】APROPOS represented level 1b evidence for assessment of pain control, patient satisfaction, cancer detection, and safety in patients undergoing transperineal under the perineal nerve block and the periprostatic block.\n\n【105】A critical strength of APROPOS is that several important methodological to assess pain were made in the design of this trial. The assessment included not only the subjective perception of the patient (which is, of course, the most important) but also the subjective perception of a third party 删除2:<u>(by how much pain the patient seems to be in)</u> and objective indicators (such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate), which together can assess pain more comprehensively and multi-dimensionally.\n\n【106】Another strength of our study was masking. All patients reported active masking, which minimised bias and was thus particularly significant with the patient-reported primary outcome (Pain score) and main secondary outcomes (anaesthesia satisfaction). Also, the research nurse who made the assessment and the urologist who performed the prostate biopsy were masked, reducing bias in the subject assessment outcome (external manifestations of pain during biopsy) and the detection rate of PCa/csPCa, respectively. In addition, as all urologists could do both perineal nerve block and periprostatic block, they were also masked to the randomised allocation until the time of anaesthesia and not involved in the subsequent biopsy procedure and any assessment or analysis. These rigorous mask strategies provided unbiased comparisons and enabled the result's reliability.\n\n【107】A further strength of this trial was the high completion rate, with all participants completing the trial and the response rate of patient-reported questionnaires was 100%. It is related to the short follow-up time set for the trial, with all patient-reported questionnaires completed within 24 h from the start of the anaesthetic. In addition, the strict blinding method eliminated the conversion of patients between the two groups, contributing to a certain extent to the completion rate.\n\n【108】A limitation is that each centre was allowed to use its own routine transperineal prostate biopsy method, which indicated heterogeneity in the number and location of biopsy cores, which might affect the pain level. However, the differences were not substantial between groups, and it better reflects typical clinical scenarios. Furthermore, analyses of the effect of the number and location of biopsy cores on the procedure pain with APROPOS data are underway and will be reported elsewhere.\n\n【109】Second, template prostate mapping biopsy, a saturation biopsy protocol following a template with a 5 mm density, with an average of nearly 50 biopsy cores and is usually performed under general anaesthesia, was not used in any of the centres. The median number of biopsy cores in this trial was 15, and the maximum number was 30; thus, the conclusion drawn may not be suitable or applicable to patients planning to undergo template prostate mapping biopsy under local anaesthesia.\n\n【110】Third, our study did not assess the pain during the anaesthetic procedure, and it is undeniable that such pain might be more severe than the pain that arises from the post-anaesthetic biopsy process. The patient's report outcome of the anaesthesia satisfaction questionnaire in this trial confirmed the fact that patients in both arms suffer more pain in the anaesthetic phase than in the post-biopsy phase, with the subscore of 2.82 (95% 2.20–3.44) and 3.80 (95% 3.18–3.80) for the perineal nerve block and the periprostatic block respectively.\n\n【111】Fourth, some comorbidities, such as anxiety or depression, that might influence the sensation of pain during the intervention were not involved in this study.\n\n【112】Last, we recognise a difference in the urologist's experience. Although the urologists did not always have the same level of proficiency in the two types of anaesthesia, they all had completed training and performed at least 20 practical exercises before the trial began and were confirmed by the principal investigator to ensure quality. In addition, although the learning curve was not analysed in this study, during the pre-trial training, we found that both anaesthesia modalities were easy to learn for operators who are usually skilled in using freehand transperineal biopsy, as was the case for the urologists in this study.\n\n【113】In general, although transperineal prostate biopsy could be performed in local anaesthesia, some patients could experience complications during the procedure (i.e. vagal syndrome) that lead to the suspension of the procedure. Therefore, in the era of \"Precision Medicine\", transperineal prostate biopsy should be planned in the best clinical condition for the patients and for the urologist \"anaesthesiologist-assisted biopsy\" to improve the prostate biopsy quality. The assistance of an anaesthesiologist during the procedure could help to perform a prostate biopsy (presence of pain and/or treatment of side effects or complications).\n\n【114】In patients undergoing a transperineal prostate biopsy, those who underwent perineal nerve block, compared with periprostatic block, suffer less pain during the biopsy procedure. This study provides level 1b evidence of the outcome that informs clinicians in making treatment choices and is suitable for broader implementation in clinical practice.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【115】BM He and HF Wang had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.\n\n【116】HF Wang, P KF CHIU, T Tao, JH Lan, JT Cai and SC Zhou have verified the underlying data.\n\n【117】Concept and design: BM He and HF Wang.\n\n【118】Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data: BM He, P KF CHIU, T Tao, JH Lan, JT Cai, SC Zhou, RB Li, KL LO, RY Xu, JR Chen, D Lan, JL Gao, SG Chu, FF Huang, ZK Shi, QW Yang, H Zhou, SD Wang, YR Ji, QP Han, CM Wang, CF NG.\n\n【119】Drafting of the manuscript: BM He, HF Wang.\n\n【120】Critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content: P KF CHIU.\n\n【121】Statistical analysis: BM He, ZC Jin.\n\n【122】Administrative, technique, or material support: P KF CHIU, T Tao, JH Lan, JT Cai, SC Zhou, Y Ren.\n\n【123】Supervision: HF Wang, P KF CHIU, T Tao, JH Lan, JT Cai, SC Zhou.\n\n【124】Data sharing statement\n----------------------\n\n【125】The data collected for this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n【126】Declaration of interests\n------------------------\n\n【127】None of the authors have any conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【128】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【129】This work was supported by Remedicine Co, grant 2019YFC0119100 from the National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant 81602220 from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant PWRd2020-17 from the Shanghai Pudong New District Health System Medical Talents Training Plan, China, grant PKX2020-S11 from the Fund of Development on Science and Technology of Shanghai Pudong New District, China, grant 18441910900 from the Shanghai “Action Plan of Technological Innovation, and grant 82002664 from the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Youth.\n\n【130】We thank Ms Ruo-Lan Zeng for depicting figures in the trial protocol.

However, we have some concerns over the undisclosed learning curve in the endovascular group, the 10% risk of developing a severe stroke or death after surgery or angioplasty, and accessibility to the primary data for independent assessment.\n\n【2】With regard to the learning curve, of the initial 99 patients (87 of whom were randomised in CAVATAS), the rate of death, stroke causing major disability, and non-disabling stroke reached 21·5% within 28 days of procedure, and 29·4% at any time after angioplasty. The proportions for surgical performance were 6% and 6%, respectively, which is significantly better. Angioplasty complications must have reduced strikingly from 29·4% at the inception and early stages of the study and fallen to around 5% for the subsequent 200 patients, to provide an overall 10% complication rate. The investigators do not report on these observations and it would be helpful to know the views of the Data Monitoring Committee for such a significant learning curve and the stopping rules that it used.\n\n【3】The overall risk of 10% risk of complications from both procedures were high compared with the declaration from the American Heart Foundation Stroke Council that, for treatment to be effective for symptomatic high-grade carotid stenosis, the combined mortality and morbidity from the surgical procedure needs to be 6% at maximum. Although the CAVATAS investigators show that surgical performance fell within the broad spectrum of surgical outcomes and large randomised controls of the trials for carotid endarterectomy, European and North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trials (ECST and NASCET). In those large studies, the poorly performing units were outweighed by the better units, which resulted in overall benefit in favour of surgery. Surgeons contributing to NASCET had to show perioperative morbidity and mortality rate of under 6%. No such precautions were adopted in CAVATAS, despite the known marked variation in performances for carotid surgery.\n\n【4】Finally, we are concerned that the CAVATAS primary data are not freely available. Similar concerns have been raised about some of the studies involving methylprednisolone in spinal cord injury. Independent professional assessors need to be able to assure themselves of the validity of conclusions drawn from randomised control trials that could change clinical practice. There can be little doubt that endovascular treatment of carotid atheroma has a future role. However, the technique must be allowed to develop in selective and expert hands, allowing comparison with robust surgical outcomes achievable in well organised and appropriate specialised units. Variations of surgical performance within our communities is a separate health-care issue. Angioplasty complication rates need to achieve stability before submitting patients to the rigour of randomised control trials against the surgical technique with proven effectiveness and durability.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

According to the European Medicines Agency (EMA), 30 cases of thromboembolic events (predominantly venous) had been reported by March 10, 2021, among the approximately 5 million recipients of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in the European Economic Area. The EMA subsequently stated that “The number of thromboembolic events in vaccinated people is no higher than the number seen in the general population”. To inform the ongoing discussion on the safety of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, we analysed nationwide population-based data from Denmark to estimate the natural incidence of venous thromboembolism.\n\n【1】Denmark has a tax-supported universal health-care system, in which all hospital contacts are registered in the Danish National Patient Registry. We first used the Danish Civil Registration System to identify all Danes who were at least 18 years old between Jan 1, 2010, and Nov 30, 2018. Using data from the Danish National Patient Registry, we then identified all first-time cases of venous thromboembolism in the general adult population in this period (corresponding to the available data period). We focused on venous thromboembolism because the thromboembolic events reported in relation to the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine by March 10, 2021, were predominantly venous, according to publicly available data on EudraVigilance . We followed all individuals from Jan 1, 2010, or their 18th birthday (whichever came first), until their first incident venous thromboembolism 删除2:<u>(see definition below)</u>, death, emigration, or Nov 30, 2018. Individuals with a diagnosis of venous thromboembolism before Jan 1, 2010, or their 18th birthday were not included in the analyses. Incident venous thromboembolism was defined as the first primary or secondary inpatient hospital diagnosis or outpatient clinic diagnosis of venous thromboembolism. Specifically, the following diagnoses were included in the outcome definition: deep vein thrombosis (International Classification of Diseases version 10\\[ICD-10\\]: I80.1–3), pulmonary embolism (ICD-10: I26), portal vein thrombosis (ICD-10: I81), hepatic vein thrombosis (ICD-10: I82.0), thrombophlebitis migrans (ICD-10: I82.1), embolism or thrombosis of vena cava (ICD-10: I82.2), embolism or thrombosis of renal vein (ICD-10: I82.3), mesenteric thrombosis (ICD-10: K55.0H), cerebral infarction due to non-pyogenic cerebral venous thrombosis (ICD-10: I63.6), and non-pyogenic thrombosis of intracranial venous system (ICD-10: I67.6). The diagnoses of venous thromboembolism in the Danish National Patient Registry have a documented high positive predictive value.\n\n【2】We then calculated incidence rates for venous thromboembolism (any of the diagnoses listed above) for all Danish adults (aged 18 years or older censored at the 100th birthday) as well as for Danes aged 18–64 years. The 18–64-year age group represents the age group in which the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, due to initial perceptions of limited evidence on its efficacy among those aged 65 years and older, has predominantly been used in most European countries—with the exception of the UK, where the vaccine has also been administered among those aged 65 years and older from the outset. We repeated the analysis restricting outcomes to deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, as they account for more than 95% of all diagnoses, and stratified by sex. All incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of incident venous thromboembolisms during follow-up by the sum of person-years during follow-up and reported per 1000 person-years. Subsequently, using these incidence rates for venous thromboembolism, we estimated the number of cases that would be expected over the course of 1 week and 1 month, respectively, in a population with the same size as that having received the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Europe by March 10, 2021. This was done by rescaling the incidence rates to the weekly (7 days) and monthly level (30·5 days) per individual, and multiplying them by 5 million. An example of the calculation carried out for this estimation is provided in the appendix.\n\n【3】The study population aged 18–99 years included 4 915 426 individuals, with a total follow-up time of 38 449 703 person-years. The study population aged 18–64 years included 3 963 153 individuals, with a total follow-up time of 29 537 310 person-years. Equivalent sex-stratified numbers are provided in the appendix.\n\n【4】The number of venous thromboembolic events, as well as the incidence rates in the Danish population in the period from 2010 to November, 2018 are also provided in the appendix. The incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 1·76 (95% CI 1·75–1·78) for venous thromboembolism among Danes aged 18–99 years, and 0·95 (0·94–0·96) among Danes aged 18–64 years. When restricting to deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, the incidence rate per 1000 person-years was 1·70 (95% CI 1·68–1·71) among Danes aged 18–99 years and 0·91 (0·89–0·92) for those aged 18–64 years. The results were consistent for women and men 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>.\n\n【5】In a population of 5 million people (ie, size matching the approximate number of people having received the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Europe by March 10, 2021 ), this incidence would correspond to approximately 169 expected cases of venous thromboembolism per week, or 736 expected cases per month (if based on the incidence rate among the 18–99-year-old Danes). Similarly, if estimated based on the incidence rate among 18–64-year-old Danes, one would expect 91 cases of venous thromboembolism per week, or 398 cases per month.\n\n【6】The Danish data provided here cannot rule out the possibility that some venous thromboembolic events reported in relation to the use of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine are caused by the vaccine. However, although affected by several limitations, these data suggest that the reported number of thromboembolic events among Europeans who have received the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (at least those reported as deriving from the venous system) does not seem to be increased relative to the expected number estimated from incidence rates from the entire Danish population before the introduction of the vaccination programme.\n\n【7】Our findings should be interpreted in the context of their limitations. The number of cases of thromboembolism reported in relation to the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine cannot be directly compared to the numbers estimated based on the incidence rates from the Danish population for several reasons. First, data on the sex and age distribution from those who received the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine are not yet publicly available. In Denmark, about 99% of those having receiving the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine are health-care workers (Valentiner-Branth P, Statens Serum Institut, Denmark, personal communication). The median age of all COVID-19 vaccinated health-care workers in Denmark is 47 years (IQR 36–57), and 82·2% of health-care workers are women. Second, data on the duration of the period during which the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccinated population developed the reported thromboembolic events are also not publicly available, making it impossible to estimate incidence rates for this population. Third, detailed clinical descriptions of the thromboembolic events reported in relation to Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccinations are still lacking. We are, however, aware that although a substantial fraction of the thromboembolisms seem to be venous, reports are emerging of rare types of multiple thrombosis, bleeding, and thrombocytopenia, apparently similar to disseminated intravascular coagulation, occurring in otherwise healthy individuals shortly after receiving the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. These outcomes are not included in the present analysis. Fourth, as even the most efficient spontaneous reporting of adverse events is unlikely to capture all cases, the true incidence rate of thromboembolic events in relation to the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is unknown, and the 30 reported cases by March 10, 2021, is probably an underestimate. Finally, our estimated weekly and monthly venous thromboembolism case numbers in the population of 5 million individuals are based entirely on incidence rates from Denmark and might not be representative of the other countries where the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine has been used. However, previous studies of the incidence rate of venous thromboembolism in other countries have found numbers within range of the Danish rates. \n\n【8】When making decisions on the use of drugs based on pharmacovigilance, it is important to take into account the natural incidence of illnesses, such as venous thromboembolisms, that might be interpreted as serious adverse events. Here, based on pre-pandemic incidence rates from the entire Danish population, we report that the number of venous thromboembolisms reported in relation to the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine does not seem to be increased beyond the expected incidence rate. Nevertheless, recent reports of thrombocytopenia-associated cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, multiple thrombosis, and bleeding within a short timeframe after receipt of the vaccine are concerning and are receiving due attention from health authorities. On March 18, 2021, with reference to the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, the EMA concluded that “benefits still outweigh the risks despite possible link to rare blood clots with low blood platelets”.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2021 Ole Jensen/Stringer/Getty Images</u>\n\n【9】删除9:<u>SDØ received the 2020 Lundbeck Foundation Young Investigator Prize.

They have drawn our attention to the fact that cancer is, or is predicted to become, the leading cause of diabetes-related death in the coming years, overtaking cardiovascular disease. We acknowledge that cancer rates are rising in people with type 2 diabetes. Indeed, in January, 2023, our team at Leicester Diabetes Research Centre published data demonstrating a transition from cardiovascular disease to cancer deaths in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【1】Cancer and type 2 diabetes are known to share many common risk factors, including ageing, obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, alcohol, and smoking. Diabetes along with obesity induces metabolic abnormalities leading to the release of various inflammatory cytokines, immune mediators, hormones, and growth factors. These abnormal metabolic substrates are implicated as risk factors for development of cancer and its mortality.\n\n【2】We agree with Wang and colleagues that better primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease has meant that people with type 2 diabetes now live longer, which consequently has led to longer exposure to the detrimental effects of hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation, all potentially associated with an increased risk of cancer in people with type 2 diabetes. It is also worth remembering that although vascular mortality rates have generally declined over the years in people with type 2 diabetes, the evidence is less clear for cancer in the context of type 2 diabetes and more robust data are needed for accurate trends across different geographical regions of the world and ethnicities.\n\n【3】We strongly agree that now is the correct time to widen general prevention efforts in people with diabetes to reduce cancer incidence and specifically for people with type 2 diabetes, early cancer detection could reduce the number of avoidable cancer deaths. In summary, although the prevention of cardiovascular disease is still considered a priority in people with type 2 diabetes, we do emphasise the need to prioritise cancer prevention, early detection, management, and clinical research in people with type 2 diabetes to prevent cancer from ultimately becoming the leading cause of death in this population group.\n\n【4】EA has received fellowship funding from AstraZeneca.

Some of this increase is driven by the demographic shift in the population; the proportion of those aged 65 years and older increased from 16% to 19% over this period, partly reflecting past birth patterns but also falling mortality rates. Another factor is population growth; during this period the total population of Scotland has grown by 10%, with almost all the growth attributable to net inward migration. Incidence rates for type 2 diabetes have fallen to a current rate of 312 per 100 000 population per year from 355 per 100 000 in 2010. However, even if this incidence trend continues, the projected ageing of the population (an expected increase of 23% in those older than 65 years in the next 25 years) means that type 2 diabetes prevalence will continue to rise. Meanwhile, the main underlying risk factor of overweight and obesity has remained about the same in Scotland since 2008, with almost two thirds of adults and 30% of children having an unhealthy weight. There are wide socioeconomic disparities in overweight and obesity and these translate into the prevalence of diabetes being 80% higher in the most deprived fifth of the population than in the fifth most affluent; moreover, this gap is widening.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【1】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【2】Already registered?\n\n【3】Log in to existing account\n\n【4】Forgot password?\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Not yet registered?\n\n【8】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In response, we are submitting this joint letter by the presidents of the ATS and the European Respiratory Society (ERS), with the unanimous support of the executive committee of the ATS and the majority consensus of the steering committee of the ERS.\n\n【1】The ATS carefully considered the implications of holding this conference during the current influenza outbreak. WHO has issued a phase 5 pandemic alert, which means that the virus has caused sustained community-level outbreaks in at least two countries in one WHO region. Phase 5 does not relate to the severity or virulence of the outbreak. Our deliberations were, and continue to be, guided by the available scientific data. The data indicate that the severity and virulence of the H1N1 outbreak are similar to that of seasonal flu.\n\n【2】The ATS and ERS consulted with experts within and outside our societies and followed published guidelines on travel by government agencies, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European Center for Disease Control, and WHO. Travel restrictions were not, and are not, recommended by any of these agencies. In fact, according to WHO, “limiting travel and imposing travel restrictions would have very little effect on stopping the virus from spreading…” Furthermore, the ATS believes this conference provided an unprecedented opportunity to educate and update more than 12 000 conference participants from around the world, and we organised a late-breaker session aimed at providing the most up-to-date information on this novel influenza A (H1N1).\n\n【3】While acknowledging that “the personal health risk for conference participants is probably limited”, Nemery and colleagues imply that travel to San Diego presents a greater health risk because of its proximity to Mexico. In fact, CDC has not recommended any restrictions on travel to San Diego, or anywhere in the USA. During the time that the ATS was making its decision to continue with the conference, the virus was already widely distributed throughout the world. For all these reasons, the ATS leadership chose to hold the conference, and most of the ERS leadership chose to attend the conference.\n\n【4】Health-care professionals have a responsibility to care for their patients and to prevent the spread of disease. We do not know of any evidence that respiratory health-care professionals carry increased risk of contracting or spreading influenza. We fully respected individual decisions not to attend the conference, and we encouraged all those who planned to attend to follow the recommendations of CDC and WHO with regard to public gatherings and travelling if sick.\n\n【5】The ATS and ERS are scientific societies that strive to use the best available evidence to guide their decisions and policies, and we will continue to do so.\n\n【6】JRW is currently past-president of the American Thoracic Society and was president when this correspondence was submitted.

They suggested that COVID-19 has drawn attention to the structural violence that is embedded within society, with the pandemic furthering the marginalisation of historically oppressed and excluded groups. Burgess and colleagues drew attention to how people who might have suffered disproportionate economic and health consequences from COVID-19 are now being asked “to trust the same structures” that failed to provide adequate resources and social protection during the pandemic. Failure to address these contextual dimensions can worsen mistrust, damaging vaccine uptake. However, Burgess and colleagues make a distinction between “people wholly opposed to vaccinations (anti-vaxxers) and…vaccine hesitancy”, and imply participatory community engagement as a means to engage only people with vaccine hesitancy.\n\n【1】Lessons from studying cults (which are less pejoratively called new religious movements, describing movements that emerged in the late 20th century) can inform approaches to the anti-vax movement. A cult has come to mean a non-conforming ideology, or a religion that is disliked, with beliefs that are unacceptable to mainstream society. Just as cults are grouped together as sinister, bad, or wrong, the discourse surrounding anti-vaxxers in both academic and popular circles can be dismissive and derogatory. The pejorative label and negative attitudes towards cults promote an us-and-them viewpoint, creating martyrs and extending the length of time that members hold the new beliefs, thus encouraging further involvement in the movement and radicalisation. Learning from these consequences, a more constructive perspective could view the anti-vax movement as a religious phenomenon, involving a whole spectrum of ideas, and focus on the essential need to understand the beliefs that are involved to avoid further marginalisation. Hence, implying that anti-vaxxers are beyond the reach of community engagement activities could result in increased anti-vax activities. We suggest a more inclusive approach, where the same inquisitive dialogue and contextual understanding that was suggested for vaccine hesitancy should be extended to members of the anti-vax movement.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2021 Indranil Mukherjee/Getty Images</u>\n\n【2】删除9:<u>SM declares funding by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Parkes Foundation towards the cost of her doctoral study.

Both analyses found significant cardiovascular event rates only in patients with high concentrations of N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP); adverse events in patients with low concentrations of NT-proBNP were negligible. This result is in accordance with previous findings, which proves that NT-proBNP is currently the best marker for cardiovascular-risk stratification in patients with diabetes.\n\n【1】The EXAMINE investigators found a significant decrease in cardiovascular mortality among patients treated with alogliptin who had NT-proBNP concentrations in the highest quartile. Hospital admissions for heart failure also tended to increase in the group of patients who took alogliptin, although this increase did not reach statistical significance.\n\n【2】Unfortunately, no analysis of cardiovascular mortality with respect to NT-proBNP concentrations was included in the saxogliptin study, but treatment was associated with an increased risk of hospital admission for heart failure for patients who had high NT-proBNP concentrations. The event rate in this subgroup was high enough to generate a signal of harm for the entire population.\n\n【3】Apart from different cutoff points for NT-proBNP (173 pg/mL _vs_ 332 pg/mL), different sample sizes (5380 patients _vs_ 16 492 patients), and differences in the medical history of the populations investigated (shortly after acute coronary syndrome _vs_ chronic history of or at risk of cardiovascular events) between the EXAMINE and SAVOR-TIMI 53 studies, differences in the therapeutic drugs (which is already known for pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) might be responsible for the discrepancies in the results.\n\n【4】Patient-relevant outcome effects have never been proven for this drug class, and safety concerns are therefore of growing interest. In response to reports of increased cardiovascular risk for patients taking glucose-lowering drugs, both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency recommend rigorous tests for excessive cardiovascular risk during treatment with these drugs. EXAMINE and SAVOR-TIMI 53 are the first studies to be based on these recommendations. As the dependence of treatment effects on NT-proBNP is consistent between both studies, one could argue that such testing should be performed on a regular basis as a new standard for such trials. It seems that strict blood-glucose lowering does not decrease cardiovascular risk, but might actually be harmful. This challenges the foundations of diabetology.\n\n【5】Yet the use of NT-proBNP concentrations in a targeted strategy can also be seen as an opportunity. Subpopulations identified by this biomarker benefit from treatment, whereas the same treatment failed in unselected populations. Again, in this respect, a focus on patients with diabetes who have a substantial risk of cardiovascular events is of great importance. At present, we have to accept that diabetes is a very heterogeneous disease with respect to specific risk profiles. Consequently, treatment options have to be tailored to the specific characteristics of the individual patient.\n\n【6】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Hidden Heart is a compelling film about surgeon Christiaan Barnard and technician Naki and the interweaving of their lives in the context of the first successful human heart transplantation.\n\n【3】Their story, set in the backdrop of apartheid South Africa, is one of glamour and injustice. The film explores the lives of these two men through the voices of friends and relatives, who reflect on this historic event and on life during and after apartheid. _Hidden Heart_ lives and breathes not only from these dialogues, but also from the striking colours of South Africa—street scenes in Langa, Cape Town, and the former Transkei.\n\n【4】On Dec 3, 1967, a large surgical, nursing, and technical team, which was led by Barnard, undertook the world's first successful human-to-human heart transplantation, placing Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town on the international map. The unprecedented media coverage of this event transformed Barnard into an international celebrity, while apartheid politicians exploited this moment of medical history to publicise the then isolated apartheid state.\n\n【5】At the time, there was little mention of those who had helped Barnard achieve this milestone. Naki was a black gardener who went on to work in the animal laboratory at the University of Cape Town and he assisted Barnard in the research effort that preceded the first human heart transplantation. Naki, who came from rural Transkei, had no access to higher education under apartheid. Yet he developed excellent technical skills and in _Hidden Heart_ Barnard is shown to have valued Naki's intraoperative role alongside his expertise at running the animal laboratory and in training a generation of future surgeons. According to interviews with Naki and Barnard in _Hidden Heart_ , Naki was present in theatre during heart and liver transplantations, which was illegal at that time because he was black—a claim that has been disputed by others.\n\n【6】In the post-apartheid era, however, newspapers began to report that Naki was as responsible for the success of the sensational operation as Barnard. In 2003, Naki received his honorary Master of Medicine degree from the University of Cape Town, probably many years too late. After Naki's death in 2005, many obituaries erroneously attributed a leading surgical role to him in the pioneering transplantation. _Hidden Heart_ illuminates the contributions of Barnard and Naki while exploring issues of racism and injustice.\n\n【7】Lack of recognition for the contribution of team members in this story has some parallels with the development of the so-called Blalock-Taussig procedure that provides palliation to patients with cyanotic heart defects. Surgeon Alfred Blalock and cardiologist Helen Taussig, from Baltimore, USA, developed the procedure in the 1940s together with Blalock's African American laboratory technician Vivien Thomas. Thomas had a key role in the development of the procedure—he did the anastomosis alone in about 200 laboratory dogs and adapted the instruments for the first human surgery. However, because of the racial prejudices in the USA at the time and the academic custom that generally precludes mention of non-degree laboratory assistants that persists even today, Thomas like Naki did not receive recognition for his contributions until much later.\n\n【8】_Hidden Heart_ certainly made me reflect on how different things are today in South Africa. I have worked in the country since 1992, rotating through internal medicine and surgery and subsequently training as a cardiologist in a resource-poor public hospital with patients from disadvantaged backgrounds. During this time, I have seen profound socioeconomic changes. Black South Africans have much better access to higher education and university training. Each year, I see an increasing number of black African students attending our medical school. However, the chances of becoming a physician or surgeon are still slim if a child comes from a truly disadvantaged background, especially in rural areas.\n\n【9】The film also made me wonder how likely a research breakthrough of the sort that Barnard achieved with his exceptional team, which constituted a good infrastructure by international standards at that time, would be in contemporary South Africa. Here I feel somewhat more pessimistic. During the past 20 years, the main focus in South Africa's medical schools and universities has been placed almost exclusively on clinical training with an overemphasis on repeating facts. My sense is that there seems to be a shortage of innovative research leaders and the necessary infrastructure, such as laboratories and postdoctoral posts. However, these shortcomings have to some extent been recognised and an increasing effort is being made by institutions such as the National and Medical Research Foundations to correct these problems. I hope such efforts succeed; South Africa has many inquisitive, open-minded medical students who can become the country's future research leaders if they are given sufficient support and encouragement.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 05 September 2009\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61579-8</u>\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a few issues must be addressed.\n\n【1】Exclusion of pupils with a history of suicide attempt(s) omits a particularly vulnerable group because past suicide attempts have been shown to be the strongest predictors of future attempts. Efficacy of intervention could be tested in this group, and it is not clear if any specific help was offered to the pupils who had previously attempted suicide. It is not clear why only pupils aged 14–16 years were studied, especially as adolescents (13–19 years old) have greater risk of suicide, and such restrictive inclusion could limit the generalisability of the study.\n\n【2】Furthermore, no mention is made of pupils (if any) found to have substantial psychopathology, or taking psychotropic medications, during the study. No comment was made on substance use, which is another risk factor associated with adolescent suicide and could have been included as a covariate during analysis.\n\n【3】Finally, more than half the potential study population (14 267 of 27 099 pupils, or their parents) declined to participate in the study, a major issue in school-based studies.

Roughly, this term means that individuals or organisations who could reap financial rewards from research into human genetics have some obligation to share the benefits of this research, perhaps with the people who made the research possible in the first place, or with humankind more broadly. This idea has met with some acceptance, finding its way into policy recommendations and statements of several prominent groups. However, the issue of benefit-sharing is generally raised in the context of large-scale population-based genetic studies. Other sources of human DNA are often ignored. In particular, little attention has been paid to the increasingly common practice of collecting genetic samples as addons to clinical drug trials. Generally such trials do not specify a use for these samples, which are collected for purposes of potential future research. We argue that if a case for benefit-sharing can be made for genetic studies in general, it can be made for add-on studies as well. We suggest some ways in which benefit-sharing might be implemented for genetic add-on studies.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

We did a study in the community using standardised instruments to investigate the relation between squalor and mental and physical disorders.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did a cross-sectional study of the clients of a local-authority special cleaning service. Levels of domestic squalor and self neglect were measured with the living conditions rating scale, and diagnoses of mental disorder were made by use of WHO's schedules for clinical assessment in neuropsychiatry (SCAN).\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】91 individuals were eligible for inclusion; 81 from 76 households consented and were interviewed (a response rate of 89%). 41 (51%) were younger than 65 years of age. 57 individuals (70%) were diagnosed as having a mental disorder at interview, as defined by the SCAN, and 21 participants (26%) had a physical health problem which contributed significantly to the unclean state of their living environment. Those with a contributory physical disorder had a lower severity of domestic squalor. People older than 65 years were less likely to have a mental disorder than those younger than 65 years, but a contributory physical disorder was not associated with the presence of active mental disorder. Only 30 (53%) of the 57 individuals with active mental disorder had had any contact with mental-health services in the previous year.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】People who live in squalor and who receive special cleaning services have high rates of mental disorder, and squalor affects younger as well as older people. Living in squalid conditions in the group was generally associated with a mental or physical disorder, and there were possible deficits in the health care received. The extent to which these disorders might respond to more assertive treatment from health services requires further study, but questions are raised about the adequacy of their current health care.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【9】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【10】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【11】One-time access price info\n\n【12】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【13】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【14】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【15】### Subscribe:\n\n【16】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【17】Already a print subscriber?

On March 9, the 64th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women was set to adopt a political declaration reaffirming commitments made in the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action . That landmark document, the outcome of the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.\n\n【1】The Platform for Action set out comprehensive strategic objectives around 12 areas of concern, including health, and was groundbreaking in its recognition that “\\[w\\]omen's health involves their emotional, social and physical well-being and is determined by the social, political and economic context of their lives, as well as by biology”. In an Article in this month's issue, Emma Slaymaker and colleagues explore the changing landscape of women's sexual and reproductive health within a social context using data from nationally representative surveys. They find that, in just over half of the 64 countries studied, the proportion of sexually active women of reproductive age who do not currently want to become pregnant and who are not using a contraceptive decreased between 1995 and 2018. Ecological analysis suggested that these findings were correlated with increases in gender equality and women's time in education, but also with social issues such as higher ages at first sexual intercourse and higher prevalence of multiple partnerships among women. However, the findings varied widely by country and the authors point to the need for contextualised, country-specific policy responses when addressing targets such as Sustainable Development Goal 3.7.\n\n【2】The UN Commission's draft political declaration expresses concern that no country has yet fully achieved equality and empowerment for women and girls, that progress in some areas has stalled or even reversed, and that “women and girls who experience multiple forms of discrimination have made the least progress”. Indeed, the world continues to witness shocking cases of denial of the rights of women. In February this year, media accounts picked up on a report from South Africa's Commission for Gender Equality of an investigation into the coerced sterilisation of 48 pregnant black women, most of whom were living with HIV. The women were reportedly sterilised during the course of a caesarean section. Their consent forms had been signed under conditions that did not allow for considered understanding (eg, extreme labour pain) or that were threatening (eg, denial of care if refused). Additionally, some of the women reported discriminatory remarks from health-care staff about their HIV status.\n\n【3】Discriminatory and biased social norms remain pervasive throughout most aspects of women's lives, according to a new analysis of the UNDP's Gender Social Norms Index released on March 5. Generated from responses to the World Values Survey, the index reveals that around 90% of both men and women across the 77 countries surveyed exhibit at least one bias around gender equality—eg, whether men make better political leaders or business executives, whether university is more important for men than women, and whether it is justifiable for a man to beat his wife or for a woman to have an abortion. In 15 of 31 countries with time trend data, bias actually increased, particularly among women themselves. Again, one-size-fits-all policies are unlikely to shift long-standing norms particular to different social contexts and cultures. Tailored educational programmes and incentives such as those that enable paternity leave and encourage women to enter male-dominated professions have shown promise and should be seriously considered by governments worldwide.\n\n【4】Finally, closer to home, March 5 also saw the release of Elsevier's 2020 gender report , _The Researcher Journey Through a Gender Lens_ . In the high-income and middle-income countries studied, all 15 had made some progress towards gender parity in research authorship between 1999–2003 and 2014–18, but Argentina was the only one to actually reach it. The fields of surgery, cardiology, and pulmonology were the most male-dominated, and those of fertility, birth, and paediatrics were most heavily female-dominated. Japan had the lowest ratio of women to men in all areas of medicine.\n\n【5】It is clear that—more than 100 years after International Women's Day was first observed in 1911—we are far from a gender-equal world and that, given some worrying turns in the wrong direction, new threats require vigilance and context-specific action.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: March 09, 2020\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(20)30084-X</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2020 The Author(s).

{"seq_id": "63654e93-63cd-45f2-bdb1-8bc1e1db716b", "title": "The hunt for red, December", "text": "【0】The hunt for red, December\nWorld AIDS Day rolled around again on December 1, with WHO adopting the theme of _Everybody Counts_ for the occasion in 2017. WHO also ran a campaign under the banner of the _Right to Health_ , which emphasised the need for all 36·7 million people living with HIV and all those who are vulnerable or otherwise affected by the disease to receive the care they need, thus linking World AIDS Day with the sustainable development goal of universal health coverage. This theme was also recognised in the UNAIDS _My Health, My Right_ campaign. These messages clearly sought to highlight the political and social imperative of access to health for people living with HIV—all people living with HIV. As concerns grow about international funding for and commitment to the global fight against HIV/AIDS, World AIDS Day is as important as ever to raise awareness among policy makers and to keep the issue on the global agenda and in the minds of all people—in this case, should we be concerned about the slow decline in visibility of the red ribbon?\n\n【1】The annual accounting that takes place around World AIDS Day was once again a chance to reflect on global numbers and achievements and to assess the task ahead in the fight against HIV. With an estimated 1·8 million new infections and 1 million HIV/AIDS related deaths in 2016, the disease continues to exact a severe burden toll. The good news is that, once again, around 2 million people were started on antiretroviral treatment, bringing the number receiving lifesaving drugs up to 21 million worldwide—53% of people living with HIV are estimated to be on treatment.\n\n【2】However, the campaigns highlighting the right to health suggest that while many more people are accessing antiretroviral therapy than ever before, those who are not accessing treatment are likely to be hardest to reach. If the difficulties in reaching these people are not addressed, the annual accrual of 2 million on treatment will tail off. This challenge is also a message brought out by the UNAIDS _Blind Spot_ report , which draws attention to the disparities between men and women. More women than men are living with HIV worldwide, but just 47% of men with HIV are estimated to be on treatment, compared with 60% of women. The differences between the sexes are starkest where access to HIV services are most restricted. In west Africa and central Asia almost twice as many women as men are on treatment and virologically suppressed: whereas both the regions have a mountain to climb to address the HIV epidemics, the situation for men is especially dire.\n\n【3】The hardest to reach populations differ around the world and the barriers that prevent people accessing health care vary too. But whether drug users, gay and bisexual men, sex workers, prisoners, or other populations are falling through the cracks in the fight against HIV, political commitment and structural change are needed to break down the barriers that prevent their access to care and to provide universal coverage for people living with or at risk of HIV. Furthermore, when these barriers are broken down, those who have been hindered by them need encouragement and help to take advantage of new opportunities. And so we come back to awareness.\n\n【4】The red ribbon of AIDS awareness was devised and launched in 1991 by the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus, and it became a powerful force for raising awareness among the public about AIDS, for showing solidarity with people living with HIV and AIDS, and of remembrance for people who lost their lives. At the peak a few years ago, the red ribbon was widely worn by the general public on World AIDS Days. However, in 2017, while still sported by politicians, people who work in HIV/AIDS, and those who have been affected by the disease, the ribbon seems to be disappearing from general use and availability: in London certainly, gone are the days when people would sell ribbons to raise money for AIDS charities at busy transport hubs or when ribbons could be purchased at shop counters, and the result of this is that the splashes of red were near absent on the commuter trains, subways, and busy city streets on December 1.\n\n【5】New tricks are available to show solidarity: a comment on social media or a bright frame for an online profile picture. All well and good, but these reach only friends and followers. The physical red ribbon is a tangible signal that not only shows support for people living with and working to end HIV/AIDS, but also is visible to friends, colleagues, and strangers you pass in the street. A reminder to all that HIV/AIDS has not gone away, and public engagement will be needed in the next phase of the fight—everybody really does count.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: January 2018\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-3018(17)30215-1</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The case highlights the need for urgent attention to WHO's core functions such as those supporting the safety of medicines. We describe what occurred and its relation to the WHO reforms.\n\n【1】Between December, 2011, and January, 2012, physicians at the Punjabi Institute of Cardiology in Lahore—a public facility serving mainly poor patients for free—reported unexpected deaths that the physicians linked to five locally manufactured heart drugs. Testing showed the cause to be isosorbide capsules filled in error with the antimalarial pyrimethamine. In addition to deaths from aplastic anaemia, an estimated 400 people had severe adverse reactions. 46 000 patients are thought to have been exposed to the faulty product, with consequences that could still emerge. This case was caused by a breakdown of good manufacturing practices—ie, a failure of national drug regulation. Although pharmaceutical production is Pakistan's fourth largest industry, there is no federal drug regulatory authority.\n\n【2】The Essential Medicines Department of WHO has a key role in supporting national regulatory authorities via policy and norms setting and direct support. Support includes review and redesign of policies, laws, structures, and systems. Only WHO has the global remit and constitutional mandate to undertake these tasks, which must fit the very different circumstances and conditions of its 194 member states. WHO has recently embarked on a massive reform process, essential to which is to agree criteria for priority setting. We argue that protection of the core functions of WHO, including the Essential Medicines Department, must be the top priority for the reform, and that these functions should be financed reliably from WHO's core budget, as they used to be.\n\n【3】In accordance with its constitution and global mandate, core functions of WHO include those that must be in place to ensure the integrity and functioning of health services. Since many member states spend 30% of their health budgets on medicines, and because faulty or badly used health goods injure patients, Oxfam used the example of the Essential Medicines Department as an important case study. We have pointed out that only 10% of the costs of the Expert Committee on Specifications for Pharmaceutical Preparations, which underpins all quality assurance guidance for the development, production, quality control, regulation, inspection, and distribution of medical products, are paid from the regular budget. The department's core functions are surviving by using levies taken from project funds supplied voluntarily by donors.\n\n【4】Once more, Oxfam calls for WHO's most urgent work to be secured before it is further eroded. The former President of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, coined the phrase “to plan is to choose”. Now is the time for Member States and WHO to choose, attending first to what Margaret Chan called the organisation's “core of core” functions.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2012 AFP/Getty Images</u>\n\n【5】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Scientists hope that knowledge of the genetic code will improve understanding of disease causes, provide options for genetic medical intervention, and cure disease. This enthusiastic line of thinking has been criticised as overoptimistic about the quantitative causal contribution of hereditary factors of the susceptibility to disease and as reductionist about social levels of disease cause. A more subtle conceptual point deserves attention. I purport that the human genome project is associated with a qualitative change in causality and, therefore, demands a shift in causal thinking.\n\n【2】Modern notions, dating back to Isaac Newton, reduce causality to a functional relation and are characterised by the ideas of causal chains, causal complexes, and deterministic or probabalistic associations of events. Aristotelian metaphysics offers a different understanding of causes, and could contribute to the understanding of the causal role of genes.\n\n【3】Functional causal relations relate to Aristotle's system of effective cause. This type of cause is regarded as an external cause, as is the so-called final cause, or the intention behind an action. An example for external cause is genitourinary infection with human papillomavirus, which may cause cervical cancer. The virus' strive for procreation could be interpreted as final cause. Aristotle supplemented these external causes with two internal causes—the formal cause, which is the blueprint that becomes manifest in a given substance, and the material cause. For human papillomavirus infection, therefore, the formal cause is the malignant transformation of cervical tissue, and the material cause is the affected cervical tissue itself. The two external and two internal causes are important for disease; the virus (effective cause), its drive to procreate (final cause), the cervix uteri (material cause), and its potential for malignant-cell transformation (formal cause).\n\n【4】Current understanding of disease cause is linked closely with external causation, especially the effective cause. The human genome project will shift causal research to internal causes: to the structure of tissue and cells (the material cause) and to the programmes of reaction in response to stimuli (the formal cause of events). Medical interventions derived from gene sequencing might, therefore, be directed towards structural vulnerability (eg, membrane proteins), or messengers of pathophysiological reactions. These powerful options have ethical consequences since the manipulation of internal causes affects personal rights more than an intervention directed against external causes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

I heartily agree that there is no one bullet for HIV prevention and no one driver. Moreover, clearly each of the ten “myths” has at least some truth. But from my programme vantage, I have seen them lead to important misdirections. I fully agree with Thomas Ellman's approach to prevention efforts. However, I would add “strategic and prioritised”.\n\n【1】Although the field is beginning to acknowledge the importance of concurrent partnerships, we lack that strategic balance. For example, the latest UNAIDS annual report does not even mention concurrent partners or partner reduction, and the 2007 report of the Global Health Prevention Working Group barely notes it.\n\n【2】Indeed, the entire framing of the present global HIV effort towards universal access rather misses the point, since behaviour change is not a matter of “access” but outreach via mass media and interpersonal communication. Meanwhile few people in these generalised epidemics have even a simple knowledge about the risks of concurrent partners.\n\n【3】Chris Simms seemingly asserts that prevention is succeeding now that overall HIV funding has substantially increased, citing decreasing prevalence and increasing funding. I wish public-health efforts could claim such credit, but the evidence refutes it. In the first place, to assess prevention requires looking at incidence (new infections) not prevalence, which lags behind. Actually, we described in _The Lancet_ almost 2 years ago (recently confirmed by UNAIDS) peaking incidence in Africa in the late 1990s. Especially when considering the sharp early peaks in individual countries and the lag time for the effect of appropriated money on programmes, the notion that turbocharged HIV funding, beginning early in the next decade, caused that decline is completely untenable. Rather, these early national peaks mainly reflect the natural history of these epidemics as the pool of “most susceptible” declines, as the rapid initial chain-reaction of new infections partly subsides, and as some people largely spontaneously adopt safer sexual practice. I believe public-health interventions have helped, but unfortunately new infections continue at an egregious level.\n\n【4】I agree with Simms that additional resources earlier on might have helped prevention efforts. However, the major prevention strategy emerging in the 1980s—the most-at-risk strategy—has been highly successful in helping contain concentrated epidemics with more modest funding. Our limited effect on generalised epidemics has more resulted from lack of an understanding, conceptual approach, and prioritised execution. Armed with new insights and resources, we must now unite, mobilise, and prevail.\n\n【5】删除9:<u>My views are not necessarily those of USAID.

A key challenge for public health is measurement of the health of marginalised groups to make their needs visible and focus prevention and treatment activities. Internationally, there has been much research into the health inequalities slope, whereby almost all important health problems gradually rise in frequency with increasing social deprivation. Geographical measures of deprivation based on people's postcodes are often used to assess the effect of inequalities on health (eg, dividing the population into deprivation quintiles on the basis of indices of multiple deprivation \\[IMD-5\\]). However, this notion of inequality does not adequately capture the experience of many marginalised groups who have more extreme deprivation. Furthermore, marginalised groups are often deemed too difficult to engage to allow collection of meaningful health data. In this study, we aim to compare the prevalence of chronic disease across population quintiles of social deprivation (housed population) and in homeless people; and develop a generalisable methodology for health surveys in marginalised groups by use of peer interviewers to achieve engagement and high uptake.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We undertook a cross-sectional health survey of homeless people attending 27 low-threshold services in London (eg, hostels, day centres, soup runs). Questions asked were directly comparable with key questions within the national Health Survey for England (HSE) and health-related quality of life (EQ-5D), allowing direct comparison across quintiles of deprivation in the housed population and in homeless people. Peers with personal experience of homelessness were used to engage participants and undertake the surveys to achieve high uptake and provide as representative a sample as possible. Data were merged with HSE 2010 data on a representative housed population. We calculated age-adjusted and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of chronic disease, multiple morbidities, and quality of life scores as measured by the EQ-5D to compare homeless participants with housed people living in areas in the poorest quintile of the IMD-5.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】455 (77%) of 592 people responded. Reasons for non-response were not obtained, but this is a high response rate for a population survey. Most respondents were men (365 of 455 \\[80%\\]) and most were aged 16–44 years (261 of 455 \\[57%\\]) and were born in the UK (277 of 455 \\[61%\\]). Nearly three-quarters were registered with a local general practice (329 of 455 \\[72%\\]). Missing data was less than 1% across all variables. There was a gradual increase in risk of chronic disease across the quintiles of multiple deprivation in HSE. However, compared with housed people living in the most socially deprived areas, homeless people had higher risks of asthma, heart disease, stroke, and epilepsy. The adjusted OR for asthma was 2·46 (95% CI 1·78–3·39; p<0·0001), for heart disease was 5·87 (3·63–9·49; p<0·0001); for stroke was 4·93 (2·15–11·28; p<0·0001), and for epilepsy was 12·40 (5·10–30·16; p<0·0001). Conversely, the likelihood of diagnosed diabetes was lower in the homeless than in those living in deprived areas (adjusted OR 0·59, 95% CI 0·35–0·99; p=0·046). The adjusted OR for having two or more of these disorders was 5·12 (3·06–8·57; p<0·0001). Quality of life measures showed similar disparities.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Our data show that in comparison with the slope in health inequalities, the health experience of the homeless is more akin to a cliff, with homeless people experiencing a significantly disproportionate burden of morbidity. This method could act as a template for surveys in other marginalised groups.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】This study was possible as a result of funding from Knowledge Into Action 删除2:<u>(Registered Charity No. 1123566)</u>, with data management and analytical support provided through a National Institute for Health Research Programme Grant For Applied Research (PGfAR RP-PG-0407-10340).

In England, the Mental Health of Children and Young People (MHCYP) Survey series and the Children and Young People with an Eating Disorder (CYP ED) Waiting Times data provide clear evidence that referrals to specialist services for the assessment and treatment of eating disorders increased substantially following pandemic onset in 2020.\n\n【1】In _The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health_ , Alex M Trafford and colleagues provide further convincing and worrying evidence of substantial increases in the incidence of eating disorders and self-harm among adolescent girls (aged 10–24 years) presenting to primary care in the UK from March, 2020, to March, 2022, compared with predicted (expected) incidence based on antecedent trends in the previous decade. The incidence of eating disorder during the pandemic was 42·4% (95% CI 25·7–61·3) higher than expected for girls aged 13–16 years, and 32·0% (13·3–53·8) higher than expected for girls aged 17–19 years. Similarly, an increase in self-harm incidence overall was driven by girls aged 13–16 years, with the number of first episodes being 38·4% (20·7–58·5) higher than expected.\n\n【2】Trafford and colleagues also reveal an interesting association between the occurrence of eating disorders and self-harm and neighbourhood deprivation. General practices serving the most affluent areas recorded the largest increase in young women and girls with eating disorders (52·4% \\[95% CI 27·7–81·7\\] higher than expected in quintile 1 _vs_ 22·2% \\[4·1–43·3\\] in quintile 5) and self-harm (30·7% \\[14·1–49·7\\] higher than expected in quintile 1 _vs_ 10·5% \\[–0·2 to 22·3\\] in quintile 5). Thus, the pandemic accentuated the eating disorders differential between areas of high and low deprivation, but because prepandemic self-harm was more common in the most deprived areas, the pandemic reduced the differential for self-harm. All findings were most pronounced for girls aged 13–16 years, while there were no discernible differences among girls aged 10–12 years or young women aged 20–24 years. Among adolescent boys (aged 10–24 years), the observed incidences of eating disorders and self-harm were overall lower than the expected incidence in the 2 years since pandemic onset, which appeared largely attributable to sharp decreases in monthly incidence rates in the first months of the pandemic. Incidence rates in later months were closer to expected rates.\n\n【3】Although Trafford and colleagues reported lower than expected incidence of eating disorders in boys, a follow-up analysis of the 2017 Mental Health of Children and Young People (MHCYP) Survey suggested that in 2021, boys also had a substantial increase in eating difficulties, and possibly more discernible increases in eating disorders, than girls. Similarly, in 2021 and 2022, the annual MHCYP surveys suggested that in both boys and girls, the 17–19-year age group has more difficulties than younger age groups, including eating disorders and self-harm. The greatest difficulties were also noted in young people living in families facing food, housing, or financial insecurity.\n\n【4】These conflicting findings almost certainly reflect methodological differences; MHCYP surveys are population-based and sample approximately 3500 young people from England, which draw on questionnaire data from parents and young people and are therefore not affected by help-seeking. Additionally, the measure of socioeconomic adversity reflects individual financial, housing, or food insecurity in the MHCYP surveys, compared with the recording of neighbourhood deprivation by Trafford and colleagues. Trafford and colleagues analysed data from 1881 general practices across all four nations of the UK, which provides a large sample size with lower selection bias and higher generalisability than the MHCYP surveys. However, some groups, particularly individuals in their late teens who relocate more frequently than other age groups, are less likely to be registered with primary care. Therefore, in the study by Trafford and colleagues, diagnoses of eating disorders and self-harm relied on the accuracy of recorded clinical data rather than a tightly controlled research protocol.\n\n【5】The findings reported by Trafford and colleagues suggest that boys and young men were consistently less likely than girls and young women to present with self-harm and eating disorders, both before and during the pandemic. Future research should consider how much of the gender difference in reported incidence in these conditions reflects gender differences in how underlying distress is experienced and displayed, as opposed to differences in help-seeking, identification, or access to treatment. For example, in the Millennium Birth Cohort, based on data collected from ages 7–14 years, girls with the same levels of hyperactivity and inattention as boys were less likely to be seen by services, to be diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder if seen, or be prescribed medication if diagnosed, but girls were also less likely to report high levels of these difficulties. Furthermore, Lutz and colleagues reported that increased frequency of non-suicidal self-injury among women (aged 18–33 years) were partly explained by higher levels of psychological distress, when compared with men of the same age, but they detected no gender differences in how men and women responded to distress.\n\n【6】Collectively, the evidence raises the question of when, and how, are we going to respond? The authors list potential adverse outcomes of eating disorders and self-harm, which include mortality, and stress the need for early identification and access to treatment. I would add that all individuals who work with children, young people, and families should be alert to both eating disorders and self-harm in their clientele, as young people frequently conceal both these difficulties and might need prompting and persuasion to seek help. Although children and young people's services might currently bear the burden of the increased incidence, these data are a warning signal for adult mental health services, as both eating disorders and self-harm frequently persist and co-occur with other mental health conditions among a substantial proportion of those affected. The need for timely access to effective treatment cannot be overstated, and requires concerted action by policy makers, health-care providers, and practitioners to reduce the numbers of young people who face long waits for treatment. Poor functioning in early adolescence has a heavy developmental price, and potentially alters future health, educational, and social trajectories.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2023 SDI Productions</u>\n\n【7】删除9:<u>I declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Although there is no effective algorithm to predict suicide in clinical practice, improved recognition and understanding of clinical, psychological, sociological, and biological factors might help the detection of high-risk individuals and assist in treatment selection.

But one fact is certain. Whatever countries do to show they are taking NCDs more seriously, cancer treatment will be missing from their commitments. Cancer's undeserved neglect makes it the Cinderella of the emerging NCD movement. As health diplomats celebrate their political success, millions of people living with cancer will be consigned to early and painful deaths. Nothing illustrates the embedded irrationality of global health more than our attitudes to cancer. In 2016, according to the Global Burden of Disease, 8·9 million people died from cancer (23% of total worldwide deaths from NCDs, and 16% of deaths from all causes). The leading causes of cancer death are tumours of the trachea, bronchus, and lung (1·7 million deaths); gynaecological cancers (breast, cervix, ovary, and uterus: 1 million deaths); gastric cancer (834 000 deaths); colorectal cancer (829 600 deaths); and liver cancer (828 000 deaths). So why the indifference?\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2018 Lynsey Addario/Getty Images</u>\n\n【1】The NCD community has become trapped in an ideology that privileges prevention over treatment. A similar mistake disfigured the early response to AIDS. I can recall senior WHO leaders two decades ago agreeing that a generation of people living with HIV would have to die before the pandemic could be controlled by prevention. Only anger and activism overturned the complacency of traditional public health practice. But the NCD community has no time for anger or activism. It prefers repeating and re-emphasising the old nostrums. We can all agree that tobacco control and vaccination against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus are indispensable interventions to curb cancer. But what about the treatment of breast cancer? Or surgery for resectable tumours? Or specialist services for cervical cancer? Or chemotherapy and radiotherapy facilities? Or treatment for childhood cancers? Or palliative care services? Silence.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2018 Joe Sohm/Visions of America/Getty Images</u>\n\n【2】Two arguments will be mounted against the charge that global health has forgotten cancer treatment. First, if global health is about remedying inequity, and if those remedies are mainly concerned with resource-poor communities, then cancer treatment cannot be a priority. If, for example, one examines the top 20 causes of age-standardised disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in sub-Saharan Africa, you will see that cancer is absent. The global health community is therefore surely right to focus on AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other infectious diseases. It should definitely accommodate ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, major depression, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. But cancer? No. A second argument is that even if we concede that cancer should be taken more seriously, the treatment gap will best be filled by focusing not on specific diseases but on strengthening health systems and achieving universal health coverage (UHC). Both claims are flawed. Take gynaecological cancers. The majority of women who die from breast and cervical cancer live in low-income and middle-income settings. Cancer should be a major health priority in the poorest countries. That is true today. It is even more true if one looks only a short distance into the future. As _The Lancet_ 's 2016 Series on Health, Equity, and Women's Cancers described, 1·7 million women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually. By 2030, the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer is projected to rise to 3·2 million. It is entirely wrong to suggest that cancer should only be a concern for richer nations. As to UHC filling the gap in cancer care, one mistake made by UHC advocates is that repeating the mantra of universal coverage is empty rhetoric without specifying the services that UHC should include. Too often, cancer treatment is absent from the debate about UHC. Some progress is being made. In its 2017 updated “Appendix 3”—a WHO-branded list of approved policy options to prevent and control NCDs—the agency does include treatment services for early cervical, breast, and colorectal cancers, together with palliative care, although none receive the coveted “bolding”. The Disease Control Priorities Project does not let countries off the hook so easily and goes further, including services to treat selected childhood cancers.

Non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, are easy to diagnose and low cost, effective treatments are available; primary prevention of non-communicable diseases does not require medical interventions. By contrast, cancer treatment requires adequate diagnostic, pathology, and imaging services and surgical, medical, and radiation oncology capability which are often only available in a rudimentary form (sometimes not at all) in LLMICs, particularly in rural areas where most people live.\n\n【18】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n*   Global health and cancer\n    *   Richard Horton 1 vividly points out the current and growing deficiency in global cancer care, and the relative inattention this problem receives compared with infectious diseases. Repeated arguments against treatment include those he presented, with emphasis on prevention as the only current serious investment. Although meritorious, this approach is wholly inadequate. Imagine the outcry if that strategy were pursued in the developed world. What care is there for the millions of patients for whom prevention fails? Even though the common strategy of repeating surveys contributes additional data essential for an effective response, the process often makes the problem feel even more hopeless.\n\n【19】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n*   Global health and cancer\n    *   We welcome attention to the issues raised by Richard Horton 1 and agree that there has been greater emphasis on non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and much less attention to their management, particularly in the case of cancer.

The multivariate analysis with clinical variables of sex, histology, smoking history, presence of deletions in exon 19, and presence of the L858R mutation in exon 21 of _EGFR_ showed the following to be contributing factors to the increase in overall survival: smoking history (hazard ratio for death 0·523, 95% CI 0·306–0·893, p=0·018; median survival 7·4 months for smokers and 24·3 months for never-smokers) and the presence of the L858R mutation (hazard ratio for death 0·534, 95% CI 0·298–0·956, p=0·035; median survival 9·3 months for patients without L858R mutation and 22·0 months for patients with the mutation).\n\n【2】Furthermore, we found an association between smoking history and the presence of the L858R mutation by Spearman's rank correlation test. Significantly fewer smokers than non-smokers had L858R mutations (p=0·01). There was no significant association between smoking history and the presence of deletions in exon 19 (p=0·208).

For instance, the development of direct-acting antiviral treatments for hepatitis C virus raises the prospect of eliminating such infections—cost and access notwithstanding. And exciting progress is being made in harnessing the immune system to tackle previously hard-to-treat gastrointestinal cancers. But other challenges remain, or are arising. For example, as a result of increases in obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is predicted to replace infection as the leading cause of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplant in the USA in the next 10–20 years; similar transitions are likely to take place elsewhere if global trends in obesity continue. Westernisation of lifestyles across the world is also a major driver of the growing global incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases.\n\n【1】It is against this backdrop that we launch _The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology_ . As with other members of the _Lancet_ group of journals, _The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology_ offers fast-track publication in which papers can be published online within 4–8 weeks from submission. We invite original research papers that reflect the rich variety of ongoing research in gastroenterology and hepatology, particularly in the areas of inflammatory bowel diseases; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and NASH; functional gastrointestinal disorders; gastrointestinal, hepatic, pancreatic, and biliary cancers; and viral hepatitis.

Duerden states that addition of some other antianginal agent would have had the same effect. As far as we know, there is no evidence to support this claim. The PRODIGY group contends that inclusion of unplanned admissions for cardiac chest pain and unstable angina exaggerate the significance of the resultant composite endpoints.\n\n【2】We were seeking to investigate whether nicorandil would improve the overall clinical outcome in patients with stable angina. In doing so, we chose endpoints that we considered achievable and relevant to stable angina. Since clinical outcome is multidimensional, we chose several common clinical events to be the components of our endpoints. For CHD death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina, definite angina, presumed angina, and stroke or admission for transient ischaemic attack, there were fewer events in the nicorandil group. Thus the trend for each of these cardiovascular endpoints is uniformly towards benefit from treatment with nicorandil.\n\n【3】We included unplanned admissions for cardiac chest pain within endpoints that also comprise CHD death and non-fatal myocardial infarction for several reasons. First, unplanned admission for chest pain was no trivial event. These patients were admitted because they were suspected of having developed an acute coronary syndrome, which is itself a composite diagnosis that includes unstable angina and both Q-wave and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction. The trial showed that these events were reduced by nicorandil, and this finding was the basis for our conclusion that the course of the underlying coronary disease was changed for the better by nicorandil.\n\n【4】Second, the endpoint of unplanned admission for chest pain was intended to capture all patients with undoubted ischaemic chest pain of a severity sufficient to be admitted. Our prespecified division of this cohort into “unstable”, “definite”, or “presumed” angina could be regarded as somewhat arbitrary. Nevertheless, these judgments were made by an independent committee which was unaware of the assignment of the study drug.\n\n【5】Third, unplanned admissions for cardiac chest pain were by far the most common of the components of the primary endpoint, and, since they represent one end of a continuous spectrum of acute coronary disease, it is logical to include them in an endpoint designed to show the effect of an anti-ischaemic agent on ischaemic events.\n\n【6】The PRODIGY group comment on the numbers needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one event in IONA. However, these results were achieved after an average follow-up of only 1·6 years and despite a fairly high withdrawal rate. Most trials of patients with CHD (eg, the statin trials) report NNTs for studies of 5 years or longer. The results of these studies would look much less favourable if reported at 1·6 years.\n\n【7】We agree with the PRODIGY group that the results cannot necessarily be generalised to all patients with stable angina. At the very least, however, in a large clinical trial, nicorandil has been shown to be safe. And, in the clinical setting, proven effects on outcome of whatever magnitude deserve consideration.\n\n【8】Finally, Duerden is correct in pointing out, as we did, that the IONA trial provides no evidence about the potential mechanisms responsible for nicorandil's beneficial effects. We merely sought to explain the results with regard to the known basic and clinical pharmacology of nicorandil. Although there is no proof that nicorandil was acting as a pharmacological mimetic of preconditioning in IONA, this property is far from being a nebulous one, since it has been shown in preclinical models of ischaemia. Were the heart to have been so protected in IONA, consequent amelioration of ischaemic events could be reflected in fewer clinical manifestations of ischaemia, and ultimately, fewer emergency admissions for chest pain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The original Helsingborg Declaration, published in 1995, aimed to improve stroke management in all European member states by 2005. Sadly, many of the aims were frustratingly vague and no attention was given to vital primary prevention strategies. Despite this, the guidelines were welcomed by the stroke community as a step in the right direction, and the management of acute stroke in Europe has improved over the past 10 years—partly due to increased numbers of specialist stroke units.\n\n【1】As a result, the publication of the second Helsingborg Declaration has been eagerly awaited. The second consensus conference in March of this year met to determine the primary goals for 2015, covering five main areas of stroke management: organisation of stroke services, management of acute stroke, prevention, rehabilitation, and evaluation of stroke outcome and quality assessment. The new guidelines do have some benefits over the 1995 declaration; they are certainly more detailed, giving specific targets such as calling for further development of recombinant factor VII for the treatment of acute haemorrhagic stroke. They also include updated drug treatment information and targets for primary prevention strategies. Yet despite these improvements, many of the 2015 targets are worryingly similar to those previously set to be achieved by 2005.\n\n【2】Evidently, it would be easy to bemoan the publication of yet more guidelines with vague and lofty targets set for some unthinkable time in the future, but our responsibilities surely run deeper than that. Without first directing additional resources towards stroke research, so that more can be learnt about what interventions would genuinely improve clinical outcomes, how can we expect anyone to foster realistic guidelines or, more importantly, to improve patient care? The most useful part of this second Helsingborg Declaration is the detailed research and development priorities. This is where the stroke community and the funding bodies should aim their efforts over the coming 9 years. Perhaps, then, the third draft will be more useful.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【3】### Publication history\n\n【4】Published: 16 December 2006\n\n【5】### Identification\n\n【6】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69840-1</u>\n\n【7】### Copyright\n\n【8】© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The second isolate, DU7433/10, was from the urine of a patient who had been hospitalised for 4 months in Bangladesh. The presence of _bla_ NDM-1 was confirmed by amplifying and sequencing a 750 bp PCR product. Additionally, both isolates contained _bla_ DHA and _bla_ CMY plasmid AmpC, and _bla_ CTX-M group-1 extended-spectrum β-lactamase genes. The outer membrane profiles of both strains were similar to each other and different compared with that of a susceptible _K pneumoniae_ control. Multilocus sequence typing showed that DU1301/10 belonged to sequence type (ST) 11, whereas DU7433/10 belonged to ST14. Both sequence types are associated with outbreak potential. Neither patient received specific antimicrobial chemotherapy because both were thought to be colonised rather than infected.\n\n【4】Like _bla_ NDM-1 , _bla_ IMP-1 is also found on plasmids and there were initial fears that _bla_ IMP-1 would spread among enterobacteria in Singapore. This spread does not seem to have occurred because, in Singapore, carbapenem resistance in enterobacteria is still largely due to CTX-M or to plasmid AmpC β-lactamases combined with loss of porin expression. We still clearly do not understand the factors that result in one resistance mechanism predominating rather than another. Our experience with _bla_ IMP-1 shows that the emergence of a novel mechanism of resistance does not always result in endemicity. Whether NDM-1-producing enterobacteria will successfully establish themselves once introduced remains to be seen. However, these bacteria seem to have been detected simultaneously in more countries and in a shorter period of time than preceding metallo-β-lactamases. That they also co-produce the same CTX-M and plasmid AmpC β-lactamases that have disseminated very successfully in recent years is perhaps an ominous sign.\n\n【5】删除9:<u>THK, CTK, and TYK did the experimental work to identify the β-lactamase genes, and did the typing studies.

Therapeutic attempts by pharmaceutical agents, psychotherapy, and abdominal surgery are of only limited success. A further possibility for treatment might be modulation of taste.\n\n【2】A man aged 53 years underwent resection of a vocal-cord polyp. During surgery, emergency intubation was necessary because of sudden apnoea. Intubation was complicated, lengthy, and induced massive bleeding. Immediately after surgery, the patient noticed loss of taste. He was taking no drug known to alter taste perception. Smelling was slightly impaired. Gustatory tests revealed that taste was greatly impaired on the tip of his tongue, and that taste perception was absent for sour, salt, bitter, and severely reduced for sweet. 20 months later, the patient started tasting again, beginning on the tip of the tongue and with sweet taste. After 36 months, ageusia had completely disappeared. Immediately after surgery, the patient was slightly obese with a weight of 74 kg. He had repeatedly tried to lose weight, but none of his attempts was successful. Surprisingly, during the period of ageusia he lost 20 kg. He simply noticed decreased appetite and ate less.\n\n【3】Decline in smell and taste can decrease appetite and lead to anorexia. There are several possibilities for the pathogenesis of ageusia in our patient. First, ageusia occurred because of bilateral pressure palsy of the afferent sensory pathways, especially the chorda tympani, by lengthy laryngoscopic manipulation. Second, the central gustatory pathways might have been affected by an anaesthetic, any other medication given during surgery, or by cerebral hypoxia during emergency intubation. Third, gustatory receptors on the tongue were directly disturbed by difficult intubation. Most probably, the enforced manipulations with the blade of the laryngoscope led—directly or indirectly by haematoma—to bilateral local pressure of peripheral nervous structures, resulting in pressure palsy of the gustatory pathways and, consequently, to ageusia.\n\n【4】Iatrogenic ageusia, like in the presented case, could be a therapeutic option for patients with morbid obesity. Possible interventions to induce ageusia could be drugs with ageusia as a side-effect, thalamic stereotactic interventions, and interruptions of the centripetal gustatory projections on the peripheral or the central side.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Mutations in Janus kinase-2 ( _JAK2_ ) occur in approximately 50% of patients. The only approved JAK2 inhibitor for myelofibrosis is the dual JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. 58–71% of patients treated with ruxolitinib in clinical trials so far have not achieved the primary endpoint of 35% or more reduction in spleen volume from baseline assessed by MRI or CT. Furthermore, more than 50% of patients discontinue ruxolitinib treatment after 3–5 years. On the basis of this unmet need, we investigated the efficacy and safety of fedratinib, a JAK2-selective inhibitor, in patients with ruxolitinib-resistant or ruxolitinib-intolerant myelofibrosis.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This single-arm, open-label, non-randomised, phase 2, multicentre study, done at 31 sites in nine countries, enrolled adult patients with a current diagnosis of intermediate or high-risk primary myelofibrosis, post-polycythaemia vera myelofibrosis, or post-essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis, found to be ruxolitinib resistant or intolerant after at least 14 days of treatment. Other main inclusion criteria were palpable splenomegaly (≥5 cm below the left costal margin), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and life expectancy of 6 months or less. Patients received oral fedratinib at a starting dose of 400 mg once per day, for six consecutive 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was spleen response (defined as the proportion of patients with a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume as determined by blinded CT and MRI at a central imaging laboratory). We did the primary analysis in the per-protocol population only (patients treated with fedratinib, for whom a baseline and at least one post-baseline spleen volume measurement was available) and the safety analysis in all patients receiving at least one dose of fedratinib. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01523171.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between May 8, 2012, and Aug 29, 2013, 97 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of fedratinib. Of 83 assessable patients, 46 (55%, 95% CI 44–66) achieved a spleen response. Common grade 3–4 adverse events included anaemia (37 \\[38%\\] of 97 patients) and thrombocytopenia (21 \\[22%\\] of 97), with 18 (19%) patients discontinuing due to adverse events. Seven (7%) patients died during the study, but none of the deaths was drug related. Suspected cases of Wernicke's encephalopathy in other fedratinib trials led to study termination.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】This phase 2 study met its primary endpoint, suggesting that patients with ruxolitinib-resistant or ruxolitinib-intolerant myelofibrosis might achieve significant clinical benefit with fedratinib, albeit at the cost of some potential toxicity, which requires further evaluation. Fedratinib development in this setting is currently being assessed.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Sanofi.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Haematology_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

In a meta-analysis, we investigated the effect of these procedures on subsequent fertility and pregnancy outcomes.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We searched for studies in MEDLINE and EMBASE and classified them by the conservative method used and the outcome measure studied regarding both fertility and pregnancy. Pooled relative risks and 95% CIs were calculated with a random-effects model and interstudy heterogeneity was assessed with Cochrane's _Q_ test.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We identified 27 studies. Cold knife conisation was significantly associated with preterm delivery (<37 weeks; relative risk 2·59, 95% CI 1·80–3·72, 100/704 \\[14%\\] _vs_ 1494/27 674 \\[5%\\]), low birthweight (<2500 g; 2·53, 1·19–5·36, 32/261 \\[12%\\] _vs_ 905/13 229 \\[7%\\]), and caesarean section (3·17, 1·07–9·40, 31/350 \\[9%\\] _vs_ 22/670 \\[3%\\]). Large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) was also significantly associated with preterm delivery (1·70, 1·24–2·35, 156/1402 \\[11%\\] _vs_ 120/1739 \\[7%\\]), low birthweight (1·82, 1·09–3·06, 77/996 \\[8%\\] _vs_ 49/1192 \\[4%\\]), and premature rupture of the membranes (2·69, 1·62–4·46, 48/905 \\[5%\\] _vs_ 22/1038 \\[2%\\]). Similar but marginally non-significant adverse effects were recorded for laser conisation (preterm delivery 1·71, 0·93–3·14). We did not detect significantly increased risks for obstetric outcomes after laser ablation. Although severe outcomes such as admission to a neonatal intensive care unit or perinatal mortality showed adverse trends, these changes were not significant.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】All the excisional procedures to treat cervical intraepithelial neoplasia present similar pregnancy-related morbidity without apparent neonatal morbidity. Caution in the treatment of young women with mild cervical abnormalities should be recommended.

Whereas multifocal brain lesions are present on MRI in many patients with a CIS, some patients have additional abnormalities on quantitative MRI in otherwise normal-appearing white and grey matter that suggest an extensive pathological process. Functional outcome for patients with symptomatic CIS lesions is determined by the interplay of inflammation, demyelination, axonal damage, remyelination, and cortical adaptation. Recovery of function may be accelerated by high dose corticosteroids, and although interferon beta delays the development of a second relapse, its long-term effect is unknown. A better understanding of pathological and pathogenetic processes in patients with a CIS will facilitate the development of disease-modifying treatments for patients with MS before they become disabled.

HIV-negative women were randomly allocated 24 weeks of oral PrEP with emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, self-administered as one of three regimens: once daily use; time-driven use (twice a week plus a post-sex dose); or event-driven use (one dose before and one dose after sex). Rigorous methods were used to ascertain adherence to the regimen and sex acts covered by PrEP, including weekly interviews to review sexual activity and electronic drug monitoring data, and measurement of drug concentrations in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Full coverage (defined as taking at least one pill within 96 h before sex and one pill within 24 h after vaginal or anal sex) was higher in women allocated the daily regimen (1459 \\[75%\\] of 1952 sex acts) than in those assigned the time-driven (599 \\[56%\\] of 1074) or event-driven (798 \\[52%\\] of 1542) regimens, but no difference between groups was noted when full and partial coverage were combined (97%, 95%, and 93%, respectively). Far fewer pills were needed to achieve 100% adherence with the time-driven (n=3616) and event-driven (n=2203) regimens than with the daily regimen (n=9652). Side-effects were uncommon in all groups but were less frequent with the time-driven and event-driven regimens than with the daily regimen.

This concern is entirely justifiable, as is the Editorial's call for young people to have more voice in decision making. The Editorial observes that younger people are under-represented in political leadership, implying that this contributes to their disproportionate vulnerability to the effects of COVID-19.\n\n【1】The Editors also imply that older people are over-represented and consequently benefit from favourable policies; indeed, they urge older adults to “let go of established power structures”. Yet, even in evidently gerontocratic countries, health policies actively discriminate against older people. In India, for example, where the average age of national members of parliament is 57·5 years, third doses of COVID-19 vaccines are being rolled out to front-line workers and will soon be available to anyone aged 15 years or older. Yet, by early January, 2022, millions of people 60 years or older were yet to receive a second or even first dose. Rather than between the interests of people at younger and older ages, COVID-19 responses are more subject to trade-offs between economic interests and the health of entire populations.\n\n【2】It is essential to avoid simple assumptions based on age stereotypes and to foster a shared community of interest between children, older people, and everyone aged in between.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2022 Sanjeev Verma/Hindustan Times/Getty Images</u>\n\n【3】删除9:<u>I declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Clavario and colleagues found almost a third of COVID-19 survivors with functional limitations identified from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPX). This illustrates the role of CPX in identifying symptoms of long COVID. Keeping in mind that the acute phase of COVID-19 could also be asymptomatic, the true incidence and prevalence of long COVID is currently unclear. Evidence indicates that the acute pathophysiologic cascade triggered by COVID-19 infection can lead to chronic symptoms. This long term-sequelae of COVID-19 supports the evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) to identify compromised exercise tolerance.\n\n【1】Considering CRF a vital sign was recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 2016, specifically stating: “ _all adults should have CRF estimated each year_ ”. Integration into clinical services, however, requires that the methods to evaluate CRF be readily available and accessible. Therefore, a key question remains: is it universally feasible to consider CRF a vital sign in the post-COVID era?\n\n【2】• View related content for this article\n\n【3】CRF is reflective of the integrated physiology of several systems, from the cardiopulmonary system to the cellular level, that allows an individual to perform physical work. At the genetic level, particular genes related to CRF (e.g. WNT3, MAPT, LRRC37A2, CRHR1) have recently been identified through genome-wide association studies. These genes were also found to have a shared genetic susceptibility for chronic disease, thus making CRF a potentially important index for chronic disease prognostication. At the cellular level, mitochondria play a vital role in an individuals’ ability to extract oxygen and perform exercise and at the system level, CRF reflects the strong interplay between the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. In fact, CRF is a more powerful predictor of adverse health outcomes than traditional risk factors in many studies, which underscores its recognition as an essential vital sign.\n\n【4】CRF is most accurately determined from a maximal exercise test using either a treadmill or bicycle ergometer with the need for measurement of heart rate and exercise workload, at minimum, for the estimation of peak oxygen consumption (peakVO 2 ). However, the cost of CPX systems as well as the advanced training of personnel needed to operate these systems is not feasible across all health care settings. Thus, there is a need for other approaches, such as walk tests like the six minute walk test, shuttle walk test or self-paced walking test. The requirement for supervision is dependent on the clinical condition of the patient and could in most circumstances be supervised by an appropriately trained non-physician healthcare professional. This makes these tests easy to administer in clinical settings. Recently, the use of estimated CRF (eCRF) has gained popularity and utilises easily available non-exercise data in a multivariable score (such as sex, age, body mass index, waist circumference, resting heart rate, smoking status and physical activity). When compared directly with the Framingham risk score, the area under the curve was slightly higher (c-statistic = 0.7987; 95% CI 0.7813, 0.8161) when compared to the Framingham risk score alone (c-statistic = 0.7972; 95% CI 0.7798, 0.8146), with no statistically significant difference in predictive power between the two. This and other studies suggest the benefit of adding eCRF to existing clinical assessments for predicting outcomes related to cardiovascular disease.\n\n【5】With variations existing in health care systems around the world, flexibility is needed to implement a CRF assessment. Table 1 illustrates a list of recommendations for the evaluation of CRF, including required human resources and infrastructure across these settings and systems. These recommendations provide the minimum requirements that should be available in different settings and regions and propose building on the various CRF evaluation methods. With the need to promote healthy lifestyle across all strata of society and to ensure “health equity”, an important starting point is the evaluation of CRF. Without this initial step, the efforts and strategies of public health initiatives and policies to promote healthy lifestyles are merely “castles in the sand”.\n\n【6】Table 1 **Recommendations for methods to evaluate CRF across settings** .\n\n| Setting | Equipment Needs for the Evaluation of CRF | Human resources |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Required | Optional | Required | Optional |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Low resource setting** | Field tests | Treadmill tests/ Cycle ergometry with or without integrated ventilatory expired gas analysis and ECG systems | Non-physician health care professional | Non-physician healthcare professional or Physician specialised in exercise science or integrative physiology or clinical cardiology |\n| **Primary/Secondary health care centre** | Non-exercise equations | Treadmill tests/ Cycle ergometry with or without integrated ventilatory expired gas analysis and ECG systems | Non-physician health care professional | Non-physician healthcare professional or Physician specialised in exercise science or integrative physiology or clinical cardiology |\n| **High resource setting** | Field tests | Exercise echocardiography | Non-physician health care professional trained in exercise science | Physician specialised in exercise science or integrative physiology or clinical cardiology |\n| **Tertiary health care centre** | Non-exercise equationsTreadmill tests/ Cycle ergometry with or without integrated ventilatory expired gas analysis and ECG systems | Invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing | Non-physician health care professional trained in exercise science | Physician specialised in exercise science or integrative physiology or clinical cardiology |\n\n【8】a These will include walk/run tests or step tests.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【9】Given the relevance of CRF in both assessing long-COVID and its impact on chronic disease, the need for it to be a vital sign could not come at a more opportune time.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【10】ASB drafted the manuscript; RA and JM provided intellectual input; ASB, RA and JM all revised the manuscript and approved the final version.\n\n【11】Declaration of interests\n------------------------\n\n【12】ASB reports grants from the Indian Council of Medical Research; all the other authors have no conflicts to report.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Discordant strategies exist, ranging from no vaccination, to vaccination equivalent to people in the community, to higher prioritisation for people in prison. Prisons are dangerous hotspots for acquiring SARS-CoV-2, and individuals who return to the community could unwittingly transmit the virus. In the USA alone, 372 583 prisoners have had COVID-19, with 2359 deaths, according to the Marshall Project. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to address racial and social inequalities globally, but the same lens is often not applied to prison-related policies. Prison health systems remain a weak link in public health preparedness, racial and social justice, and human rights.\n\n【1】Globally, 10·74 million people were in penal institutions as of 2018, either as pretrial detainees, on remand, or having been convicted and sentenced. Since 2000, the number of people in prison has grown by 24%, with a worrying rise in the female prison population, which has outpaced the growth rate among males. The USA still has the most people in prison, with 2·1 million, and has the highest rate of prisoners relative to the population.\n\n【2】Previous publications in _The Lancet_ have underscored the serious gaps in care and follow-up for prisoners, both inside prison walls and in the community. Certainly before COVID-19, prisoners faced a higher burden of poverty, discrimination, disease, mental health issues, and substance use disorders. Insufficient follow-up for prevention and treatment of conditions can also be affected by incompatible health data management systems for prisons and community health providers.\n\n【3】Each year, millions of people cycle in and out of prisons. It stands to reason that the barbed wire and walls that surround prisons are not an N95-style barrier against disease and inequality. The UN has called for countries to embrace a health systems approach, where prisons are integrated within community health services. In 2015, the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Nelson Mandela Rules) called for prison health systems to be equivalent to what is provided in the country as a whole, while ensuring that risks to health are minimised. This stipulation includes women prisoners when giving birth, and their children. UN guidance also calls for community prevention of health conditions, including for mental health and substance use to be addressed early, owing to the risk of incarceration for people with such conditions.\n\n【4】Several areas could be prioritised for legal and policy reform to improve prison health. Since 2014, WHO has recommended that countries review their laws and decriminalise behaviours such as drug use, sex work, and engaging in same-sex sexual activity, including for those with non-conforming gender identities. 69 countries still criminalise same-sex sexual behaviour (about half are Commonwealth countries with archaic colonial era laws). In Asia, over 400 000 people are detained in forced drug rehabilitation and compulsory detention centres, a figure that does not include those in prison. Such laws should be repealed, which will also reduce societal stigma as well as racial and social inequalities that can disproportionately affect the most vulnerable. Detaining people unnecessarily is unjustifiable from a human rights perspective and it is bad for public health.\n\n【5】A strong accountability mechanism for the Nelson Mandela Rules is also needed so that progress can be monitored and poor compliance addressed. Countries could also close the jurisdiction chasm between ministries of health (which provide health recommendations) and ministries of justice 删除2:<u>(which oversee prisons and prison health)</u>.\n\n【6】Fortunately, there has been some progress on prison health reform. COVID-19 has encouraged some countries to look at overcrowding and to pay more attention to prisoners with high-risk comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. The pandemic has also encouraged discussion on vaccination in prisons, which all otherwise eligible prisoners should receive. In Europe, England and Finland have transferred the governance of prison health from the justice ministry to the health ministry. In the USA, President Joe Biden has abolished federal contracts with privately operated, for profit, criminal detention facilities. Humane and evidence-based prison health systems with community links will improve public health within and outside prison walls, both for COVID-19 and other health issues. Such an approach is key to the pursuit of a just and equitable society. As Nelson Mandela said, “A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens, but its lowest ones.”\n\n【7】(此段删除)无关文本-1:删除1-1:<u>For more on **contrasting COVID-19 vaccination strategies in prisons** see https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/03/texas-prisons-coronavirus-vaccine/ , https://news.</u>sky.删除1-1:<u>com/story/covid-19-vaccine-rollout-in-english-prisons-to-begin-today-12201902 , and https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2021/02/coronavirus-in-oregon-judge-orders-inmates-be-prioritized-for-covid-19-vaccines-23-new-deaths-reported-statewide.html</u>\n\n【8】删除1-1:<u>For the **Marshall Project** see https://www.themarshallproject.org/records/8793-covid-19</u>\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>For more on the **world prison population** see https://www.prisonstudies.org/sites/default/files/resources/downloads/wppl\\_12.pdf</u>\n\n【10】删除1-1:<u>For more on the **increase in the female prison population** see https://www.prisonstudies.org/news/world-female-imprisonment-list-fourth-edition</u>\n\n【11】删除1-1:<u>For **WHO guidance for prisons** see https://www.who.int/topics/prisons/en/</u>\n\n【12】删除1-1:<u>For more on **criminalisation of same-sex sexual behavior** see https://ilga.org/downloads/ILGA\\_World\\_State\\_Sponsored\\_Homophobia\\_report\\_global\\_legislation\\_overview\\_update\\_December\\_2020.pdf</u>\n\n【13】删除1-1:<u>For more on the **governance of prison health** see https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/336214/WHO-EURO-2020-1268-41018-55685-eng.pdf</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2021 Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【14】### Publication history\n\n【15】Published: 13 February 2021\n\n【16】### Identification\n\n【17】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00361-5</u>\n\n【18】### Copyright\n\n【19】© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

It is also associated with a major disease burden in middle-aged people, and represents 4–5% of disability-adjusted life-years in those aged 30–60 years. The burden of disease caused by osteoarthritis is greater for women than for men, and is projected to increase as the population ages. Joint damage in osteoarthritis is caused by several predisposing systemic factors (including genetics), and local mechanical factors (including joint injury and load) that determine its distribution and severity. The knee, hand, and hip are most often affected. Joint damage might be associated with use-related joint pain and restricted movement. Diagnostic criteria are ambiguous and disease assessment is difficult: for example, pain and radiographical severity of joint damage are only weakly associated. Socioeconomic and psychosocial factors have an important role in establishing disease burden for the individual with osteoarthritis, as in many other musculoskeletal diseases.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

We assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in children aged 2–5 years.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In this multicentre, phase 3, open-label, two-part study, we enrolled children aged 2–5 years, weighing at least 8 kg at enrolment, with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis who were homozygous for the _F508del-CFTR_ mutation. Children received lumacaftor 100 mg and ivacaftor 125 mg (bodyweight <14 kg) or lumacaftor 150 mg and ivacaftor 188 mg (bodyweight ≥14 kg) orally every 12 h for 15 days in part A (to assess pharmacokinetics and safety) and for 24 weeks in part B (to assess safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy). Children could participate in part A, part B, or both. Children were enrolled into part A at five sites in the USA and into part B at 20 sites in North America (USA, 17 sites; Canada, three sites). The primary endpoints of the study were the pharmacokinetics (part A) and safety (part B) of lumacaftor and ivacaftor; all analyses were done in children who received at least one dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. Secondary endpoints in part A were safety and pharmacokinetics of the metabolites of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, and in part B included pharmacokinetics in children who received at least one dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and absolute changes from baseline in sweat chloride concentration, growth parameters, and markers of pancreatic function. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT02797132.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】The study was done from May 13, 2016, to Sept 8, 2017. 12 children enrolled in part A, 11 of whom completed the 15-day treatment period and enrolled in part B. 60 children enrolled in part B, 56 of whom completed the 24-week treatment period. Safety and pharmacokinetics were consistent with the well characterised safety profile of lumacaftor and ivacaftor. In part B, most children (59 \\[98%\\] of 60 children) had one or more treatment-emergent adverse events; most events were mild to moderate in severity. The most common adverse events were cough (38 \\[63%\\] of 60), vomiting (17 \\[28%\\]), pyrexia (17 \\[28%\\]), and rhinorrhoea (15 \\[25%\\]). Serious adverse events occurred in four children: infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis (n=2), gastroenteritis viral (n=1), and constipation (n=1). Three (5%) of 60 children discontinued treatment because of elevated serum aminotransferase concentrations. Mean sweat chloride concentrations decreased by 31·7 mmol/L, biomarkers of pancreatic function improved (fecal elastase-1 concentrations increased and serum immunoreactive trypsinogen concentrations decreased), and growth parameters increased at week 24.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Lumacaftor and ivacaftor were generally safe and well tolerated in children aged 2–5 years with cystic fibrosis for 24 weeks. Efficacy findings also suggest that early intervention with lumacaftor and ivacaftor has the potential to modify the course of disease.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Respiratory Medicine_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

The concept of disease concentration holds that two or more epidemics co-occur in particular temporal or geographical contexts due to harmful social conditions. This aspect of the theory of syndemics is not necessarily what makes its contribution distinctive. For example, anthropologists have long called attention to the manner in which large-scale political, economic, and cultural forces have given rise to clustered epidemics of various infectious diseases, most prominently HIV and tuberculosis; and the theory of fundamental causes highlights the roles of these forces in driving concentrated health disadvantage. Rather, what makes the theory notable are its predictions about how interactions between epidemics amplify disease burden and about how public health planners can (or cannot) effectively intervene to mitigate this burden. Although the theory of syndemics is principally a theory about population health, the past two decades' worth of quantitative literature motivated by the theory has generally focused on studying individuals rather than populations—and consequently has had very little to say about population health. Our aim in this Viewpoint is to critically review the literature on syndemics and to introduce key concepts for measuring their effects on population health.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

They highlight that in their experience, only a minority of patients achieve the threshold values above which efficacy outcomes become significantly improved by phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors and calcium channel blockers, which is what we also observe in our experience. Although these thresholds might be useful to identify responders to these drugs, we agree that using them as inclusion criteria for future trials would be misguided for several reasons. First, these thresholds are derived from current evidence and only highlight the small effect size of available treatments; they do not preclude the potential efficacy of future drugs, which should be assessed using clinically relevant thresholds. Using the results of our meta-regressions as inclusion criteria would undeniably select patients with characteristics at baseline that are unrepresentative of the actual patient population. Selection of such patients is not desirable not only because of recruitment issues, but also for the sake of external validity (ie, representativeness) of the results. Additionally, as menstioned in the Discussion of our Article, these results rely on meta-regressions with large credible intervals, indicating the need for more data to specifically address this question.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【1】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【2】Already registered?\n\n【3】Log in to existing account\n\n【4】Forgot password?\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Not yet registered?\n\n【8】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

None of the trials recruiting patients with and without diabetes were designed to assess outcomes separately in patients without diabetes.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitor trials. We searched the MEDLINE and Embase databases for trials published from database inception to Sept 5, 2022. SGLT2 inhibitor trials that were double-blind, placebo-controlled, performed in adults (age ≥18 years), large (≥500 participants per group), and at least 6 months in duration were included. Summary-level data used for analysis were extracted from published reports or provided by trial investigators, and inverse-variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to estimate treatment effects. The main efficacy outcomes were kidney disease progression (standardised to a definition of a sustained ≥50% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate \\[eGFR\\] from randomisation, a sustained low eGFR, end-stage kidney disease, or death from kidney failure), acute kidney injury, and a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. Other outcomes were death from cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular disease considered separately, and the main safety outcomes were ketoacidosis and lower limb amputation. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42022351618.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We identified 13 trials involving 90 413 participants. After exclusion of four participants with uncertain diabetes status, we analysed 90 409 participants (74 804 \\[82·7%\\] participants with diabetes \\[>99% with type 2 diabetes\\] and 15 605 \\[17·3%\\] without diabetes; trial-level mean baseline eGFR range 37–85 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 ). Compared with placebo, allocation to an SGLT2 inhibitor reduced the risk of kidney disease progression by 37% (relative risk \\[RR\\] 0·63, 95% CI 0·58–0·69) with similar RRs in patients with and without diabetes. In the four chronic kidney disease trials, RRs were similar irrespective of primary kidney diagnosis. SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of acute kidney injury by 23% (0·77, 0·70–0·84) and the risk of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure by 23% (0·77, 0·74–0·81), again with similar effects in those with and without diabetes. SGLT2 inhibitors also reduced the risk of cardiovascular death (0·86, 0·81–0·92) but did not significantly reduce the risk of non-cardiovascular death (0·94, 0·88–1·02). For these mortality outcomes, RRs were similar in patients with and without diabetes. For all outcomes, results were broadly similar irrespective of trial mean baseline eGFR. Based on estimates of absolute effects, the absolute benefits of SGLT2 inhibition outweighed any serious hazards of ketoacidosis or amputation.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In addition to the established cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors, the randomised data support their use for modifying risk of kidney disease progression and acute kidney injury, not only in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, but also in patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure irrespective of diabetes status, primary kidney disease, or kidney function.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】UK Medical Research Council and Kidney Research UK.\n\n【10】</u>Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Large placebo-controlled trials have shown that sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, and particularly hospitalisation for heart failure, in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. There is good evidence to support the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as a foundational therapy to prevent cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with heart failure, irrespective of ejection fraction or history of previous diabetes. Large trials have also shown that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of kidney disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes and proteinuric chronic kidney disease, although few patients with chronic kidney disease without diabetes were included in the three previously reported chronic kidney disease trials. CREDENCE and SCORED exclusively studied patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, and the DAPA-CKD trial in patients with proteinuric chronic kidney disease reported just 109 kidney disease progression outcomes in patients without diabetes. Although evidence of the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney disease progression in patients without diabetes is also available from the reported heart failure trials (in which decreased kidney function was common), a previous meta-analysis had limited power as only 98 kidney disease progression outcomes were reported in participants without diabetes in such trials. \n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【14】In our previous systematic review and meta-analysis reported in 2021, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception to Aug 28, 2021, for large double-blind placebo-controlled sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor trials. We identified 11 large trials with low risk of bias conducted in three at-risk populations (type 2 diabetes and high atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease). Overall, SGLT2 inhibitors reduced the risk of kidney disease progression and the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure, both by about a quarter. Relative risks were markedly consistent across the different patient groups. However, data were limited in patients without diabetes who were eligible for inclusion (in one trial in patients with chronic kidney disease and three trials in patients with heart failure). Estimates of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney disease progression in patients without diabetes were based on around 100 events from the chronic kidney disease trial and around 100 events from the heart failure trials. This limits the quality of evidence for making clinical practice recommendations. The influence of diabetes on the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on acute kidney injury, cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality, and safety outcomes was also not explored in the previous meta-analysis.\n\n【15】**Added value of this study**\n\n【16】The majority of people with chronic kidney disease do not have diabetes, and thus more information about SGLT2 inhibitors in this patient group has particular public health importance. Since 2021, two placebo-controlled SGLT2 inhibitor trials (EMPA-KIDNEY and DELIVER) have studied a large number of people without diabetes. EMPA-KIDNEY recruited 6609 patients with chronic kidney disease including 3569 patients without diabetes, and DELIVER recruited 6263 patients with heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved (>40%) ejection fraction including 3109 patients without diabetes. By incorporating data from these trials and standardising outcome definitions, the current updated meta-analysis shows that in the studied patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure (in whom chronic kidney disease was common), SGLT2 inhibitors safely reduced the risk of kidney disease progression by 37% (relative risk 0·63, 95% CI 0·58–0·69) and of acute kidney injury by 23% (0·77, 0·70–0·84), compared with placebo, with similar reductions in patients with and without diabetes. Apparent benefits on kidney disease progression were also similar across the range of studied kidney function, and appeared unmodified by primary kidney diagnosis.\n\n【17】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【18】This meta-analysis provides high-quality evidence to support guideline recommendations for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors as a foundational therapy to reduce the risk of kidney disease progression and acute kidney injury not only in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, but also in patients who have chronic kidney disease or heart failure, irrespective of diabetes status, primary kidney diagnosis, or level of kidney function.\n\n【19】Two recent placebo-controlled SGLT2 inhibitor trials have provided important new information on the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney disease progression and other outcomes in patients without diabetes. DELIVER randomly assigned 6263 patients with stable heart failure and an ejection fraction of greater than 40%, including 3109 (49·6%) patients without diabetes (mean estimated glomerular filtration rate \\[eGFR\\] 61 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 ), and EMPA-KIDNEY randomly assigned 6609 patients with chronic kidney disease at risk of progression (mean eGFR 37 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 ), including 3569 (54·0%) without diabetes. Although geographical variation exists, globally the majority of people with chronic kidney disease do not have diabetes. Therefore, these data need to be incorporated and an updated meta-analysis performed to definitively summarise the relative and absolute effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney disease progression and other outcomes according to whether or not trial participants had diabetes.\n\n【20】Another limitation of previous meta-analyses was the inability to standardise between-trial differences in the thresholds of eGFR decrease used to define kidney disease progression within categorical composite outcomes 删除2:<u>( appendix p 9 )</u>. We therefore performed a collaborative meta-analysis assessing the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney disease progression according to a standardised outcome definition, and on acute kidney injury, death, heart failure, and key safety outcomes by diabetes status. Secondarily, we assessed whether the relative effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on outcomes are modified by mean baseline kidney function (at a trial level) or by primary kidney diagnosis.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Search strategy and selection criteria\n\n【23】We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist in the conduct and reporting of this study. We did a systematic search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases via Ovid to cover the period from database inception to Sept 5, 2022. Further details and search terms are listed in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 3–7 )</u>. Trials were eligible if they assessed SGLT2 inhibitors (including combined SGLT1/2 inhibitors) and if they were double-blind and placebo-controlled (excluding crossover trials), performed in adults (age ≥18 years), large (defined as ≥500 participants in each arm, thereby minimising any potential for publication bias to distort findings), at least 6 months in duration, and reported any of the prespecified efficacy or safety outcomes. Titles and abstracts were initially screened for relevance and duplicates by one author (AJR). The EMPA-KIDNEY trial baseline report was available while the final report was unpublished at the time of the search. Subsequent screening of full texts and risk of bias assessments (with version 2 of the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool ) were completed independently by two authors (KJM, AJR) with conflicts resolved by consensus discussion.\n\n【24】### Data analysis\n\n【25】For each included trial, summary data were extracted from the principal and relevant subsidiary peer-reviewed publications, independently and in duplicate by two authors (KJM, AJR) with discrepancies resolved by consensus discussion 删除2:<u>( appendix p 4 )</u>. For trials without previously published relevant outcomes, results were provided by trial investigators.\n\n【26】The main focus of efficacy analyses was on kidney disease progression, acute kidney injury, and a composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure. Kidney disease progression was defined as a sustained eGFR decrease (≥50%) from randomisation, end-stage kidney disease (ie, start of maintenance dialysis or receipt of a kidney transplant), a sustained low eGFR (<15 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 or <10 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 ) or death from kidney failure 删除2:<u>( appendix p 9 )</u>. For eight trials this kidney disease progression outcome was unavailable publicly, and thus individual trial investigators provided a re-analysis of eGFR data to derive our composite kidney disease progression outcome and any other unavailable outcomes of interest (data unavailable from the short duration SOLOIST-WHF trial ). The kidney failure component of the primary outcome was defined as a composite of maintenance dialysis, kidney transplantation, or sustained low eGFR. On the basis of previously reported results, we considered acute kidney injury an efficacy outcome (rather than a safety outcome). Acute kidney injury was defined by its specific Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Preferred Term, wherever possible 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 10–11 )</u>. The composite of hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death excluded urgent heart failure visits to enable standardisation across trials. Cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular death were also assessed and retained individual trial definitions. All-cause mortality is a less generalisable outcome than cause-specific mortality, but it was included for completeness. Safety outcomes focused on key medical complications that previous meta-analyses have indicated are potentially caused by SGLT2 inhibition: ketoacidosis and lower limb amputation, with information on lower limb amputation particularly sought because the CANVAS trial reported a significant excess of amputation among participants allocated to SGLT2 inhibition. Additional information on urinary tract infections (all infections and restricted to serious infections), mycotic genital infections, severe hypoglycaemia, and bone fractures was included for completeness. Details on the derivation of each outcome by trial are provided in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 10–11 )</u>.\n\n【27】For the trials in chronic kidney disease, we used prespecified subgroups according to investigator-reported primary kidney diagnosis when possible. This applied for DAPA-CKD and EMPA-KIDNEY, with the subgroups: diabetic kidney disease or nephropathy; ischaemic and hypertensive kidney disease; glomerular disease (also known as glomerulonephritis); and other kidney disease or diagnosis or unknown combined. CREDENCE excluded suspected non-diabetic kidney disease, and so all participants were considered to have diabetic kidney disease. A sensitivity analysis excluding SCORED was conducted due to an absence of data on investigator-reported primary kidney diagnosis. On the basis of previous DAPA-CKD publications, exploratory analyses were also conducted by subtype of glomerular disease: immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy versus focal segmental glomerulosclerosis versus other glomerulonephritides.\n\n【28】Analyses were done separately in patients with and without diabetes at baseline (except for analyses by primary kidney diagnosis). When possible, diabetes-specific (or primary kidney diagnosis-specific) effects of treatment were obtained from Cox models reported in trial publications. When these effects were unavailable 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 10–11 )</u>, log relative risk (RR) and the associated SE were estimated from the numbers of events and participants in each arm. Inverse-variance-weighted averages of log hazard ratios or log RRs were then used to estimate the treatment effects, summarised as RR (95% CI), in each patient group and overall. This information-weighted-average approach has the desirable property that, at the point of random assignment, every participant has the same opportunity to contribute the same amount of statistical information to the meta-analysis as every other participant, without making any assumptions about the nature of any true heterogeneity in results between the trials.\n\n【29】Tests of between-study heterogeneity were conducted in our previous meta-analysis published in 2021, which established that effects were generally similar across its included trials (excluding DELIVER and EMPA-KIDNEY). Standard χ 2 tests for heterogeneity were used to assess whether treatment effects differed between those with and without diabetes at recruitment, by trial population 删除2:<u>(based on predefined trial eligibility \\[table\\])</u> and by primary kidney diagnosis. Heterogeneity was also assessed post hoc for the lower limb amputation outcome, comparing CANVAS with the other 12 trials combined. In forest plots, trials were ordered by their mean baseline eGFR values and effect modification by kidney function was assessed by a standard χ 2 test for trend across the set of ordered results. Heterogeneity and trend p values were interpreted in the context of the multiple exploratory hypotheses being tested and the absence of individual participant-level data. For trials reporting median eGFR and its IQR, mean and SD values were estimated. A sensitivity analysis reordering trials by median baseline level of albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio) was conducted.\n\n【30】Rates of outcome events were presented per 1000 patient-years. For the outcomes of kidney disease progression, acute kidney injury, cardiovascular death or hospitalisation for heart failure, ketoacidosis, and lower limb amputation, absolute benefits and harms of SGLT2 inhibitors versus placebo per 1000 patient-years were estimated by diabetes status and patient group. Absolute effects were estimated by applying the diabetes status-specific RRs, or their 95% CIs, to the corresponding mean event rates in the placebo arms (first event only). As in our previous report, data from SOLOIST-WHF were excluded from these analyses due to the extremely high absolute risks in this trial in patients with a recent hospitalisation for heart failure.\n\n【31】All analyses were performed in SAS (version 9.4) and R (version 3.6.2). Our outline protocol was registered in PROSPERO on Aug 5, 2022 (CRD42022351618).\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of funding source\n\n【32】The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.\n\n【33】</u>Results\n-------\n\n【34】Our literature searches identified 15 large trials 删除2:<u>( appendix p 14 )</u>. Two large trials, one with 1402 participants with type 1 diabetes (the inTandem3 trial) and one with 1250 people hospitalised with COVID-19 (the DARE-19 trial) were excluded from meta-analyses as follow-up was less than 6 months 删除2:<u>( appendix p 8 )</u>. Results from the remaining 13 trials' main reports (and their relevant subsidiary publications ) included a total of 90 413 randomly assigned patients. 32 238 (35·7%) patients were women and trial-level mean age ranged from 61·9 years to 71·8 years 删除2:<u>( appendix p 12 )</u>. All 13 trials were judged to be at low risk of bias 删除2:<u>( appendix p 13 )</u>.\n\n【35】Four trials included 42 568 patients with type 2 diabetes and high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; five trials included 21 947 patients with heart failure (11 305 with diabetes, 10 638 without diabetes, and four with uncertain status); and four trials included 25 898 patients with chronic kidney disease 删除2:<u>(20 931 with diabetes and 4967 without diabetes; table )</u>. Patients with uncertain diabetes status were excluded from all analyses, resulting in 90 409 patients in the final analysis population. More than 99% of participants with diabetes had type 2 diabetes. The range of values for trial-level mean baseline eGFR was 74–85 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 in the type 2 diabetes and high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk trials, 51–66 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 in the heart failure trials, and 37–56 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 in the chronic kidney disease trials. Median follow-up was longest for the type 2 diabetes and high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk trials (2·4–4·2 years), intermediate for the chronic kidney disease trials (1·3–2·6 years), and shortest for the heart failure trials (0·8–2·2 years).\n\n【36】Table Summary of included trials\n\n|  | **Size, n** | **Median follow-up, years** | **Proportion with diabetes, n (%)** | **Proportion with heart failure, n (%)** | **Mean (SD) eGFR, mL/min per1·73 m 2** | **Median (IQR) uACR, mg/g** | **Key eligibility criteria** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease** | **Type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease** | **Type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease** | **Type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease** | **Type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease** | **Type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease** | **Type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease** | **Type 2 diabetes at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease** |\n| DECLARE-TIMI 58 (dapagliflozin 10 mg) | 17 160 | 4·2 | 17 160 (100%) | 1724 (10%) | 85 (16) | 13·1 (6·0–43·6) | Type 2 diabetesAge ≥40 years and history of coronary, cerebral, or peripheral vascular disease;

Consequently, in both participants with chronic kidney disease and participants with heart failure, the absolute benefits of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment were often larger for patients with diabetes. For example, treatment for one year of 1000 patients with chronic kidney disease and diabetes with an SGLT2 inhibitor was estimated to result in 11 fewer patients developing kidney disease progression, four fewer patients with acute kidney injury, and 11 fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalisations for heart failure, and to cause around one episode of ketoacidosis and around one lower limb amputation 删除2:<u>( figure 5 )</u>. The corresponding benefits in patients with chronic kidney disease without diabetes were 15 fewer patients with kidney disease progression, five fewer with acute kidney injury, and two fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalisations for heart failure per 1000 patient-years, with no excess risk of ketoacidosis or amputation.

Our key objective was to perform a collaborative meta-analysis incorporating all of the available evidence from all large SGLT2 inhibitor trials in populations with chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk, to compare the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the risk of kidney disease progression, acute kidney injury, and other key outcomes in patients with and without diabetes. Our analyses included information from around 90 000 trial participants, including about 16 000 people without diabetes. We defined kidney disease progression on the basis of a sustained decrease in eGFR (≥50%) from randomisation, a need to start maintenance dialysis or receive a kidney transplant, sustained low eGFR, or death from kidney failure. Our results showed that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the risk of kidney disease progression by 37% and acute kidney injury by 23%, with similar effects in patients with and without diabetes. Patients with a wide range of kidney function have been studied in the reported trials, and despite attenuation of the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on glycosuria with lower kidney function, our results did not suggest that kidney benefits were attenuated when trials were ordered by average baseline kidney function. SGLT2 inhibitors also appear safe at low levels of kidney function down to an eGFR of at least 20 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 with patients without diabetes being at particularly low risk of ketoacidosis or amputation (whether receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor or not). In all the trial populations studied to date, the absolute benefits of SGLT2 inhibition considerably outweighed any serious hazards.\n\n【58】The outcome of a sustained decrease in eGFR (≥50%) from randomisation has been widely used to explore effects on kidney disease progression in subanalyses of the DAPA-CKD trial. This definition appears to be more specific for progression to kidney failure than lower thresholds for sustained decreases in eGFR (eg, ≥30% or ≥40%) when assessing interventions with a negative acute dip effect on eGFR, such as SGLT2 inhibitors. The optimal percentage decrease in eGFR used to assess kidney disease progression is a trade-off between specificity (increased by larger percentage decreases) and outcome event rate (increased by smaller percentage decreases). DAPA-CKD suggested the effects of dapagliflozin on kidney disease progression were similar when participants with diabetic kidney disease or nephropathy, glomerular diseases, ischaemic or hypertensive kidney disease, and chronic kidney disease of other or unknown causes were considered separately. Furthermore, the DAPA-CKD investigators have reported results for 270 patients with IgA nephropathy, the commonest cause of glomerulonephritis worldwide, and reported kidney benefits in this particular subgroup (based on 25 kidney disease progression events). Analyses from EMPA-KIDNEY included 817 patients with IgA nephropathy and 80 kidney disease progression outcomes 删除2:<u>( appendix p 18 )</u>. The current meta-analysis shows that the benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors on kidney disease progression extend to patients irrespective of diabetes status and in patients with chronic kidney disease irrespective of their primary kidney diagnosis.\n\n【59】Based on the average risk in different trial populations, we estimated that for every 1000 patients with chronic kidney disease treated for one year with an SGLT2 inhibitor, 11 first kidney disease progression events would be prevented in patients with diabetes, and 15 would be prevented in patients without diabetes. In these patients, such treatment also appeared to result in an estimated four to five fewer acute kidney injury events in patients with and without diabetes. Individual trials have shown that kidney benefits translate into important reductions in the need for dialysis or kidney transplantation, and the cardiovascular and kidney benefits appear to be cost-saving in diabetic chronic kidney disease. We found no good evidence that the kidney benefits were modified by the average level of kidney function studied in the trials. Importantly, efficacy and safety data from EMPA-KIDNEY and DAPA-CKD combined include information on nearly 3000 patients with an eGFR of 20–30 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 . A total of 489 kidney disease progression outcomes accrued in those with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 in those two trials. Although some clinical practice guidelines have started recommending use of SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes at eGFRs down to 20 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 (based on grade B levels of evidence), many other recommendations limit initiation to those with eGFR greater than 25 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 or 30 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 . As patients with decreased eGFR are at the highest absolute risk of kidney disease progression, our findings should encourage the initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with chronic kidney disease down to an eGFR of 20 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 with continued use below this level. Several hundred participants in the chronic kidney disease trials had an eGFR below 20 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 at randomisation or during follow-up (eg, 254 participants in EMPA-KIDNEY at randomisation), providing indirect evidence to support initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in selected patients with an eGFR less than 20 mL/min per 1·73 m 2 .\n\n【60】This meta-analysis has a number of strengths: it addresses the scarcity of a single standardised kidney disease progression outcome in previous meta-analyses, and takes into account all of the available large-scale randomised evidence (at the time of publication) from around 90 000 people recruited into 13 relevant SGLT2 inhibitor clinical trials. The inclusion of new EMPA-KIDNEY and DELIVER data has more than doubled the number of outcomes previously available for kidney disease progression in patients without diabetes. Nevertheless, some limitations remain. Firstly, we found low numbers of cardiovascular deaths and heart failure hospitalisations in patients with chronic kidney disease without diabetes. Secondly, adjudication of acute kidney injury was not performed in most trials. Thirdly, individual participant-level data from all the trials are not yet available, precluding detailed analyses of the rate of change of eGFR (an accepted surrogate of kidney disease progression). Such analyses might have sufficient power to assess effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in individuals with slowly progressive chronic kidney disease in whom data are limited (eg, patients with chronic kidney disease with low levels of albuminuria). Fourthly, the efficacy and safety of SGLT2 inhibitors in people with established kidney failure requiring dialysis or kidney transplant remains to be evaluated (eg, NCT05374291), and data are insufficient to assess the effects on kidney and cardiovascular clinical outcomes for patients with other kidney diagnoses excluded from the chronic kidney disease trials (eg, polycystic kidney disease) and for patients with type 1 diabetes 删除2:<u>( appendix p 8 )</u>. Finally, our absolute effect estimates are specific to the recruited trial populations. RRs tend to be more generalisable, and so, in routine clinical practice, absolute effects of SGLT2 inhibitors could be estimated for an individual by calculating their absolute risk for an event with an established risk score, and then applying the RRs for the relevant outcome from the present meta-analysis.\n\n【61】In conclusion, our meta-analysis of the available large placebo-controlled SGLT2 inhibitor trials has shown that in the studied populations, SGLT2 inhibitors safely reduce the risk of kidney disease progression, acute kidney injury, cardiovascular death, and hospitalisation for heart failure in patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure, irrespective of diabetes status. The proportional benefits were similar in patients with and without diabetes and appeared to be evident across the wide range of kidney function studied. In the trials of patients with chronic kidney disease, we also found that the proportional benefits on kidney disease progression were similar across the range of primary kidney diagnoses studied. The data from these large trials therefore support a central role for SGLT2 inhibitors as a disease-modifying therapy for chronic kidney disease, irrespective of diabetes status, primary kidney diagnosis, or level of kidney function.\n\n【62】Correspondence to: Assoc Prof William Herrington, Medical Research Council Population Health Research Unit at the University of Oxford, Nuffield Department of Population Health, Oxford OX3 7LF, UK\n\n【63】### Writing committee\n\n【64】Natalie Staplin\\*, Richard Haynes\\*, Kaitlin J Mayne, Alistair J Roddick, SGLT2 inhibitor Meta-Analysis Cardio-Renal Trialists' Consortium (SMART-C) collaborators (Brendon L Neuen, Sibylle J Hauske, Stefan D Anker, Martina Brueckmann, Javed Butler, David Z I Cherney, Jennifer B Green, Chih-Chin Liu, Finnian R McCausland, Darren K McGuire, John J V McMurray, Milton Packer, Vlado Perkovic, Marc S Sabatine, Scott D Solomon, Muthiah Vaduganathan, Christoph Wanner, Stephen D Wiviott, Faiez Zannad, Hiddo J L Heerspink), Sarah Y A Ng, Doreen Zhu, Parminder Judge, David Preiss, Martin J Landray, Colin Baigent, Jonathan R Emberson\\*, William G Herrington\\* (\\*contributed equally).\n\n【65】### SMART-C steering committee\n\n【66】Deepak L Bhatt, David Z I Cherney, Bruce Neal, Brendon L Neuen, Vlado Perkovic, Richard Haynes, William G Herrington, Hiddo J L Heerspink, Silvio E Inzucchi, Meg J Jardine, Kenneth W Mahaffey, Darren K McGuire, John J V McMurray, Milton Packer, Marc S Sabatine, Scott D Solomon, Muthiah Vaduganathan, Christoph Wanner, Stephen D Wiviott, David C Wheeler, Faiez Zannad.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【67】WGH conceived the meta-analysis and developed its design with NS, AJR, KJM, and RH.

However, our experience is that where primary-care doctors, nurses, and managers show _any_ interest in improving their “awareness, services, and skills” some local champions can improve care.\n\n【2】However, _The Lancet_ is right to pinpoint that “health service staff have little knowledge about learning disability”. A missing link is that knowledge-based practice needs a strong research base. The academic community bears a measure of responsibility, because health research has been underdeveloped, devalued, and even discounted when evidence is produced. No wonder knowledge transfer is minimal! Perhaps, just as service commissioners need to “take their responsibilities to this marginalised group more seriously”, so should commissioners of research?\n\n【3】I am an honorary consultant to Essex Children's Trust, and an elected governor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

When two members of the Zombie Research Society came up with a brainy idea to write a book in preparation for the coming zombie apocalypse, you might be tempted to dismiss it as cult fantasy—topical, entertaining, frightening even, but not serious, surely?\n\n【1】In _Do Zombies Dream of Undead Sheep?_ the zombie phenomenon is studied in depth. Psychological evaluation and neuroscientific principles are applied to analyse the brain of the walking dead. Authors Timothy Verstynen, Department of Psychology and the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition at Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and Bradley Voytek, University of California, San Diego (CA, USA), are self-confessed zombie nerds, and experts in brain cognition. What they have created is a satirical but oddly plausible and engaging investigation that leads to a diagnosis of zombism as a neurological disorder called consciousness deficit hypoactivity disorder (CDHD). CDHD is an affliction caused by starvation of oxygen and nutrients to the brain (essentially brain damage) with the speed of the zombification process (time-to-resurrection) determining the rapidity and agility of the awakened zombie. How they reached this conclusion is delivered in bite-size chunks of deductive reasoning.\n\n【2】Because they do not assume a working knowledge of the brain, the authors zip through a fairly rudimentary lesson on brain parts, brain functions, and cognitive processes, but always refer back to the zombie, and the parallels drawn between the human brain and the damaged brain of the zombie. A substantial portion of content is technical, and is translated with metaphor and analogy for the layperson (usually recreating a situation with you and the ravenous zombie). However, for those with some interest in the brain, this book undeniably provides a deeper understanding of zombies through playful linguistic interactions with the reader. Voytek and Verstynen are patient and thorough teachers, and inclusive in this process with an ingenious touch of conscious nerdy sophistication.\n\n【3】The book breaks down areas of relevant interest: sleeping and waking; which neural systems control movement; what is the nature of hunger and anger (the two most visible traits of the zombie); how we speak and how we are understood; facial recognition; voluntary and involuntary control; and memory. Zombies can be friends, family, neighbours—we recognise them, but they have no emotional connection to us anymore, we are nothing but meat. This is a hard fact to swallow, described perfectly by Verstynen and Voytek; “As a human with a loved one who has just turned into a zombie, it can sometimes be difficult to understand that this bloody, drooling, groaning beast lumbering toward you will not recognise you as the person she once loved. No matter how long you have known her, once she has turned into an undead walker that spark of recognition will never again appear in her eyes—ever.” The hypothesis drawn is that zombies no longer possess facial perception abilities. As seen in _Shaun of the Dead_ (one of the many movies alluded to in the book), one survival method might be to act like a zombie—moaning, drooling, and ghoulish. This would lead us to suppose that zombies use other clues, such as sound and movement to differentiate zombies from non-zombies, and that “one component of the zombie syndrome is acquired prosopagnosia”; damaged functioning of the ventral visual stream.\n\n【4】Then there is the insatiable hunger and all-consuming rage. The authors compare this abnormal behaviour to the stimulus driven and impulsive–reactive behaviour of a primitive being. Thus, they conclude that the orbitofrontal cortex is dysfunctioning; the limbic system is too dominant; the amygdala, hypothalamus, and thalamus are overactive; and the hormonal system is massively disturbed. As for the appetite, zombies just don't feel full—the neurons that process leptin signals from the gut are not doing their job. These, and many more evidence-based hypotheses, supported by what science has already discovered, are the thrust of this project. Through popular culture, neuroscience becomes more interesting, more relevant, and not so esoteric.\n\n【5】The book wades through a lot of information, and with an enthusiastic stride, Verstynen's and Vortek's excitement and passion for their topic is infectious. The illustrations resemble a cult-comic book style, and are not immediately helpful as visual tools, but they are fun. And fun is exactly how I would describe the reality of this book. If you really do believe in an imminent zombie apocalypse you could increase your chances of survival, and if you don't, you can enjoy imagining one. In keeping with a tongue-in-cheek flair, hopefully Verstynen and Voytek will be successful in securing a grant to research the coming zombie apocalypse, and then we can all sleep more soundly at night (without dreaming of undead sheep).\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2015 Rekha Garton</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: December 15, 2014\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(14)70320-5</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Ibrutinib, a novel oral Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has shown single-drug activity in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. We investigated the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in combination with R-CHOP for patients with previously untreated CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In this phase 1b, open-label, non-randomised study, patients were recruited across six centres in the USA and France. Eligibility was age 18 years or older and treatment-naive histopathologically confirmed CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In the dose-escalation phase (part 1), patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle-cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma were enrolled. The primary objective was to determine a recommended phase 2 dose of ibrutinib with a standard R-CHOP regimen, by assessing safety in all patients who received treatment. Patients received ibrutinib 280 mg, 420 mg, or 560 mg per day in combination with a standard R-CHOP regimen every 21 days. Safety of the recommended phase 2 dose was then assessed in a dose-expansion population, which consisted of patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (part 2). Secondary objectives included assessments of the proportion of patients who had an overall response, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. 删除8:<u>This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01569750.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】From June 22, 2012, to March 25, 2013, 33 patients were enrolled (part 1: 17; part 2: 16) and 32 received ibrutinib plus R-CHOP treatment (one patient in the part 2 cohort withdrew). The maximum tolerated dose was not reached and the recommended phase 2 dose for ibrutinib was 560 mg per day. The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events included neutropenia (73% \\[24 of 33 patients\\]), thrombocytopenia (21% \\[seven patients\\]), and febrile neutropenia and anaemia (18% each \\[six patients\\]). The most frequently reported serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (18% \\[six patients\\]) and hypotension (6% \\[two patients\\]). 30 (94%) of 32 patients who received one or more doses of combination treatment achieved an overall response. All 18 patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma who received the recommended phase 2 dose had an overall response. For those subtyped and treated at the recommended phase 2 dose, five (71%) of seven patients with the germinal centre B-cell-like subtype and two (100%) patients with the non-germinal centre B-cell-like subtype had a complete response. R-CHOP did not affect pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib, and ibrutinib did not alter the pharmacokinetics of vincristine. Pharmacodynamic data showed Bruton's tyrosine kinase was fully occupied (>90% occupancy) at the recommended phase 2 dose.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Ibrutinib is well tolerated when added to R-CHOP, and could improve responses in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but our findings need confirmation in a phase 3 trial.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Janssen.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Oncology_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

In stage 1, we genotyped patient-level data from two UK cohorts (the Genetics of Asthma Severity and Phenotypes \\[GASP\\] initiative and the Unbiased BIOmarkers in PREDiction of respiratory disease outcomes \\[U-BIOPRED\\] project) and used data from the UK Biobank to collect patient-level genomic data for cases and controls of European ancestry in a 1:5 ratio. Cases were defined as having moderate-to-severe asthma if they were taking appropriate medication or had been diagnosed by a doctor. Controls were defined as not having asthma, rhinitis, eczema, allergy, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis as diagnosed by a doctor. For stage 2, an independent cohort of cases and controls (1:5) was selected from the UK Biobank only, with no overlap with stage 1 samples. In stage 1 we undertook a genome-wide association study of moderate-to-severe asthma, and in stage 2 we followed up independent variants that reached the significance threshold of p less than 1 × 10 −6 in stage 1. We set genome-wide significance at p less than 5 × 10 −8 . For novel signals, we investigated their effect on all types of asthma (mild, moderate, and severe). For all signals meeting genome-wide significance, we investigated their effect on gene expression in patients with asthma and controls.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We included 5135 cases and 25 675 controls for stage 1, and 5414 cases and 21 471 controls for stage 2. We identified 24 genome-wide significant signals of association with moderate-to-severe asthma, including several signals in innate or adaptive immune-response genes. Three novel signals were identified: rs10905284 in _GATA3_ (coded allele A, odds ratio \\[OR\\] 0·90, 95% CI 0·88–0·93; p=1·76 × 10 −10 ), rs11603634 in the _MUC5AC_ region (coded allele G, OR 1·09, 1·06–1·12; p=2·32 × 10 −8 ), and rs560026225 near _KIAA1109_ (coded allele GATT, OR 1·12, 1·08–1·16; p=3·06 × 10 −9 ). The _MUC5AC_ signal was not associated with asthma when analyses included mild asthma. The rs11603634 G allele was associated with increased expression of _MUC5AC_ mRNA in bronchial epithelial brush samples via proxy SNP rs11602802; (p=2·50 × 10 −5 ) and _MUC5AC_ mRNA was increased in bronchial epithelial samples from patients with severe asthma (in two independent analyses, p=0·039 and p=0·022).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】We found substantial shared genetic architecture between mild and moderate-to-severe asthma. We also report for the first time genetic variants associated with the risk of developing moderate-to-severe asthma that regulate mucin production. Finally, we identify candidate causal genes in these loci and provide increased insight into this difficult to treat population.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Asthma UK, AirPROM, U-BIOPRED, UK Medical Research Council, and Rosetrees Trust.\n\n【10】</u>Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Asthma is a common disease and was identified as the most prevalent chronic respiratory disease in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2015. 10–15% of individuals with asthma have severe asthma and substantial unmet clinical needs, with symptoms including debilitating breathlessness, associated frequent exacerbations, and increased hospital admissions despite the high use of medicines. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to disease risk, with genetic factors thought to account for 35–95% of the susceptibility to develop asthma. Previous genome-wide association studies have identified 38 regions of association with asthma, including signals in or near _PEX14, IL6R, PYHIN1_ (African American individuals only) _, ADAMTS4, CD247, TNFSF18, DENND1B, ADORA1, ID2, IL1RL1/IL18R1, D2HGDH, LPP, TLR1, USP38_ (Japanese individuals only), _PDE4D, TSLP/WDR36, RAD50/IL13, NDFIP1, GPX5, HLA-C/NOTCH4/HLA-DRB1/HLA-DQA1, GRM4, BACH2, CDHR3, SLC30A8_ (Japanese individuals only) _, ZBTB10, IL33, EQTN, GATA3, LRRC32, IKZF4, STAT6, RAD51B, RORA, SMAD3, CLEC16A, ERBB2/GSDMB/ORMDL3, ZNF652_ , and _IL2RB._ Asthma signals substantially overlap with signals reported in genome-wide association studies of self-reported allergy and allergic sensitisation—eg, _TLR1, WDR36, IL1RL1, SMAD3, STAT6, C11orf30_ (EMSY) _, IL1RL1_ , and _TLR1._ In a 2018 genome-wide association study of allergic disease and asthma, the authors showed a genetic correlation between asthma and allergic disease with evidence of specific loci being unique to asthma—eg, _ORMDL3_ .\n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【14】We searched the National Human Genome Research Institute-European Bioinformatic Institute Catalog of published genome-wide association studies from database inception to January, 2018, for studies that tested the association between genetic variants and asthma using the search term “asthma”, and manually searched the findings to identify studies that used a diagnosis of asthma to define cases. We examined the original publications and included studies with more than 500 cases and 500 controls and we considered signals of relevance to be those that met genome-wide significance (p<5 × 10 −8 ). These previous studies reported 38 regions associated, at genome-wide significance, with susceptibility to develop asthma, providing novel insight into disease biology. To date, only two genome-wide association studies have specifically investigated moderate-to-severe asthma; however, the power of these studies was restricted by the number of cases included (<1000).\n\n【15】**Added value of this study**\n\n【16】To our knowledge, this is the largest genetic study of moderate-to-severe asthma to date. We identified three novel genome-wide significant genetic associations that imply _MUC5AC, GATA3_ , and _KIAA1109_ have an association with susceptibility to the development of moderate-to-severe asthma. Altered expression of the pathogenic mucin _MUC5AC_ potentially contributes to mucus plugging and airway obstruction, _GATA3_ is a transcription factor linked to the T-cell response in asthma and eosinophilia, and the _KIAA1109_ locus has previously been associated with allergic sensitisation. We also describe and further characterise the contribution of 21 previously described asthma signals to this phenotype, and identify potential candidate causal genes.\n\n【17】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【18】Identification of genetic associations with variants in multiple genes of the innate or adaptive immune (type 2 inflammation) pathways suggest that targeting this pathway could be a therapeutic opportunity in moderate-to-severe asthma. The association identified between variants in the _MUC5AC_ locus adds to evidence of alterations in the airway epithelium and mucin dysregulation in more severe forms of asthma, and potentially supports specific targeting of _MUC5AC_ expression and induction in severe asthma. Identification of the _GATA3_ and _KIAA1109_ signals further extend the data that genetic variants in these regions are associated with asthma, potentially via eosinophilia and allergic sensitisation, two drivers of asthma that are also important in moderate-to-severe disease.\n\n【19】The concept of shared genetic origins between different allergic diseases has been tested in a large genome-wide association study with 180 129 cases (asthma, allergic rhinitis, or atopic dermatitis) and 180 709 controls. The study identified 99 genetic susceptibility loci, including 136 independent signals implicating genes involved predominantly in immune function, with only six signals showing some disease specificity—eg, _ORMDL3_ specific for asthma.\n\n【20】In the first genome-wide association study in severe or difficult to treat asthma, which used the Epidemiology and Natural History of Asthma: Outcomes and Treatment Regimes (TENOR) cohort, associations with known asthma loci were found—eg, with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the _RAD50/IL13_ and _HLA-DR/HLA-DQ_ regions. Similarly, the Asthma UK Genetics of Severe Asthma (AUGOSA) study of moderate-to-severe asthma replicated the known 17q21 association at _ORMDL3/GSDMB/ZPB2._ Neither study identified any new signals that met genome-wide significance, potentially because the number of cases was small. Therefore, we aimed to complete a large genome-wide association study of moderate-to-severe asthma to address three specific objectives: first, we aimed to identify novel signals predicting disease risk for moderate-to-severe asthma (as opposed to mild asthma); second, we wanted to see whether asthma signals that have been previously described were specifically associated with moderate-to-severe asthma; and finally, we aimed to translate genetic findings into disease mechanisms via initial functional studies using the Unbiased BIOmarkers in PREDiction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) integrated asthma patient genomics resource, which might in turn identify new targets for therapeutic intervention.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Study design and participants\n\n【23】In this genome-wide association study, we used a two-stage design to identify novel and significant genome-wide associations that confer susceptibility to moderate-to-severe asthma. We used a two-stage case-control design, with variants that showed suggestive association (p<1 × 10 −6 ) in stage 1 tested in stage 2 and then meta-analysed across the two stages to maximise power.\n\n【24】For stage 1, we selected individuals of European ancestry with moderate-to-severe asthma who had been recruited from primary and secondary care settings across the UK as part of the Genetics of Asthma Severity and Phenotypes (GASP) initiative, with additional cases included from the U-BIOPRED asthma cohort and the UK Biobank May, 2015, genetic data release 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. Genotyped data were assessed for quality control 删除2:<u>(details are in the appendix )</u>. From GASP and U-BIOPRED, we identified patients with moderate-to-severe asthma by assessing clinical records that indicated that a patient was taking medication required for patients defined as having moderate-to-severe asthma according to the British Thoracic Society (BTS) 2014 guidelines. From the UK Biobank, cases of moderate-to-severe asthma were defined as having asthma diagnosed by a doctor, taking medication for asthma, no diagnosis of emphysema or chronic bronchitis by a doctor, and meeting the definition of moderate-to-severe asthma by BTS criteria. Therefore, cases were selected from individuals for whom medication information was available and who met BTS stage 3–5 criteria—ie, for stage 3, taking a long-acting β 2 agonist plus inhaled corticosteroid; stage 4, taking higher dose inhaled corticosteroids than stage 3 patients, and addition of a fourth drug (eg, leukotriene receptor antagonist, theophylline); and stage 5, taking oral corticosteroid or omalizumab, or both. A complete list of medications used to identify patients with moderate-to-severe asthma is in the appendix . Controls for stage 1 were identified from the UK Biobank by taking the remaining subjects for whom genotyped data were available that passed quality control and excluding individuals with asthma, rhinitis, eczema, allergy, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis as diagnosed by a doctor, or if medication data were not available to assign to either the mild-moderate or moderate-severe asthma group. Additional controls for stage 1 were included from U-BIOPRED to ensure we had controls from each cohort. Patients in the U-BIOPRED cohort had not been screened for rhinitis or eczema, and so this information was not available for these controls at time of selection. For stage 2, both cases and controls were selected from the UK Biobank May, 2017, release using the same criteria to define cases and controls as in stage 1. There was no overlap in the patients included in stage 1 and stage 2. A case-control ratio of 1:5 was chosen for both stages to balance power and computational time. Cases and controls were matched across age and sex strata, and in stage 1 across genotyping arrays. All cohorts included individuals with self-reported European ancestry; individuals of non-European ancestry were excluded to reduce confounding of the study by ancestry.\n\n【25】UK Biobank has ethical approval from the UK National Health Service (NHS) National Research Ethics Service (Ref 11/NW/0382). All other studies were approved by an appropriate ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\n【26】### Procedures\n\n【27】In stage 1, cases and controls were genotyped using the Affymetrix Axiom (Affymetrx, Santa Clara, CA, USA) UK BiLEVE array and the later-generation Affymetrix Axiom UK Biobank array, which are 95% identical in content. In stage 2, only the later-generation Affymetrix Axiom UK Biobank array was used. If the sentinel SNP from stage 1 was not available in stage 2, a proxy was chosen with the highest linkage disequilibrium to the sentinel SNP. Genotyping and imputation procedures are described in the appendix . After imputation using UK10K Project and 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 reference panels, 33 771 858 SNPs were available for association testing in stage 1 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>.\n\n【28】### Statistical analysis\n\n【29】Descriptive statistics of baseline characteristics were compared using a χ 2 test to check for imbalances in comorbidities, smoking, and oral corticosteroid use between cases in stage 1 and 2. Our sample sizes were determined by the number of moderate-to-severe cases in each cohort for each stage. We then collected data for an excess of potenial controls and used a ratio of 1:5 cases to controls to maximise the power of our study.\n\n【30】For stage 1, we used a logistic model of association to determine genome-wide associations for susceptibility to moderate-to-severe asthma and assumed an additive genetic model of asthma status with imputed genotype dose fitted (effect allele count continuous over the range 0–2 to reflect uncertainty in genotype imputation) using SNPTEST version 2.5, adjusted for ancestry using the first ten principal components of genotypic variance derived by EIGENSOFT 6.1.4. In stage 1, we used conditional analyses (Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis version 1.26.0 ) to identify additional independent signals in the same loci (passing the same threshold of p<1× 10 −6 as for the unconditional analysis) and we did a sensitivity analysis to check for array effects. In stage 2, we followed up independent variants that reached the p value significance threshold of less than 1 × 10 −6 in stage 1 association testing.\n\n【31】Variants with p<1 × 10 −6 in stage 1 were then meta-analysed across stage 1 and stage 2 using inverse-variance weighted meta-analyses. Variants with the same direction of effect in stages 1 and 2, with a genome-wide significant association (ie, p<5 × 10 −8 ) in the meta-analyses of stages 1 and 2 and a p value of less than 0·05 in stage 2, were included in further analyses. We used a Bonferroni correction for the number of putative novel signals as the threshold for independent replication in stage 2. We controlled for age and sex by selecting cases and controls with similar age and sex distributions. Ancestry was controlled by selecting European samples and including ten principal components as covariates. To avoid missing data, we only included samples with complete phenotype, age, sex and covariate data.\n\n【32】Because we excluded patients with allergic disease from the controls in stage 1 and 2, we could potentially have inflated shared genetic signals associated with allergic comorbidities in the asthma population. Hence, we also did a sensitivity analysis that included stage 2 cases and controls including individuals with rhinitis, eczema, and allergy.\n\n【33】To investigate whether novel variants we identified as associated with moderate-to-severe asthma showed an association with susceptibility to all types of asthma (mild, moderate, and severe), we interrogated a large genome-wide association study of asthma, which included 28 399 cases of self-reported asthma and 128 843 controls. We also investigated SNPs previously associated with asthma and allergic diseases at genome-wide significance (p<5 × 10 −8 ) in our stage 1 dataset.\n\n【34】For all signals we determined to have a genome-wide significant association with moderate-to-severe asthma, we investigated the lead SNP 删除2:<u>(and SNPs in linkage disequilibrium—ie, r 2 \\>0·4)</u> for association with mRNA levels in cells and tissues using expression quantitative loci (eQTL) datasets. For lung tissue we used an eQTL database with data for 1110 subjects, and for blood cells we used an eQTL database with data for 5311 subjects, and we used a 10% false discovery rate for eQTLs for these two databases. To complement these resources, we used five additional U-BIOPRED eQTL datasets for blood (n=345), sputum (n=91), bronchial biopsy samples (n=84), bronchial brushing (n=117), and nasal brushing (n=75), and for these datasets we used a 5% false discovery rate 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. For the U-BIOPRED cohort, DNA from whole blood was extracted and genotyped as outlined and after imputation 删除2:<u>(SHAPEIT2 for pre-phasing and IMPUTE 2, using 1000 Genome Phase 3 as reference panel)</u> and quality control, 2 536 796 SNPs were available for association testing. Transcriptomic analysis was done with the Affymetrix HT HG-U133 1 PM GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, Calif) on extracted RNA from the different samples. When the sentinel SNP was not available we used a proxy with the highest linkage disequilibrium. We considered an association signal meeting the designated false discovery rate for any dataset to be of interest.\n\n【35】For novel signals for which an eQTL effect was observed, we investigated the expression of proteins in human lung tissue using Protein Atlas to identify relevant airway cell types for further study. We also investigated mRNA levels in patients with severe asthma using two gene expression omnibus datasets to see if altered expression is a feature of these patients compared with patients with mild asthma, which might imply a mechanistic role in moderate-to-severe disease, 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. GSE43696 includes Agilent Human GE 4×44K V2 Gene Expression data for bronchial epithelial cells from 20 controls, 50 patients with mild asthma, and 38 patients with severe asthma. GSE89809 contains Affymetrix HT HG-U133+ PM GeneChip data for 18 controls, and 14 patients with mild asthma, 13 with moderate asthma, and 11 with severe asthma. The definition of asthma severity was different between these studies. In GSE43696, patients with mild-to-moderate asthma had a predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s of less than 60%, with or without a low-to-moderate dose of inhaled corticosteroids, and patients with severe asthma were defined as having continuous use of high-dose inhaled corticosteroids or frequent use of oral corticosteroids, or both, with continuing symptoms or chronic airflow limitations. In GSE89809, patients with mild asthma were defined as taking β 2 agonists alone, those with moderate asthma as taking inhaled corticosteroids, and those with severe asthma had persistent symptoms despite taking high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and oral corticosteroids. Both of these studies defined patients as having moderate-to-severe asthma by use of medication, and so comparable definitions were used between these genome-wide association studies and our study. Robust multi-array average data was extracted from these datasets for _KIAA1109_ and _MUC5AC_ and expression was compared across groups (Kruskal-Wallace test).\n\n【36】To provide insight into the disease mechanism, we investigated lead SNPs 删除2:<u>(and SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with r 2 \\>0·4)</u> at the novel loci using the HaploReg version 4 resource and the deep-learning functional prediction resource DeepSEA. We used GRASP and a GWAS catalog to identify whether any variants in linkage disequilibrium with the three novel signals had previously been reported in genome-wide association studies of other diseases or quantitative outcomes.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【37】The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. IS and LVW had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n【38】</u>Results\n-------\n\n【39】For the stage 1 analyses, after genotyping of the GASP and U-BIOPRED cohorts and using available data from the UK BioBank (May, 2015, release), data were available for 5135 moderate-to-severe asthma cases, (GASP n=1858, U-BIOPRED n=281, and UK Biobank n=2996), and 25 675 controls 删除2:<u>(U-BIOPRED n=75, and UK Biobank n=25 600; figure 1 )</u>. For the independent stage 2 cohort, 5414 cases and 21 471 controls were selected from the UK Biobank (May, 2017, release) after excluding the cases and controls in stage 1.

The third signal included an indel (rs560026225, proxy in stage 2 rs72687036) in a locus covering _KIAA1109_ (coded allele GATT, OR 1·12, 1·08–1·16; p=3·06 × 10 −9 ). rs10905284 ( _GATA3_ ) is a novel signal for asthma independent from previously described signals in the _GATA3_ region for asthma—eg, rs10508372, rs2589561, and rs12413578.

Using DeepSEA, the moderate-to-severe asthma risk allele (G) at the sentinel SNP rs11603634 near _MUC5AC_ was predicted to result in a log 2 fold change of more than 1·5 in function at Forkhead Box A1 (FOXA1) and Forkhead Box A2 (FOXA2) binding sites in airway epithelium 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. For the rs10905284 ( _GATA3_ ), the asthma risk allele (C; proxy rs3802597; r 2 \\=0·93) had an effect on upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF1) and 2 (USF2) binding in various cell types, including airway epithelium 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. rs560026225 ( _KIAA1109_ ; proxy rs17389644; r 2 \\=0·57) had a functional effect on a DNase hypersensitivity site in human microvascular endothelial and human umbilical vein endothelial cell types 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>.\n\n【68】GRASP and GWAS catalog analyses of the three novel signals, and variants in linkage disequilibrium identified genome-wide significant associations. The rs560026225 ( _KIAA1109_ ) asthma risk allele (GATT; allele associated with increased risk of moderate-to-severe asthma) was associated with risk of allergic sensitisation (proxy rs17454584, with the rs560026225 GATT allele correlated with rs17454584 G allele), the rs10905284 ( _GATA3_ ) asthma risk allele (C) was associated with an increased number of eosinophils in the blood, and the rs11603634 ( _MUC5AC_ ) asthma risk allele (G; proxy rs4077759, rs11603634 G allele correlated with rs4077759 T allele) was associated with risk of pulmonary fibrosis 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>.\n\n【69】Discussion\n----------\n\n【70】To our knowledge, we present the largest genetic-association study of moderate-to-severe asthma to date, with 10 549 cases and 47 146 controls, identifying 24 signals that reach genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis of stages 1 and 2. 21 (88%) of 24 signals have previously been reported in studies that predominantly assessed samples from patients with mild asthma, suggesting a substantial shared genetic architecture between mild and moderate-to-severe asthma. Our findings suggest that additional factors might drive the development of more severe forms of asthma—eg, environmental exposures or epigenetics, and the presence of comorbidities. We also provide increased insight into the identification of candidate casual genes in many of these loci, including several genes associated with type 2 inflammation. Three signals we identify here have not previously been reported for asthma in genome-wide association studies: rs11603634 in the _MUC5AC_ region (coded allele G, frequency 50·4%, risk), rs1090584 in _GATA3_ (coded allele A, frequency 57·06%, protective), and rs560026225 (coded allele GATT, frequency 23·60%, risk) in a locus covering _KIAA1109._ The rs11603634 signal is specific to moderate-to-severe asthma and we identified that _MUC5AC_ is increased in bronchial epithelial cells of carriers of the risk allele, with _MUC5B_ being decreased in carriers of the risk allele, albeit not reaching our significance threshold. This genotype specific expression might be caused by alterations in FOXA transcription activity. For the _GATA3_ and _KIAA1109_ signals we saw an association with all asthma, while _GATA3_ has been previously reported to be associated with increased concentrations of blood eosinophil and _KIAA1109_ has been reported as being associated with self-reported allergy. Therefore, we provide additional insight into the genetic architecture of moderate-to-severe asthma and we report the first evidence that genetic variants associated with the risk of developing moderate-to-severe asthma regulate mucin production.\n\n【71】In this study, we identified 21 previously reported signals as being associated with asthma, including some previously associated with asthma that is severe or difficult to treat: _RAD50_ and _HLA-DR/HLA-DQ_ , and _17q21_ ( _ORMDL3/GSDMB/ZPB2_ ). Using eQTL analyses, we identified candidate causal genes for moderate-to-severe asthma; however, the level of evidence for each potential candidate gene based on linkage disequilibrium with sentinel SNP, relevant tissue and cell type, and statistical significance varied from highly supportive to suggestive. Overall, these signals highlight the role of innate and adaptive immunity and type 2 inflammation in moderate-to-severe asthma including: _CD247_ , which encodes T-cell receptor ζ; trans-acting T-cell specific transcription factor GATA-3 (GATA3), an important transcription factor in T cells; interleukin-18 receptor 1 (IL18R1) and interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1), receptors for key cytokines interleukin-18 and interlukin-33, respectively; thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which drives type 2 inflammation; human leukocyte antigen genes that encode the major histocompatibility complex; transcription regulator protein BACH2 (BACH2), a transcriptional regulator in type 2 inflammation; interleukin-33 (IL33), an innate cytokine; and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6), a signalling molecule downstream of interleukin 4 and 13, which are drivers of type 2 inflammation. The other genes identified highlight roles in homoeostasis of airway cells, including D-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (D2HGDH), which regulates α-ketoglutarate concentrations, influencing histone and DNA methylation; sodium/hydrogen exchanger 2 (SLC9A2), a sodium-hydrogen exchanger involved in the regulation of cell pH and volume; inhibitor of growth protein 5 (ING5), a transcription factor involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition; DNA repair protein RAD50 (RAD50), which is involved in DNA double-strand break repair; solute carrier family 22 member 5 (SLC22A5), an organic cation transporter with a role in epithelial cells; protein CLEC16A (CLEC16A), a regulator of autophagy; gasdermin-B (GSDMB), which is linked with airway smooth-muscle contraction; and ORM1-like protein 3 (ORMDL3), which is linked with airway remodelling.\n\n【72】This is the first report, to our knowledge, of the _MUC5AC_ locus being specifically associated with increased susceptibility to development of moderate-to-severe asthma in a genome-wide association study. We showed this association in both stages 1 and 2 of our investigation, and in our meta-analyses; however, the higher severity of asthma in the cases (and associated power) in stage 1 than among those in stage 2 could explain the different significance levels between the stages—ie, cases in stage 1 had lower lung function than those in stage 2 and reported higher use of oral corticosteroids than those in stage 2. The proportion of cases with allergic comorbidities (allergic rhinitis or eczema, or both) or smoking history did not differ significantly between stages 1 and 2. The association between the asthma risk allele (G) of rs11603634 and increased concentrations of _MUC5AC_ mRNA in bronchial epithelial brush samples, and the predicted effect on FOXA transcription factors provide putative mechanisms because FOXA2 regulates mucin-5AC (MUC5AC) production. We found this eQTL association to be the most significant for _MUC5AC_ in the bronchial epithelial cell dataset. This signal of moderate-to-severe asthma has also previously been identified as associated with pulmonary fibrosis (proxy rs4077759, r 2 \\=0·42); however, rs11603634 reported in our study and rs35705950 (the main idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis signal) are not in linkage disequilibrium (r 2 \\=0·01), suggesting distinct signals. Similarly, the signal we reported is independent from that reported (rs1132440) in a candidate gene study for asthma. We also identified an association between rs11603634 on _MUC5B_ mRNA levels in bronchial epithelial brush samples, with carriers of risk alleles having lower concentrations than those who are not carriers, although this association did not meet our significance threshold. MUC5AC protein concentrations are increased in the sputum of patients with asthma during exacerbations compared with patients with stable asthma and controls, whereas concentrations of mucin-5B (MUC5B) are decreased among patients with asthma—ie, alterations in the ratio of MUC5AC to MUC5B are a feature of asthma. This altered ratio of MUC5AC to MUC5B in asthma might be partially explained by the opposite effect of our novel asthma risk allele (G) of rs11603634 on MUC5AC and MUC5B production. MUC5AC has pathogenic roles and has been linked to airway hyper-responsiveness and mucus plugging during exacerbation. _MUC5AC_ deficient mice develop allergic airway disease; however, the severity and abundance of mucus plugging is attenuated. Loss of MUC5B in a mouse knock-out study led to airway inflammation, suggesting a role in homoeostasis. Overall, these data suggest targeting of specific mucins could be a therapeutic opportunity for moderate-to-severe asthma.\n\n【73】The _KIAA1109_ (rs72687036) novel signal we identified has previously been associated with self-reported allergy and allergic sensitisation, type 1 diabetes, ulcerative colitis, mean platelet volume, and with allergic disease (asthma, hayfever, allergic rhinitis, or eczema). The region is rich in candidate genes (eg, _IL2_ and _IL21_ ); however, our eQTL data suggest that the potential causal gene is _KIAA1109_ . Little is known about _KIAA1109_ . Mice deficient in _KIAA1109_ have preweaning lethality ( International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium ) and a suggested role in synaptic vesicle recycling in Drosophila has been identified.\n\n【74】The third novel signal we identified, rs1090584 in _GATA3_ , asthma risk allele C, is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis (proxy rs3824660; r 2 \\=0·86) and increased concentrations of blood eosinophils, a known effector cell in asthma. This signal has been associated with allergic disease (asthma, hayfever, allergic rhinitis, or eczema). The rs1090584 signal in _GATA3_ identified in this study is independent to those previously described for asthma, including rs10508372 in Japanese individuals, rs2589561 in European or multi-ancestry individuals, and rs12413578 in European individuals. The second signal in _GATA3_ (rs61840192) we report is in linkage disequilibrium with rs12413578 and rs2589561 (r 2 \\=0·16). These data suggest that multiple genetic signals within the _GATA3_ locus might contribute to asthma. We identified potential effects of rs1090584 on USF1 and USF2 in airway cells; however, we did not identify an eQTL association. USF1 is important in regulating GATA family genes, including _GATA5_ . GATA3 is a transcriptional regulator associated with differentiation—eg, in type-2 innate lymphoid cell differentiation, an effector cell in type 2 inflammation.\n\n【75】We also investigated all previously reported asthma signals to date, with general replication of previous results. The previously described signals that did not replicate in our dataset were associated with a specific asthma phenotype (eg, _PDE4D_ and mild-to-moderate childhood asthma with bronchial hyper-responsiveness ) or were reported in people of non-European ancestry (eg, _NOTCH4_ ). The effect sizes for previously described asthma signals in stage 1 of this moderate-to-severe asthma cohort (OR range 1·08–1·24) are comparable with those reported in large studies of asthma. Similarly, we investigated allergic disease signals identified in two large genome-wide association studies, and found a large proportion of these signals were associated with moderate-to-severe asthma; however, our case-control design used moderate-to-severe asthma cases and controls excluding individuals with asthma, rhinitis, eczema, and allergy diagnosed by a doctor, and so the ability to identify genetic signals associated with allergic comorbidities in the asthma population will be enhanced compared with these previous studies.\n\n【76】Our study had several limitations. Regarding the design of the study, we considered alternative approaches when planning the analysis, such as using patients with mild asthma as the control group. However, we opted to compare patients with moderate-to-severe asthma with healthy controls in the initial discovery analysis because we felt that this comparison would minimise the risk of misclassification between mild and moderate asthma and so be a more powerful strategy for a genetic study. We included a large genome-wide association study of asthma to specifically address the issue of specificity of the signals we found in our cohort to moderate-to-severe asthma. Cases in stage 1 have more severe asthma than those in stage 2 because patients from GASP and U-BIOPRED in stage 1 were predominantly recruited from secondary care. This potential difference between cases in stage 1 and 2 might have contributed to the attenuated association with, for example, the _MUC5AC_ signal in the stage 2 cohort; however, this difference also potentially provided additional power for stage 1. We also acknowledge that we defined asthma severity on the basis of medication use alone and additional measures including symptoms, exacerbation frequency, and other markers would have enhanced the definition, although these data were not available. Importantly, all cases in our analyses required a doctor diagnosis of asthma for inclusion before stratification on the basis of medication. Severe asthma is defined by the requirement for high dose of inhaled corticosteroid or maintenance oral corticosteroid, with persistent poor control or a high risk of developing poor control if these therapies are stepped down. Similarly, the Global Initiative for Asthma treatment steps are used as surrogates of severity. Thus, using the treatment step as a measure of severity is in keeping with current guidelines and has the advantage that it provides maximum sample sizes because medication data are available for a greater number of patients than, for instance, symptom scores. Additionally, for cases who were prescribed oral corticosteroids, we did not undertake individual case reviews to exclude the possibility that some patients might have been receiving oral corticosteroids for other comorbid conditions, and we did not record additional information on current asthma control or exacerbation frequency, which would have been informative. Advances in imputation mean that the widely used threshold for genome-wide significance of a p value of less than 5 × 10 −8 , historically defined on the basis of 1 million independent tests, could be considered too lenient for an analysis of 33 million SNPs (representing >1 million independent tests). Had we applied a threshold p value of less than 5 × 10 −9 , recommended as an appropriate threshold for studies of whole-genome sequence data from European populations, the signals at _GATA3_ (p=1·76 × 10 −10 ) and _KIAA1109_ (p=3·06 × 10 −9 ) would still have been significant. Overall, the _MUC5AC_ signal was weaker in terms of significance compared with other signals identified—eg, in stage 2, this signal only met nominal significance not Bonferroni correction and was just within the threshold for genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis. Finally, asthma is a complex disease involving both genetic and environmental influences and we have not formally assessed the role of the environment, which could be critical for the development of more severe asthma. Accumulating data suggest a role for several factors in the development of severe disease (eg, comorbidities such as atopic dermatitis in severe asthma and environmental or epigenetic mechanisms ) but further work is needed.\n\n【77】In summary, to our knowledge, this is the largest genome-wide association study of moderate-to-severe asthma published to date, in which we have identified that the genetic architecture of moderate-to-severe asthma is similar to mild disease, three novel genome-wide significant associations, and potential candidate causal genes underlying these signals. These findings provide new understanding for this difficult to treat population and adds to the accumulating evidence that strategies to target mucins might have therapeutic value. Similarly, our findings add to evidence that targeting type 2 inflammation in asthma could be particularly useful for moderate-to-severe asthma, potentially in carriers of genetic variants in genes of relevance to innate or adaptive immunity.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【78】IS and LVW designed and supervised the study.

Although no single cause of AD has been identified, recent research has suggested that several pathogenetic factors influence risk and expression. A growing amount of evidence underscores a mechanistic link between cholesterol metabolism in the brain and the formation of amyloid plaques. Excess brain cholesterol has been associated with increased formation and deposition of amyloid-β peptide from amyloid precursor protein. Cholesterol-lowering statins have become a focus of research in AD. Genetic polymorphisms associated with pivotal points in cholesterol metabolism in brain tissues may contribute to the risk and pathogenesis of AD. In this review, we summarise current knowledge of the role of cholesterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of AD and examine the potential of statins in the prevention and treatment of AD.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet Neurology_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

They cite E-cadherin as their key example of an immunological mediator that is selected against in metastatic selection.\n\n【2】That tumours excite immune responses and that the cancer mutator phenotype subsequently militates against this specific selection pressure is well accepted. However, the development of general metastatic properties derived through adaptation against immune responses is less plausible. Although controversial, findings in various settings of immunosuppression suggest an increase in invasive tumours, especially those dependent on viral triggers.\n\n【3】The most potent driving force for metastasis seems to be the enormous selection pressure to escape the nest of rapidly proliferating cells in the competition for nutrients. Angiogenesis, a key tumour characteristic, is driven by hypoxic drive. Studies of metastatic cells have noted that molecule expression lost during invasion is reversed on arrival in suitable tissues. This finding implicates local rather than systemic forces in determining the metastatic phenotype. Although they suggest that E-cadherin downregulation may reduce immune response, there are many other reasons for this change. For example, E-cadherin allows cells to detach and escape the masses of competing cancer cells, and has been implicated in the tumour-suppression pathway mediated by antigen-presenting cells.\n\n【4】Immunoprivileged sites generate fewer metastasising cancers. However, cells from these environments have unusual fundamental properties, such as reduced proliferation, and support from the blood-brain and blood-testis barrier may account for these differences. When these barriers are artificially overcome, as occurs in ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion, bypassing of the blood-brain barrier allows tumour to spread.\n\n【5】If immune responses do contribute to metastatic selection, identification of the specific aspects and patterns of the immune response that are significant will be important, not least because of the implications of the findings to cancer vaccines and immunotherapy. There may be a U-shaped dependence on the immune response, which is detrimental at its most hostile and hospitable and drives selection or allows neoplastic proclivities. The intermediate response may be protective. Genetic predispositions that misdirect immune responses (eg, towards T-helper type 1 responses or genetic polymorphisms in cytokine promoters) or coincidental environmental stimuli, such as tuberculosis infections, may also be crucial in tumour immune responses.\n\n【6】Seymour and colleagues suggest the use of transplanted tumours to study tumour development in concert with immune response. Unfortunately, it may prove difficult to control for other active selective forces such as cellular competition in these settings. Instead, it may be more helpful to subject tumours to varying immunological selective pressures, which can be generated by subjecting uninvasive metastatic cells to activated immune cells that are collected and purified from the tumour sites or draning lymph nodes. If the hypothesis is accurate, cancers would develop more rapidly when subjected to more powerful selecting forces, and hence more powerful immune responses. This effect could be enhanced genetically by selectively modifying responses to specific tumours—eg, by knocking out or upregulating specific T-cell receptors or cytokines.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Since most physicians regularly complete CME hours, conflicts of interest that could introduce bias into CME must be avoided to prevent potentially detrimental downstream effects on patient care. However, joint provider activities, which can be undertaken between accredited providers of CME activities and medical education and communication companies (MECCs), raise serious concerns since they are a source of industry (such as pharmaceutical or device companies) influence on CME that circumvents regulatory oversight. Mitigating the risks arising from joint provider activities is needed to preserve the integrity of the CME process. We hope by bringing these new partnerships to light we can refocus attention on hidden conflicts of interest in CME activities.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

There are too many open questions about wound classification, treatment details, and even wording that need clarification.\n\n【1】In a preliminary report of the same study, the foot lesions included in the study were called “complex ulcers” without mentioning previous amputation, whereas in the present paper they are called “complex wounds” due to “amputation at the metatarsal level”. What does “complex” mean? Armstrong and Lavery write that “all wounds corresponded to University of Texas grade 2 and 3 in depth”. This system neatly discerns grades 0–3 and A–D, respectively, accounting for the severity of infection, ischaemia, and outcome. How were wound grades and stages distributed among the NPWT and control groups?\n\n【2】Armstrong and Lavery do not indicate the causes and extent of amputations. It can be inferred from the clinical characteristics of the patients that most amputations had been done because of osteomyelitis or wet gangrene; however, this remains to be stated. Likewise, analyses should include how many resections of how many rays, and how many transmetatarsal forefoot amputations were done.\n\n【3】What was the use of antibiotics throughout the study, and what were the swab results?\n\n【4】More clarification of the adverse events is needed: we are told that 40 NPWT patients and 46 controls had adverse events, of whom 25 NPWT patients and 27 controls had infections, and nine NPWT patients and 11 controls had a treatment-related adverse event. These figures leave six NPWT patients and eight controls with unclear adverse events.\n\n【5】The basis of the power calculation is not given: why was a 26% amputation rate in the control group assumed when a previous study using the same off-loading device has shown an amputation rate of only 5%? These unexplained questions cast substantial doubts on the validity of the presented data.\n\n【6】删除9:<u>I declare that I have no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Studies have consistently shown a small but significant correlation between birthweight in the normal range and childhood cognitive ability. However, only two studies have investigated whether this correlation persists into older age, showing no significant effect. The aim of this investigation was to assess whether factors early in life (birthweight, gestational age, parity, antenatal complications, neonatal complications, and social group), affect cognition in childhood and whether these effects persist.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】The Aberdeen 1936 Birth Cohort (ABC1936) is a longitudinal study of cognitive ageing in a well-characterised cohort of individuals born in 1936 (n=506 of 658 alive and resident in Aberdeen, were recruited in 2000). The study is ongoing with wave 4 of testing completed in 2011 (n=216). Only wave 1 (baseline) data are presented here. In wave 1, participants underwent a battery of cognitive and physical tests at age 64–66 years. Results for Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), a test of non-verbal reasoning, are reported here. The test was administered by a trained research nurse and individuals had 20 min to complete as many of the multiple choice problems as possible. All 658 individuals invited to participate in ABC1936 had IQ measured with the Moray House Test when aged 11 years as part of the nationwide Scottish Mental Survey 1947. Some were born in hospital, and therefore had prospectively obtained data available for perinatal effects. Birth data were obtained for all hospital births in Aberdeen in 1936 (n=1250). Results are reported for individuals who had birth data, IQ at age 11 years, and IQ at age 64–66 years available. Associations between cognitive ability scores (at both ages) and potential predictors (sex, social group at birth, birthweight, gestational age, parity, antenatal or neonatal complications) were tested. Factors significantly associated with cognitive ability (p<0·1) were included in multivariate regression models for the prediction of childhood IQ and RPM scores.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of participants with childhood IQ available, 140 (21%) had birth data available. Of those, 108 (77%) had IQ scores at age 64–66 years. Mean IQ scores did not differ between those with birth data and those without at either age 11 years (with birth data, mean 38·3 \\[SD 13·8\\]; without birth data, mean 40·3 \\[14·0\\]; p=0·06) or age 64–66 years (with birth data, mean 34·7 \\[8·2\\]; without birth data, mean 35·8 \\[8·8\\]; p=0·21). Birthweight was not significantly correlated with childhood cognitive ability ( _r_ \\=0·07; p=0·39). Multivariate regression analysis showed that low perinatal social group (unskilled manual work compared with others; β=–0·23; p=0·007) and increased parity (β=–0·21; p=0·015) were associated with decreased test scores in childhood (adjusted R 2 \\=0·09). Neither birthweight ( _r_ \\=–0·003; p=0·77) nor perinatal social group (p=0·56) were significantly associated with RPM scores. In older age, increased childhood cognitive test scores (β=0·47; p<0·0001) and male sex (β=0·31; p<0·0001) were associated with improved performance (adjusted R 2 \\=0·35).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In this fairly small cohort, birthweight and childhood or older age IQ were not associated. Childhood IQ was predicted by social group and parity, and was the main predictor of older age IQ. Longitudinal data from more than six decades, including prospectively recorded birth data, are rare. The reasons for differences between this cohort and others in Scotland and worldwide should be explored, and could include cohort effects, residual confounding factors, and selection bias. Early-life programming of cognitive function is not a significant determinant in this cohort.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】The Alzheimer's Research Trust funded data collection during wave 1 of ABC1936; RLS is funded by an NRS Career Researcher Fellowship.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】EA contributed to transcribing and collecting historical data, data analysis, interpretation, and writing.

Nerve conduction studies indicated a sensory-motor axonal neuropathy. Extensive assessment did not show alternative explanations for her neuropathy. At the time of death 1 month after discontinuing linezolid, the neuropathy had not resolved. A review of published material shows a growing body of evidence that long-term use of linezolid may be associated with severe peripheral and optic neuropathy. 21 cases have been reported. In most cases, optic neuropathies resolved after stopping linezolid but peripheral neuropathies did not. The duration of therapy rather than indication for treatment seems to be the most important factor. The mechanism of toxicity is unknown but certain pharmacological properties of linezolid that may play a part are proposed. This report highlights the importance of post-approval surveillance and reporting of serious adverse drug effects, and potential consequences of off-label use of pharmaceuticals. It further demonstrates the critical role clinicians have in communicating awareness of emerging drug toxicities.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is postulated to induce preterm labor. Routine antenatal screening for ASB using urine culture is not feasible in most developing countries due to long turn-around time, user-unfriendliness, and lack of resources. The current parallel-group superiority pragmatic randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of screening and evidence-based treatment of ASB using an optical-sensor-based point-of-care rapid-test on the incidence of preterm birth and low birthweight (LBW).\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】240 consenting asymptomatic pregnant women visiting an Indian tertiary public hospital for first antenatal check-up, irrespective of trimester/gravida, who had not consumed antibiotics in the preceding week, were enrolled from February-May 2017. Computer-generated concealed simple randomization allocation sequence was used to assign participants to intervention (120) and control arm (120). Usual hospital-care was provided in the control arm. In the intervention arm, urine samples were additionally screened for ASB using the rapid-test and the positive women were prescribed susceptible antibiotics.

The alternative tests tried in the past to screen ASB could not provide identification and antibiotic susceptibility test (ID & AST) and did not possess characteristics suitable for screening mass population, namely, rapidity, validity, user-friendliness, and affordability. No study had measured the effectiveness of a point-of-care test on reduction of preterm birth and low birthweight (LBW) in a real-life situation.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】The study showed the effectiveness of use of a rapid point-of-care test during antenatal checkup in reducing preterm birth and LBW by informing clinicians regarding ID & AST for ASB within four hours. The study also proved feasibility of using a rapid, user-friendly, affordable, and valid test for mass screening of ASB in pregnant women.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】The rapid point-of-care test evaluated in this study can be used for mass screening of ASB in pregnant women in low resource settings so as to provide evidence-based prescription to pregnant women instead of empirical antibiotics. This can also reduce antimicrobial resistance. The confirmation of test results can be done using conventional urine culture, but the patient need not wait for up to 72 h for initiation of effective therapy using antibiotics.\n\n【19】1\\. Introduction\n----------------\n\n【20】Pregnant women are susceptible to colonization of the urinary tract like asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), or urogenital infections, such as bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and urinary tract infections (UTI), which co-exist in many cases 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. As a result of the biochemical mechanisms operating in these conditions 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>, the women may experience preterm labor. Preterm birth and its consequent complications contribute 50% of 3·1 million neonatal deaths world-wide annually, while it is also noteworthy that India contributes 23% of the world's annual premature deliveries 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Of all the deaths caused by low birth weight (LBW)/prematurity, more than 70% occur during the first week of life, highlighting the importance of continuum of care starting from the early antenatal period to the early neonatal period 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Even if the babies survive after preterm birth, its long-term adverse effects related to visual, hearing, neuro-development, behavior, psychiatric issues, learning disability, lung maturity and cardiovascular health continue in most of them throughout life, also burdening their families and health system due to the need of the long-term special care 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【21】The progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) target 3·2 of reducing preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u> has been slower due to multiple factors including lack of cause-specific solutions 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Since preterm birth contributes to majority of these deaths, and the proportion of deaths due to LBW/prematurity has remained high in spite of intensive efforts done during antenatal care 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, focusing on the preventable causes of preterm birth such as ASB is a promising solution. Out of ASB-affected pregnancies, which account for nearly 1·9 to 9·5% of 213 million estimated pregnancies in a year worldwide 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, around 8·6% to 13·6% end in preterm birth, while 6·9% to 20·5% end in LBW 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Early diagnosis and treatment of ASB can reduce preterm birth among these pregnancies by 73%, and LBW by 36% 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, which extrapolate to potentially reduce 0·25 to 2 million preterm births and 0·1 to 1·5 million LBW babies globally and 57,375 to 453,660 preterm births and 22,701 to 337,229 LBW in India every year.\n\n【22】Antenatal check-ups provide an opportunity to detect ASB. Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u> and United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u> recommend urine culture for screening every pregnant woman for ASB at least once between 12 and 16-weeks’ gestation or during the first antenatal visit. Most pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) like India attend antenatal check-ups in low resource healthcare facilities in rural areas, which suffer from wide disparity in availability and accessibility to health infrastructure and diagnostic testing facilities, and fail to provide screening for ASB as per the recommendations 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Conventional urine culture is not suitable for this purpose considering the need for specific resources, dedicated infrastructure, trained personnel, and long turnaround time 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. USPSTF suggested to develop a new technology for rapid screening to reduce the dependence on conventional urine culture and improve the outcomes of such pregnancies 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Similar use of rapid point-of-care tests in primary care has been found to be beneficial for many infectious diseases due to availability of bedside results in a short turnaround time in remote areas with limited infrastructure 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Several tests have been tried to screen ASB but none of them provided identification of bacteria and antimicrobial sensitivity (ID & AST) or possessed characteristics like rapidity, validity, user-friendliness, and affordability 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The rapid test employed in this study is based on optical sensors and provides results of ID & AST within four hours at the point-of-testing 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. This novel test has been clinically validated in around 2000 patients suffering from UTI 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【23】The process of development of prematurity and LBW due to ASB is largely insidious and influenced by an interplay of multiple factors 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Variability is also introduced at facility-level, including training status of lab technicians, resource availability, adherence to guidelines, myths among the providers regarding asymptomatic nature of the disease, and lack of habit of conducting point-of-care tests in routine antenatal check-ups. Hence, usefulness of an intervention targeted to reduce the burden of prematurity and LBW attributable to early detection and informed management of ASB cannot be studied in close confine of laboratories and needs a pragmatic real-life set up with minimal control, which is provided by a pragmatic randomized controlled trial design. Such a design has been widely used for generating evidence of effectiveness of interventions in actual clinical setting 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【24】The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effect of early detection and evidence-based treatment of ASB in pregnancy using this rapid point-of-care test on incidence of preterm birth and LBW in a real-world situation.\n\n【25】2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\n【26】### 2.1 Ethical approval\n\n【27】The study was reviewed and approved by Institutional Ethics Committee of Gandhi Medical College, Secunderabad, India. Participants were enrolled after explaining the details of the study in their native language and obtaining written informed consent. The study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n【28】### 2.2 Study design and setting\n\n【29】The study was conducted in a parallel-group pragmatic randomized controlled design 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 )</u> with 1:1 allocation, to identify the superiority of the intervention- “using a rapid test and prescribing antibiotics based on positive antimicrobial sensitivity results”, over the usual care in the study hospital in case of ASB. Randomization would have minimized the effect of other factors affecting preterm birth and LBW. Unit of randomization was pregnant woman.\n\n【30】Fig. 1 Care pathways evaluated in the study.

The study hospital receives walk-in patients mostly from the areas within and around Secunderabad and Hyderabad, which are twin cities in the state of Telangana, India with a combined population of nearly 700,000, and a reported prevalence of ASB in pregnancy as 18% 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Referred patients from even other districts of Telangana are also catered by the hospital since it is a tertiary care hospital. Thus, the participants in both arms are representative of a wider population. As the participants were selected from a pool or line-list of clients who visited the study hospital based on their own preference and choice, the results may not be generalized to the entire population of the city or state.\n\n【32】The reader machine for the novel test was installed in the microbiology laboratory of Gandhi Hospital by Department of Biological Sciences, Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS) Pilani, Hyderabad Campus, for the complete duration of the study. Strips for the test were supplied by the Genomics Laboratory at BITS Pilani. The research staff involved were lab technicians from BITS Pilani and Obstetricians and Microbiologists from Gandhi Hospital.\n\n【33】The study was registered with the Clinical Trials Registry-India (ID number CTRI/2016/09/007240). The study protocol is provided as an appendix 删除2:<u>(Appendix 1)</u>.\n\n【34】### 2.3 Study population, sampling, eligibility and enrolment\n\n【35】The study population consisted of the pregnant women attending antenatal clinic of the hospital for first antenatal check-up irrespective of trimester and gravida. Every day nearly 50 to 150 women used to visit the antenatal clinic, who were first registered in an antenatal register. Randomx android mobile app was used to select the participants by simple random sampling of the line list of the register for that day. The consenting participants were evaluated clinically by a research team consisting of a doctor and a lab technician, and those with any sign or symptom of UTI were excluded. Any participant who had a history of consumption of antibiotics in the preceding week was also excluded. Based on the mission capacity of the study team, maximum ten participants per day and on an average four participants per day were enrolled on weekdays until the sample size was met. Identification details, antenatal history, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and clinical evaluation details were recorded in a pre-approved data collection format. A urine sample was collected in a sterile container from each of the participants.\n\n【36】### 2.4 Randomization and allocation concealment\n\n【37】The urine samples were sequentially numbered before sending them to the microbiology laboratory. Computerized random allocation sequence was generated by Dr Manish Gehani using Microsoft Excel's random number generation feature, which was concealed from the team members involved in enrolling and assessing participants in the antenatal clinic. Following simple randomization method without any restriction, participants were randomly assigned in microbiology laboratory to either intervention ( _n_ \\= 120) or control ( _n_ \\= 120) group. Selectively, the urine samples from only the intervention arm were provided to the novel test team for further processing.\n\n【38】### 2.5 Intervention and usual care in control arm\n\n【39】Participants were not informed about their allocation to either intervention or control arm. All the participants, irrespective of the arm in which they were enrolled, underwent routine first antenatal check-up in antenatal out-patient department (OPD) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, which included history taking, general and obstetric examination, and routine blood and urine tests. The battery of tests conducted during routine antenatal check-up did not include urine culture and sensitivity or rapid test but included routine urine examination and microscopy 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Even for pus cells more than ten per high power field, the obstetricians did not order urine culture and sensitivity, and did not prescribe any antibiotics, since the patient was asymptomatic. In control arm, this usual care of hospital for asymptomatic pregnant women coming for their first antenatal check-up was continued without any interference.\n\n【40】Whereas, pregnant women enrolled in intervention arm were additionally screened for ASB with the novel rapid test 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. The rapid test utilized a proprietary medium to promote growth of uropathogens; chromogens to impart color to the medium; a pre-functionalized identification strip; two pre-loaded antibiotic strips; and a reader machine with optical sensor to detect chromogenic and nephelometric endpoints, and a proprietary indigenous lab-developed statistical algorithm-based software. For each test, 10 ml of urine sample was harvested in 3 ml of the proprietary medium at room temperature for 5 min and then the resultant suspension was added to the strips and incubated. Subsequently, the strips were kept in the reader machine for generating software-based results. Performing each test took a turn-around-time of four hours. The machine provided at the same time, the results of bacterial load; direct quantitative detection of common UTI-causing bacteria found in human urine, namely _Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Proteus, and Staphylococcus_ sp. and phenotypic antibiotic sensitivity of the causative bacteria to Amoxicillin, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Cefepime, Ofloxacin, Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, Piperacillin-Tazobactum, Cefotaxime, Cefuroxime, Tobramycin, Levofloxacin, Cefazolin and Imipenem 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test was found to be 92.5% and 82% respectively as compared to the gold standard urine culture 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【41】The positive results of ID & AST were shared immediately with obstetricians on duty to assist them in clinical decision making and in prescribing the standard regimen and duration of course of a freely chosen antibiotic based on the AST report of the rapid test, during the same hospital visit of the participant. Telephonic follow-up was done for only those women in the intervention arm who were prescribed antibiotics after being found positive for ASB. They were called on day 1, 3 and 7 after their hospital visit and prescription of antibiotics, to ensure compliance to the prescribed antibiotic regimen.\n\n【42】### 2.6 Follow-up and masking of data collectors\n\n【43】The length of follow up was till the delivery of baby. All 240 women enrolled in both the arms were followed up after delivery of baby, by three graduate data collectors (outcome assessors) experienced in field epidemiology, who were blinded regarding the allocation of the participants. They called each participant on her Expected Date of Delivery (EDD) and visited her in the hospital where she gave birth to the child. Based on the interview of the patient and the information recorded in the case record and discharge record by hospital nurse and verified by obstetrician, the data collectors recorded in a pre-designed format, the date of delivery, gestational age at childbirth and birth weight. In case the participant could not be contacted or traced around the EDD, or had delivered before the initial contact around EDD, they were visited at their home and data was collected by interview and by reviewing the discharge record. History was also taken of other complications of pregnancy and of symptomatic UTI after first antenatal check-up.\n\n【44】### 2.7 Outcome measures\n\n【45】The primary outcome measure was a delivered baby having either preterm birth or LBW or both. As per WHO definition, preterm birth is defined as babies born alive before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, while LBW is defined as weight at birth being less than 2500 gs 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The secondary outcome of the study was the incidence of other maternal and perinatal morbidities, irrespective of whether hospital admissions were needed for them, or not needed for mild complaints which could be managed without admission. The chosen outcome is important to the experts and decision makers who recommend and implement guidelines, as preterm birth and LBW affect child survival and additional resources are needed to cater special care to such vulnerable infants.\n\n【46】### 2.8 Materials\n\n【47】Analytical-grade chemicals required for preparation of BITGEN (proprietary growth promoting media), and identification strips were procured from Sigma Chemicals, USA. The 8-well strips and syringe filters were procured from NUNC, Denmark, and sterile syringes from Dispovan, India. The scanner/reader machine for novel test was obtained from Micro Lab Instruments, India.\n\n【48】### 2.9 Statistical analysis\n\n【49】For sample size calculation, the global rate of preterm birth, 10·6%, and that of LBW, 14·6%, were combined to extrapolate the combined rate of preterm or LBW (primary outcome measure) as 25%, which was assumed to be the incidence in the control arm. Based on the contribution of ASB to total preterm birth and LBW, which varies from 6·9% to 20·5% 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>, the expected incidence of preterm birth or LBW in intervention arm, was safely assumed to be 15% lower than the control arm, as a minimally important reduction for success of the study. Based on type 1 error of 5%, power of 80%, and loss to follow up as 10% (5% in each arm), it was estimated that 240 participants should be enrolled in the study (120 in each arm). Pearson's chi square was used for analyzing data using SPSS (v24), after tabulation of categorical dichotomous outcome of preterm birth or LBW and the two arms in a 2 × 2 table. The cut off of p-value used in the study to indicate statistical significance was 0.05. Intention-to-treat analysis was planned in the original groups in which the participants were allocated. Incidence of other maternal and perinatal events was described as frequencies and proportions in two arms were compared for significance using z test.\n删除5:<u>\n### 2.10 Role of funding source\n\n【50】The funding agency had no role in design of the study, collection of data, collection of samples, processing of the rapid point-of-care test, analysis and interpretation of data, writing of paper or submission for publication. The study and researchers were independent of the funding agency. The authors had full control of all primary data at all times and accept responsibility to submit for publication.\n\n【51】</u>3\\. Results\n-----------\n\n【52】### 3.1 Participants\n\n【53】Eligible participants were recruited from 15th February to 18th May 2017, while the follow-ups of women were done from February 2017 to February 2018, as and when they delivered. Since many women came for first check-up in their third trimester, the length of follow up period varied from one day to 287 days from the date of enrolment. 248 pregnant women were approached for participation in the study. 242 were eligible and 240 women agreed to participate. None of the women discontinued the intervention 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 )</u>.\n\n【54】Fig. 2 CONSORT diagram of flow of participants through the study (Trial Profile).

Since the proportion of participants in second or third trimester (79·1% in control arm versus 73·3% in intervention arm) and as multigravida (56·7% in control arm versus 50·8% in intervention arm), was only insignificantly higher in control arm, the prognostic strength and chance imbalance of these variables were low. Hence baseline risk of ASB due to these factors was comparable in two groups.\n\n【57】Table 1 Baseline characteristics of participants.

For gram negative bacteriuria, gentamycin was prescribed in five cases, cephalosporins in seven cases, and piperacillin-tazobactum in one case, while for gram positive bacteriuria, amoxycillin was prescribed in two cases and cephalosporins in five case. One woman in the intervention arm, who was negative at the time of enrolment, presented with signs and symptoms of UTI in her 29th week of gestation. On re-evaluation with the novel test, she was found to have bacteriuria due to _E. coli_ , for which she was prescribed piperacillin-tazobactum. In this way, total 21 women received antibiotics in the intervention arm (20 for ASB and one for UTI). No participant in control arm received any antibiotic for ASB at the time of enrolment. Although, in due course of pregnancy, three women in control arm had suffered with symptomatic UTI and had received antibiotics for the same.\n\n【62】### 3.4 Outcome analysis\n\n【63】#### 3.4.1 Analysis of the primary outcome of the incidence of either preterm birth or lbw\n\n【64】When a participant was called on her EDD, there were cases when the telephone numbers were out of service or not reachable and no alternative numbers were available. After three trials of calling the participants on three consecutive days, if they were still not contactable, the address provided by them at the time of enrolment was visited. In case they were not traceable even after home visit, due to migration and lack of information with their neighbors, they were labeled as lost to follow up. Due to loss to follow-up ( _n_ \\= 10), abortions ( _n_ \\= 5), death of new-born ( _n_ \\= 4), twin deliveries ( _n_ \\= 6), and refusal to divulge any information ( _n_ \\= 2), the final analysis included 103 participants in intervention arm and 110 participants in control arm for complete case analysis. There was no deviation from protocol during the study. Out of 213 women, 212 had institutional deliveries, while one woman (in control arm) delivered at home. Among institutional deliveries, eight had caesarean section (two in intervention arm and six in control arm), while 204 had normal delivery. A 14·7% (95% CI: 2·2 to 27·2) lower incidence of preterm birth or LBW was observed in the intervention arm (27 cases in intervention arm and 45 in control arm) (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0·43 to 0·95) 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Six cases in intervention arm and ten cases in control arm had both preterm birth and LBW, while majority of preterm births were late preterm births. The gestational age at delivery for preterm births and LBW babies are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. Out of 21 women who received antibiotics in intervention arm, only four experienced preterm birth or LBW, while three were lost to follow up. A significant association was found between intervention and occurrence of preterm birth or LBW by pre-specified Pearson's chi square test (X 2 \\= 5·13, _p_ \\= 0·023). No adverse events were reported due to the intervention. Early diagnosis enabled obstetricians with timely confirmation of bacteriuria and rapid antibiotic susceptibility helped them in prescribing antibiotics based on readily available evidence during the same visit.\n\n【65】Table 2 Primary outcomes of the study.

Discussion\n--------------\n\n【74】To the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first studies evaluating usability of a rapid point-of-care technology for ID and AST in real practice conditions for reducing preventable perinatal and neonatal mortality, lifelong disability and health expenditure due to preterm birth. The clinical implication of arresting disease processes by early detection using rapid diagnostics and subsequent timely and appropriate treatment is a widely recognized approach 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【75】The confidence interval ranging from 2·2% to 27·2% less cases of preterm birth or LBW in intervention arm, indicates a clinically important effect of early diagnosis of ASB and its subsequent treatment with appropriate antibiotics. Since the value of chi-square (5·13) exceeds the critical value (3·84) for one degree of freedom, and p value is less than 0·05, we conclude that preterm birth and LBW were significantly higher in control arm than in intervention arm. Considering the inter-current events between randomization and point of analysis, randomization would have minimized the risk of confounding due to other causative factors, although this risk cannot necessarily be considered to be eliminated. Thus, it can safely be assumed that the observed increase in cases of preterm birth and LBW in the control arm were attributable to undetected and hence, untreated ASB.\n\n【76】Recently, Lee et al. conducted a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effect of population-based antenatal screening using home-based urine culture analysis and empirical treatment of genitourinary tract infections on birth outcomes 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The screening of abnormal vaginal flora and UTI in the study was based on samples collected and transported by community health worker from patient's home, which had higher risk of contamination. Whereas our study was a randomized controlled trial with facility-based intervention where the sample processing was done immediately after collection. Moreover, everybody who had an abnormal vaginal flora was treated empirically by Lee et al. with clindamycin and those suspected of UTIs were initially treated with cefixime and later with nitrofurantoin, after a high prevalence of cefixime resistance was detected. It is worth mentioning here that the antibiotics administered to subjects by Lee et al. were not based on actual testing for antibiotic sensitivity of the bacteria found in the urine sample or vaginal swab. In contrast to this, the present study prescribed specific antibiotics to patients diagnosed with bacteriuria based on antibiotic sensitivity data, and thus assisted in prescription of effective antibiotics and avoid antimicrobial resistance. Consequently, Lee et al. could not attain the reduction in the incidence of preterm birth 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In a similar study, Kazemier et al. could not show association of ASB and preterm birth due to use of empirical nitrofurantoin prescription instead of pathogen specific antibiotic based on AST report 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Use of a single antimicrobial can have differential results as opposed to using a pathogen specific antibiotic based on AST results. The current study showed that the rapid-test-guided treatment for ASB effectively lowered the incidence of preterm birth and LBW in the intervention arm by 14·7%.\n\n【77】Previously published meta-analyses have shown a strong association between untreated ASB and the incidence of preterm birth or LBW 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The promising results obtained from the present study emphasize the usefulness of a rapid test over conventional urine culture and of susceptibility-based prescription of antibiotics over empirical prescription for antibiotics. The usefulness of the results of a hospital-based pragmatic randomized controlled trial increases considering the fact that pregnant women come to hospitals for antenatal check-ups and the rapid test can become the part of the usual care in the hospital.\n\n【78】There were certain limitations of the study. The estimation of gestational age was based on fundal height or recall of the last menstrual period. To reduce inaccuracy in measurement and recording of endpoints, the labor room staff at Gandhi Hospital were re-trained for obstetric examination, weight measurement and estimation of gestational age before commencing the study and calibration of the digital weighing scales used in the hospital was ensured. Another limitation was that blinding those women in intervention arm who had a positive result was not possible, since they needed prescription of antibiotics. Similarly, the rapid test team in the microbiology laboratory could also not be blinded, as they selectively screened the urine samples of the participants enrolled in the intervention arm. Moreover, the study team at antenatal clinic was also made aware of the positive results of the participants in order to facilitate the prescription of antibiotics for them and to follow up with them for compliance to the prescribed antibiotic regimen. Nevertheless, data was collected prior to this disclosure, follow-ups were done to ensure compliance to the protocol, and outcome assessors were blinded to safeguard against bias. Many signs and symptoms of UTI also occur normally in pregnancy, still any such feature was out-rightly excluded to enroll only completely asymptomatic women. In India, many women visit hospital for first antenatal checkup directly in third trimester. Due to the pragmatic nature of the study and to reflect the actual state of care as it is in the facility, women were enrolled even when they came for the first antenatal checkup in third trimester. This arrangement created a possibility that if a woman would have come for first antenatal checkup in 36 weeks, she would never have reached the endpoint of preterm birth. Although, the highest gestational age of any woman remained 32 weeks at the time of enrolment in the study. The study also did not control for early preterm or late preterm births. Six cases in intervention arm and ten cases in control arm had both preterm birth and LBW, which implies that majority of preterm births in both arms (21 in intervention arm and 28 in control arm) were late preterm births. The study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital to achieve the required sample size. Tertiary care hospitals are adequately staffed, well located and more resourceful, however it is noteworthy that still they are unable to provide regular urine culture testing for the large population routinely visiting these places for antenatal care.\n\n【79】The novel rapid test described herein has unique features like portability and point-of-use testing, user-friendliness, low cost and no dependence on lab infrastructure. It can be performed by minimally-trained healthcare workers. These features make it feasible to install and run this test in primary and secondary care government run peripheral rural and remote hospitals, especially in LMICs. Availability of ID & AST results by this test in a short time interval can enable the clinicians to prescribe antibiotics on basis of real evidence for efficacy of a given antibiotic on a case-to-case basis, and to follow guidelines like screening pregnant women routinely for ASB. It fulfills 25 out of 26 Delphi-consensus criteria for point-of-care test for UTI detection except for just one, i.e. use of small sample volume 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The novel test also demonstrates high user acceptance by fulfilling six out of seven of the WHO's (World Health Organization) ASSURED (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and robust, Equipment-free and Deliverable to end-users) criteria for a low-cost point-of-care test in resource-limited settings, the only unfulfilled criteria being equipment free 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Due to these advantages, it can be scaled for mass screening of pregnant women during antenatal check-ups.\n\n【80】In conclusion, it can be emphasized that the real-world application of the portable rapid tests has immense potential in clinical care. This should be further evaluated using a multi-centric approach in a larger cohort and included in established clinical algorithms and public policies for rapid diagnosis during routine check-ups.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nAuthor contributions\n--------------------\n\n【81】SK and SS conceptualized the study.

A war, the UK's Ukraine Ambassador wrote last week “on the whole of the civilised world”. The burden of war falls mostly on women and children. 10 million children younger than 5 years died in conflicts between 1995 and 2015. Women and children will now be dying from preventable causes in Ukraine. The health and humanitarian crisis afflicting Ukraine has received far too little attention. Consider those forcibly displaced. Although hard to predict, as many as 5 million people, up to three-quarters of whom will be women and children, are likely to become refugees. European nations must allow visa-free entry for these displaced families. Delay will be lethal. But one does not have to be displaced to be at risk. Deaths and physical injuries from direct violence are high in close combat urban settings. Protracted conflicts also bring food insecurity. Outbreaks of infectious disease are common. Surveillance systems and vaccination programmes will be disrupted. In the midst of a continuing pandemic, with a population poorly vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 (34% of Ukrainians have received two doses of vaccine and only 1·7% a third dose), the risk of local spikes of COVID-19 is likely. Destruction of safe water and sanitation facilities only adds to the danger. Continuity of care—maternity services, dialysis, chemotherapy and immunotherapy for cancers, insulin supplies, mental health care—will be derailed. The history of war teaches that sexual violence will be pervasive. Amid the talk of punitive sanctions against Russia, the basic needs of the Ukrainian people are being overlooked.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2022 Richard Saker/Contour by Getty Images</u>\n\n【1】What connects this European war to a global pandemic? One word: security. This concept is not fashionable in global health. We prefer to talk about sustainability. Securitisation is seen as anathema to the values of global health—the progressive expansion of rights, equity, and social justice. Serious efforts have been made to redefine the notion of security to accommodate these concerns. The most definitive statement came from the 2003 Commission on Human Security, _Human Security Now_ . Sadako Ogata and Amartya Sen set out a vision for security based on people, not states. A nation state's security is necessary to protect its people. But national security alone is an insufficient guarantor of individual security. As western nations debate how to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, human security must be put on the security agenda—by the UN Security Council and WHO. So far, these multilateral actors have been weak in both words and deeds. Ironically, the importance of protecting individual lives has a Russian origin. Alexander Herzen, born in Moscow in 1812, embodied the tense struggle of identities between Russians and Europeans (he died in Paris in 1870). Herzen observed the failure of European revolutions in the 1840s. His conclusion, relevant today in this latest European war, was that there are no simple solutions to the problems faced by societies. Every historical moment is unique. The only fact one can be sure of is the absolute importance of the life of the individual. There can be no sacrifice of present and urgent human needs for a promise of a better future. The goal of life is life itself. There exists no clearer definition of human security.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2022 Kyodo News Stills/Getty Images</u>\n\n【2】One final caution. Politicians are calling for Russia to be isolated—ending diplomatic relations, imposing trade embargoes, driving out oligarchs. But be careful what you wish for. Last week, WHO convened a forum to review lessons from research into COVID-19. My task was to identify the challenges to ensuring the best science was published as quickly as possible. The first challenge was that a global pandemic demanded a global science—an international network of scientists able to communicate freely with one another. A second challenge was that global science depends on global trust. And global trust depends on open collaboration with scientists in all countries. Scientists must build trust with other scientists, irrespective of their national origin. We must support one another in the face of often hostile political criticism to provide the most reliable evidence to decision makers. As Herzen wrote “an exclusive feeling of nationality is never productive of good”. Inadvertently isolating Russian scientists and health workers will be self-defeating. Scientists must work towards a more convergent and less divided world—for national as well as human security.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2022 Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty Images</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【3】### Publication history\n\n【4】Published: 05 March 2022\n\n【5】### Identification\n\n【6】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00411-1</u>\n\n【7】### Copyright\n\n【8】© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Data on whether HIV increases the risk of severe COVID-19 are conflicting, with initial studies showing that excess risk was associated with the presence of other comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19. However, subsequent investigations in larger and more diverse population-based cohorts have suggested that people with HIV with lower CD4 cell counts or unsuppressed viral loads might be at increased risk of severe COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is expected to substantially reduce this risk, although there is a paucity of HIV-specific data.\n\n【1】People living with HIV have diminished or less durable response to hepatitis B and yellow fever vaccination, and people with low CD4 cell counts have diminished antibody titres to diphtheria, tetanus, and poliomyelitis. This lower magnitude or less durable immune response in HIV-positive populations than in the HIV-negative population is thought to be mediated by lower CD4/CD8 ratios, T-cell exhaustion, or persistent inflammation related to HIV infection despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). After natural infection with SARS-CoV-2, people with HIV have lower anti-spike IgG concentrations and pseudovirus neutralising titres. For other immunocompromising conditions, such as solid organ transplantation, decreased immunogenicity to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination has been documented, with data emerging for other conditions. Investigators from the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine study's South African sites reported that efficacy decreased from 60% (95% CI 20–80) to 49% (6–73) when people living with HIV were included in the analysis, although these data have not yet been published. These concerns have led public health authorities to recommend selective use of facemasks and physical distancing after vaccination among immunocompromised individuals until additional data are available.\n\n【2】• View related content for this article\n\n【3】In _The Lancet HIV,_ John Frater and colleagues present anxiously awaited data on the humoral and cell-mediated response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost vaccine among 54 people living with HIV (all male, median age 42·5 years \\[IQR 37·2–49·8\\]) compared with 50 adults without HIV. Only individuals with HIV who were virologically suppressed on ART and had CD4 counts of more than 350 cells per μL were enrolled, and the median CD4 count was 694 cells per μL (IQR 574–860). The authors examined humoral immunity by measuring anti-spike IgG concentrations, and live virus neutralisation among a randomly selected subset of 15 individuals with HIV, and cell-mediated immunity via ex-vivo IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) and T-cell proliferation studies. Reassuringly, IgG concentrations were similar or higher when examined up to day 56 after prime vaccination (geometric mean ratio 1·66 \\[95% CI 1·14–2·41\\] at day 56), and four of 15 individuals showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation by day 28, which increased to 13 of 15 at day 56. Investigation of cell-mediated immunity by HIV status showed no differences in ELISpot responses at all timepoints, with 40 (91%) of 44 individuals with HIV with available data having a response by day 14, and proliferative CD+ and CD8 cells to SARS CoV-2 increasing significantly from baseline.\n\n【4】Frater and colleagues' results support that people with HIV who are on effective ART with suppressed viral loads and high CD4 cell counts (>350 cells per μL) do not have diminished humoral and cell-mediated responses to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime-boost vaccine, although longer term follow-up is needed to examine the durability of these responses. Increasing data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity after natural infection is correlated with later protection, although prospectively following up people with HIV after vaccination will be important. However, we should not attempt to extrapolate these data to people with HIV with lower CD4 counts or CD4/CD8 ratios than the population studied here, or without suppressed HIV viral loads. The diminished humoral immune response after natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 among people with HIV, but not after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination, could be related to the differing populations examined, given that people with HIV with unsuppressed viral loads or low CD4 cell counts were not included in Frater and colleagues' study. Alternatively, the greater immunogenicity of vaccination compared with previous natural infection could attenuate or reverse differences in the immunological response by HIV status. Future studies will need to enrol diverse populations with HIV to investigate whether the vaccination maintains high efficacy in those with low CD4 cell counts and who are not virally suppressed because they are at greater baseline risk of severe COVID-19. Although these studies are ongoing, these encouraging data support the importance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination as a principal COVID-19 prevention strategy among people with HIV.\n\n【5】I am funded by the National Institutes of Health National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R01AI158013) supported this work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Extensive basic and clinical scientific investigation has provided strong evidence that the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has a key role in migraine. This evidence led to the development of small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists and monoclonal antibodies targeting either CGRP or its receptor. Clinical trials investigating these therapies have consistently shown statistically significant efficacy for either the acute or preventive treatment of migraine. No serious safety or tolerability issues have been identified in the trials of the monoclonal antibody therapies. Although the appropriate place of these new migraine-specific therapies relative to other available acute and preventive treatments remains to be determined, a growing body of evidence shows that therapeutic approaches targeting CGRP have the potential to transform the clinical management of migraine.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

Previous studies have shown substantially lower birthweight in infants of south Asian origin than in those of white European origin. Whether such differences mask increased adiposity in south Asian infants and whether they persist across generations in contemporary UK populations is unclear but important to the development of public health interventions aimed at increasing birthweight. We aimed to compare birthweight, skinfold thickness, and cord leptin between Pakistani and white British infants and to investigate whether the magnitude of any difference varies depending on whether the mother, father, and all four grandparents were born in the UK or south Asia.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We examined differences in birthweight, subscapular, and triceps skinfold thickness between 4649 Pakistani and 4055 white British infants born at term in the same UK maternity unit and compared cord leptin in a subgroup of 775 Pakistani and 612 white British infants. All infants were born to mothers recruited to the Born in Bradford cohort study between March, 2007, and December, 2010. Around 80% of women invited to take part were recruited to the study and levels of recruitment were broadly similar in both ethnic groups. We investigated whether the magnitude of any differences changed by Pakistani generation and used multiple linear regression models to adjust for a wide range of potential explanatory or masking factors (including smoking, alcohol, maternal glycaemia, body-mass index, height parity, sex, gestation, and socioeconomic factors).\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Pakistani infants were lighter (adjusted mean difference −234 g, 95% CI −258 to −210) than were white British infants and were smaller in both subscapular and triceps skinfold measurements. The differences for subscapular and triceps skinfold thickness (mean _Z_ score difference −0·27, 95% CI −0·34 to −0·20, and −0·23, 95% CI −0·30 to −0·16, respectively) were smaller than the difference in birthweight (mean _Z_ score difference −0·52, 95% CI −0·58 to −0·47) and attenuated to the null with adjustment for birthweight (0·03, 95% CI −0·03 to 0·09, and −0·01, 95% CI −0·08 to 0·05, respectively). Cord leptin concentration (used as an indicator of fat mass) was similar in Pakistani and white British infants without adjustment for birthweight, but with adjustment became 30% higher (95% CI 17–44) in Pakistani infants than in white British infants. The magnitudes of difference did not differ by generation.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Despite being substantially lighter, Pakistani infants had similar skinfold thicknesses and greater total fat mass, as indicated by cord leptin, for a given birthweight than did white British infants. Our findings draw attention to a potential problem for WHO guidance and other health policy aimed at increasing birthweight in populations in low-income and middle-income countries and in migrant populations in high-income countries. If mean birthweight increases, but a fat-preserving tendency is maintained, the effect might be simply to increase adiposity, which in turn could worsen long-term cardiometabolic health and increase existing ethnic inequalities in diabetes and coronary heart disease. Policies to reduce ethnic inequalities in birthweight therefore need to consider differences in adiposity, and the possibility that increasing birthweight in south Asian infants might inadvertently worsen health by increasing relative adiposity.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】JW was funded by a UK Medical Research Council (MRC) Special Training Fellowship in Health of the Public and Health Services Research (MRCGO601712), DAL works in a centre that receives funding from the MRC (G0600705).

Tumour tracking involves real-time target localisation and correction of radiation beam geometry to compensate for motion. Uncertainties in tumour localisation are important in particle therapy (proton therapy, carbon-ion therapy) because charged particle beams are highly sensitive to geometrical and associated density and radiological variations in path length, which will affect the treatment plan. Target localisation and motion compensation methods applied in x-ray photon radiotherapy require careful performance assessment for clinical applications in particle therapy.

We developed a novel resilience measure based on the degree of mismatch between a person's frailty level and disease burden and examined its ability in predicting adverse outcomes.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We included white and black older adults (≥70 years) from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study. Eligibility criteria were (1) free of life-threatening illness, (2) self-reported ability to walk a quarter of a mile, to climb 10 steps without resting, and to perform basic activities of daily living without assistance, and (3) no intention to move out of the current geographic area for at least 3 years. We constructed the resilience measure as the residual taken from the linear model regressing frailty on age, sex, race or ethnicity, and 14 diseases. We classified participants into three groups—adapters, expected agers, and premature frailers—on the basis of residuals (less than, within, or above 1 SD of the mean). Validation outcomes included years of healthy and able life (YHAL), disability, hospitalisation, and survival. We also examined the association between this new resilience measure and survival after incident cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke).\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】2457 adults were included in the analysis. The average YHAL was 4·65 for premature frailers, 7·70 for expected agers, and 9·63 years for adapters. Compared with premature frailers and expected agers, adapters had significantly lower disability (p<0·0001), hospitalisation (p<0·0001), and mortality (p<0·0001) and a higher proportion surviving to 90 years (p<0·0001). Among the 371 adults who had incident cardiovascular events, the multivariable-adjusted model showed that each 1-unit increase in the resilience level corresponded with a 10·4% decrease in hazard of death (p=0·0021). We observed similar results when we examined each of the three cardiovascular events separately: hazard ratios were 0·86 for coronary heart disease, 0·92 for myocardial infarction, and 0·90 for stroke.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】We developed and validated a novel approach for quantifying and classifying physical resilience in a biracial cohort of older adults.

By the middle of the afternoon I was rolling around on the carpet in agony. A friend I'd been staying with took me straight to the nearest hospital, and in doing so, it seems, saved my life. A CT scan, done by a kindly man who was missing most of the fingers on his right hand—these details stick in the mind—showed that my appendix had burst, and acute peritonitis had set in.\n\n【1】After another 3 hours of racking, fiery pain, in which my blood pressure fell so far that any more morphine might have crashed it completely, I was wheeled into an operating theatre.

I came round to find my surgeon, an elfin South Korean woman, telling my friend that if we'd waited another couple of hours I probably wouldn't have survived.\n\n【2】I spent another 3 days and nights in that hospital. I listened to the man in the next bed giving a former lover his bank details, and complaining to his current girlfriend when his ex cleaned out his savings account. Three times a day trays of food were placed on a table next to my bed; I watched them, wishing I didn't have to smell them, and later they were taken away untouched. Ward sisters brought huge, cartoonish syringes filled with broad-spectrum antibiotics and whooshed them into a vein in my arm. These drugs play havoc with what is euphemistically termed bowel habit, so I hobbled to the toilet when I could unplug my IV and my ECG in time, and soiled the bed when I couldn't. The nurses were endlessly patient, endlessly understanding, never reproachful.\n\n【3】_Robert Liston Operating_ , painting by Ernest Board and commissioned by Henry S Wellcome circa 1912\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2015 Wellcome Library Collections, London</u>\n\n【4】Confined to bed and sofa for another week, I ate plain vegetable dumplings, slept fitfully, and watched a liquid with the consistency and colour of Vimto ooze out of a tube in my belly and into a little transparent bulb pinned to my pyjamas. The removal of this drain at the end of the week provoked the most intensely painful few seconds of my life so far: a greasy medieval agony as what felt like yards of plastic tubing were pulled out through a small hole in my abdominal wall, without pain relief or even much of a warning, by a tall, good-looking junior surgeon. I would still like to break his nose if I could lay my hands on him.\n\n【5】All this has been part of my life for almost as long as I can remember. I have had surgery on my head, shoulders, knees, and toes, and many places in between, at an average rate of one general anaesthetic about every 3 years since I was 9 years old, alongside a scattering of procedures under local anaesthesia. I'm not writing this to elicit sympathy: many have suffered far more than I, and have been left to deal with far greater postoperative consequences. Only two of these operations have been life-saving, and the remainder fall into the category of running repairs. Like a late 1970s Datsun Cherry, I'm just not very well put together.\n\n【6】Just as the notoriously sybaritic King Edward VII became an expert at being entertained, so I came to think of myself as an expert at being operated on. With no alternative I toughed out the pain and the indignities: the surgeon who mistook my gangly preadolescent self for a first-year undergraduate, and bellowed at me to pull myself together as he hacked away at my inadequately frozen big toe; the time I found myself urinating blood after bursting stitches in my bladder. By the age of 15 I was disconcerting anaesthetists with reviews of their venepuncture technique, flirting with nurses in the recovery room, waving away counsellors and chaplains with the air of one who knew the ropes, who had been through all this before. Most of all I began to look forward to general anaesthesia itself. Sinking into an inky, balmy ocean of absence is one of the great metaphysical experiences.\n\n【7】For most of my life I bounced back unthinkingly from these surgical encounters like, successively, the growing boy, medical student, and medical historian that I was. But this time was different. My physical recovery was slow, and for a year I had nightmares, deep depressions (not new, but newly intense), and flashbacks. One cliché has it that surgical scars are emotional as well as physical, another that recovery means recovering into a different person as well as a different body. But for a year I lived these clichés, and this was also the year during which I worked on my latest book, _Crucial Interventions_ .\n\n【8】Drawing on the Wellcome Library's rich and diverse image collection, _Crucial Interventions_ tells the story of the great 19th-century transformation in surgery through illustrations taken from period textbooks, atlases, and journals. Writing this book while struggling through my own surgical recovery left me with a set of questions at once historical and entirely personal. Time and again, strangers have switched off my consciousness and rummaged around inside me, and in doing so have made my body work better. How on earth did this become routine? And how could I write this history without falling into an attitude of self-indulgent self-reference or supine, uncritical gratitude?\n\n【9】Of all the modern clinical professions, surgery has wanted least for gratitude. Surgeons have revelled in the praise of others, and have praised themselves in terms that might make José Mourinho blush. Heroic, humane, unselfish, democratic, near-divine—all these words can be found in descriptions of surgery by surgeons during the 19th and 20th centuries. Addressing the International Congress of Arts and Science in 1904, the American surgeon Frederick Dennis went even further:\n\n【10】“The science of surgery stands out in bold relief, and conspicuous grandeur, apart from and above the others, in that it deals directly with human life, that most precious of mortal possessions, often lending to it not only a helping, but a saving hand. At the same time, its story is so simple and so grand, that the child and the savant may alike participate in the pleasure which the wonderful narrative is fitted to convey.”\n\n【11】But histories of surgery that revolve around great surgeons and their pioneering operations do so at the risk of excluding other stories—most importantly, those of patients. Even the best recent studies of surgery have tended to be analyses of what surgeons do in operating theatres, although there are notable exceptions. Emily Mayhew's widely praised books on wounded soldiers in World War 1, and plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe and his patients in the Guinea Pig Club in World War 2, show that these stories can be told with clarity and compassion, and that they can connect the history of surgical technique with larger historical themes and with new currents in life-writing. And in his work on surgical simulation at Imperial College London, surgeon Roger Kneebone has flung open the doors of the operating theatre, drawing out connections between surgery, art, craft, theatre, and ethics.\n\n【12】Working on _Crucial Interventions_ has led me to think again about the meaning of surgery for patients—not just as a set of technical procedures in a sterile room, but also as an episode in the story of their lives, one with resonances and consequences that go far beyond the time they spend in hospital. I hope that its readers will reflect on the people—or parts of people—represented in its pictures: their lives, their suffering, and the question of how we modern folk should look at them in a way that acknowledges their richness and depth, without turning them into mere kitsch or gore porn. Writing of the images in my previous book, _The Sick Rose_ , I said that they undermine the seeming integrity of the viewer's own body and, by foreshadowing its ultimate destruction through disease, injury, and death, they conjure a peculiarly intimate sensation of the sublime. With _Crucial Interventions_ I find that I cannot look at these representations of corporeal fragility without seeing myself in them, and imagining alternative versions of my own history in which I did not come round from an anaesthetic, or awoke to find my own body grievously resected.\n\n【13】Ligature of an artery in the inguinal region, using sutures and a suture hook, with compression of the abdomen to reduce aortic blood flow (1841) in _Iconografia d'anatomia chirurgica e di medicina operatoria_ by J M Bourgery\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2015 Wellcome Library Collections, London</u>\n\n【14】For many of those who undergo it, the story of surgery is not awe or gratitude at the operative brilliance of a surgeon. It is learning to deal with the memory of pain and its persistence, and to live in an altered, perhaps diminished body, one that has become newly visible, vulnerable, and mortal. These experiences may last days, decades, or a lifetime.

We investigated the effects of homocysteine-lowering treatment (folic acid plus vitamin B 6 ) on markers of subclinical atherosclerosis among healthy siblings of patients with premature atherothrombotic disease.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did a randomised, placebo-controlled trial among 158 healthy siblings of 167 patients with premature atherothrombotic disease. 80 were assigned placebo and 78 were assigned 5 mg folic acid and 250 mg vitamin B 6 daily for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the development or progression of subclinical atherosclerosis as estimated from exercise electrocardiography, the ankle-brachial pressure index, and carotid and femoral ultrasonography.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Ten participants in the treatment group, and 14 in the placebo group dropped out. Vitamin treatment, compared with placebo, was associated with a decrease in fasting homocysteine concentration (from 14·7 to 7·4 μmol/L vs from 14·7 to 12·0 μmol/L), and in postmethionine homocysteine concentration (from 64·9 to 34·9 μmol/L vs from 64·8 to 50·3 μmol/L). It was also associated with a decreased rate of abnormal exercise electrocardiography tests (odds ratio 0·40 \\[0·17–0·93\\]; p=0·035). There was no apparent effect of vitamin treatment on ankle-brachial pressure indices (0·87 \\[0·56–1·33\\]), or on carotid and peripheral-arterial outcome variables (1·02 \\[0·26–4·05\\] and 0·86 \\[0·47–1·59\\], respectively).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Homocysteine-lowering treatment with folic acid plus vitamin B 6 in healthy siblings of patients with premature atherothrombotic disease is associated with a decreased occurrence of abnormal exercise electrocardiography tests, which is consistent with a decreased risk of atherosclerotic coronary events.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【9】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【10】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【11】One-time access price info\n\n【12】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【13】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【14】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【15】### Subscribe:\n\n【16】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【17】Already a print subscriber?

Disease mechanisms can be investigated in preclinical models and patients with multiple sclerosis by molecular and metabolic imaging techniques. Many insights have been gained from such imaging studies: persisting inflammation in the absence of a damaged blood–brain barrier, activated microglia within and beyond lesions, increased mitochondrial activity after acute lesions, raised sodium concentrations in the brain, increased glutamate in acute lesions and normal-appearing white matter, different degrees of demyelination in different patients and lesions, early neuronal damage in grey matter, and early astrocytic proliferation and activation in lesions and white matter. Clinical translation of molecular and metabolic imaging and extension of these techniques will enable the assessment of novel drugs targeted at these disease mechanisms, and have the potential to improve health outcomes through the stratification of patients for treatments.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet Neurology_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

Overall, the centre managed 1518 patients with multiple sclerosis in 2010–11, of whom none but these two had active tuberculosis.\n\n【5】The use of immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies has increased as they emerge as effective therapeutic options across many specialties, but concerns remain about the potential risks, particularly susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Natalizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody, licensed for treatment of HARRMS in the UK, that binds α 4 β 1 and α 4 β 7 integrins, thus blocking the transmigration of activated lymphocytes into the CNS. However, its inhibition of leucocyte trafficking is not organ-specific and other organs such as the gut, bone marrow, and kidney are affected. Natalizumab has been associated with progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy—a disorder associated with impaired immunity. Other unusual infections reported to the US Food and Drug Administration include _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ pneumonia, pulmonary aspergillosis, meningitis, encephalitis, and one case of _Mycobacterium avium_ intracellulare complex pneumonia, but no cases of tuberculosis.\n\n【6】Tuberculosis was unexpected, since the UK is a low-risk area for the disease and we had not seen any other cases in our clinic. However, we cannot exclude that these cases occurred by chance, especially since the patients had not been vaccinated with BCG. Although natalizumab has not been associated with reactivation of tuberculosis, α 4 β 1 expression is localised on effector T cells and facilitates their migration to the lung during tuberculosis. Thus pulmonary tuberculosis after natalizumab could be a result of the drug's action on α 4 β 1 integrin activity. Whether such an effect was due to heightened susceptibility to de novo tuberculosis infection owing to lack of BCG and potential environmental exposure, or to reactivation of latent tuberculosis, cannot be definitively concluded.\n\n【7】These patients presented to emergency departments and their cases highlight the importance of ongoing holistic surveillance of patients with multiple sclerosis on natalizumab by all medical professionals as the drug's use widens. The cases also suggest that individuals with any history of, or exposure to, tuberculosis might be considered for screening.\n\n【8】删除9:<u>DD and DMA declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

Thus, monitoring and quantifying aging rate is a fundamental question. Scientists have constructed a variety of aging clocks by machine learning to predict chronological age. The residue between prediction and chronological age followed by regressing out age effects is taken as the biological aging rate. DNA methylation clocks are the mostly widely recognized aging clocks. However, bio-sample collection and high-throughput sequencing are often invasive, time-consuming and expensive, which may hinder the translational application of aging clocks. What's more, the relatively small sample size of omics-based aging clocks may affect the model generalization and limits the application of powerful deep learning methods.\n\n【1】To tackle the above problems, we have built facial aging clocks by support vector regression (SVR) and deep convolutional neuron networks (CNN) with MAD as 6.0 and 2.8 years respectively. Aging rate derived from facial aging clock shows significant correlation with transcriptome and identifies molecular mediators of lifestyles. These indicate that facial aging clock can accurately capture the biological age and detect associated molecular patterns. In addition, facial aging clock trained on perceived age creatively avoids the dilemma of taking model error as the true aging rate. Age based on only face appearance estimated by human judges are defined as perceived age and have been shown to be a biological age of the face. As perceived age trained facial aging clocks are actually trained on biological age instead of age, it is not surprising that such a clock is more associated with health indicators than chronological age train models. Such a clock can also reflect how humans judge other people's age.\n\n【2】Studies have shown that numerous diseases associate with aging rate. DNA methylation aging clock acceleration is observed in diseases like tumors, combat PTSD, and even can reflect mortality risk. Facial aging clock acceleration is also observed for systemic inflammation, high blood cholesterol and uric acid. Convenient data acquisition and processing, and high accuracy confer promising translational potential of facial aging clocks. Single cell RNA-seq clock can be accelerated by 10–20 years in CoVID and lupus, and decelerated by decades in super centenarians. Unlike other omics aging clocks, facial aging clock is suitable to clinical scenarios. Facial images taking and biological age prediction takes only several minutes, thus well fit to daily monitoring of aging rate. Except common clinical evaluation markers of diseases, aging rate dynamics of patients as a novel biomarker can provide doctors evaluation of quantitative patients aging status and objective evaluation of therapies. As aging acceleration often reflects disease risk and progression, facial aging clock application may help doctors to optimize drugs and therapies, thus a better prognosis. Accelerated aging may indicate future risk of some diseases, can thus guide people to alter their lifestyles. Another application scenario may be for clinicians to monitor patients health management and relieving clinicians from overloaded routine monitoring. Overall, we envision the non-Invasive and low-cost facial aging clock and even disease risk assessment to be affordable and practical applications under many clinical scenarios, as the workflow shown in Fig. 1 .\n\n【3】Fig. 1 Workflow of building and applying facial aging clocks.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【4】Furthermore, application of facial aging clocks is not restricted to only hospitals. Facial aging clock can be utilized for evaluating daily anti-aging interventions like calorie restriction, metformin and personalized therapies. If this clock is integrated to smart phones in the soon future, daily monitoring of aging is available to all people under any situations. We believe that facial aging clock will prompt people to get accustomed to monitoring aging for optimum health. From the public health perspective, monitoring aging by facial aging clocks can prevent or suspend diseases progression, and ease the economical and clinical pressure.\n\n【5】Additionally, some diseases seem to be linked with face morphology. Various diseases may be manifested through alterations in facial features, such as in the case of Down syndrome. Facial appearance has been used as a diagnostic tool to facilitate early detection. Deep learning-based analysis of facial images has shown high accuracy in genetic disorders. This implicates that pre-diagnosis and risk assessment of certain diseases are clinically practical based on facial images. With the advance in artificial intelligence and cohort data accumulation, we expect that a plethora of facial models will emerge and assist doctors to prevent, diagnose and manage aging and diseases in the near future.\n\n【6】However, there exist some limitations on clinical application of facial aging clocks. The effect of geographical differences on faces may introduce confounding factors. Facial appearance exhibits notable variations across different regions worldwide. Recent study of 3D facial images has further revealed significant disparities in facial morphology between East Asian and European populations. Environmental and lifestyle factors also influence facial development. Moreover, while deep learning-based facial image analysis holds promise for future clinical applications, it is important to acknowledge that facial changes associated with certain diseases can be subtle and may overlap with normal variations or non-disease-related factors. Finally, many diseases exhibit diverse manifestations. To enhance the accuracy and reliability of disease identification, it is crucial to adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates multiple diagnostic factors, including medical history, physical examinations and medical tests.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【7】J.D.J.H conceived and designed the comment.

Instead, we have synthesised the existing evidence regarding interactions between global health initiatives (GHIs) and country health systems to ascertain what really happens in practice. We, therefore, welcome the concluding statement of the high-level dialogue convened in Venice, Italy 删除2:<u>(July 4, p 10)</u>, which provides an accurate reflection of the preliminary findings of the MPSCG, and acknowledges “that the impact of GHIs on health outcomes and health systems, though variable, has been positive on balance and has helped to draw attention to deficiencies in health systems.” This statement recognises that GHIs and those who invest in country health systems have shared goals, namely to improve health and to save lives. Leveraging synergies between GHIs and health systems would help achieve these goals more effectively.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2009 Photolibrary</u>\n\n【1】Moreover, we would like to call attention to four key messages from the MPSCG and the Venice Statement that urgently need to be acted on by decision-makers, including G8 and G20 leaders, public health authorities, and global health advocates. A concerted effort is needed, in the current context of the global financial crisis, to ensure funding is sustained to improve health, provide social protection, and alleviate poverty.\n\n【2】First, the impact assessment of GHIs suggests that there is substantial room for more effective application of existing resources in both the way disease-targeted programmes are implemented and the way they interact with health systems as a whole. As pointed out by the MPSCG, improvements are needed especially to strengthen the health workforce, align health information systems, and to reduce out-of-pocket payments for financing health-care expenditures. Tapping these improvements more systematically within and across GHIs could provide significantly higher health and socioeconomic returns on current investments, but it should be recognised that it would be far from sufficient to reach the MDGs and universal access targets.\n\n【3】Therefore, the second message concerns the need to mobilise additional resources for health. Low-income countries must continue to expand their commitments to investments aimed at improving health by reaching the agreed Abuja thresholds of 15% of total public spending. Similarly, donor countries must continue to increase their effective funding to development support for health, given the recent estimates of at least a doubling or a tripling of funding needed by 2015 to reach the internationally agreed health-related Millennium Development Goals. GHIs and the wider global health community must stand united and intensify their efforts to augment overall resources for the health “pie” rather than descend into a zero-sum calculus that would trade off disease-specific funding against health-systems funding, effectively robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n\n【4】Third, an important contribution of GHIs to aid effectiveness has been to promote performance-based funding in the field of development support for health. However, increased focus on health-systems-related performance indicators by GHIs would create a strong incentive for them to better coordinate countries' investments in disease-targeted programmes with health-systems-strengthening efforts. To this end, the GAVI Alliance, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the World Bank have recently started a process for developing mechanisms that will enable coordinated and joined-up investments in health systems and elaborating a harmonised set of indicators in this field in close collaboration with WHO. Therefore, we welcome the call of the Venice Statement for WHO “to draw on its standards setting and convening roles, to work with partners to enhance further alignment”.\n\n【5】Finally, GHIs have supported meaningful multistakeholder partnerships between governments, civil society, and affected communities at the global and local levels. Civil society has crucially important roles ranging from advocacy, demand creation, and service delivery, to policy-setting and providing oversight by emphasising accountability to service users. These more inclusive partnership arrangements, which put countries in the driving seat, represent important innovations that should be supported as an integral part of systems strengthening, especially in the context of the current discussions around global health architecture.\n\n【6】Limited data on the synergies between GHIs and health systems reflect the unresolved scientific challenges related to both the generation and interpretation of evidence on the effect of GHIs on health systems and the effect of investments in health systems on health outcomes, economic growth, and human development. These complex relations mean that oversimplistic or ideologically motivated interpretations of the evidence are best avoided. As those involved in policy-relevant evidence generation we strongly support the Venice Statement's call to “reinforce the need for further research” with the explicit goal of strengthening “specific dimensions of health systems and their interaction with GHIs”. This call could be heeded more strategically by tapping the 5–10% of country grant monies allocated by GHIs for monitoring and evaluation to intensify health systems and operational research to generate meaningful information for countries to inform policy and practice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

All the defendants are currently facing the death penalty. Bojan Pancevski reports.\n\n【1】The retrial of five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor accused of infecting hundreds of Libyan children with HIV has been adjourned once again after a member of the defence team was hospitalised with an illness.\n\n【2】Nurses Snezhana Dimitrova, Nasya Nenova, Valentina Siropolu, Christiana Valcheva, and Valia Cherveniashka, and Dr Ashraf Alhajouj, were all found guilty of deliberately injecting 426 children with the deadly virus by a court in the eastern city of Benghazi in May, 2004, and sentenced to death by firing squad. 52 of the infected children have since died of AIDS.\n\n【3】But the ruling was overturned by the country's Supreme Court 19 months later after an appeal and a retrial was ordered. The retrial of the six, who have been held in custody in the Libyan capital since 1999, was due to continue at the beginning of September but has now been postponed until Oct 31 because of the hospitalisation of one of the Bulgarian defence lawyers. According to Libyan law, a court cannot proceed with a hearing if a defendant is not represented by a lawyer. At the last hearing on Aug 29, the Libyan prosecutor had called for all six of the accused to be executed.\n\n【4】The retrial, which began on May 11, was ordered after the defendants claimed they had been tortured during interrogations by Libyan authorities. According to reports in the Bulgarian media, the nurses were forced to undress in front of police officers who then allegedly put insects on their bodies and set dogs on them. The five women were also allegedly denied water and forced to sleep in a tiny cell with just plastic bags and fruit juice boxes to urinate into. The reports also claimed that the officers had threatened to infect the prisoners with HIV.\n\n【5】Lawyer Thaman al-Bizanti, who is co-ordinating the defence of the Bulgarian nurses, has also called for the testimony of ten defence witnesses, but so far none of them have appeared in court.\n\n【6】Among them is key defence witness and former Libyan Health Minister Suleiman al Amari, who reportedly claimed there were over 1500 cases of HIV infection in the town before the Benghazi hospital infections occurred. In 1998, while still in office as Health Minister, he reportedly told local press that he felt entirely responsible for the HIV tragedy in Benghazi. He was reported as saying: “I bear full responsibility for the health-care sector and I feel ashamed of what has happened.”\n\n【7】In the same interview he was reported as saying that the Benghazi hospital lacked elementary equipment, such as disposable needles, and blamed the poor funding of the health-care sector. He subsequently claimed to have informed the Libyan government and its leader Muammar Gaddafi about the gravity of the situation.\n\n【8】The six were arrested after an investigation by Libyan experts concluded that the large number of HIV-infected patients at the Benghazi hospital was the result of deliberate contamination.\n\n【9】The inquiry was ordered despite a previous conclusion by an international specialist that the infections were the result of poor hygiene standards at the hospital.\n\n【10】Libyan prosecutors also claimed that the Bulgarian nurses confessed to having been recruited by a foreigner who paid them large amounts in US dollars and provided them with infected blood which they then administered to children. The case has been prominently reported by the international media and top European scientists have pleaded in favour of the six health workers claiming they could not have been the cause of the HIV infection in question.\n\n【11】Both the USA and the EU have also backed Bulgaria in declaring the innocence of the five nurses, with France and the USA said to have played a major part in attempts to broker an agreement that would result in the women's release.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【12】### Publication history\n\n【13】Published: 21 October 2006\n\n【14】### Identification\n\n【15】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69585-8</u>\n\n【16】### Copyright\n\n【17】© 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

{"seq_id": "4a6c5a8d-e8de-4e79-8ebe-7574a89cf291", "title": "Cancer: the revolution has begun", "text": "【0】_The Lancet_ today precedes the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Milan (Oct 8–12) by including much content on cancer. In a Health Policy paper , a global task force highlights inequities between rich and poor countries. But the task force is upbeat: if AIDS can be tackled, so can cancer, and it proposes steps for prevention, early detection, treatment, and palliation.\n\n【1】Policies can only follow clinical research. The TROPIC investigators compared the new taxane, cabazitaxel, against mitoxantrone in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and found a median survival advantage of 2·4 months. Tackling another hard to treat cancer, investigators from the UK's Medical Research Council and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer studied early versus delayed treatment in relapsed ovarian cancer . The study found no difference between the strategies, but highlights the necessity of publishing such important information. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is also difficult to treat. Michael Hallek and colleagues added the monoclonal antibody rituximab to standard therapy and found a highly significant advantage in progression-free survival.\n\n【2】TROPIC revealed a small survival advantage. What can follow seems inevitable. Health-technology assessors (eg, the UK's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence \\[NICE\\]) conclude the new treatment cannot be recommended on cost-effectiveness grounds. The media hits overdrive, fuelled by patients' groups that are often funded by the manufacturer—a fact usually overlooked in news reports. This mismatch—between what seriously ill patients understandably want and what seemingly callous health systems will fund—must be narrowed. Patients need to understand that small median survival gains mean that some on the new drug might do worse than those on control and face new side-effects. Bodies such as NICE should find ways to translate the cold statistic of survival (and its confidence limits) into meaningful information for the public. Society needs to find ways to show that money better spent on other treatments is not callous.\n\n【3】“Personalised treatment” is a buzz phrase, including in cancer. In oncology, it has actually been around a long time but is not recognised as such. One of the most important advances was the use of adjuvant tamoxifen (more latterly, an aromatase inhibitor) in women with oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. Genetic oncology revealed mutations in _BRCA_ , with implications for treatment decisions in familial breast and ovarian cancer. Trastuzumab for women with breast cancers with HER2-receptor overexpression or amplification, and erlotinib or gefitinib therapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer with a tumour somatic EGFR mutation, are other examples. Personalised medicine is a misnomer, and probably an approach that will never be achieved in complex diseases such as cancer. What is occurring is “personalised group-treatment”: groups of patients receive a selective drug on the basis of sensitivity, and other patients without the relevant marker are spared side-effects. In fact, today's CLL paper strongly suggests that patients with a chromosome 11q deletion will be ideal candidates for the rituximab-based regimen whereas those with a 17p deletion will probably not benefit. An era of molecular evidence-based medicine has arrived.\n\n【4】High-throughput genomics shows the complexity of cancer, with many of the 21 000 genes in the human genome implicated in the disease. Yet less than 200 encoded proteins are current targets for treatment, and only a few cancer biomarkers are used to target treatment. Why has progress seemingly stalled? The drug industry seems reluctant to grasp the nettle of targeted treatment, and rarely funds trials that stratify patients by known or potential markers. This “same old” attitude has to change if new molecularly based drugs are to be developed and the patients that could benefit from them identified. One recent example (with no drug industry funding) of novel methods to better predict benefit from therapy was to use RNA interference to deduce the functional role of each drug-response gene in laboratory models, which was then used to develop a metagene 删除2:<u>(a set of genes whose combined expression is linked to a specific cellular pathway; in this case, sensitivity to paclitaxel)</u>. In patients with triple-negative breast cancer (ie, negative for oestrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors), the metagene was associated with a statistically significant pathological complete response in retrospective cohorts.\n\n【5】Groups such as the PREDICT consortium (European Union funded) are investigating how cancer proteins (and the mutated genes behind them) interact in downstream pathways that govern drug sensitivity. Industry now needs to combine more functionally with academia to pursue the same goals.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2010 Science Photo Library</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: 02 October 2010\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61518-8</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, as more and more westerners deprive themselves of the near-certainty of death from smoking, it is increasingly difficult to convey the supratemporal moment of inhalation—experienced alone, post-coital, or socially over a pint in the local. A vast array of tactile testimonials is almost all that remains: accoutrements elaborately carved, cast, or tooled. And, above all, images: the “great detective” with his meerschaum; Marlene Dietrich in cabaret gear (the smoke curling to the top hat); Bogart with his trademark roach between thumb and index finger—to say nothing of Marlboro Man, the Silk Cut, and what you will of the sailor on the pack of Players. For pure evocation, among the many beautifully reproduced images sprinkled across the 35 essays in this coffee-table volume, it's hard to beat a full-page John Coltrane playing his sax with a cigarette knuckled in his right hand. Other such images lead irresistibly to _The Lancet_ 's 1958 conclusion that smokers were “energetic, impulsive, independent, interesting men, ardent in the pursuit of enterprises which appealed to them”, whereas non-smokers were “bland, steady, dependable, hard-working, rather uncommunicative family men” 删除2:<u>(p 133)</u>. To be sure, it's a smoker's view, to which the anthropologists, ethnographers, historians, and professors of English, medicine, music, politics, and art contributing to this book conspire by curtaining off black lungs and cancer wards.\n\n【2】Nevertheless, from well-blended contributions on Kretek (the popular Indonesian “medicinal” clove-tobacco mix) to “The Cocaine Experience”, it's clear that “a smoke” is not the same the world over, nor is it ever _just_ that—as Churchill, Castro, and Groucho Marx needed no reminding. As for Freud, the addiction to displaced phalluses transcended psychoanalysis. Gilman observes (“Jews and Smoking”) that the buccal cancer Freud was diagnosed with in 1923 was by then a sign of Gentile acculturation: it took 20 or more “good” cigars a day to fall ill “like everyone else”—ie, to be identified not by “race” but, economically, by class.\n\n【3】This is no book for pinched-nosed policy-makers casting about for more cheap smoke-screen legislation. And it's hardly a gift for those hoping to stick to New Year's resolutions. But for others who have consigned their ashtrays to Oxfam and forgotten how Santa used to light-up a Lucky Strike after his hard night's work or who can savour the ironies of Christopher Columbus introducing Amero-Indians to church incense before loading up with weed, it's a worthy substitute to pass with the port.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【4】### Publication history\n\n【5】Published: 18 December 2004\n\n【6】### Identification\n\n【7】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17575-2</u>\n\n【8】### Copyright\n\n【9】© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Under stressed or pathological conditions, such as OVA challenge or GCase mutations, HSP70 is recruited to GCase aggregates through PGRN as an indispensable adaptor. PGRN-dependent association with HSP70 is thus crucial, particularly under pathological conditions, for preventing the aggregation of GCase. Importantly, we have developed a PGRN derived molecule, referred to as Pcgin, which exhibits therapeutic effects in GD fibroblasts and animal models.

Here we report that PGRN binds directly to GCase and its deficiency results in aggregation of GCase and its receptor LIMP2. Mass spectrometry approaches identified HSP70 as a GCase/LIMP2 complex-associated protein upon stress, with PGRN as an indispensable adaptor. Additionally, 98 amino acids of C-terminal PGRN, referred to as Pcgin, are required and sufficient for the binding to GCase and HSP70. Pcgin effectively ameliorates the disease phenotype in GD patient fibroblasts and animal models. These findings not only demonstrate that PGRN is a co-chaperone of HSP70 and plays an important role in GCase lysosomal localization, but may also provide new therapeutic interventions for lysosomal storage diseases, in particular GD.\n\n【12】Keywords\n--------\n\n【13】*   Progranulin\n*   HSP70\n*   β-glucocerebrosidase\n*   Gaucher disease\n*   Lysosomal storage diseases\n*   Pcgin\n\n【14】1\\. Introduction\n----------------\n\n【15】Gaucher disease (GD), a common lysosomal storage disease (LSD), is caused by mutations in _GBA1_ with resultant defective glucocerebrosidase (GCase) function and the consequent accumulation of β-glucosylceramide (β-GlcCer) in macrophages and other cell types 删除7:<u>( , )</u>. β-GlcCer storage transforms lysosomes into tubular-like structures as viewed by electronic microscopy, with the lipid-engorged macrophage (Gaucher cell) showing a characteristic “wrinkled tissue paper” appearance under light microscopy. There are three types of GD based on its neurological complications 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Type 1 GD, the most common, is a non-neuropathic form occurring predominantly in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent; characteristics include hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, anemia, osteonecrosis and sclerosis, diffuse osteopenia, and multiple osteologic complications 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Type 2 (or acute infantile neuropathic Gaucher's disease) begins within 6 months of birth and presents with serious convulsions, hypertonia, mental retardation and apnea. Children with Type 2 usually die before two years of age. Type 3 GD, a chronic neuropathic form, can begin at any time in childhood or even in adulthood. It is characterized by slowly progressive, milder neurologic symptoms as compared to acute type 2 GD.\n\n【16】Progranulin (PGRN), also known as granulin, epithelin precursor (GEP), PC-cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF), proepithelin, and acrogranin, contains seven-and-a-half repeats of a cysteine-rich motif (CX5–6CX5CCX8CCX6CCXDX2HCCPX4CX5–6C) and forms a unique “beads-on-a-string” structure 删除7:<u>( )</u>. PGRN is abundantly expressed in epithelial cells, in chondrocytes, in cells of the immune system, and in neurons 删除7:<u>( )</u>. PGRN is known to play a critical role in a variety of physiologic and disease processes, including early embryogenesis, wound healing 删除7:<u>( )</u>, and host defense 删除7:<u>( )</u>. PGRN also functions as a neurotrophic factor and mutations in the PGRN gene ( _GRN_ ) resulting in partial or complete loss of the PGRN protein were reported to associate with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 删除7:<u>( , )</u> and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) 删除7:<u>( , )</u>, respectively.\n\n【17】PGRN associates with particular members in the TNF receptor superfamily, including TNFR1, TNFR2 and DR3 删除7:<u>( , )</u>, and possesses the ability to suppress inflammation in various conditions 删除7:<u>( , )</u>. Auto-antibodies against PGRN have been found in several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, and such antibodies were shown to promote a proinflammatory environment in a subgroup of patients 删除7:<u>( , )</u>.\n\n【18】We recently reported that the four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in _GRN_ , the gene encoding PGRN, lead to PGRN insufficiency and have significantly higher frequency in GD patients; revealing an association between PGRN insufficiency and GD 删除7:<u>( )</u>. In addition, “aged” and challenged adult PGRN null mice develop GD-like phenotypes 删除7:<u>( )</u>. However, the mechanisms underlying the association between PGRN and GD remain unclear. In this study, we report that PGRN is a co-chaperone for the lysosomal localization of GCase under pathological conditions through linking GCase to heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), an evolutionarily highly conserved molecular chaperone that mediates folding and unlocks disaggregation of numerous proteins 删除7:<u>( , )</u>. More importantly, a 15-kDa PGRN-derived protein, referred to as Pcgin, effectively ameliorates the cellular phenotypes of GD.\n\n【19】2\\.

The amino acid number encoded by C-terminal Deletions (CD) constructs: full-length PGRN (aa 1-593), CD1 (aa 1-521), CD2 (aa 1-444), CD3 (aa 1-376), CD4 (aa 1-284), CD5 (aa 1-209), CD6 (aa 1-127), and CD7 (aa 1-61). The amino acid number encoded by N-terminal Deletions (ND) constructs: ND1 (aa 45-593), ND2 (aa 113-593), ND3 (aa 179-593), ND4 (aa 261-593), ND5 (aa 336-593), ND6 (aa 416-593), and ND7 (aa 496-593). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequence. Full-length human GCase was purchased from Addgene (Cambridge, MA) and subcloned to pDsRed-monomer N1 vector (Clontech Mountain View, CA). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\n【24】### 2.3 Preparation of Lipid Extraction\n\n【25】Mouse brain tissue was used as a source of lipid mixture. Briefly, one mouse brain was dissected under sterile conditions. The brain tissues were homogenized in 50 ml DMEM medium containing 10% FBS. Bicinchoninic acid assay was used to determine the protein level in the brain lysate.\n\n【26】### 2.4 Expression and Purification of Pcgin\n\n【27】The sequence for Pcgin was inserted into pD444 expression vector with a His-tag (from DNA2.0, Menlo Park, CA). Pcgin was expressed in the BL21(DE3) _E. coli_ strain after induction by 1 mM IPTG. After a 3 h culture, cells were pelleted and sonicated to release the fusion protein. His-tagged Pcgin was purified by using ProBond™ Purification System (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA) as we have previously described 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Briefly, supernatant of cell lysis was incubated with affinity beads overnight, and washed with washing buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) six times. Pcgin was eluted from beads with elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 200 mM NaCl, 250 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0). After dialysis with PBS, endotoxin removal, and 0.2 μm filter sterilization, recombinant Pcgin protein was used in our cell-based model and in vivo animal model.\n\n【28】### 2.5 Site-directed Mutagenesis\n\n【29】pEGFP vector containing the Pcgin sequence was used as a template to create serial deletion mutants using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Ipswich, MA). Five deletion mutants were made to cover the full-length Pcgin: Δ1 delete aa496-522, Δ2 delete aa523-534, Δ3 delete aa535-539, Δ4 delete aa540-573 and Δ5 delete aa574-593. All mutant constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and their expressions were examined by western-blot.\n\n【30】### 2.6 Chronic Lung Inflammation Model\n\n【31】C57B/L6 WT and PGRN KO mice were housed in the animal facility of New York University as previously described 删除7:<u>( )</u>. All animal experiments have been approved by Institutional Animal Care and use Committee (IACUC) of New York University School of Medicine. 8 week-old mice were induced with chronic lung inflammation by intraperitoneal (I·P.) injection of OVA-Alum at Day 1 and Day 15, followed by intranasal challenge with 1% OVA, beginning at Day 29 and administered at a frequency of every three days for the duration of four weeks 删除7:<u>( )</u>.\n\n【32】To evaluate Pcgin's therapeutic function in vivo, a GD phenotype was induced in 8-week-old PGRN KO mice (n = 10) by OVA as described by above. One group of mice were injected with Pcgin (4 mg/kg/week) starting from the first week of intranasal challenge until to the end of this experiment and another group of mice were treated with Imiglucerase (60 u/kg/week) as a positive control. After 5 weeks of treatment with Pcgin or Imiglucerase, mice were sacrificed and lung tissues were fixed and processed by Mass Histology Service (Worcester, MA).\n\n【33】### 2.7 Right Ventricular Systolic Pressure (RVSP)\n\n【34】The right jugular veins of anesthetized WT and PGRN KO mice were exposed under an anatomic microscope. The RVSP was measured as reported previously 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Briefly, a catheter was inserted into right ventricular chamber via the jugular vein and RVSP was measured. Mice were analyzed without prior knowledge of group identity. The data from three independent experiments were pooled.\n\n【35】### 2.8 Histology and Analysis\n\n【36】After mice were sacrificed, lung tissues were embedded in paraffin, cut into slides, and stained with H&E and PAS by Mass Histology Service (Worcester, MA). Quantification of Gaucher cell count and measurement of area occupied by Gaucher cells was analyzed by Image J software.\n\n【37】### 2.9 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)\n\n【38】WT and PGRN KO mice after OVA treatment were anesthetized and the lung was processed for TEM or immunogold EM staining at microscope core facility at New York University School of Medicine 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Briefly, mice were euthanized and the lung was perfused with fixative containing 2.5% Glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 2 h. The samples were post fixed in 1% OsO4 for 1 h, block stained with 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated and embedded in Embed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). 60 nm sections were cut, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate by standard methods. Stained grids were examined under Philips CM-12 electron microscope (FEI; Eindhoven, The Netherlands) and photographed with a Gatan (4 k × 2.7 k) digital camera (Gatan, Inc. Pleasanton, CA).\n\n【39】For immunoelectron microscopy, lungs were fixed with 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The tissues were embedded in Lowicryl K4M (Polysciences, Inc.Warrington, PA) and LR White (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Polymerization was carried out under UV light (360 nm) at − 35 °C for LK4M and − 10 °C for LR White. After incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, gold conjugated secondary antibodies (15 nm Protein A Gold, Cell Microscopy Center, University Medical Center Utrecht, 35584 CX Utrecht, The Netherlands; 18 nm Colloidal Gold-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L), Jackson ImmunoReasearch Laboratories, Inc. West Grove, PA) were applied.\n\n【40】For double immunogold labeling, the tissue sections were incubated with mouse antibodies against GBA, or HSP70, followed by incubation with secondary antibody labeled with 5 nm gold particle. Then the sections were incubated with rabbit anti-PGRN antibody, followed by incubation with secondary antibody labeled with 18 nm gold particle. The grids were stained and examined as described above.\n\n【41】### 2.10 Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)\n\n【42】Binding affinity between GCase and PGRN were measured by SPR experiments by SensiQ Technologies Inc. (Oklahoma City, OK) as previously described 删除7:<u>( , )</u>.\n\n【43】### 2.11 Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)\n\n【44】293 EBNA cells in 96-well plates were transfected with pDsRed-GBA and pEGFP-PGRN·Cells transfected with pDsRed empty vector were employed as baseline control. The fluorescence intensity was read by SpectraMax® i3x Platform from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA). The cells were excited by GFP excitation wavelength (488 nm) and detect the DsRed emission wavelength (588 nm).\n\n【45】### 2.12 Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscope\n\n【46】Frozen lung sections, or cover-slip cultured cells, were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeabilized by 0.1% Triton-100 PBS. Primary antibodies were probed at 4 °C degree overnight, followed by fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies. The tissues or cultured cells were mounted on anti-fade medium containing DAPI. The images were taken by Leica TCS SP5 con-focal system.\n\n【47】### 2.13 Immunoprecipitation\n\n【48】Lungs from WT and PGRN KO mice with or without OVA challenge, or in another experiment from control PGRN KO mice, or OVA-challenged PGRN KO mice with or without rPGRN treatment, were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. The same amount of proteins from each group of mice was mixed together to represent the protein profile of each group. 400 μg protein from mixed samples were used for immunoprecipitation.\n\n【49】To determine the interaction between PGRN and GCase in cells, 293 EBNA cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding Flag-tagged PGRN and RFP-fused GCase. Cells were collected by RIPA buffer, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibody, and the protein complexes were detected with anti-GCase antibody.\n\n【50】To dissect the domains of PGRN responsible for binding to GCase, 293 EBNA cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding GFP fused full-length PGRN, or its serial deletion mutants, together with an expression plasmid encoding RFP fused GCase. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and samples were processed as described above.\n\n【51】All the samples were incubated overnight with primary antibodies and protein A/G agarose-beads, followed by thorough washing with RIPA lysis buffer. The samples were run on SDS-PAGE. Targeted proteins were probed with antibody and visualized by western-blot. In some experiments, the samples were sent to NYU Core Facility for Mass Spectrometry after immunoprecipitation.\n\n【52】### 2.14 Mass Spectrum\n\n【53】1) Gel Separation and Digestion. Samples were reduced with DTT at 57 °C for 1 h and were alkylated with Iodoacetamide for 45 min. Each sample was loaded onto a NuPAGE® 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel 1.0 mm The gel was stained using GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Thermo Scientific) and Coomassie stained gel bands were excised as indicated on the gel image. Excised gel pieces were destained with a 50:50 _v_ /v solution of methanol and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate. 300 ng of trypsin (Promega) were added to digest the gel pieces. 2) Protein Extraction. A slurry of R2 20 μm Poros beads (Life Technologies Corporation) in 5% formic acid and 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was added to each sample. The samples were shaken at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were loaded onto equilibrated C18 ziptips (Millipore) using a microcentrifuge for 30 s at 6000 rpm. Gel pieces were rinsed three times with 0.1% TFA. The extracted porors beads were further washed with 0.5% acetic acid. Peptides were eluted by the addition of 40% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid followed by the addition of 80% acetonitrile in 0.5% acetic acid. The organic solvent was removed using a SpeedVac concentrator and the sample reconstituted in 0.5% acetic acid. 3) MS Analysis. 1/5th of each sample was analyzed individually with the mIgG analyzed first, then the KO GBA, and finally the WT GBA. Samples were injected for on-line LC-MS using the autosampler of a EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific). Peptides were gradient eluted from the column directly to Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) using a 1 h gradient Solvent A: 5% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid Solvent B: 95% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid. 4) MS Method. High resolution full MS spectra were acquired with a resolution of 70,000, an AGC target of 1e6, with a maximum ion time of 120 ms, and scan range of 300 to 1500 _m_ / _z_ . Following each full MS twenty data-dependent high resolution HCD MS/MS spectra were acquired. All MS/MS spectra were collected using the following instrument parameters: resolution of 17,000, AGC target of 2e5, maximum ion time of 250 ms, one microscan, 2 _m_ / _z_ isolation window, fixed first mass of 150 m/z, and NCE of 27. MS/MS spectra were searched against a UniProt mouse database using Sequest within Proteome Discoverer.\n\n【54】### 2.15 Immunohistochemistry\n\n【55】Paraffin-embedded lung slides from WT and PGRN KO mice were de-paraffined in a xylene and ethanol gradient. After antigen retrieval by 0.1% trypsin and inactivation of endogenous hydrogen peroxidase, the slides were blocked with 3% BSA and 20% goat serum for 30 min. Primary antibodies were diluted at 1:20–50 with 2% goat serum and primed on the slides at 4 °C overnight. The next day, slides were washed with PBS and secondary antibodies were added (1:200 biotin-labeled goat-anti rabbit antibody or goat-anti mouse antibody) for 1 h. The staining was visualized by Vector ABC peroxidase kit, followed by DAB substrates.\n\n【56】### 2.16 Fluorescence Labeling of Active Form of GCase\n\n【57】MDW933, a specific ultrasensitive fluorescent dye for active lysosomal GCase 删除7:<u>( , )</u>, was a kindly provided by Dr. Hermen E. Overkleeft at University of Leiden. Cells were cultured on cover glass, and MDW933 (50 nM) was added in cell culture medium for 2 h to label lysosomal GCase. Next, cells were fixed with 3% ( _v_ /v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized by 0.1 mM NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, Cells were mounted with DAPI-medium, and fluorescence was visualized under a confocal microscope.\n\n【58】### 2.17 Knockdown of PGRN and HSP70 by siRNA\n\n【59】siRNA against mouse PGRN and HSP70 were purchased from Life Technology. 20 pmol of each siRNA were transiently transfected into RAW264.7 cells by Lipofectamine 2000. The cells were treated with lipid mixture (50 μg/ml) for 24 h and the level of the active form of GCase was measured by MDW933 dye. The knockdown of PGRN or HSP70 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining using their specific antibodies.\n\n【60】### 2.18 Lysosome Staining in LSD Fibroblasts\n\n【61】Fibroblasts from GD patients were cultured on coverslips in 24-well plates, and challenged with lipid lysis (50 μg/ml), with PGRN (0.4 μg/ml) or Pcgin (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. The next day, fresh medium containing 100 nM LysoTracker® Red was added for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 2% PFA. The coverslips were mounted on slides and the staining of lysosomes was imaged by confocal microscopy. Ten images were randomly taken from each sample, and fluorescence intensities were measured by ImageJ software.\n\n【62】### 2.19 Lysosome Staining by Live Imaging System\n\n【63】Full-length PGRN, as well as its serial deletion mutants, was cloned into pEGFP vector, and transiently transfected into GD fibroblasts seeded in Lab-Tek Chamber cover glass system. After 48 h in culture, LysoTracker® Deep Red (50 nM) was added to the medium for 1 h. The LysoTracker Deep Red signaling (excitation/emission of 647/668 nm) was observed in live cells by Applied Precision Personal DV live-cell imaging system at NYU core facility.\n\n【64】GFP \\+ positive cells indicated the expression of PGRN or its mutants, and GFP − negative cells were un-transfected control cells. The therapeutic effect of PGRN, as well as its mutants, was evaluated by comparing the LysoTracker signal between GFP \\+ and GFP − cells. Ten images were taken for each sample, and fluorescence intensity of lysosome of GFP \\+ and GFP − cells were selected and quantified by ImageJ.\n\n【65】### 2.20 GlcCer Quantitation\n\n【66】GlcCer contents in cell and spleen were quantitated by LC/MS following glycosphingolipids extraction as described 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Internal standard of D 5 \\-C18-GlcCer was added prior to extraction. LC/MS was carried out on a Waters Quattro Premier XE triple quadruple mass spectrometer interfaced with Aquity UPLC system (Milford, MA). GlcCer were quantified using 3 GlcCer reference standards (C16, C18 and C24-1 GlcCer) based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) function on mass spectrometer. Quantification of GlcCer with various chain lengths was accomplished using the curve for the GlcCer of closest chain length. Total GlcCer was the sum of individual GlcCer species detected. The GlcCer levels were normalized by protein amount in the cells and by tissue weight in spleen.\n\n【67】### 2.21 Statistical Analysis\n\n【68】For comparison of treatment groups, we performed unpaired _t_ \\-tests, paired _t_ \\-tests, and one-way or two-way ANOVA (where appropriate). All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Software. Statistical significance was two-sided and was achieved when at p < 0.05.\n\n【69】3\\. Results\n-----------\n\n【70】### 3.1 PGRN is Required for GCase Lysosomal Appearance and Its Deficiency Causes GCase/LIMP2 Aggregation\n\n【71】The findings that PGRN plays important anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory roles in various conditions, including inflammatory arthritis 删除7:<u>( )</u>, prompted us to examine its involvement in chronic lung inflammation. For this purpose, chronic lung inflammation was induced in 8-week old WT and PGRN knockout (KO) mice by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ovalbumin (OVA) at Day 1 and 15, followed by intranasal challenge of 1% OVA three times a week for four weeks beginning at Day 29. PGRN expression was induced in WT mice after OVA challenge 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1a)</u>, and PGRN KO mice developed more severe lung inflammation, including increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, pulmonary cell infiltration, and right ventricular systolic pressure 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1b–f)</u>. Remarkably, large numbers of “giant cells” were found in the lungs of PGRN KO mice, particularly after OVA treatment 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 a )</u>. These cells were engorged with materials and had a “wrinkled tissue paper” appearance, which is the typical morphology of Gaucher cells. No such cells were found in WT mice, either with or without OVA challenge. The liver and spleen were larger in PGRN KO mice relative to those in WT mice 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 b)</u>. In accordance with our previous report that β-GlcCer is accumulated in the lung tissue of PGRN KO mice, lipid composition analysis revealed that GlcCer 删除7:<u>( )</u>, as well as levels of GlcSph (glucosylsphingosine), were significantly higher in both lung and plasma of PGRN KO mice as compared to WT mice 删除2:<u>(Fig. S2)</u>. These macrophages from PGRN KO mice were much larger than those in WT mice, and the PGRN KO lysosome displayed the classic Gaucher-like cell tubular shape, instead of a regular round shape, as viewed under transmission electronic microscope (TEM) 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 c)</u>. The transformation of lysosome from the normal round shape to a tubular-like structure was observed along with material accumulation 删除2:<u>(Fig. S3)</u>. Other organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum, and other types of cells, such as type 1 and 2 pneumocyte, appeared normal 删除2:<u>(Figs. S4, S5)</u>, although defects in mitochondrial function have been reported in GD 删除7:<u>( , )</u>. The tubular-like structure was confirmed as lysosome through immunogold EM staining with the lysosomal receptor Sortilin 删除2:<u>(Figs. S6)</u>.\n\n【72】Fig. 1 PGRN is required for GCase lysosomal appearance and its deficiency causes GCase/LIMP2 aggregation. WT and PGRN KO mice received I.P. injection of OVA at Day 1 and 15, followed by intranasal challenge of 1% OVA beginning at Day 29 and administered thereafter three times a week for four weeks. (a) H&E staining shows giant Gaucher-like cells in lung of both male and female PGRN KO mice, especially after OVA treatment. (n = 10, 5 male and 5 female for each group). (b) Spleen and liver are larger in OVA-challenged PGRN KO mice than in WT mice (n = 10, 5 male and 5 female for each group). (c) Macrophages from PGRN KO mice are much larger than those in WT mice, and lysosomes become a tubular-like shape instead of the regular round shape, as assayed by transmission electronic microscope (TEM). (d) Distribution of GCase is altered in PGRN KO macrophages. Paraffin-embedded lung slides from OVA-challenged mice were stained with GCase antibody by immunohistochemistry. The aggregation of GCase in PGRN KO macrophages is indicated with arrows. (e) GCase is aggregated in the cytoplasm in of PGRN null macrophage, assayed by immunogold labeling of lung tissue. (f) The membrane of the aggregation structure in PGRN KO mice under EM. Lung tissues from PGRN KO mice after OVA challenge were processed for EM scanning. The membrane structure around aggregates is indicated by the red arrow. (g) Expression of LIMP2 and LAMP2 in macrophages from OVA-challenged WT and PGRN KO mice. Paraffin-embedded lung slides from WT and PGRN KO mice were stained with LIMP2 and LAMP2 by immunohistochemistry. Aggregation of LIMP2 in PGRN KO macrophages was indicated with an arrow. (h) LIMP2, but not LAMP2, is aggregated in the cytoplasm of PGRN null macrophage, assayed by immunofluorescence staining. Frozen sections of lung tissue from OVA-challenged PGRN KO mice were stained with LIMP2 or LAMP2 antibodies by immunofluorescence. The aggregation of LIMP2 is indicated with an arrow. The numbers of LIMP2 aggregates and Gaucher-like cells were counted and indicated as aggregates/100 Gaucher-like cells 删除2:<u>(right panel)</u>. (i) LIMP2 is not detectable in the lysosome and is aggregated in the cytoplasm in the PGRN null macrophage, assayed by immunogold labeling of lung tissue. LIMP2 is detectable in the lysosome, indicated with an arrow, of WT macrophage 删除2:<u>(left panel, 53,000 ×)</u>, whereas it is aggregated in the cytoplasm of PGRN-null macrophage and not observed in the tubular-like lysosome 删除2:<u>(middle panel 31,000 ×)</u>. An aggregation region of denser immunogold labeling is circled with a dashed line. The numbers of aggregates of LIMP2 and Gaucher-like cells were counted and indicated as aggregates/50 Gaucher-like cells 删除2:<u>(right panel)</u>. (j) GCase binds to LIMP2 in the absence of PGRN in vivo, assayed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Lung tissue from both WT and PGRN KO mice were lysed and protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-GCase antibody and detected with anti-LIMP2 antibody.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【73】Accumulation of β-GlcCer in GD is caused by reduced GCase enzymatic activity or decreased GCase protein expression 删除7:<u>( )</u>. However the protein level and GCase enzymatic activity were not affected in PGRN KO mice 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Immunohistochemistry staining of GCase revealed that intracellular localization of GCase was dramatically altered. Remarkably, GCase was aggregated in the cytoplasm in OVA-challenged PGRN KO mice 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 d)</u>. Immunogold labeling TEM further demonstrated that GCase was aggregated in PGRN null macrophages 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 e)</u>. The specificity of GCase antibody was examined with _Gba1_ −/− tissues 删除2:<u>(Fig. S7)</u>. As a control for the immunogold labeling TEM, Sortilin was found mainly to be clustered close to the cell plasma membrane, mediating endocytosis, and was also present in the tubular-like lysosomes of Gaucher cells in PGRN KO mice 删除2:<u>(Fig. S6)</u>. TEM revealed that the aggregation of GCase was environed, at least partially, in/on a membrane structure 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 f)</u>. We also performed co-immunogold staining of GCase with various organelle markers, including ER, trans-Golgi network, lysosome, and autophagy markers. Intriguingly, GCase was found to be specifically co-localized with the autophagy marker LC3 in aggregates 删除2:<u>(Fig. S8)</u>. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the lysosomal localization of GCase depends on the presence of PGRN.\n\n【74】Lysosomal integral membrane protein 2 (LIMP2), known as a GCase-binding receptor that mediates delivery of GCase to lysosomes, is present in several subcellular organelles in the secretory pathway, including the lysosome 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Interestingly, we found that lysosomal localization of LIMP2 was also defective in OVA-challenged PGRN-deficient macrophages 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 g, h)</u>. However, intracellular localization of lysosomal associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2), a lysosomal marker, was not affected in OVA-challenged PGRN null macrophages. Specifically, both LIMP2 and LAMP2 were detected in the lysosomes of WT macrophages; however LIMP2 was aggregated, while LAMP2 was distributed normally, in PGRN null macrophages 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 g)</u>. Confocal staining with frozen sections of lung tissues also demonstrated the aggregation of LIMP2, but not LAMP2, in OVA-challenged 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 h)</u> and aged 删除2:<u>(Fig. S9)</u> PGRN deficient tissues. The cytoplasmic aggregation of LIMP2 was further confirmed with immunogold TEM staining 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 i)</u>. In addition, GCase and LIMP2 still bind together in both WT and PGRN KO tissues mice, as assayed by co-immunoprecipitation 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 j)</u> and con-focal staining 删除2:<u>(Fig. S10)</u>, which is in accordance with the previous reports that indicating that sorting of GCase and LIMP2 are tightly linked 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Collectively, both GCase and its receptor LIMP2 were aggregated and absent from lysosomes in stressed (OVA-challenged or lipid-stimulated) PGRN deficient macrophages and mice.\n\n【75】### 3.2 PGRN Directly Binds to GCase Through a Two-site Mechanism\n\n【76】The finding that PGRN was required for lysosomal localization of GCase prompted us to determine whether PGRN directly associates with GCase. In vivo interaction between PGRN and GCase was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation with both transfected cells 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 a )</u> and native tissues from WT mice 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 b)</u>. TNFR2 was employed as a positive control for binding to PGRN 删除7:<u>( , )</u>. We also determined whether PGRN directly binds to GCase using a solid-phase binding assay with recombinant PGRN and GCase. PGRN demonstrated dose-dependent binding and saturation to liquid-phase GCase 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 c)</u>, whereas no direct interaction between PGRN and LIMP2 was detected 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 c)</u>. The binding affinity between PGRN and GCase was then measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with SensiQ Pioneer as described 删除7:<u>( , )</u>. The results demonstrated that PGRN binds to GCase in a two-site model: The first binding site exhibited a very high binding affinity (K D1 \\= 0.71 nM), whereas the second one displayed a relatively weaker binding affinity (K D2 \\= 360 nM), at pH 7.4 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 d)</u>. Intriguingly, these two binding sites responded differently to pH changes: The affinity for the high binding site decreased, whereas affinity for the weaker binding site increased, during pH reduction in the traffic process from endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and trans-Golgi network (TGN) of macrophages 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 d, e)</u>, although GCase and PGRN co-localized in all of these intracellular traffic compartments, as revealed by immunofluorescence staining 删除2:<u>(Fig. S11)</u>. Double labeling immunogold TEM also showed that PGRN co-localized with GCase in the ER and lysosome 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 f)</u>. Taken together, these results suggest that the probable points of GCase and PGRN association are in the intracellular compartments, beginning in compartments as early as the ER.\n\n【77】Fig. 2 PGRN directly binds to GCase in a two-sites binding mechanism. (a) PGRN binds to GCase in 293 EBNA cells transfected with plasmids encoding Flag-tagged PGRN and RFP-tagged GCase, assayed by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-Flag antibody and probed with RFP antibody. The result is representative of three independent experiments. (b) PGRN binds to GCase assayed by Co-IP. Lung tissues from WT mice were lysed and protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-GCase or TNFR2 (serving as a positive control) antibody, and probed with anti-PGRN antibody. (c) PGRN directly binds to GCase in vitro, assayed by solid phase binding assay. Various amounts of PGRN were coated, and biotin-labeled BSA, LIMP2 and GCase were added, followed by HRP-labeled Streptavidin and its substrates. (d) PGRN binds to GCase in a two-site mechanism, and the binding affinity responds differently to decreasing pH in traffic, assayed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with COOH1 chips.

Co-IP was performed to examine the binding activities of these mutants to RFP-fused GCase encoded by the pDsRed-GCase plasmid 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 c)</u>. Deletion of Grn P and Grn G did not affect, whereas deletion of Grn F abolished, the interaction of PGRN with GCase, indicating that Grn F of PGRN is involved in the association between PGRN and GCase. Interestingly, further removal of Grn B resulted in a weak recovery of interaction, suggesting that Grn B might act as an inhibitory and regulatory domain for binding to GCase. Further deletions demonstrated that Grn E alone strongly bound to GCase 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 c)</u>. The binding pattern of these N-terminal deletion mutants of PGRN with GCase was also confirmed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 d)</u>. Indeed, the importance of the major and strong binding site Grn E in mediating the binding of PGRN to GCase was further demonstrated with serial C-terminal deletions of PGRN, since deletion of Grn E from C-terminus abolished the interaction in both Co-IP and FRET assays 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 e–h)</u>. Collectively, these sets of assays indicate that Grn E and F are the strong and weak binding sites, respectively, which also supports the aforementioned two-site binding mechanism of PGRN to GCase, first observed in our surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 d, e)</u>.\n\n【79】Fig. 3 PGRN binds to GCase through Grn E and Grn F.

To isolate the molecules that are involved in PGRN's regulation of GCase, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-GCase antibody from OVA-challenged WT and PGRN KO tissues, followed by mass spectrometry (MS). Immunoprecipitation with GCase antibody pulled-down both PGRN-dependent and PGRN–independent GCase-associated proteins in WT tissues. When the same immunoprecipitation experiment was performed in PGRN KO tissues, only PGRN-independent GCase-associated proteins were immunoprecipitated. Hits from WT mice were subtracted by hits from PGRN KO, to yield PGRN-dependent GCase associated proteins, with the rationale that the molecules involved in PGRN-mediated GCase localization would be among the hits only present in WT mice but not PGRN KO mice 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 a )</u>. 134 hits in WT mice and 114 hits in PGRN KO mice were identified. 95 of them were common in both groups, and 39 proteins were found to be specific for WT mice, suggesting that these proteins would be PGRN-dependent GCase-associated proteins 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 b)</u>. Perlecan and Leukocyte elastase inhibitor, two known PGRN-binding proteins 删除7:<u>( , )</u>, were identified among the 39 hits, validating the technique. In addition, HSP70 and its co-chaperone protein T-complex protein 1 subunit alpha (TCP1), as well as cytoskeleton, vesicle-traffic related proteins, and an energy producing enzyme, were among the 39 hits 删除2:<u>(Table S1)</u>. These data were followed up with the studies in HEK293EBNA cells stably transfected with an expression plasmid encoding His-tagged PGRN 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Two proteins were co-purified with His-tagged PGRN, and MS analysis revealed that these were HSP70 and TCP1 (data not shown). To confirm the MS data, we conducted immunoprecipitation using an anti-GCase antibody in WT and PGRN KO tissues, and probed with an antibody against HSP70. HSP70 bound to GCase in WT mice after OVA challenge, and this interaction was undetectable in PGRN KO mice 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 c)</u>. In addition, administration of rPGRN rescued the binding of GCase to HSP70 in PGRN KO mice 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 d)</u>. HSP70 co-localized with PGRN in macrophages 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 e, f)</u>. PGRN bound to HSP70, and deletion of GrnE (i.e. CD1), known to be important for binding to GCase 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 c, g)</u>, also abolished the binding to HSP70 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 g)</u>. We also examined whether HSP70 is required for the lysosomal localization of GCase via suppression of HSP70 using a siRNA approach. Similar to knockdown of PGRN (serving as a control), suppression of HSP70 led to a reduction of lysosomal GCase detection, assayed with the activity-based probe (ABP) MDW933, which can spontaneously cross membranes and allow sensitive and specific labeling of active lysosomal GCase in living cells 删除7:<u>( , )</u> 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 h)</u>. Further, immunofluorescence staining with anti-GCase antibody demonstrated clear aggregation of GCase in lipid-stimulated HSP70 knockout cells, but not in the WT cells 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 i)</u>, and lysotracker and MDW933 co-staining revealed elevated lysosomal storage and reduced active GCase in HSP70 KO cells as compared to control cells 删除2:<u>(Fig. S12)</u>.\n\n【82】Fig. 4 Stress-induced PGRN-dependent interaction between GCase and HSP70. (a) The scheme of the method used to identify potential molecules involved in PGRN-mediated regulation of GCase, i.e. PGRN-dependent GCase associated proteins. Immunoprecipitation was performed with GCase antibody from both OVA-challenged WT and PGRN KO mice, followed by high-sensitivity mass spectrometry. (b) Summary of the hits isolated from both WT and PGRN KO mice and identification of HSP70 as a PGRN-dependent GCase-associated chaperone. (c) Binding of GCase to HSP70 is PGRN-dependent. Immunoprecipitation was conducted with anti-GCase antibody in WT and PGRN KO mice, and probed with HSP70 antibody. The result is representative of three independent experiments. (d) rPGRN restores the interaction between GCase and HSP70 in PGRN deficient mice in vivo. Lung tissue lysates prepared from OVA-unchallenged (Ctrl) or OVA-challenged PGRN KO mice treated with or without rPGRN were immunoprecipitated with anti-GCase antibody, and the presence of HSP70 in the immunoprecipitated complex was probed with HSP70 antibody. The result is representative of three independent experiments. (e) PGRN is co-localized with HSP70 in macrophages. Distribution of PGRN and HSP70 in BMDM were stained by the specific antibodies followed by fluorescence secondary antibodies, the co-localization is quantified as PDM Value (Product of the Differences from the Mean) shown in the lower right panel. (f) PGRN is co-localized with HSP70 in cytosol of macrophage, assayed by double immunogold labeling TEM of lung tissue in WT mice. PGRN is labeled with 18 nm gold particle (large) and HSP70 is labeled with 5 nm gold particle (small), and the co-localizations are indicated by arrow. (g) GrnE of PGRN is required for its binding to HSP70. A plasmid encoding GFP alone, GFP fused PGRN (FL) or C-terminal deletion of GrnE (CD1) mutation, was transfected into 293T cells. The interaction between PGRN and HSP70 were measured by immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody and detected with HSP70 antibody. The result is representative of three independent experiments. (h) Suppression of PGRN and HSP70 via a siRNA approach markedly reduces the lysosomal GCase in living macrophage, assayed by MDW933 labeling. RAW264.7 macrophages were transfected with siRNA specifically against PGRN or HSP70. Cells pre-treated with lipid stimulation were labeled with MDW933 probe for 2 h, and the expression levels of PGRN and HSP70 were measured by immunofluorescence staining. The cell transfected with corresponding siRNA is indicated with an arrow. (i) GCase is aggregated in HSP70 deficient cells, assayed by immunofluorescence staining. Murine lung endothelial cells from wild-type (WT) and HSP70 knockout (KO) mice were stimulated with lipid for 24 h. The cells were immunofluorescence stained with anti-GCase antibody, and imaged under confocal microscope. The aggregation of GCase is indicated with an arrow. The numbers of aggregates of GCase were counted and indicated as aggregates/100 cells 删除2:<u>(bottom panel)</u>. (j) Binding of LIMP2 to HSP70 is also stress-induced and PGRN-dependent. Immunoprecipitation was conducted with anti-HSP70 antibody in OVA-challenged WT and PGRN KO mice, and probed with LIMP2 antibody. The result is representative of three independent experiments.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【83】Previous reports that LIMP2 is the GCase transport receptor 删除7:<u>( )</u>, together with the finding that both GCase and LIMP2 were aggregated in PGRN deficient macrophages 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 )</u>, led us to determine whether HSP70 also interacted with LIMP2. Similar to GCase, LIMP2 also associated with HSP70 in WT, but not in PGRN KO tissues 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 j)</u>. In addition, the interaction between LIMP2 and HSP70 is highly dependent on OVA challenge.\n\n【84】### 3.4 Development of Pcgin, a PGRN-derived Protein, Retains the Binding Activity to GCase and HSP70\n\n【85】The finding that PGRN acts as a co-chaperone of HSP70 and is required for disaggregation of GCase, together with the facts that chaperone-based treatments aiming to enhance GCase lysosomal localization have proven to be a promising alternative to enzyme replacement treatment (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT) for GD 删除7:<u>( , )</u>, and recombinant HSP70 has been shown to effectively correct altered lysosomal stability seen in Niemann–Pick B disease (NPD) 删除7:<u>( )</u>, promoted us to examine whether PGRN would have therapeutic effects in GD. Indeed, we have found that recombinant PGRN protein is therapeutic against Gaucher disease 删除7:<u>( )</u>. However, there is concern for the long-term usage of PGRN as a drug due to potential oncogenic activity of this growth factor and the established elevation of PGRN levels in various cancer tissues relative to healthy counterparts 删除7:<u>( , )</u>. To address this issue, we devoted considerable effort toward developing a PGRN-derived molecule that retains the GCase-binding and therapeutic activity of PGRN but lacks its oncogenic action. For this purpose, numerous PGRN mutants (i.e. C-terminal deletions, N-terminal deletions, internal deletions, and various combinations) were generated, and their interactions with GCase were tested. According to a series C-terminal and N-terminal deletion mutants, a C-terminal 98 amino acid fragment (from aa 496–593) of PGRN, containing Grn E domain, was found to be both required and sufficient for binding to GCase 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 )</u>. We next examined whether Grn E also is the functional domain that mediates PGRN's therapeutic effect against GD. Type 2 GD fibroblasts (L444P) were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP alone (negative control), PGRN-GFP and CD1-GFP 删除2:<u>(deletion of Grn E domain, Fig. 3 e)</u>, and the correction of lysosomal storage was analyzed with LysoTracker Deep Red. By comparing the lysosomes in the transfected (GFP + ) and non-transfected (GFP − ) cells, we found that lysosomal storage was significantly reduced in cells expressing PGRN-GFP, compared to non-transfected cells. Interestingly, the Grn E domain is also required for PGRN-mediated therapeutic function, as the transfection of CD1-GFP, similar to the transfection with GFP empty vector, did not show any therapeutic effect 删除2:<u>( Fig. 5 a, b )</u>.\n\n【86】Fig. 5 Development of Pcgin. (a) Overexpression of PGRN, but not its mutant lacking Grn E, significantly reduces lysosomal storage in type 2 GD fibroblasts (L444P). GD fibroblasts were transiently transfected with plasmid encoding either GFP alone, GFP fused PGRN, or its mutant lacking GrnE (CD1-GFP), and LysoTracker® Deep Red were added after transfection, and live images were taken. Red color represents level of lysosome signal, and the green color reflects cells expressing GFP (vector) or GFP-fused proteins. Lysosomal content was compared between GFP + and GFP − cells. (b) Quantification analysis of the therapeutic effects of PGRN and its mutant. Ten images were taken for each sample, and fluorescence (FL) intensity of lysosomal signals from GFP + and GFP − cells were selected and quantified by Image J. The therapeutic effects were determined by comparison of the red fluorescence intensity between GFP + and GFP − cells. (c) Scheme of Pcgin and its deletion mutants. (d) Co-IP assays for examining the binding of Pcgin and its mutants to GCase and HSP70. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding either GFP fused Pcgin, or its mutants, together with plasmids encoding RFP fused GCase and HSP70, and the protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with GFP antibody and probed with RFP or HSP70 antibodies respectively. The bottom panel shows expression of Pcgin and its mutants in the transfected cells. The result is representative of three independent experiments. (e) Evaluation of the therapeutic effects of Pcgin and its mutations in type 2 GD fibroblasts (L444P). Fibroblasts from type 2 GD were transiently transfected with pEGFP control vector, or plasmid encoding Pcgin or its mutants. LysoTracker® Deep Red was added after transfection, and live images were taken by DV live-cell imaging system. GFP + cells with reduced lysosome staining exhibit a green color, while GFP + cells with a high level of lysosome staining give rise to a yellow color (GFP + cells are indicated with white arrow). (f) Quantification analysis of the therapeutic effects of Pcgin and its mutants. Ten images were taken for each sample, and fluorescence intensity of lysosomal staining from GFP + and GFP − cells were quantified by Image J. The therapeutic effects were determined by comparison of the red fluorescence intensity between GFP + and GFP − cells. (g) Structure and sequence of Pcgin. Pcgin is derived from C-terminal human PGRN from aa496-593, containing Grn E and linker regions on both sides 删除2:<u>(top panel)</u>. Sequence of Pcgin is shown in bottom panel. Linker regions and Grn E are highlighted in green and red, respectively. Binding sites of GCase, HSP70, and Sortilin are indicated. One-way ANOVA was used to compare means among multiple groups (Data are represented as mean ± SEM, \\* p < 0.05; \\*\\* p < 0.01; two sided).\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【87】To identify the “minimal fragment” that retains GCase-binding and therapeutic activity of PGRN, we dissected C-terminal 98-aa fragment with five fine-tune deletions 删除2:<u>( Fig. 5 c, d)</u>. Deletion of the linker on the left, i.e. Δ496–522, the region of aa540–573 and the linker on the right of GrnE, i.e. Δ574–593, did not affect the binding to GCase and HSP70 删除2:<u>( Fig. 5 c, d)</u>, but abolished the molecule's therapeutic effects in type 2 GD fibroblasts (L444P) 删除2:<u>( Fig. 5 e, f)</u>, suggesting that these regions may be needed for maintaining the proper functional conformation. However, deletion of 12 (aa523–534) and of 5 (aa535–539, RDNRQ) amino acid fragments completely abolished the binding activity to GCase and HSP70, respectively, indicating these 12 amino acids and the RDNRQ motif are responsible for binding to GCase and HSP70, respectively. Intriguingly, deletion of these critical motifs/fragments led to more severe phenotypes as compared to controls 删除2:<u>( Fig. 5 e, f)</u>, suggesting that these mutants might act as the dominant negatives of endogenous PGRN. Taken together, these results suggest that the C-terminal 98 amino acid fragment appears to be the “minimal” molecule that retains GCase-binding and functional activities. This molecule was referred to as Pcgin ( P GRN C \\-terminus for G Case In teraction). The structure and amino acid sequence of Pcgin are shown in Fig. 5 g.\n\n【88】### 3.5 Pcgin Effectively Ameliorates the Phenotypes of GD\n\n【89】Pcgin was expressed in bacteria and purified as a His-tagged protein. The purity was examined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE electrophoresis gels and confirmed by Western blotting with His probe 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 a )</u>. Using a solid phase binding assay 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 b)</u>, we found that recombinant Pcgin directly bound to GCase, HSP70 and sortilin (known to bind to the last three amino acids QLL of PGRN and serving as a positive control) 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Although Pcgin retained the GCase and HSP70 binding activity of PGRN, it lacked PGRN's oncogenic activity, including PGRN-activated oncogenic signaling and cell proliferation (data not shown).\n\n【90】Fig. 6 Pcgin is therapeutic against GD in vitro and in vivo. (a) Expression and characterization of recombinant Pcgin. The purified Pcgin was analyzed by Coomassie blue staining (left) and Western blotting with anti-His antibody (right). (b) Recombinant Pcgin directly binds to GCase and HSP70 (Solid phase binding). Pcgin was coated on a 96-well plate and incubated with biotin-labeled GCase, HSP70, and Sortilin (serving as a positive control) respectively. Direct binding was detected by an ELISA-based method. (c) Pcgin reduces lysosomal storage as measured by lysotracker intensity. Type 2 GD fibroblasts (L444P) cultured in 96-well plates were stimulated with lipid lysis, and treated with Pcgin (5 μg/ml) or PGRN (0.4 μg/ml) for 24 h. The cells were stained with LysoTracker Red and the fluorescence intensity read using SpectraMax i3x plate reader. This data is representative of at least three independent experiments.

Gaucher cell number (l) and Gaucher cell sizes (m) were significantly reduced after Pcgin treatment. (n) Pcgin reduces β-GlcCer storage in OVA-challenged PGRN KO mice. Spleens of PGRN KO mice from (k) were used to measure the levels of β-GlcCer.

Similar to PGRN, recombinant Pcgin significantly reduced lysosomal storage content in the fibroblasts from type 2 GD L444P fibroblasts (measured by LysoTracker intensity recorded via plate reader) 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 c)</u> and D409H fibroblasts(measured by fluorescence microscopy, followed by quantification) 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 d, e)</u>. In addition, Pcgin also effectively increased the lysosomal localization of mutant GCase (N370S) in type 1 GD fibroblasts, visualized by MDW933 labeling 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 f, g)</u>. Pcgin also reduced lysosome storage and increased lysosomal localization of mutant GCase (L444P) in type 2 GD fibroblasts 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 h)</u>. In addition, Pcgin treatment led to significant reduction in β-GlcCer storage and increase of GCase activity in type 2 GD fibroblasts (L444P) 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 i, j)</u>. We also examined Pcgin's therapeutic effect in the animal model. GD phenotype was induced by OVA challenge in 8-week-old PGRN deficient mice as described above (n = 6 per group). Pcgin (4 mg/kg/week) was I.P injected starting from the first week of intranasal challenge and continuing for 5 weeks, at which point, the mice were sacrificed. Another group was injected with imiglucerase as a positive control. In the untreated group, mice developed severe GD–like phenotype and large Gaucher cells occupied lung tissues. However, histology of lung tissue revealed dramatic improvement in the Pcgin treated group 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 k)</u>. Quantified data reveals that Pcgin significantly reduced number and size of Gaucher cells 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 l, m)</u>. Lipid composition analysis confirmed that Pcgin significantly reduced β-GlcCer storage as well 删除2:<u>( Fig. 6 n)</u>. These results suggest that Pcgin may be a promising drug candidate in treating Gaucher disease.\n\n【92】4\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\n【93】Recently we reported that PGRN is a previously unrecognized factor that associates with GD 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Serum level of PGRN is significantly lower in GD patients than in healthy controls, and we have identified 4 SNP sites which may contribute to the low levels of PGRN in GD patients 删除7:<u>( )</u>. In addition, aged PGRN null mice spontaneously develop Gaucher-like phenotypes 删除7:<u>( )</u>. In the present study, we demonstrate that PGRN directly bound to GCase and was essential for the lysosomal appearance of GCase. In addition, HSP70, known to be crucial in unlocking protein disaggregation 删除7:<u>( , )</u>, was isolated as one of numerous GCase-associated proteins dependent on the presence of PGRN in our unbiased proteomic screen. Interestingly, the interaction between GCase and HSP70, as well as their involvement in GD, had been reported previously 删除7:<u>( , )</u>, although the nature of this association was unclear. In addition, the binding of PGRN to HSP70 was also independently reported 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Our studies disclosed PGRN as an indispensable co-chaperone that links GCase/LIMP2 complex to HSP70. Although PGRN binds to and co-localizes with GCase in all traffic compartments, as early as the ER and Golgi apparatus, the interactions of GCase/LIMP2 with HSP70 highly depend on OVA challenge 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 , Fig. 4 , Fig. S11)</u>. These results suggest that recruitment of HSP70 to the GCase/LIMP2 complex through PGRN may be stress- or disease-dependent. Under physiological conditions, GCase/LIMP2 associates with PGRN in traffic compartments, including ER/Golgi apparatus, and basal level of HSP70 may not interact or marginally interacts with this complex. Whereas under stressed or pathological conditions, such as OVA challenge, lipid stimulation and/or _GBA1_ mutations, GCase/LIMP2 complex aggregates in the cytoplasm 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 f)</u>, the HSP70 disaggregation system will be recruited to GCase/LIMP2 complex through PGRN as an indispensable co-chaperone, to unlock the disaggregation of GCase/LIMP2 complex. Thus, PGRN-dependent association with HSP70 is specifically crucial for preventing the aggregation of the GCase/LIMP2 complex under pathological conditions. It is also noted that the level of HSP70 is much higher than that of PGRN 删除2:<u>( Fig. 4 f)</u>, indicating that the level of PGRN may be the rate-limiting step for HSP70-mediated disaggregation of GCase/LIMP2 aggregates. Thus, it is conceivable that supplementing PGRN 删除7:<u>( )</u> or its derivative Pcgin may enrich or enhance the utility of HSP70, leading to the effective amelioration of GD phenotypes in various models tested 删除2:<u>( Figs. 6 )</u>.\n\n【94】Although failing to recruit HSP70 disaggregation system to GCase/LIMP2 complex may largely account for the OVA-induced GD-like phenotype in PGRN KO mice, some known functions of PGRN may also contribute to understanding the unexpected observations in OVA-challenged PGRN KO mice. For instance, PGRN associates with TNF receptors and possesses the ability to suppress inflammation in various conditions 删除7:<u>( , )</u>, the lack of PGRN thus likely leads to an abnormal macrophage response during OVA-induced inflammation 删除2:<u>(Fig. S1)</u>. In addition, inflammation is known to be involved in multiple sphingolipid LSDs and anti-inflammatory drugs have benefits in treating LSDs when used alone or combined with other treatments 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Furthermore, PGRN has been implicated in ER-stress related unfolded protein response 删除7:<u>( )</u>, which may play a key role in cell death in GD 删除7:<u>( )</u>. The loss of PGRN leads to the abnormal ER stress responses and the aggregation of various proteins in the cytoplasm, such as TDP-43 删除7:<u>( , )</u> and GCase/LIMP2 (this paper). Recently, it was reported that RIPK3, a component of the TNFR1 signaling complex that mediates necroptosis, was also involved in the pathology of GD and inhibiting RIPK3 might be a novel therapeutic approach for GD 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Thus, PGRN's anti-TNF and anti-cell death activities may also contribute to its therapeutic effects in GD and other LSDs.\n\n【95】Many _GRN_ gene mutations have been reported, and most of these mutations lead to reduced levels of PGRN 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Insufficiency of PGRN has been associated with many types of neurodegenerative diseases including FTD, Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Our finding that PGRN is an indispensable co-chaperone of HSP70 disaggregation system required for lysosomal localization of GCase/LIMP2 may also have relevance to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Mutation of the _GRN_ gene may directly affect the HSP70-based disaggregases 删除7:<u>( )</u> and in turn lead to defects in the clearance of proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as TDP-43 and α-synuclein, or indirectly affect the function of lysosomes resulting from the impairment of GCase lysosomal localization and consequent accumulation of glucosylceramide 删除7:<u>( )</u>. Thus, the identification of PGRN as a co-chaperone of HSP70 for GCase lysosomal appearance may also help us to better understand the putative molecular mechanisms underlying _GRN_ mutation-associated neurodegenerative disorders. Further, heterozygosity for mutations in the _GBA1_ gene may be a risk factor for PD 删除7:<u>( )</u>, this indicates that there may exist a functional and a genetic linkage between _GRN_ and _GBA1_ genes, and that their homozygous or heterozygous mutations cause or render some carriers vulnerable to rare (i.e. GD) and/or common (i.e. PD) diseases.\n\n【96】Although Pcgin is a 98 amino acid c-terminal PGRN fragment, it demonstrates comparable therapeutic effects with PGRN in several types of GD patient fibroblasts bearing common _GBA1_ mutations and our GD mouse model. Future investigations with additional GD models are warranted to further test the therapeutic effect and safety of Pcgin. Pcgin possesses features that suggest it may compare favorably to currently marketed GD drugs. For example, currently marketed drugs are enzyme replacement or substrate reduction therapies. In contrast, Pcgin functions as a co-chaperone of HSP70 and enhances the disaggregation and lysosomal appearance of mutant lysosomal enzymes. Due to this alternate mechanism of action, Pcgin may be effective for other LSDs in addition to GD. Additionally, Pcgin's safety (lacking PGRN's potential oncogenic activity) and ease of production (as a small ~ 15 kD recombinant protein) suggest that it may be a viable cost-effective agent for the clinical treatment of LSDs, in particular GD.\n\n【97】In summary, this study identifies PGRN as a previously-unrecognized molecule associated with GCase, thus providing a foundation for future discoveries relating to this critical factor in GD and other lysosomal storage diseases. In addition, it also isolates PGRN as a co-chaperone of HSP70 disaggregation system, thus uncovering a unique strategy to target this cardinal pathway of metabolic diseases. More importantly, we have developed a PGRN derivative, Pcgin, which effectively ameliorates the phenotypes of GD in several preclinical models. With the consideration that HSP70 is involved in a plethora of disease processes, the identification and manipulation of this new co-chaperone of HSP70 may lead to innovative therapeutics for LSDs, in particular GD, and other metabolic pathologies and conditions.\n\n【98】Author Contributions\n--------------------\n\n【99】J.

These recommendations seemed out of place in view of the fact that 56% of pregnancies in the region are unintended. Poor quality of sex education, poor access to contraception, high prevalence of rape, and cultural barriers that make it difficult for women to negotiate the use of contraception with their partners, result in large groups of women who do not have control over their sexual and reproductive lives.\n\n【1】No reliable information is currently being offered to women who are already pregnant and their families about the confirmed or potential risks of Zika virus infection, the different types of microcephaly that the virus might cause and the consequences of each type depending on its severity, and how to safely carry the pregnancy to term or access an abortion when allowed by law. The countries most affected by Zika virus have widely varying laws on women's sexual and reproductive rights. In El Salvador, for example, abortion is completely outlawed, and many women who have had miscarriages are serving prison sentences of up to 40 years on abortion charges.\n\n【2】Even in countries with more progressive laws that allow termination of pregnancy when there is a risk to the woman's health, such as Colombia, many women are unaware of this right because of a scarcity of information. The Colombian Ministry of Health has been clear that women do have the right to have an abortion, and that although the physician is the person who determines whether a risk to the physical, mental, or social wellbeing of the woman is present, the decision remains in the woman's hands. However, local health authorities at municipal levels, who are closer to women at risk, are not providing enough information to these women about the risks and the choices available according to the law.\n\n【3】The Zika virus outbreak is exposing the tragic failures of reproductive health and rights policies in Latin America. Too many women, particularly those living with social inequality and vulnerability, face two risk factors in relation to Zika virus infection during pregnancy. These women and girls often have poor access to reproductive health and rights information and services, and their housing and local environments disproportionately expose them to areas that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes.\n\n【4】The Zika virus crisis offers a belated opportunity for governments to begin to close gaps in sex education and access to contraceptives, safe motherhood, safe abortion, and programmes to prevent discrimination and exclusion of people living with disabilities. If governments do not take this opportunity, the Zika virus will not only be a public health issue, but also exacerbate existing gender inequalities and social injustice.\n删除4:<u>\n**This online publication has been corrected.

Direct inhibition of MEK blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. We aimed to analyse safety, efficacy, and genotyping data for the oral, small-molecule MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with melanoma.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We undertook a multicentre, phase 1 three-part study (dose escalation, cohort expansion, and pharmacodynamic assessment). The main results of this study are reported elsewhere; here we present data relating to patients with melanoma. We obtained tumour samples to assess BRAF mutational status, and available tissues underwent exploratory genotyping analysis. Disease response was measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and adverse events were defined by common toxicity criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00687622.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】97 patients with melanoma were enrolled, including 81 with cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma (36 BRAF mutant, 39 BRAF wild-type, six BRAF status unknown), and 16 with uveal melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash or dermatitis acneiform (n=80; 82%) and diarrhoea (44; 45%), most of which were grade 2 or lower. No cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas were recorded. Of 36 patients with BRAF mutations, 30 had not received a BRAF inhibitor before; two complete responses (both confirmed) and ten partial responses (eight confirmed) were noted in this subgroup (confirmed response rate, 33%). Median progression-free survival of this subgroup was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·0–7·4). Of the six patients who had received previous BRAF inhibition, one unconfirmed partial response was recorded. Of 39 patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma, four partial responses were confirmed (confirmed response rate, 10%).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Our data show substantial clinical activity of trametinib in melanoma and suggest that MEK is a valid therapeutic target. Differences in response rates according to mutations indicate the importance of mutational analyses in the future.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】GlaxoSmithKline.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Oncology_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

Foundational to any weight loss effort is lifestyle change, diet, and increased physical activity. The approach should be a high quality diet to which patients will adhere accompanied by an exercise prescription describing frequency, intensity, type, and time with a minimum of 150 min moderate weekly activity. For patients who struggle with weight loss and who would receive health benefit from weight loss, management of medications that are contributing to weight gain and use of approved medications for chronic weight management along with lifestyle changes are appropriate. Medications approved in the USA or European Union are orlistat, naltrexone/bupropion, and liraglutide; in the USA, lorcaserin and phentermine/topiramate are also available. Surgical management (gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, and Roux-en Y gastric bypass) can produce remarkable health improvement and reduce mortality for patients with severe obesity.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

We also agree that long-term health-care engagement and use are important issues.\n\n【1】However, we think that there is no conflict between our results and those of previous studies and systematic reviews. These studies did not investigate overall mortality during current or cumulative antipsychotic use compared with no use or a reference drug, but instead looked at the number of concomitant antipsychotics at baseline (not at the time of death), or mainly the role of antipsychotic dose or polypharmacy.\n\n【2】In the review of 12 studies, one study showed that cardiovascular risk was inversely associated with the intensity of use of antipsychotic drugs. This finding indicates that regular contact with health-care personnel might have a beneficial effect on physical morbidity. For example, it is possible that increased blood glucose and lipid concentrations are detected earlier in patients taking clozapine, who give blood samples regularly. This might result in earlier treatments—eg, with statins.\n\n【3】In any case, when choosing between treatment options, the most important issue for the patient, his or her family, and the doctor is how well the treatment actually works; what factors explain the good outcome are less important. We think that regular monitoring might also be beneficial for antipsychotics other than clozapine.\n\n【4】We agree with M De Hert and colleagues with respect to their comment on older drugs. We stated that the patients “represent a cohort of survivors. Therefore, mortality of patients using first-generation antipsychotic drugs ( _vs_ second-generation antipsychotic drugs) might be underestimated.” Clozapine was reintroduced in Finland in the beginning of the 1990s, but its use started to grow rapidly only after the mid 1990s. The use of clozapine increased by 159% between 1996 and 2006, whereas perphenazine use decreased during the same time period. Therefore, we can assume that, in the comparison between clozapine and perphenazine, the antisuicidal effect of clozapine may have been underestimated.\n\n【5】Concerning De Hert and colleagues' comment on cardiovascular mortality, we did not interpret our findings as evidence that antipsychotic medications do not affect cardiovascular mortality. The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality, and for secondary outcomes (such as ischaemic heart disease mortality), only comparisons between specific medications and perphenazine were done.\n\n【6】Concerning the comments by Wolfgang Sperling and Teresa Biermann, we regret that, owing to limitations of space, it was not possible to present results concerning exact causes of death.\n\n【7】We state on page 625: “In the long term, good adherence to treatment might lead to a healthy lifestyle which might compensate for the adverse cardiometabolic effects of clozapine”. Thus, we totally agree with the comment by Alain Dervaux and Xavier Laqueille that a reduction in substance abuse could be the link between clozapine treatment and reduced mortality in patients with schizophrenia.\n\n【8】删除9:<u>I declare that I have no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

There is a large amount of literature on strategies for knowledge translation or more discursive knowledge exchange. However, little evidence exists for their effectiveness and underlying mechanisms, especially with regard to multisectoral, multidisciplinary evidence in knowledge mobilisation. Taking the opportunity of a knowledge exchange forum at the end of a natural experimental study, we investigated how stakeholders assess, negotiate, and use multisectoral evidence.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Participants represented both existing and newly interested stakeholders of the natural experimental study, from national and local government, the third sector, and academia. We conducted participant observation during an interactive event with 41 stakeholders and semi-structured interviews with 17 of them. Formal and informal interactions between stakeholders were recorded in field notes. Interviews considered the event format and content as well as knowledge exchange in general. Thematic content analysis of field notes and transcripts was undertaken.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Stakeholders working across sectors expressed uncertainties about finding a common language between research and practice and between sectors, and about who had the capacity to translate across these boundaries. They also expressed differing expectations of evidence. Whereas public health specialists tended to have a hierarchical view of evidence that favoured trials, transport specialists tended to prefer case studies as precedents for workable solutions. However, stakeholders encountered uncertainties about their preferred evidence. Population health studies generated more complex results than did those of apparently clear-cut randomised controlled trials; case studies highlighted the context-dependency of evidence and difficulties in transferring insights across settings. Finally, stakeholders had to reconcile uncertainties about “health in all remits”. Despite its premise, public health was not always acknowledged to contribute to the goals of other policy sectors, and stakeholders had to negotiate competing priorities, such as those between health improvement and economic growth, or between integrated and designated budgets.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】This case study of stakeholders' experiences indicates that multisectoral research, practice, and policymaking require the ability and capacity to locate, understand, and communicate complex evidence from a variety of disciplines, and integrate different types of evidence into clear business cases.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Public Health Research Programme (project number 09/3001/06) as part of the Commuting and Health in Cambridge study; and initially funded by the Centre for Diet and Activity Research, a UKCRC Public Health Research Centre of Excellence, with funding from the British Heart Foundation, Economic and Social Research Council, Medical Research Council (MRC), NIHR, and the Wellcome Trust, under the auspices of the UK Clinical Research Collaboration.

The trial was designed as a pragmatic trial of a policy of general anaesthesia versus a policy of local anaesthesia, and we allowed individual centres to provide these techniques and surgery in the way they currently practised. Thus any subsidiary analysis of individual local anaesthetic techniques will be non-randomised (and, moreover, selected by the anaesthetist after the randomised treatment was allocated), and will have to be interpreted very carefully indeed. Even if the overall type of local anaesthetic block had been controlled, there would still have been substantial differences in performance of the technique, choice of type and dose of local anaesthetic agents, addition of vasoconstrictors with potential systemic effects, choice of supplementary sedative or analgesic drugs, antiemetics, antibiotics, and other interventions, all of which can have a potential treatment effect. Similar problems would be likely in trying to control general anaesthetic techniques.\n\n【1】We agree with Lulong Bo and Keming Zhu that maintaining cerebral blood flow and perfusion pressure and reducing cardiac stress are all important. We also agree that complications are of great importance and we are currently preparing a paper on that subject. We are also planning a paper giving greater detail of the anaesthetic techniques used. It was not possible to analyse every part of the data we collected in the short time between database lock and publication, and, in addition, _The Lancet_ has a strict word limit, and we could not present all of the analyses that we did do.

Diagnosis is usually easily made from the presented history, making it the least challenging part of patients' management. However, owing to fear of police involvement, the history could be deliberately misleading. We present two cases with no initial suspicion of gunshot wounds, but in whom the diagnosis was made incidentally after radiographic studies.\n\n【1】The first patient was an adult who presented to the emergency department of a central London hospital with a vague history of blunt facial trauma during an altercation. Initial examination revealed a small (3 mm×3 mm) laceration over the left mandibular region, with severe tenderness and swelling over both anterior triangles of the neck.\n\n【2】Plain neck radiograph 删除2:<u>( figure )</u> showed a comminuted fracture of the mandible and, at the lower left corner of the film, a highly radio-opaque shadow (circled). After excluding the possibility of artifact, the diagnosis of gunshot wound was made despite persistent denial by the patient of firearm involvement. Subsequent chest radiograph and CT scans of the head, neck, and chest confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was observed overnight and had an internal fixation of the mandible at a later date.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure Radiographic findings of two patients who denied sustaining gunshot wounds</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【3】The second patient was an adult who presented to the same emergency department with a left-sided chest wound after allegedly falling onto a blunt object. The patient was otherwise symptom-free and examination was unremarkable except for a 4 mm diameter round laceration inferior to the left clavicle.\n\n【4】Radiological examination of the chest showed a 5 mm foreign body and a small apical pneumothorax 删除2:<u>( figure )</u>. Again the patient denied firearm involvement. The patient was treated conservatively and admitted for overnight observation. The police were informed, but, on learning of their involvement, the patient absconded, taking the hospital records.\n\n【5】The UK General Medical Council (GMC) recommends that all gunshot wounds be reported to the police in the interest of public safety. Although the disclosure does not require giving the patient's personal details, this is often difficult to avoid in practical terms. In an attempt to avoid police involvement, victims might deny any link with firearms, especially if there is involvement in gangs or criminal activity. Eliciting a history can therefore become a challenge, with the risk of missing the diagnosis. A high index of suspicion for ballistics injury might help in reaching a diagnosis obscured by a vague history inconsistent with clinical findings; further imaging might be appropriate.\n\n【6】Considering that penetrating trauma in the UK is much more likely to involve knives, the issues outlined above could become more common with the proposed GMC policy to report all knife crime also. This could lead to an increased potential for misleading stories and patients absconding when police are involved, leaving us with the ethical dilemmas of whether the benefits to the general public outweigh the risks to the victim and of who has the priority of our duty of care.\n\n【7】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Prednisone (20 mg per day) was maintained from March to August, 2011. 5 months before presentation, she had several falls and she received local care with 3 stitches for a chin wound in April 2011, and was given a first tetanus vaccination. She had not previously been vaccinated for tetanus and complete vaccination was proposed, but she refused. In August, 2011, she had another fall, resulting in a severe wound to her left leg. She was given oral amoxicillin clavulanate and daily wound care for a week. She reported 10 days afterwards, dysphagia, gait instability, dysarthria, stiffness of the neck, and intractable trismus. She was referred the same day to our hospital. On presentation, she was alert and fully oriented. Core temperature was 37°C. She was severely malnourished.

Are the 330 000 Rwandan girls who will be vaccinated against a highly prevalent, oncogenic virus for free during the first phase of this programme not regarded as “the people”?\n\n【1】Ouedraogo and colleagues argue that cervical cancer ranks behind other vaccine-preventable diseases in resource-constrained settings. But for the diseases cited (measles and tetanus), Rwanda has 95% and 96·8% vaccination coverage rates, respectively. Second, Ouedraogo and colleagues state that HPV vaccine effectiveness is unknown. Many studies say otherwise. Third, the cost-effectiveness analysis cited does not account for vaccine market dynamics by presenting assumptions as immutable facts. The initial price of the pneumococcal vaccine provides a helpful lesson, and Merck announced a two-thirds reduction in the price of Gardasil for GAVI-eligible countries (to US$5 per dose) more than a month before Ouedraogo and colleagues published their Correspondence letter. Finally, Ouedraogo and colleagues accuse Merck and Rwanda of conflicts of interest regarding connections to the GAVI Alliance. Actually, Merck representatives are non-voting GAVI observers, and GAVI's website clearly shows Rwanda's board membership terminating on Dec 31, 2011. GAVI will have no role in the HPV vaccine programme before 2014.\n\n【2】Ouedraogo and colleagues' argument reminds us of nihilistic claims against provision of antiretroviral therapy in Africa. Their argument constitutes but the latest backlash against progressive health policies by African countries. When the possibility of prevention exists, writing off women to die of cancer solely because of where they are born is a violation of human rights.\n\n【3】删除9:<u>The opinions expressed in this Correspondence are entirely those of the authors and should not be attributed to Harvard Medical School or Dartmouth College.

No HGA-lowering therapy has been approved to date. The aim of SONIA 2 was to investigate the efficacy and safety of once-daily nitisinone for reducing HGA excretion in patients with alkaptonuria and to evaluate whether nitisinone has a clinical benefit.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】SONIA 2 was a 4-year, open-label, evaluator-blind, randomised, no treatment controlled, parallel-group study done at three sites in the UK, France, and Slovakia. Patients aged 25 years or older with confirmed alkaptonuria and any clinical disease manifestations were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral nitisinone 10 mg daily or no treatment. Patients could not be masked to treatment due to colour changes in the urine, but the study was evaluator-blinded as far as possible. The primary endpoint was daily urinary HGA excretion (u-HGA 24 ) after 12 months. Clinical evaluation Alkaptonuria Severity Score Index (cAKUSSI) score was assessed at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months. Efficacy variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients with a valid u-HGA 24 measurement at baseline. Safety variables were analysed in all randomly assigned patients. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01916382).\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between May 7, 2014, and Feb 16, 2015, 139 patients were screened, of whom 138 were included in the study, with 69 patients randomly assigned to each group. 55 patients in the nitisinone group and 53 in the control group completed the study. u-HGA 24 at 12 months was significantly decreased by 99·7% in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted geometric mean ratio of nitisinone/control 0·003 \\[95% CI 0·003 to 0·004\\], p<0·0001). At 48 months, the increase in cAKUSSI score from baseline was significantly lower in the nitisinone group compared with the control group (adjusted mean difference –8·6 points \\[–16·0 to –1·2\\], p=0·023). 400 adverse events occurred in 59 (86%) patients in the nitisinone group and 284 events occurred in 57 (83%) patients in the control group. No treatment-related deaths occurred.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Nitisinone 10 mg daily was well tolerated and effective in reducing urinary excretion of HGA.

The final paper in the Series made a call to scale up evidence-based packages of services for people with mental disorders with a commitment to the protection of human rights. The Series and the call to action that concluded it has received support from leaders in world health 删除2:<u>( panel 1 )</u>. 1 year on, we take stock of the effect of this Series, focusing on implementation of the call for action. Although 1 year is a short time to see substantial outcomes, and definitively attributing events to the Series is impossible, our objective is to discern the commitment of stakeholders and the general direction they are taking since publication. We consulted the members of an advisory group set up soon after the Series was published to track major events. Only events that explicitly cited or were based on _The Lancet's_ Series were counted. We have organised our findings in four broad themes: the effect on global advocacy; the effect on global-health programmes; the effect on policies, resources, and professional societies; and the launch of a new Movement for Global Mental Health.\n\n【1】Panel 1\n\n【2】**Support from leaders of global health organisations**\n\n【3】*   •\n\n【4】    “The _Lancet_ Movement on Global Mental Health is being very successful in: a) emphasizing the multiple interrelations between mental disorders and other health conditions and the practical implications of this comorbidity; b) mobilizing the interest of national authorities and other stakeholders about such issues as decentralization of resources and implementation of community care; c) giving visibility to some exemplary experiences of mental health care in various regions of the world; d) promoting the development of a consensus in the mental health field about some basic messages to be delivered consistently worldwide. The WPA will be delighted to contribute to these efforts.” Mario Maj, President, World Psychiatric Association\n\n【5】*   •\n\n【6】    “Evidence can also bring attention to neglected health problems. As one recent example, WHO worked closely with _The Lancet_ to generate evidence and formulate a call for action to increase coverage of mental health services in low- and middle-income countries. The data, published in September, generated broad media coverage. This is an important step towards correcting a bleak situation: mental health services are being starved of both human and financial resources.” Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director General\n\n【7】*   •\n\n【8】    “Mental disorder is a hugely neglected problem in the developing countries. It is wonderful that _The Lancet_ has collaborated with a remarkable group of scholars and practitioners to work out what steps need to be taken to remedy the neglect. The results of their work and the attention they are generating are already having a significant impact. I am sure this continuing work will succeed in making a big difference to the lives of some of the most deprived people in the world.” Professor Amartya Sen, Nobel Laureate\n\n【9】Raising awareness of mental health is key to improving policies and practices, increasing access to services, and reducing persistent stigma. The World Federation for Mental Health established World Mental Health Day in 1992, and coordinates and promotes its commemoration on Oct 10 every year. The only annual global awareness campaign focusing specific attention on mental health and mental disorders, World Mental Health Day is now marked in over 100 countries through public awareness and education events. The theme in 2008 is “Making Mental Health A Global Priority—Scaling Up Services through Citizen Advocacy and Action”. World Mental Health Day, 2008, uses the information and messages contained in _The Lancet_ 's Series to encourage renewed attention to the need for well-informed mental-health public policy advocacy at all levels in countries throughout the world. The aim of this year's campaign is to generate a sense of urgency and to fuel advocacy efforts locally and globally to scale up services for people living with mental disorders. The central message of World Mental Health Day, 2008, is clear: “It is time for governments throughout the world to listen and act to improve mental health services and increase availability and access to services by those experiencing serious mental health problems and disorders such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and depression.” The specific focus on civil society calls upon citizens, human-rights groups, and non-governmental organisations to implement the call for action through several interlinked strategies 删除2:<u>( panel 2 )</u>.\n\n【10】Panel 2\n\n【11】**Strategies for civil society to scale up services for people living with mental disorders**\n\n【12】*   •\n\n【13】    Become mobilised to advocate for an improved national mental-health policy and plan that provides effective interventions and human-rights protection\n\n【14】*   •\n\n【15】    Network with other user and health movements to support the implementation of the improved national mental-health plan\n\n【16】*   •\n\n【17】    Demand state recognition of and support for the crucial role played by families in caring for people with mental disorders\n\n【18】*   •\n\n【19】    Strengthen family support networks and service development\n\n【20】*   •\n\n【21】    Facilitate the provision of social supports (housing, work, social networks) for people with mental disorders, building on local resources and adding external resources as needed\n\n【22】*   •\n\n【23】    Facilitate livelihoods and interventions for the inclusion of people with mental disorders in their local communities\n\n【24】*   •\n\n【25】    Develop school mental-health programmes that include both mental-health promotion and interventions for early detection of and inclusion of children with mental disorders\n\n【26】*   •\n\n【27】    Monitor and protect the human rights of people with mental disorders\n\n【28】*   •\n\n【29】    Advocate for the rights of those with severe mental disorders—in particular, people living in mental hospitals—and for mechanisms to protect those rights\n\n【30】*   •\n\n【31】    Join the Movement for Global Mental Health\n\n【32】WHO has recently developed the Mental Health Gap Action Programme to address the large treatment gap for mental, neurological, and substance-use (MNS) disorders. The programme provides health planners, policy makers, and donors with clear and coherent activities and programmes for scaling up care for MNS disorders. The objectives of the programme are to reinforce the commitment of all stakeholders to increase the allocation of financial and human resources for care of MNS disorders and to achieve higher coverage with key interventions, especially in countries with low and low-middle incomes that have large proportions of the global burden attributable to these disorders. The Mental Health Gap Action Programme provides criteria to identify the countries that have a high burden of MNS disorders and a high resource gap. This programme is grounded on the best available evidence about MNS disorders that have been identified as priorities; it promotes the delivery of an integrated package of interventions and takes into account existing and possible barriers to scaling up care. Priority disorders are identified on the basis that they represent a high burden (in terms of mortality, morbidity, and disability), cause large economic costs, or are associated with violations of human rights. These priority disorders are depression, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, suicide, epilepsy, dementia, disorders due to use of alcohol, disorders due to use of illicit drugs, and mental disorders in children and adolescents. The Mental Health Gap Action Programme package consists of interventions for prevention and management for each of these priority disorders, for which there is evidence for the effectiveness and feasibility of scaling up. The programme provides a template for an intervention package that will need to be adapted for countries, or regions within countries, on the basis of local context. The essence of the programme is to establish productive partnerships, to reinforce commitments with existing partners, to attract and energise new partners, and to accelerate efforts and increase investments that will produce a reduction of the burden of MNS disorders. Successful scaling up is the joint responsibility of governments, health professionals, civil society, communities, and families, with support from the international community. The Mental Health Gap Action Programme will be formally launched by the WHO Director General on Oct 9, 2008.\n\n【33】Since the launch of _The Lancet's_ Series in London in September, 2007, there have been country-level launches in Australia, Brazil, Chile, and the USA, and a launch in India will take place later in 2008. All these events were attended by policy makers, consumer representatives, and mental-health professionals, and received wide media coverage. Presentations and symposia have been held in many countries, aimed to educate policy makers, academics, mental-health professionals, non-governmental organisations, health students, and the media about the key messages of the Series. The Series has been profiled in a wide range of other publications, including journal articles, professional society documents, and public science websites. The papers in the Series are used as core teaching materials in existing teaching programmes (for example, courses on international mental health run by the University of Melbourne, Australia, and King's College London and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in the UK) and new courses specifically geared to the call for action (for example, the Leadership in Mental Health Course in India ). Several new research projects have been funded with the aim of generating evidence to scale up evidence-based services for people with mental disorders. Research from low-income and middle-income countries commonly has low visibility because of publication in non-indexed journals; the World Psychiatric Association has therefore appointed a task force and approved a seed grant to offer support to a group of mental-health journal editors from low-income and middle-income countries to identify the steps needed for indexing in the main indexed databases.\n\n【34】_The Lancet's_ Series has been effectively used to support proposals for the development of National Taskforces on Community Mental Health System Development in Vietnam and in Indonesia. The National Taskforce on Community Mental Health System Development in Vietnam was established in February, 2008, in a workshop convened by WHO Vietnam, and hosted by the Research and Training Centre for Community Development, Hanoi, with technical support from the Centre for International Mental Health, University of Melbourne. There are two broad objectives. First, to contribute to the establishment of strategies on national mental-health care for the period 2011–15 (the current National Mental Health Plan ends in 2010) by providing scientific evidence for the development of community policies of mental-health care, especially those related to mothers and children. And second, to encourage the Government of Vietnam to increase the budget for mental-health care to US$2·00 per person each year, as recommended in the call for action in _The Lancet's_ Series, by implementation of a community system of mental-health care and development of policies and service systems on the basis of scientific evidence.\n\n【35】The National Taskforce on Community Mental Health System Development in Indonesia was established by the Directorate of Mental Health of the Indonesian Ministry of Health, in June, 2008, with technical support from the Centre for International Mental Health, University of Melbourne, and financial support from AusAID, Christian Blind Mission, and the University of Melbourne (US$485 000 for 1 year). The taskforce will strengthen the capacity of Indonesia's Ministry of Health to plan, implement, manage, and assess mental-health systems at provincial and district levels, and to develop effective and equitable community-focused mental-health services. Four taskforce working groups will receive training, mentoring, and technical support from the Centre for International Mental Health and will produce proposals for the consideration of government on mental-health legislation, policy, and financing; community mental-health workforce; integrated hospital and community-focused mental-health services; and ethics, human rights, and advocacy. These proposals will be presented and discussed at the seventh International Mental Health System Development Conference in Indonesia in mid-2009, and then presented to the Ministry of Health with a well articulated case for investment in mental-health services.\n\n【36】In January 2008, the Brazilian Ministry of Health created the Support Teams for Family Health Teams (NASF- Núcleos de Apoio a Saúde da Família). The purpose is to strengthen the link between mental-health care and primary care by integrating family-physician teams and mental-health teams and by providing specialised supervision to primary health-care teams. Moreover, there is a commitment to increase substantially the number of psychiatric beds in general hospitals for the admission of those with acute and severe episodes of mental illness. The Chinese National Strategy Plan for Mental Health System Development from 2008 to 2015 was issued in January this year. The plan requires local governments to strengthen capacity of existing systems for providing mental-health care through the integration of psychiatric services in hospitals with community health care and development of community-based rehabilitation services.\n\n【37】The call for action that concluded _The Lancet's_ Series is succinct; however, its implementation will require a radical transformation in global health policy and practice. Change will be incremental, not revolutionary, but will require new and sustained commitment, new investment, and fundamental changes in the way in which care is delivered. Simply issuing the call was never going to be enough. Governments have a particularly important part to play, but many other stakeholders need to get engaged with the problems and work together to advocate, plan for, and implement change. The voices of those most affected—the users of mental-health services and their families—must be heard. Mental-health professionals, technical experts, academics, and policy makers need to show solidarity and work collaboratively. The mental-health community as a whole needs to act with national, regional, and international leaders in public health to ensure the inclusion of mental health on the global public-health policy agenda, and the effective integration of mental-health care into every level of general health care. Hence, the Movement for Global Mental Health , launched today through its website.\n\n【38】The Movement for Global Mental Health was initiated after the launch of _The Lancet's_ Series. The advisory group that led the development of the Series was expanded to ensure greater representation of users, women, and civil society representatives, particularly from low-income and middle-income countries. In the past year, this group has collaborated to define the concept of the movement and its goals. The advisory group has proposed a set of priority actions 删除2:<u>( panel 3 )</u>.\n\n【39】Panel 3\n\n【40】**Priority actions proposed by the advisory group of the Movement for Global Mental Health**\n\n【41】*   1\n\n【42】    A global advocacy campaign to demand that the morally and scientifically indefensible denial of effective care to people with mental disorders and the blatant violations of human rights be immediately addressed\n\n【43】*   2\n\n【44】    Documentation and development of delivery systems for mental-health care, including packages of care for specific disorders and comprehensive programmes of mental-health care for specific groups of people\n\n【45】*   3\n\n【46】    Promotion of research to develop and assess affordable and effective ways of delivering mental-health care in resource-poor settings\n\n【47】*   4\n\n【48】    Building of the capacity of various stakeholder groups, from mental-health professionals to users and families, to be more effective advocates and agents for change\n\n【49】*   5\n\n【50】    Monitoring of progress of countries in scaling up mental-health care and protecting the human rights of people with mental disorders\n\n【51】The advisory group will help to coordinate the campaign, promote the growth of the network and its interactivity, and facilitate the priority actions. Much of this will be achieved through the movement's website, which will evolve into a participatory and interactive medium, with materials, resources, and news and views, all intended to increase the volume and range of activities. The movement will host a Global Mental Health Summit on Sept 2, 2009 (alongside the WFMH World Mental Health Congress, Sept 2–6, 2009) in Athens to take stock of progress.\n\n【52】The movement is not an organisation. It has no constitution, no office, no board of governors, and no budgets. Anybody and any organisation can join the movement; all that is required is support for the specific goals of scaling up services for and protecting the human rights of people living with mental disorders. The network of individuals and organisations committed to these goals will be at the heart of the movement. Through the shared values and coordinated actions that harness the enormous motivation and creativity of the diverse stakeholders for mental health, the movement will seek to achieve its goals. Ultimately, we hope that substantial progress in scaling up services for people with mental disorders will take its place alongside progress in HIV/AIDS treatment and maternal and child survival as one of the great public-health successes of our times.\n\n【53】**Conflict of interest statement**\n\n【54】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflict of interest.</u>\n\n【55】**Acknowledgments**\n\n【56】_The Lancet's_ Series on global mental health was supported by a grant from the John T and Catherine D MacArthur Foundation.

{"seq_id": "5bd94b91-89db-488a-add3-335d403d90c6", "title": "Tobacco advertising still rife in southeast Asia", "text": "【0】Tobacco advertising has a strong foothold in many countries in southeast Asia, where regulations are not only weak but also poorly enforced. Chris McCall reports from Jakarta.\n\n【1】In a skimpy black skirt not much below her hips, a young girl dances to _dangdut_ music, a blend of pop and ancient Javanese rhythms. The women watching her wear long skirts and Muslim headscarfs, but this sales pitch is for the men. She is not selling sex. She is selling cigarettes.\n\n【2】In this small village in western Java, the girl is promoting one of Indonesia's top-selling cigarette brands, and one whose name is spread far and wide on billboards, in cinemas, and on television, at least after 9·30 pm.\n\n【3】Cigarette advertisements can be found on electronic billboards at airports, on point-of-sale adverts at small shops selling cigarettes along with other day-to-day items, and even on banners over Indonesia's trademark _warung_ —the small roadside restaurants where millions of consumers eat lunch daily. It can be seen on billboards over roads. You just cannot get away from them. They project images of sky-diving, sports cars, and a luxury life way beyond most Indonesians' means, but not beyond their dreams. For those from other countries used to smoke-free public spaces, a trip to Indonesia is like a step back in time.\n\n【4】Official data show nearly two-thirds of adult Indonesian men smoke. A particularly popular style of cigarette is the _kretek_ , which mixes tobacco with cloves. The distinct smell of a _kretek_ is often the first thing visitors notice on arrival in the country.\n\n【5】At the same time, Indonesia and its population of around 240 million has a serious problem with tuberculosis and other lung diseases, not to mention other smoking-related illnesses. The kind of advertising seen in Indonesia would be illegal in many other countries, including neighbouring Singapore. But in Indonesia and at least some of its neighbours, it is all still largely regarded as normal.\n\n【6】Around southeast Asia\n---------------------\n\n【7】And although tobacco control advocates say Indonesia's record on tobacco advertising is the worst in the region, some of its neighbours are not that far ahead. Most countries in the region now have laws to control tobacco advertising, in some shape or form, even if implementation is often patchy. Tobacco control advocates hope they are slowly winning a battle of attrition with tobacco companies. “We don't know if we are winning or not. We can say that we are winning based on the law”, said Worrawan Jirathanapiwat, a Thai official of the Southeast Asia Tobacco Control Alliance.\n\n【8】In Laos, it is umbrellas at cafés. In the Philippines it is slogans on roofs, scholarships, and prominent press releases at times of disaster relief, pointing out generous donations to victims.\n\n【9】For Jirathanapiwat, there is a fundamental difference between tobacco companies and other lines of business. Normal commercial issues of advertising and marketing a product simply do not apply here, for one simple reason, the clients' lives are actually at stake. “In other businesses companies don't kill the consumer. But cigarettes kill the consumer”, she said.\n\n【10】In 2003, WHO negotiated the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which came into force in 2005 and has been adopted since then by most countries around the world. There are two large countries that are notable exceptions. The USA is one and Indonesia is the other.\n\n【11】Tobacco advertising\n-------------------\n\n【12】A law on tobacco advertising was finally passed by Jakarta in 2012, but it is very weak and most forms of tobacco advertising are still permitted. The only substantial restriction is that advertising on television is only permitted between 9·30 pm and 5·00 am.\n\n【13】In Indonesia's university city of Yogyakarta lives Sambudiono, a 47-year-old smoker and father of one, with a second child on the way. His job is filling up large plastic bottles of drinking water that his clients keep at home. The shop he works at uses spring water taken from up on the slopes of the volcanoes that run all along the island of Java. He has to carry the bottles, each with a capacity of 19 litres, to people's homes slung over his shoulders. It is hard work. Like most Indonesian men, he says he smokes to relax. “I have smoked since high school. I have been smoking a long time. I have tried to give up but I couldn't do it”, said Sambudiono.\n\n【14】A schoolboy passes billboards advertising tobacco products in Sumba, Indonesia\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2014 Chris McCall</u>\n\n【15】Like most smokers, Sambudiono does not think he is influenced by cigarette advertising, although he sees it all the time and he has been smoking since he was about 15 years old. He reads the health warnings on the cigarette packets and he knows it is unhealthy. His wife would like him to give up and his son, who is only aged 4 years, frequently tells him not to smoke. But he says he will never give up. “I will always smoke as long as there is tobacco”, he says.\n\n【16】Yayi Prabandari is a psychologist at the public health unit of Yogyakarta's prestigious Gadjah Mada University. She says people like Sambudiono have got it wrong. They clearly are influenced by cigarette advertising and the exotic images of wealth and luxury that go with it. They just do not realise it. “I asked senior high school students. They don't believe they are influenced, but they said that they liked the advertisements”, she said.\n\n【17】“It is on television every day. Even though they broadcast after 9·30 pm, the young people are still awake. It is unconscious. They always see it.”\n\n【18】Statistics from 2013 show that around 63% of Indonesian adult men smoked. The figure has not gone down over the years. The figures for women are much lower, about 4%, but that figure has doubled in 10 years, Prabandari said. For her, the culprit is obvious. It is the advertising.\n\n【19】Lack of political will\n----------------------\n\n【20】Prabandari feels some progress is being made. At the local level some people are starting to wake up to the dangers of tobacco consumption. A few local administrative districts around Yogyakarta have unilaterally declared smoke-free areas, she said.\n\n【21】At the national level, however, she said the political will is lacking. Political parties cite the need to support tobacco farmers and although tobacco companies might not necessarily contribute directly to political campaigns, they have plenty of room to contribute indirectly—eg, by sponsoring events.\n\n【22】Tobacco control advocates hoped that outgoing President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono might sign the WHO treaty before leaving office later this month. There is no indication as yet, however, that this will happen. The party of his recently elected successor, President-elect Joko Widodo, has been notably reluctant to act on tobacco control.\n\n【23】Three large tobacco companies are especially active in the region, namely British American Tobacco (BAT), Japan Tobacco International (JTI), and Philip Morris International (PMI), which has a major subsidiary in Indonesia known as Sampoerna. All three companies were contacted by _The Lancet_ in preparation for this article, and only PMI responded.\n\n【24】In a statement 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>, Julie Soderlund, PMI's vice-president of communications, denied promoting tobacco products through disaster relief and said its contributions programmes were aimed at improving living conditions. PMI denied funding political campaigns through Sampoerna and said tobacco contributes substantially to the region's economy. PMI also criticised tobacco control in the region. “Asia is home to some of the world's most restrictive and extreme tobacco control policies. This includes plain packaging in Australia and health warnings in Thailand that cover 85% of a cigarette pack”, Soderlund said.\n\n【25】Neighbouring progress\n---------------------\n\n【26】Ironically, Indonesia's neighbour Australia has led the world in recent decades in controlling cigarette advertising. Plain packaging and some extremely graphic images of what smoking can do to various parts of a person's body have come in recently. But tobacco control advocates say it all started with targeting cigarette advertising.\n\n【27】Arthur Chesterfield-Evans is an Australian doctor who in the 1980s, upset by seeing the results of smoking in his work, was involved with a controversial campaign called BUGA UP—Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions. They deliberately sprayed graffiti on cigarette billboards. Some of them went to jail, but Chesterfield-Evans credits the campaign with transforming national opinion about cigarette companies.\n\n【28】“It was their social legitimacy that was being targeted. It was their right to tell lies”, he told _The Lancet_ , adding that today in Australia, high taxes mean smoking is simply too expensive for younger people to get addicted in the first place and, perhaps more importantly, it is not seen as attractive. “It is seen as ‘uncool’. It is seen as ‘being losers’”, he said.\n\n【29】The Philippines has recently introduced a major tax hike on tobacco products. Ulysses Dorotheo, a Filipino doctor and tobacco control advocate, says, however, that his country is not really much ahead of Indonesia. Tobacco companies have met attempts to restrict advertising with legal challenges, attempting, for example, to place adverts on the roof of a building selling cigarettes, saying this represented legal point-of-sale advertising.\n\n【30】One such case has dragged on for 5 years. Nevertheless, Dorotheo said he was optimistic that in the foreseeable future other Asian countries will follow the example of neighbours such as Singapore, Brunei, and Thailand, which already have tough tobacco advertising controls. Asked how soon that would be, he said: “It'll be a while.”\n以下都删除1:<u>\nSupplementary Material\n----------------------\n删除4:<u>\n*   Download .pdf (.11 MB)</u>\n\n【31】    Help with pdf files\n\n【32】    Supplementary appendix\n\n【33】Article info\n------------\n\n【34】### Publication history\n\n【35】Published: 11 October 2014\n\n【36】### Identification\n\n【37】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61804-3</u>\n\n【38】### Copyright\n\n【39】© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

More broadly, in selecting risk factor metrics for population health reporting, two other issues should be kept in mind.\n\n【1】First, it is important to consider how different metrics represent the health consequences of risk factors. For example, a systematic review of epidemiological studies reported that, taken together, studies that assessed BMI and other measures of adiposity did not show that any of these measures had superior discriminatory capability for adverse cardiometabolic outcomes; any reported difference was “too small to be of any clinical relevance”.\n\n【2】Second, to be useful for population health surveillance, data should be readily available through population-based surveys. Height and weight can be measured in population-based surveys, whereas methods like dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry are too complex for use, even in a clinical setting.\n\n【3】Nonetheless, to the extent that data are available, how the classification of individuals and prevalence in the population vary on the basis of the specific adiposity metric used should be explored in large, global databases, such as those used by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, as has been done for diabetes.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>ME reports a charitable grant from AstraZeneca Young Health Programme and personal fees from Scor and Third Bridge, all outside the submitted work.

Changing this rate, however, has no effect on the estimate of new infections acquired from spouses 删除2:<u>(p 2187 and table 5)</u>. It affects the estimated effect of CVCT.\n\n【2】However, we respectfully disagree that 5–10% is a valid baseline value. Seroincidence in discordant couples from the extensively counselled Rakai cohort was 11·8 per 100 person-years. Matovu concludes that individual VCT in Rakai does not result in decreased risk and we agree that condom use is rare among HIV-negative adults who are unaware that their spouse is HIV-positive. Unfortunately, neither Matovu nor Quinn report how many couples in their cohort knew each other's serostatus, and this uncertainty is common to the other cohorts reviewed by Guthrie.\n\n【3】As a middle ground, we offer the proportion of infections preventable by CVCT comparing 20% with lower baseline rates of 12% for Rwanda and 15% for Zambia 删除2:<u>( table )</u>.

If both quantities are underestimated, the effect on the proportion of infections attributable to cohabiting couples is minimal 删除2:<u>(table 6)</u>.\n\n【9】The pie chart showing a high proportion of discordant couples represents a snapshot of a dynamic process in which discordant couples transmit, die, or split up, and are replaced by new discordant couples resulting from premarital or extramarital contact. The “steady state” has a large proportion of couples discordant at any given time.\n\n【10】This brings up a related point about our model: our estimate of the benefit of couples' counselling does not account for reduced HIV incidence in couples who test concordantly HIV-negative. Among 509 such couples in Kigali, Rwanda, four individuals acquired HIV in 1 year (0·4 per 100 person-years), only one of whom transmitted it to their spouse. This very low incidence affirms the beneficial effect of CVCT, confirming that couples' testing—rather than the current standard of care stressing individual VCT—is essential to future HIV prevention efforts.\n\n【11】Ron Gray and Stan Becker are not the first to assert that the proportion of HIV infections attributable to married or cohabiting couples must be capped at 50%. This is false. Such a cap would only apply if one looked retrospectively at the source of existing infections 删除2:<u>(see the third paragraph of our Discussion)</u>. This was not the research question we addressed.\n\n【12】We took the population-based relationship structures as defined in the Demographic and Health Survey data and linked this to observed rates of serodiscordance to create a 12-month forward projection based on straightforward probability calculations. The cap for couple-attributable infections in this type of analysis, which encapsulates all past events in the baseline set-up and projects forward, is 100%.\n\n【13】We respectfully suggest that ours is the more relevant question for setting policy and allocating resources to prevent future infections.\n\n【14】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Community leaders have raised funds and volunteers are going door-to-door to distribute food, masks, and hygiene kits, using megaphones to educate residents about mask use, physical distancing, and handwashing. Local journalists are also using social media to counter fake news, and activists are converting schools into isolation wards, facilitating cash transfers, and fighting for the accurate documentation of COVID-19 deaths.\n\n【1】Those writing about mutual aid in the media have typically emphasised favela residents' “resilience” and “altruism”. Yet these depictions fail to do justice to the coordinated organising that is taking place. Mutual aid is a form of localised collective care that has grown in the pandemic, as in other key moments in history such as in the USA in the abolitionist movement of the 19th century and the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Mutual aid practice eschews paternalistic and charity-oriented development models and works to deactivate structures of inequity while building new infrastructures for living. Solidarity practices in the favelas have much to teach global and public health experts. Published reports and the insights of eight activists involved in mutual aid whom we interviewed reveal how solidarity practices challenge three key assumptions in conventional global health and reveal the merits of social medicine in Latin America and global social medicine.\n\n【2】The first assumption relates to the dominance of short-term, vertical interventions in global health, driven by the premise that scarce resources should be spent on targeted high-impact interventions that can be easily delivered by community actors. Favela activists are engaged in a form of collective governance that works synergistically toward short-term and long-term aims, addressing immediate health concerns while building infrastructure and tackling upstream factors. This means that the same individuals working to contain COVID-19 are also addressing associated problems, such as economic livelihood, food security, mental health, violence against women and children, and police repression. Activists do not aim to centralise networks into an umbrella organisation, emphasising instead reciprocity between smaller, localised solidarity networks. Gizele Martins, for instance, a journalist of the Favela da Maré, told us how local reporters temporarily brought their networks to the table to contribute with food distribution and cash transfer activities, while continuing their vital work reporting and countering misinformation.\n\n【3】Second, in global health, disease-specific vertical interventions tend to compete with one another for funding and prioritisation, which often leads to inadequate coordination on the ground. In the favelas, by contrast, the infrastructures being mobilised to respond to COVID-19 and address associated crises have been long in the making, and those maintaining them emphasise solidarity and multiplicity of action instead of issue-specific expertise. In the Complexo do Alemão, one of the largest groups of favelas in Rio de Janeiro, activists working to contain COVID-19 first came together during the 2013 flood and then shifted to creating a system to monitor and denounce police repression of favela residents. These pre-existing infrastructures have been built with the help of other favela groups and key actors in public health institutions, and they enable activists to respond quickly to the pandemic while bypassing the central government's roadblocks. A key aspect of this infrastructure-building, activists told us, is the creation of local data collection systems. Thainã de Medeiros of the Coletivo Papo Reto citizens' collective told us how vital a transparent information system has been for keeping track of donations, informing logistical decisions, helping volunteers respond to families' diverse needs, and correcting misinformation. Data collection, when underpinned by principles of fairness and democratic governance, can strengthen self-determination. Activists in the Complexo do Alemão are using their own data collection infrastructure to highlight the government's calculated misreporting of COVID-19 deaths, and to keep favela residents from being blamed for the expansion of the pandemic.\n\n【4】Third, over recent decades, global health has turned towards evidence-based policy making in an effort to depoliticise decision making, but this has led to a narrowing of policy suggestions and the prioritisation of vertical actions over horizontal ones. By contrast, activists in the favelas are maintaining both vertical and horizontal actions in large part because of their commitment to keeping histories of oppression in full view. Residents used the hashtag #COVID19NasFavelas to highlight the ways the pandemic has poignantly exposed pre-existing racial, economic, and health injustices. Meanwhile, the organisation RioOnWatch has described how “the pandemic has further accelerated the ‘state of exception’ in the favelas, a politics of death implemented by the state”.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2021 Volunteers working at Papo Reto/© Bento Fabio, Papo Reto</u>\n\n【5】The way mutual aid envisions and works for change aligns with the field of social medicine, particularly in Latin America, where experts, based mostly in public universities and key state-funded public health institutions, have worked synergistically with groups engaged in political transformation. Brazilian and Latin American social medicine (LASM) has historically involved activists, academics, and clinicians engaged in social movements struggling for the right to health and pursuing core principles of health justice. Like the emerging field of global social medicine, LASM highlights upstream “determinations” of health (a term used in LASM theory), such as unregulated capitalist production, political corruption, and concentration of power. Leaders in LASM have critiqued how even so-called “social” programmes that do little to tackle the underlying structures which cause illness can be used to relieve governments of their responsibilities.\n\n【6】The mutual aid activists we interviewed underscored the fundamentally political nature of their work, a fact that has become increasingly important under the presidency of Bolsonaro. As Martins told us, “How are we to say that the president's words are not reliable? It's a question of hierarchies…People believe because there is a lack of information and political debate.” For Martins, the dismantling of Brazil's democratic institutions and national health system over the past two decades is also a result of the growing influence of an unregulated private sector. Government “reforms” can entrench structures of inequity by demobilising political action and serving the economic interests of elite groups. Similar arguments have been made by researchers who study the detrimental impacts of philanthrocapitalism in global health. For the activists we interviewed, fighting for government and institutional reform, although vital, can only go so far. Other actions are needed to dismantle entrenched systems of oppression that have been in place since colonialism.\n\n【7】“Solidarity not charity”, one of mutual aid's core philosophies, inspires activists to strive to dismantle these systems by building new democratic alliances that reject hyper-individualism, hierarchical leadership models, and political polarisation. Antonio Xaolin, president of the neighbourhood association of the Favela da Rocinha, explained that the pandemic is exacerbating “tensions between religious fundamentalism and paternalistic forms of assistance of the Bolsonaro Government, on the one hand, and those who fight for political justice, on the other.” Rather than view the neighbourhood association as apolitical, he and others are working to “gain the confidence of residents” and to find allies in the fight for “a politics without oppression and oppressors”. de Medeiros explained that pandemic organising has generated opportunities for wide-ranging social mobilisation. “The average young man in the favela”, he explained, “knows what the police are up to. He knows people are getting rich with COVID-19 and thinks it's unjust, but he can also be sexist and homophobic without even realising it.” While de Medeiros was careful to add that some disagreed with him, in his view, this crisis is creating a space for activists to add anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic, and anti-ableist actions to Brazilians' long-standing engagement with class politics.\n\n【8】Mutual aid activists in cities across the globe—from Mumbai and Los Angeles, to Madrid, Sao Paulo, and Nairobi—are starting to share expertise and resources. In the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines, local activists are calling for the fair distribution of vaccines not only nationally but also globally. Furthermore, mutual aid is not only being practised by those subjected to state neglect. As activists of the Escuta Pandemia group in Pelotas in southern Brazil told us, mutual aid is being used by nurses, psychologists, and occupational health professionals who are seeking a space of care that is more fluid and egalitarian than what is usually found in professional spaces; mutual aid is encouraging these professionals to rethink their own role in the reproduction of oppressive structures. This is an opportune time to underscore a vision of global social medicine that emphasises horizontal cross-community learning and solidarity, the reinvention of democratic civil society, and the creation of infrastructures that support self-determination.\n\n【9】We would like to acknowledge the following for their collaboration and insights: Thainã de Medeiros, journalist and museologist, co-founder of the Coletivo Papo reto, Complexo do Alemão, Rio de Janeiro; Gizele Martins, journalist and activist, Favela da Maré, Rio de Janeiro; Antonio Xaolin, General Coordinator of the Community Chamber of Rocinha, Favela da Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro; José Mário HIlario, President of the neighbourhood association, Dona Marta Community, Rio de Janeiro; Liamara Denise Ubessi, Universidade Regional do Noroeste do Estado Estado do Rio Grande do Sul (UNIJUÍ), Pelotas; Roberta Antunes Machado, Professor of Nursing, IFRS-Rio Grande, Federal University of Pelotas; Luana Ribeiro Borges, Professor of Nursing, UNIPAMPA; Larissa Dall Agnol da Silva, Professor of Occupational Therapy, Federal University of Pelotas.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The regulation passed by the City's Board of Health will require all 24 000 restaurants to stop using these substances within 6–18 months. Additionally, a second, and perhaps even more significant measure, is a regulation that will require some restaurants to post calorie content information on menus.\n\n【1】Artificial trans-unsaturated fatty acids are created by adding hydrogen to liquid cooking oils to solidify them, yielding such products as partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, shortening, and margarine. The hydrogenation process makes the fat more stable, less likely to become rancid, and able to be shipped and stored at room temperature. The resulting transfats are cheap and convenient, alternatives to them are not uniformly so.\n\n【2】Nonetheless, the health risks of artificial transfats are well known and serious: they raise low-density lipoprotein, reduce high-density lipoprotein, and increase the risks of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. A 2002 report by the US Institute of Medicine concluded that there is no safe level of artificial transfat consumption. Because the substances pose clear risks to health—causing by one estimate 50 000 premature deaths each year—the US Food and Drug Administration has required labelling of transfats in all packaged foods since January, 2006. The measure has been successful, with most packaged products now containing very little or no transfat.\n\n【3】There are legitimate concerns about alternative substances, particularly saturated fats as substitutes. But several restaurants have already developed cheap, convenient, and safe alternatives, with diners reporting no difference in taste. Now it is up to the rest to follow suit.\n\n【4】The city's health commissioner, Thomas Frieden, makes no apologies for the aggressiveness of these interventions, which he says are necessary to avoid preventable mortality. Some critics have decried the regulations as another overreach of the nanny state. To that we say: at least the nanny's charges may soon be both healthier and thinner.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【5】### Publication history\n\n【6】Published: 16 December 2006\n\n【7】### Identification\n\n【8】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69841-3</u>\n\n【9】### Copyright\n\n【10】© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, shortfalls in current undergraduate curricula may mean tomorrow's doctors are ill-equipped to lead in this area.\n\n【1】We agree that health professionals are uniquely placed to communicate to the public the detrimental health effects of climate change and the benefits of mitigation. However, health professionals also require a good knowledge base to be trusted advocates. Unlike the effects of smoking or HIV/AIDS, the health effects of a changing climate do not feature strongly in medical school curricula. Surveys have indicated that only six of 33 UK medical schools teach climate and health topics, and only one institution includes these topics as core teaching. A high demand for global health teaching is found among medical students internationally. One frequent question is how best to integrate climate and health topics into the already crowded undergraduate curricula. Free resources such as Sustainable Healthcare Education, and BMJ E-Learning are good examples of how integrated case-based teaching could work. \n\n【2】We call on medical schools, The General Medical Council, and the Royal Colleges to incorporate climate and health topics into undergraduate and postgraduate education.

The most striking symptom in young animals is, however, growth retardation, and the American National Research Council concluded in 1976 that growth inhibition might be the best indicator of toxic effects from selenium. Selenium accumulated in the anterior pituitary, especially in the secretory granules of the somatotroph, and in the liver.\n\n【5】Infant rats exposed to selenium intake from age 25 days to 46 days (after weaning) had a 36% lower bodyweight gain during the 3 weeks of exposure than controls (46 g _vs_ 72 g).\n\n【6】Serum IGF-I increased from 151 μg/L to 500 μg/L in the control rats, but no increase was seen in selenium-treated rats. GH response to a stimulation test with GH releasing hormone was severely lowered (by 75%). We found that concomitant GH administration restored normal growth without inducing increase in serum IGF-I, which suggests a GH-independent lesion in the liver IGF-I producing system. Withdrawal of selenium resulted in recovery of GH secretion within 2 weeks, but low circulating serum IGF-I concentrations and growth retardation persisted for much longer.\n\n【7】We therefore wish to further stress Rayman's warnings against high selenium intake, especially in children, because of the risk of stunting their growth. We also underscore the possibility that some of the beneficial effects of selenium in cancer are mediated by the substantial suppressive action on the GH and IGF-I system. The growing evidence of the importance of IGFs for tumourigenesis and neoplastic growth has been reviewed. We suggest that measurements of serum GH, and especially IGFs and their binding proteins, be included in continuing and future studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The median age of 56 years suggests substantial selection (median age was 63 years in ASTEC). Data were gathered over 18 years and information about the distribution of patients in each group across time and any time effect on survival is important.

Legal derogations made some pandemic data transfers possible. However, non-pandemic medical research, including cancer research, follows regular legal rules, and these rules currently create data transfer stalls, delaying medical advancements.\n\n【1】Data transfers from the European Union (EU) to federal institutions in the United Stated (US) for medical research are currently impeded for legal reasons. Transfers to most of the US private sector can proceed provided appropriate safeguards are in place, but presently, US cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure that provide large-scale, advanced data processing solutions can often not be used.\n\n【2】Legal challenges therefore affect clinical trials when 1) the pharmaceutical company uses a US subcontractor providing a cloud-based analysis platform, and/or 2) legally mandated information including safety data must be reported to regulatory authorities such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\n【3】In the following, we describe the use of a very narrow safety valve derogation in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/679 to enable such transfers. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (DPA) concurred with our use of this legal option. To our knowledge, this is the first time-use of this derogation in Europe.\n\n【4】Current situation for clinical trials\n-------------------------------------\n\n【5】The GDPR regulates processing of personal data, including the collection, analysis and storage of pseudonymized (key-coded) data for scientific research purposes. The objective of the GDPR is twofold – to achieve both protection and free movement of personal data within the European Economic Area (EEA). When personal data is to be transferred outside the EEA, there are rules in the GDPR to ensure that the EEA level of data protection is upheld, see Fig. 1 .\n\n【6】Fig. 1 **The tiered process of establishing a legal transfer mechanism for data transfers from the European Economic Area to non-European Economic Area according to the GDPR** .\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【7】With the application of the GDPR, the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) _Schrems II_ judgment, and subsequent guidance from the EEA DPAs in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), two legal problems materialized: 1) US cloud providers and other US electronic communication service providers can as a main rule no longer be used ; and 2) Previously used legal data transfer mechanisms provided for in domestic European laws were repealed and already transferred data must rely on another legal transfer mechanism. In attempting to identify a new legal data transfer mechanism, it has become clear that because US federal institutions such as the FDA and the National Institutes of Health are protected by sovereign immunity, it is, as a main rule, no longer possible to transfer personal data from the EEA to them. \n\n【8】Since the European Commission has not decided that the US offers an adequate level of protection to that in the EU (Article 45 of the GDPR), such data transfers must as a general rule be based on provision of appropriate safeguards (Article 46 of the GDPR), see Fig. 1 .\n\n【9】### The use of US cloud services\n\n【10】It is often possible to use the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) for international transfers or another of the Article 46 appropriate safeguards for data transfers to US pharmaceutical companies. However, if the company does not use an internal dedicated server, but a cloud-based platform from a US provider, appropriate safeguards cannot be established. This is because US intelligence legislation, found by the CJEU to be in violation of EU fundamental rights, allows US authorities legal access to the data the US cloud providers process. Supplementary measures of a technical or organizational nature cannot usually remedy this challenge.\n\n【11】The US and the European Commission have announced a new Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework, which, when in place, will likely re-enable use of US cloud providers. The European Commission has published a draft adequacy decision, which is now subject to an adoption process lasting until the summer of 2023. However, Schrems has already announced the framework will be challenged in Court unless it meets EU legal requirements, noting that he does not see how the draft decision will survive a challenge before the Court of Justice of the European Union. This implies that the use of US cloud providers, including their EEA servers, will likely be subject to longer-term legal uncertainty.\n\n【12】### Transfer of individual level safety data to the FDA\n\n【13】The other challenge relates to the requirement of regulatory agencies to obtain individual level data in certain instances from pharmaceutical companies. This is a safety precaution, to ensure that companies do not overlook possible hazards.\n\n【14】One of the requirements for using any of the eight appropriate safeguards in Article 46 of the GDPR, is that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies are in place. The FDA and other US federal institutions provide this for US citizens and permanent residents in the United States Privacy Act of 1974, but not for other individuals. Thus, the FDA does not meet the requirements for establishment of an Article 46 appropriate safeguard for potential onward transfers of individual level data. The proposed Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework will not facilitate data transfers from the EEA to US federal institutions and will thus not solve this problem.\n\n【15】The seven derogations (exceptions) for specific situations cannot be used\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Derogations in Article 49 of the GDPR, are last resort options only to be used when there is no adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards cannot be established. The derogations place additional data protection risk on the research participants. This risk is acceptable only in rare instances, for instance if a specific individual's life is at stake.\n\n【17】One of the derogations is explicit consent to specified data transfers after the participant has been informed of the risk of the transfer. However, consent cannot be used as a transfer mechanism to the FDA or other non-EEA country regulatory authorities in clinical trials, as the participants cannot withdraw this consent. Note that consent to international data transfer is different from informed consent to research participation.\n\n【18】The European Commission included a provision in the new SCC allowing onward transfers from pharmaceutical companies to regulatory authorities. However, in some cases, the SCC cannot be used, for instance where the data importer uses a US cloud provider.\n\n【19】We have also asked the Norwegian DPA specifically whether the derogation in Article 49(1)(e), which is phrased quite similarly to the SCC provision, could be used for an onward transfer to regulatory authorities where the SCC could not be used. Their response was not to use Article 49(1)(e) for this onward transfer.\n\n【20】Our recommendation\n------------------\n\n【21】Where there is no adequacy decision, no appropriate safeguard, and the seven derogations for specific situations do not apply, there is a very narrow safety valve derogation in the GDPR in Article 49(1)(2).\n\n【22】This derogation can only be used in residual cases where specific, cumulative conditions are met. Formal DPA acceptance is not required. However, we requested feedback for the first-time use of the derogation, as the DPA has corrective power to suspend data flows. The Norwegian DPA agreed with our use of this derogation, including that none of the Article 46 GDPR data transfer mechanisms nor other Article 49 derogations were applicable. Although there is no guarantee, it is likely that other DPAs would share this assessment. Table 1 describes each of the legal conditions for using the safety valve derogation in Article 49(1)(2) and recommendations for how to address them, based on our successful experience. The Table thereby creates a legal step-by-step recipe and a useful tool to re-enable some data transfers.\n\n【23】Table 1 The conditions of Article 49(1)(2) of the GDPR and how to fulfill them.\n\n| The cumulative conditions of Article 49(1)(2) GDPR | Recommendations for how to fulfill the conditions |\n| --- | --- |\n| The transfer: |  |\n| – could not be based on a provision in Article 45 or 46, including the provisions on binding corporate rules, and none of the derogations for a specific situation referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is applicable | Provide an explanation for why any other rules cannot not be used (as summarized above). |\n| – is not repetitive | Clinical trials often require several data transfers, and some may have been conducted prior to 2018, when the GDPR started to apply.

We estimate the prevalence of food deprivation among infants and young children in India and describe its evolution over time at sub-national levels.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Data from five National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) conducted in 1993, 1999, 2006, 2016 and 2021 for the 36 states/Union Territories (UTs) of India were used. The study population consisted of the most recent children (6–23 months) born to mothers (aged 15–49 years), who were alive and living with the mother at the time of survey ( _n_ \\= 175,614 after excluding observations that had no responses to the food question). Food deprivation was defined based on the mother's reporting of the child having not eaten any food of substantial calorific content ( _i.e._ , any solid/semi-solid/soft/mushy food types, infant formula and powdered/tinned/fresh milk) in the past 24 hours (h), which we labelled as “Zero-Food”. In this study, we analyzed Zero-Food in terms of percent prevalence as well as population headcount burden. We calculated the Absolute Change (AC) to quantify the change in the percentage points of Zero-Food across time periods for all-India and by states/UTs.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】The prevalence of Zero-Food in India marginally declined from 20.0% (95% CI: 19.3%–20.7%) in 1993 to 17.8% (95% CI: 17.5%–18.1%) in 2021. There were considerable differences in the trajectories of change in the prevalence of Zero-Food across states. Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, and Jammu and Kashmir experienced high increase in the prevalence of Zero-Food over this time period, while Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh witnessed a significant decline. In 2021, Uttar Pradesh (27.4%), Chhattisgarh (24.6%), Jharkhand (21%), Rajasthan (19.8%) and Assam (19.4%) were states with the highest prevalence of Zero-Food. As of 2021, the estimated number of Zero-Food children in India was 5,998,138, with the states of Uttar Pradesh (28.4%), Bihar (14.2%), Maharashtra (7.1%), Rajasthan (6.5%), and Madhya Pradesh (6%) accounting for nearly two-thirds of the total Zero-Food children in India. Zero-Food in 2021 was concerningly high among children aged 6–11 months (30.6%) and substantial even among children aged 18–23 months (8.5%). Overall, socioeconomically advantaged groups had lower prevalence of Zero-Food than disadvantaged groups.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Concerted efforts at the national and state levels are required to further strengthen existing policies, and design and develop new ones to provide affordable food to children in a timely and equitable manner to ensure food security among infants and young children.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】This study was supported by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation INV-002992.\n\n【10】</u>Keywords\n--------\n\n【11】*   Food deprivation\n*   Food insecurity\n*   Zero-Food\n*   Food policy\n*   Sustainable development goals (SDGs)\n*   Zero hunger\n*   Social determinants of health\n*   Children\n*   States/Union Territories\n*   India\n\n【12】Research in context\n\n【13】### Evidence before this study\n\n【14】We searched PubMed and Web of Science to identify empirical studies with a quantitative analysis on the prevalence of food insecurity and deprivation in India. We used structured combinations of keywords: “Food Insecurity” OR “Food Deprivation” OR “Food Poverty” OR “Hunger” OR “Starvation” AND (“India” or “India + Children”) with no restriction on date and language. The search yielded 1118 studies. After removing duplicates and screening the titles and abstracts of each of these papers, 50 articles were considered as relevant for the scope of our study. We reviewed these articles for the following: national representativeness, definition of food insecurity/deprivation based on food consumption, whether the measurement was at individual (including children or not) or at household level, and source of the data. Majority of the studies (n = 37) were local non-representative studies. Eight studies entailed a definition of food insecurity/deprivation based on actual consumption (self-reported or measured) of food at the individual level, and of these, three were on children, with one reporting severe food insecurity among children aged 5–8 years. However, none of the studies reviewed reported nationally representative estimates of food insecurity among infants and young children in India using a public data set.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】Our study provides the first systematic assessment of severe food insecurity among infants and young children in India. The study is comprehensive in that we assessed the evolution of food insecurity over the last 30 years (1993–2021) and for each of the 36 States and Union Territories (UT) of India. The study also introduces a new metric, referred to as “Zero-Food” ( _i.e._ , children who did not eat any food of calorific significance for at least one day). Lastly, we developed an online interactive dashboard to visualize the evolution of the prevalence of Zero-Food across the states/UTs of India. Almost one out of every five children in India is at the risk of not being able to eat any food every day, with not much decline in the prevalence of Zero-Food over time. Inequalities in the prevalence of Zero-Food between states/UTs also have remained largely unchanged.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】The existing framework of National Food Security Act (along with other food-related policies and programs) needs to be examined for its design, implementation—and most importantly, to ensure identification of the population that needs the most assistance. Bringing precision to existing food policies, should be urgently considered if India aims to realize the Sustainable Development Goal related to ending hunger and ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year-round by 2030.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Safe and nutritious food is the basic essence of human survival, growth, and development, especially for infants and young children. Newborn infants rely on breastmilk (or animal milk for non-breastfed infants) for their source of food. By 6 months, infants also require external forms of foods to ensure a healthy physical and cognitive growth and introduction of the external food in a timely, safe, adequate, and appropriate manner is critical. \n\n【21】The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 seeks to end hunger and ensure access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food year-round by 2030. To ascertain the progress of SDG2 there is a need to identify a metric for monitoring hunger and food security. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) uses Prevalence of Undernourishment (PoU) to monitor the number of people in a population who are experiencing hunger, defined as the consumption of too few calories to meet the minimum amount of energy required to live a healthy and productive life in accordance with his or her age, sex, and activity level. Meanwhile, the FAO defines being food-insecure as state where a person lacks access to safe and nutritious food, either due to lack of availability or lack of resources. The Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) developed by the FAO provides definition of “moderate” and “severe” food insecurity. Moderate food insecurity is identified as a state whereby a person has reduced the quality and/or quantity of their food and is uncertain about their ability to obtain food due to lack of money or other resources, while severe food insecurity reflects a state where a person has had no food for a day or more, has run out of food, or has gone an entire day without eating at times during the year.\n\n【22】In the context of infants and young children, the commonly used food-related measure is the “minimum dietary diversity”, that measures whether a child consumed foods and beverages from at least five out of eight defined food groups during the previous day. The prevalence of children not meeting the minimum dietary diversity across Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) is about 80%. Infants and young children also have a very low consumption of food items that are protein-rich and contain essential micronutrients.\n\n【23】The average energy required by an infant aged 6–8 months is 600 Kcal/day, at 9–11 months of age is 700 Kcal/day and increases to 900 Kcal/day for children 12–23 months of age. For on-demand breastfed children aged 12–23 months, food consumed needs to meet about 61% of energy, 45% of protein and about 95% of iron requirements over and above the breastmilk. The share of food contributing to calorific requirements is about 50% for children aged 9–11 months ( _i.e._ , 300 out of 700 Kcal/day), and the share of breastmilk is greater than the food when it comes to children aged 6–8 months ( _i.e._ , 400 out of 600 Kcal/day). The consequences of malnutrition due to food deprivation, especially for infants and young children, are well-known. There has been a growing recognition in the literature on the intrinsic importance of food-based measures for assessing child nutritional status as opposed to the current practice of solely relying on children's anthropometric status. \n\n【24】India is estimated to have 224 million people who experience hunger, accounting for nearly one-third of the global burden of hunger. Further, nearly 80% of infants and young children in India do not meet the minimum dietary diversity, with significantly low consumption of protein-rich food. However, to our knowledge, no study has proposed a measure of absolute deprivation of food among children. The progress and success of the world in meeting SDG 2, thus, is contingent on India's progress and success in measuring and eliminating food deprivation and ensuring food security among its population, especially among infants and young children.\n\n【25】In this study, we present an up-to-date, comprehensive and systematic description of the trends in absolute or extreme food deprivation among infants and young children in India and its 36 states and Union Territories (UTs) between 1993 and 2021. We operationalized the concept of extreme food deprivation by identifying the children who did not eat any food of calorific significance for an entire day, which we refer to as Zero-Food. From a policy perspective, it is not only important to understand the prevalence which provides information on the current and prospective risk of a child not being able to eat for an entire day, but also the absolute burden ( _i.e._ , the current headcount of at-risk children who need immediate intervention). We therefore also estimated the population headcount burden of Zero-Food children for 2021 for all-India and for each of the states/UTs. Finally, we also assessed the patterning in the prevalence of Zero-Food in 2021 across basic demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.\n\n【26】India is a federation of 28 States and 8 UTs. States are administrative and legislative geographic units that fall in jurisdiction of the respective state governments. The UTs are geographical areas that fall under the governance and jurisdiction of the central government and may or may not have their own legislatures. States vary with regards to their natural resources, as well as in terms of differences in development histories. There are large differences between states on indicators related to population health and well-being, and states oversee policy development for social sectors including those related to nutrition. Thus, a substantial component of state differences in India can be linked to policy processes that operate uniquely at the state level.\n\n【27】Methods\n-------\n\n【28】### Data\n\n【29】The study used repeated cross-sections of five waves of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) covering all states and UTs in India. The five surveys were conducted in 1992–93, 1998–99, 2005–06, 2015–16 and 2019–21, hereafter identified with the end year of each survey. All rounds of the NFHS employ a multistage stratified cluster sampling design and use the latest available Census of India at the time of the survey as their sampling frame 删除2:<u>( Appendix S1 )</u>.\n\n【30】### Study population\n\n【31】The study population were infants and young children who were the most recent born in the past two years prior to the survey, aged 6–23 months, alive and living with their mother (aged 15–49 years) at the time of the survey. Food-related information was not ascertained for children younger than six months or above 2 years. Observations for which any food-related questions were reported as “don't know” or were missing (unreported) were excluded. With the exception of the 1993 survey where non-response was 15.8%, the percentage of non-responses was less than 1% across the remaining four surveys 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The final analytic sample was 14,043 (1993), 14,624 (1999), 13,667 (2006), 71,271 (2016) and 62,009 (2021).\n\n【32】Table 1 Study sample size selection from the five National Family Health Surveys, 1993–2021.\n\n| Survey round (year) | Sample size based on inclusion criteria (n) | Non-responses on food-related questions (n) | Percentage of cases with non-responses on food-related questions to total sample size (n) | Final study sample Size (n) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| NFHS-1 (1992–93) | 16,687 | 2644 | 15.8 | 14,043 |\n| NFHS-2 (1998–99) | 14,716 | 92 | 0.6 | 14,624 |\n| NFHS-3 (2005–06) | 13,879 | 112 | 0.8 | 13,667 |\n| NFHS-4 (2015–16) | 71,538 | 267 | 0.4 | 71,271 |\n| NFHS-5 (2019–21) | 62,167 | 158 | 0.3 | 62,009 |\n| **All waves** | **178,987** | **3273** | **1.8** | **175,614** |\n\n【34】Bold values represent the \"overall\" or \"pooled\".\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【35】### Outcome\n\n【36】We used the food consumption questions across the surveys to define Zero-Food 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>. Food-related questions of the following nature were asked of the mothers: “ _Did \\[Child's NAME\\] drink/eat \\[specific food items\\] anytime during the day (yesterday) or night (last) 24 h prior to the survey?_ ” The mothers were asked to report the consumption of any food item even if it was consumed mixed with other item/s. To construct a comparable metric of Zero-Food across all surveys, an answer of “No” to all the food questions for a particular child in a particular survey meant the child received no food in the past 24 hours. In NFHS-1, this meant an answer of “No” to 4 questions, in NFHS-2 it was 5 questions, in NFHS-3 it was 20 questions, and in both NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 it was 18 questions all under the heading of “Food (Including Milk)” in Table 2 . Despite differences in food-related questions across surveys, there are questions that consistently ask whether the child consumed “any or any other solid/semi-solid/soft/mushy” food in addition to the other food-specific questions. This ensures a reliable assessment of whether the child has eaten any food whatsoever in the past 24 h.\n\n【37】Table 2 Sample size (n) and prevalence (%) of food items not consumed in the last 24

For each survey, Zero-Food was calculated separately based on the food items asked under the \"Food (Including Milk)” and includes children who did not have any of the listed food categories. Calculation of Zero-Food\\* also included items asked under the heading, “Liquid Food (Excluding Milk)”.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【40】Based on these responses, we defined the prevalence of Zero-Food in children as:\n\n【41】Zero ‐ Food children Number of total children × 100,\n\n【42】where, Zero-Food children represents the number of children who did not consume any food of calorific significance in the past 24 h. The prevalence of Zero-Food estimates the percentage of children in a population who did not eat every day, thus aligned with the overall concept of severe food insecurity. \n\n【43】To be comprehensive, we also present estimates under a definition whereby the child has not had anything, including food items listed under the heading “Liquid Food (Excluding Milk)” in Table 2 , labeled as Zero-Food∗”.\n\n【44】### Constructing comparable state estimates\n\n【45】While currently there are 28 states and 8 UTs, the geometry of states/UTs in India have evolved over the years, with many states/UTs experiencing change in their geometry and by extension their population jurisdiction. For instance, in 1993 there were 25 states and 7 UTs. These changes mean that creating a repeated cross-sectional panel of states/UTs across the years is not straightforward. The conventional approach is to collapse the more recent state-geometry into an older state-geometry by merging the states that were involved in the change. For example, representing 2021 data for the current two states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, as an average of the two states, because, they comprised a single state (Uttar Pradesh) in 1993 and 1999. However, presenting recent data on an older state-geometry does not accurately reflect current estimates and is not meaningful for current policy deliberations at the state-level. We solved this problem by assigning surveyed districts in older survey years to states in their current geometry 删除2:<u>(see Appendix S2 )</u>.\n\n【46】### Demographic and socioeconomic correlates\n\n【47】We also considered demographic and socioeconomic characteristics to assess any systematic patterning of the 2021 prevalence of Zero-Food. These included age (6–11/12–17/18–23 months), sex (Female/Male) of the child, place of residence (Rural/Urban), social caste of the mother (Other/Other Backward Classes/Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe), educational attainment of the mother (no Formal Schooling/Primary Schooling (1–5 years)/Secondary Schooling (6–10 years)/Senior Secondary (11–12 years), and College Education (more than 12 years)), and a household measure of wealth based on an asset index categorized as quintiles (Poorest, Poor, Middle, Rich and Richest).\n\n【48】### Analysis\n\n【49】To estimate trends over time for all-India and states/UTs, we calculated the percentage (and 95% Confidence Interval) of Zero-Food children for India at each of the five time periods. The prevalence estimates used the survey weights to account for the multi-stage stratified cluster sampling design. We calculated the Absolute Change (AC) to quantify the change (in percentage points) in prevalence of Zero-Food across time periods: A C \\= P t − P x ; where, P t refers to percentage at recent year ( _e.g._ , 2021), P x represents percentage at a previous year in consideration ( _e.g._ , 1993). A negative AC value indicates a decline in the prevalence of Zero-Food ( _i.e._ , an improving change), whereas a positive AC value indicates an increase in the prevalence of Zero-Food ( _i.e._ , a worsening change).\n\n【50】We used box plots and line plots to assess the extent to which state-inequalities in the prevalence of Zero-Food have increased/decreased over time. Descriptive assessments of the state-level patterns over time were made using scatterplots and correlations. Specifically, we examined the extent to which state/UT ordering with regards to the prevalence of Zero-Food is correlated across various years. We also assessed whether the magnitude and patterns of change since 1993 are correlated with the prevalence of Zero-Food in 1993 (considered as a baseline). We visualized the changing geographic distribution of the prevalence of Zero-Food using choropleth maps and also created an interactive dashboard 删除2:<u>删除1:<u>( Appendix S3 , https://geographicinsights.iq.harvard.edu/State-Zero-Food )</u></u>.\n\n【51】We estimated the current absolute burden of food deprivation among children ( _i.e._ , population headcounts of Zero-Food children) for all India and for the states/UTs in 2021 using the microdata and Census of India Population Projections. We used the methodology provided by Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) with appropriate modifications for our purposes 删除2:<u>( Appendix S4 )</u>. We also provide a visual and quantitative assessment of whether states/UTs with higher prevalence of Zero-Food are correlated with the absolute headcount burden.\n\n【52】We assessed the demographic and socioeconomic patterning in the prevalence of Zero-Food across age and sex of the children, place of residence, social caste, educational attainment of mother, and household wealth quintile.\n\n【53】The software STATA 15.0, ArcGIS Pro, and Microsoft Power BI were used for computations and visualization. Lastly, we have outlined major food related policies of the national and state governments of India to draw a contextual picture for the Zero-Food measure. This list is illustrative and at best exhaustive with respect to central government programs.\n\n【54】### Ethics statement\n\n【55】The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data were collected using informed consent and the protocol for the NFHS survey, including the content of all the survey questionnaires, was approved by the International Institute for Population Studies Institutional Review Board and the ICF Institutional Review Board. For the analysis presented in this study using the NFHS data, the Harvard Longwood Campus Institutional Review Board (IRB) allows researchers to self-determine whether their research meets the requirements of IRB oversight using the IRB Decision Tool. These activities did not meet the regulatory definition of human participant research, and our study was determined to be exempt from a full institutional review.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of funding\n\n【56】This study was supported by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation INV-002992. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish or preparation of the manuscript. All authors had access to the data. Akhil Kumar, Mayanka Ambade and Rockli Kim accessed and verified the sample survey data for the analysis.\n\n【57】</u>Results\n-------\n\n【58】### Sample characteristics\n\n【59】We estimated that roughly 33,623,000 children were aged 6–23 months in India in 2021. Amongst these infants and young children aged 6–23 months, the sample distribution was more or less similar across the three age categories of 6–11, 12–17 and 18–23 months and gender categories 删除2:<u>( Table S1 )</u>. Nearly three-fourths of the children were from rural areas and over half of the mothers had completed secondary school education. These characteristics were largely consistent across the five surveys with the percentage share of children becoming more urban and having mothers with higher levels of education over time. For the 1993 survey year that had about 15% observations not reporting food-related questions, the characteristics between those who reported and did not report were largely similar with the exception of age as non-response rates were greater among children aged 12–17 and 18–23 months 删除2:<u>( Table S2 )</u>.\n\n【60】### Patterns of change in the prevalence of Zero-Food\n\n【61】The all-India prevalence of Zero-Food decreased from 20.0% (95% CI: 19.3%, 20.7%) in 1993 to 17.8% (95% CI: 17.5%, 18.1%) in 2021 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>; an absolute change of −2.2 percentage points over nearly 3 decades (28 years) 删除2:<u>( Table 4 )</u>. There was a marked decline in the prevalence of Zero-Food between 1999 and 2006 (absolute change: −7.6%).

First, the prevalence of Zero-Food in India has only marginally declined over the last 30 years, with a significant decline in 2006 and a subsequent rise in 2016 and 2021 to levels similar to 1993. There are indications of stagnation or even increases in the last 15 years. Second, the extent of state-inequalities in the prevalence of Zero-Food appears to have largely remained the same, even though the rank-ordering of states/UTs have changed across years. Third, states that had an initial higher prevalence of Zero-Food generally experienced a greater AC compared to states that had lower initial prevalence of Zero-Food. Fourth, India currently has a large and substantial headcount burden of Zero-Food children, and the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh (all moderate to high prevalence of Zero-Food states) account for nearly two-third of the headcount burden of Zero-Food children. At the same time, there is evidence that considering the prevalence of Zero-Food and the population headcount of Zero-Food children together is necessary for targeting and prioritizing states/UTs that need immediate intervention. Fifth, the risk of Zero-Food is patterned by child's age and socioeconomic status but prevalence is still substantial across all groups.\n\n【88】The following data-related issues should be considered while interpreting the findings. First, the questionnaire does not assess the frequency or severity of food deprivation. However, not eating anything for even one day during the most essential period of child's development represents a useful metric of food deprivation, and aligns with the FAO's criteria of food insecurity. Second, the food consumption questions in NFHS were restricted to age 6–23 months. Thus, our estimates are not representative of all children under the age of 5, which is the age group conventionally considered for “young children”. The substantial prevalence of food deprivation among age 6–23 months identified in our study underscores the need to expand the food consumption questions in future NFHS to include all children under the age of 5, in order to have a complete picture of food deprivation among children in India. Third, in South Asia, there is likely to be seasonality to consumption of food items, and therefore the time of the survey interview could influence the responses to previous 24-h recall of food consumption. While seasonality may be important for consumption of specific food items based on availability and affordability, it is unlikely to influence response to overall food consumption or lack of it, which is the focus of our study. Fourth, the NFHS-5 was initiated in 2019 and was disrupted due to Covid-19 before resuming and completing it in 2020–21. There is a need for further deep dive investigation of the micro data separated by the dates of survey preceding Covid-19 from the rest, to examine any systematic influence of Covid-19 on responses, both positive such as the effects of _Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana_ (PMGKAY) by the Government of India during Covid-19, and negative such as loss of sustained employment. Fifth, the scope of our study does not allow us to meaningfully engage in any formal policy assessment or reasons for the observed trends. However, we make note of the government programmes that may need careful appraisal in the light our findings. Sixth, about 15% of the sample in 1993 had not reported food consumption information with a higher percentage of the same among children aged 18–23 months. Since we adopted a complete case analysis, we assumed no potential impact of these missing cases for the values of 1993. Seventh, the explanation of the substantial decline in prevalence of Zero-Food children in 2006 and then its sharp increase by 2016 needs further scrutiny from a survey administration perspective as well as if this was “real”, such as effects of economic growth or policies. To the extent, we could discern on the survey design aspect, 2006 was the survey year when more detailed questions on food intake were administered for the first time. It could be that the 2006 is the anomaly here since the prevalence of Zero-Food prior to, and after, 2006 show similar levels, suggesting little change in the last thirty years. Finally, the 1993 and 1999 estimates are approximations for the following states 删除2:<u>( Appendix S2 )</u>: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir. For 2006, estimates are approximations for the following states: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.\n\n【89】Within the context of the preceding data-related considerations, we discuss our study findings by providing a comparative perspective to estimates of food deprivation. We follow this by mapping the food policy landscape in India to contextualize our findings to facilitate a policy deliberation of existing policies from a resource and design perspective.\n\n【90】We are not aware of any study that has estimated the prevalence of food deprivation among infants and young children for India and its states/UTs, currently or over time. To the extent that there are studies on all population (primarily, adults or households), there is substantial variation in the definition of food deprivation itself that prohibits a strict comparison, besides being local and non-representative. Nonetheless, at the all-India level, the FAO's PoU which captures food deprivation based on inadequate dietary calorie consumption for healthy living among all population (children and adults) was 16.3% in 2019–21. Prevalence of food inadequacy, which extends the PoU to account for those who did not consume enough calories for a normal physical activity, was about 25.0% in 2014–16 in India. Another study using the FIES, showed that among children aged 15 years or younger in India, 16.1% lived in a household where at least one member faced severe food insecurity. The prevalence of Zero-Food we report in our study for infants and young children, thus, seem broadly consistent with prior estimates at the all-India level. To effectively monitor the prevalence of Zero-Food, future iterations of NFHS can incorporate a straightforward question regarding the child's daily food consumption. The question could be phrased for example as: ‘ _Has the child eaten anything yesterday apart from breastmilk such as any solid food, soft mushy food, milk, infant milk powder?_ ’. This approach emphasizes the importance of identifying children who are experiencing extreme food deprivation.\n\n【91】Policy response to the issue of food security in India has evolved over time to include a substantial share of the population 删除2:<u>( Table S5 )</u>. Historically, India addressed the issue of food insecurity through its Public Distribution System (PDS). The PDS was revamped as the Targeted Public Distribution System (TPDS) in 1997 to target the poorest population. The TPDS and its subsidiary _Antyodaya Anna Yojana_ provide 35 kg of food grains per family per month at a merged price of Indian Rupees 2–3 per kilogram to the poorest of poor. Population specific policies such as the Annapurna scheme (for elderly), The Rajiv Gandhi Scheme for Empowerment of Adolescent Girls, renamed as _Sabla_ scheme (for adolescent girls) and Nutrition Rehabilitation Centres (for severely malnourished children) were rolled out in 2000–2010. The enactment of the 2013 National Food Security Act (NFSA) marked a paradigm shift in India's policy response to addressing food insecurity from a “welfare” perspective to a “human rights” perspective. Since the National Food Security Act, 75% of the rural and 50% of the urban populations are legally entitled to receive subsidized food grains under AAY.\n\n【92】Focused programs such as the Special Nutrition Program (1970) and Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) (1975) were launched to improve maternal and child under-nutrition and remains in place. The Supplementary Nutrition Program under ICDS provides food supplements of 500 calories of energy and 12-15 grams of protein per day, either as a take-home ration (for 6 months to 3 years) or morning snack and home-cooked meals (for 3 to 6 years). Severely underweight children are given 800 calories and 20 to 25 grams of protein per day for each child. Pregnant women and lactating mothers are given food supplements of 600 calories of energy and 18-20 grams of protein per day in the form of Micronutrient Fortified Food and/or energy-dense food as Take-Home Ration. To further streamline efforts and policies targeting under-nutrition among children and women, _POSHAN Abhiyaan_ (Prime Minister's Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nutrition) was launched in 2018, which was later aligned with the supplementary nutrition programme and scheme for adolescent girls and launched as Integrated Nutrition Support Programme (POSHAN 2.0).\n\n【93】In addition to the above national policies, state governments have also developed programs for their respective populations. For example, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have community canteens that serve cooked meals at much subsidised rates. Telangana and Kerala have recently adopted schemes for providing fortified foods that cater to a substantial amount of daily micronutrient requirements of children. Andhra Pradesh and Haryana have augmented their supplementary nutrition program of ICDS by providing milk to children 6–72 months as well as pregnant and lactating mothers. \n\n【94】The COVID-19-related disruptions prompted the launch of the _Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana_ in 2020. Under this scheme, about 800 million individuals (two-thirds of India's population) received 5 kg of food grains and 1 kg pulses per month. The program has been relaunched from January 1, 2023 for Antyodaya and priority households.\n\n【95】India has the breadth and depth of policy instruments and coverage to adequately address the issue of food deprivation and insecurity in India. A careful appraisal of these instruments from a design, implementation as well as resource perspective is likely to be helpful. In particular, a greater degree of precision is required to ensure that food is reaching the populations most in need in a timely and equitable manner. Policy precision in targeting could be facilitated with further analysis focused on identifying smaller areas ( _e.g._ , districts, sub-districts, and villages) and vulnerable populations based on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics using the metric of Zero-Food. Indeed, in the remaining eight years left to achieve the SDG 2, India should consider a routine and systematic food surveillance to monitor the progress they are making in ensuring food security and eliminating hunger among children and adults.\n\n【96】Globally, food insecurity has emerged as a critical issue underscored by the vulnerabilities of the globally interconnected food production and distribution systems, including in higher-income countries. For instance, the current United States (US) administration hosted a White House conference and released a National Strategy identifying ending hunger by 2030, among others, as an explicit policy goal. A comparable effort in India with the backing of current political leadership can help galvanize a purposeful strategy to comprehensively address the issue of food access and security for India. The fact that almost one out of every five children in India is at the risk of not being able to eat any food every day indicates substantial calorie deficiency based on the recommended WHO guidelines, even after accounting for breastmilk intake. The existing framework of NFSA should be re-examined to identify improvements in design and in better identifying populations that needs the most assistance, based on both prevalence of Zero-Food and population headcount of Zero-Food children. Bringing precision to existing food policies should be urgently considered if India aims to realize the SDG goal related to ending hunger and ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round by 2030.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【97】_Conceptualization and Design_ : S.V.S.

Despite this, PCOS is not mentioned in Nicholas Steel and collegues’ Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD). GBD informs policy makers by incorporating the effect, relative harm, and the prevalence of the disease in their report. PCOS has such a high prevalence and effect on day-to-day quality of life that we feel it should be captured in this data. Perhaps one major problem is underdiagnosis and underregistration in the UK primary care system, for which the recorded prevalence in one region (Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland) was about 1·5%, indicating that of every 100 women with PCOS, almost 85 cases were unrecorded or undiagnosed in the health system. The situation appears to be the same elsewhere in the world.\n\n【1】PCOS often remains unrecognised by health systems, which results in its absence in important health reports such as GBD. The likely consequences of its absence are underresourcing for PCOS by health-care policy makers and commissioners.\n\n【2】We call on _The Lancet_ as a key player in the field with a track record of interest in public health—and especially women's health—to take this point into consideration and perhaps commission a work on PCOS to help increase awareness of this condition.\n\n【3】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The CDC study was designed to assess the presence or absence of a temporal association between intussusception and previous vaccination, not to measure its magnitude, whereas we aimed to measure its magnitude and not temporal patterns in risk. Therefore, any inference about one study contradicting the other is inappropriate.\n\n【3】To reconcile CDC's finding of a temporal association between intussusception and vaccination, with our finding of a decrease in intussception occurrence during the RRV-TV use period, we suggested that benefits of vaccination are seen later in infancy. We also suggested that this vaccine might have triggered early onset of intussception cases destined to occur eventually, with a compensatory decrease in occurrence later.\n\n【4】New data from the CDC study suggest that the strong intussusception-RRV-TV association in the immediate weeks before intussusception was preceded by a significant depression in vaccination frequency at more remote times before intussusception (adjusted odds ratio 0·3 \\[95% CI 0·1–0·5\\] > 21 days before intussusception). This finding could be due to significant uncontrolled biases in the matching of cases and controls, but is also consistent with Rotashield triggering and compensatory protection effect.\n\n【5】In response to Hall's second point, in the USA, for reasons of privacy protection, several limitations are imposed on the use of hospital data for research purposes. Three notable limitations are: the central collection of state hospital discharge databases by federal government agencies does not allow access to personal identifiers; agreements between the federal government and the state data agencies that collect hospital data specifically prohibit researchers from contacting hospitals and providers to request additional information about patients; and additional restrictions are placed on linking patient-level hospital data to other data sources. We were, therefore unable to validate intussusception diagnoses further by these methods.\n\n【6】Our case data source was not subject to sampling error or bias, since it included 100% of hospital admissions for intussusception in each state. New data gathered since completion of the original study from 20 states confirm a decrease in infant intussusception hospital admissions in states with moderate-to-high RRV-TV coverage.\n\n【7】US recommendations for this vaccine are expected in the near future. Therefore, intensive reassessment of collected evidence is needed, including the post-publication observations in the CDC case-control study, new data from an extended phase of the CDC cohort study, and augmented data from our study. We also hope for assessment of the benefit of vaccination in infants and high-risk subpopulations at increased risk for severe outcomes of rotavirus diarrhoea, and of at what level of intussusception risk should be acceptable.\n\n【8】All published studies of the RRV-TV-intussusception association, including ours, have shortcomings in their methods but we are convinced that they all contribute important pieces of information needed to form the best possible picture of what actually took place during the period of use of this vaccine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

So far, mutations in two genes regulating ion translocation— _CACNA1A_ and _ATP1A2_ —have been identified in pedigrees with this disease.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】To identify additional genes for familial hemiplegic migraine, we did a genome-wide linkage analysis of two disease pedigrees without mutations in _CACNA1A_ and _ATP1A2_ . Ion channel genes in the candidate interval were analysed for mutations, and the functional consequences of the recorded sequence alteration were determined.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We identified a novel locus for familial hemiplegic migraine on chromosome 2q24. Sequencing of candidate genes in this region revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (Gln1489Lys) in the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel gene _SCN1A_ , mutations of which have been associated with epilepsy. This same mutation was present in three families with familial hemiplegic migraine. It results in a charge-altering aminoacid exchange in the so-called hinged-lid domain of the protein, which is critical for fast inactivation of the channel. Whole-cell recordings in transiently transfected tsA201 cells expressing the highly homologous SCN5A sodium channel showed that the mutation induces a two-fold to four-fold accelerated recovery from fast inactivation without altering any of the other channel parameters investigated.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Dysfunction of the neuronal sodium channel SCN1A can cause familial hemiplegic migraine. Our findings have implications for the understanding of migraine aura. Moreover, our study reinforces the molecular links between migraine and epilepsy, two common paroxysmal disorders.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【9】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【10】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【11】One-time access price info\n\n【12】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【13】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【14】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【15】### Subscribe:\n\n【16】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【17】Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "4f79f0de-ba6e-4927-943c-6fa900352d85", "title": "A nuclear shadow from Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Fukushima", "text": "【0】70 years ago this week, in the quiet early morning of Aug 6, 1945, the world changed irreversibly when the first nuclear weapon in warfare was used by the USA against Japan. The target of Hiroshima had been spared previous bombing, so that the destructive force of the 15 kiloton uranium bomb could be assessed. The result, repeated 3 days later against Nagasaki with a larger plutonium device, was near-total devastation. The explosion melted metal and incinerated people. Exposure to ionising radiation led to further deaths and damage to health that can be measured today, as Kenji Kamiya and colleagues report in the first paper of a Series in _The Lancet_ today.\n\n【1】In the immediate aftermath of the bomb, doctors such as Michihiko Hachiya (author of _Hiroshima Diary_ ), struggled to make sense of the symptoms and signs in survivors, but noted the poor prognosis associated with petechiae. Only when his hospital received a microscope to replace the one destroyed in the blast, did the causes become clearer. In _The Lancet's_ Series, a new lens is applied to events from Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Fukushima, for a better understanding of the health challenges faced by populations exposed to radiation from man-made disasters. The Series provides an opportunity to consider civil protection and health service provision before the next nuclear catastrophe occurs. As a result, evacuation can be better planned, messages about risk communicated more clearly, treatment targeted more efficiently, and priorities for data collection established to improve understanding and management. The three Series papers are led by authors in Japan, coordinated by Koichi Tanigawa of Fukushima Medical University and Rethy Chhem, formerly of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n【2】The Hiroshima bomb provides a convenient opportunity for reflection, but even in the absence of that anniversary, the danger of nuclear attack remains present and timely. The world bristles with more than 15 000 nuclear warheads, believed to be concentrated in nine countries (excluding states that host weapons from other governments). Worryingly, three countries that admit to nuclear weapons are not parties to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty: India, Pakistan, and North Korea. Little wonder that for two generations, the doomsday clock has hovered near midnight. Yet, health professionals, such as International Physicians for Prevention of Nuclear War, have helped to turn back the doomsday clock in the past. The medical community should consider their example—and the contents of this Series—to inform contemporary debate on nuclear weapons, especially as Iran's nuclear programme hangs in the balance. The negotiations between the USA and Iran that concluded on July 14, although unpalatable to some, are of potentially immense importance to reduce the risk of war in the Middle East, and to improve the health of people in Iran by the reduction in sanctions.\n\n【3】Nuclear technology also provides benefits: notably in scientific research, medical diagnosis, and treatment. Electricity from the world's 437 nuclear power plants supports development. Yet the understanding of nuclear risk by most clinicians—and especially by the general public—has not advanced as deeply or as widely as has the uptake of nuclear technology. The knowledge gap is fortuitous in that there have not been more major nuclear disasters to learn from, but it is also dangerous, because answers to many questions are unknown and cannot be extrapolated from the experiences of Hiroshima, Three Mile Island, or Chernobyl. Nonetheless, health professionals will be expected to provide guidance at the next nuclear incident and to care for the many tens of thousands of people in evacuation zones. Therefore, common features of such events, described by Arifumi Hasegawa and co-authors in the second Series paper, and recommendations for responses, discussed by Akira Ohtsuru and colleagues in the third Series paper, make valuable reading.\n\n【4】Japan's unenviable experience of man-made nuclear disasters can inform scientific and ethical approaches to nuclear technology elsewhere. For nuclear power, two (among many) lessons from Fukushima are that seemingly fail-safe mechanisms can fail, and that when they do, health professionals will be expected to provide timely, accurate, and unambiguous advice, despite scarce evidence. For nuclear weapons, survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki remind the world of the barbaric consequences that result from using such devices against civilians 删除2:<u>(see World Report)</u>.

As a result of this unwelcome triple legacy, Japan has become a uniquely important site for understanding radiation-related health effects 1 and the aftermath and effects of nuclear accidents. 2,3 As the From Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Fukushima Series makes clear, the three Japanese locations are linked by more than tragedy.\n\n【20】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n*   Hiroshima survivors remember\n    *   Ahead of the 70th anniversary of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima, three survivors recount their memories of that day and their health experiences since.

But not for long. As the then Chairman of Hiroshima University's Department of Emergency and Critical Care Medicine, and also Deputy Director of its Radiation Medicine Centre, he found himself with a key part to play in subsequent events. His institution had been designated a tertiary centre for dealing with major disasters, and within 2 days Tanigawa had been flown to Fukushima as leader of the radiation emergency medical team.\n\n【22】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n*   Long-term effects of radiation exposure on health\n    *   Late-onset effects of exposure to ionising radiation on the human body have been identified by long-term, large-scale epidemiological studies. The cohort study of Japanese survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (the Life Span Study) is thought to be the most reliable source of information about these health effects because of the size of the cohort, the exposure of a general population of both sexes and all ages, and the wide range of individually assessed doses. For this reason, the Life Span Study has become fundamental to risk assessment in the radiation protection system of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and other authorities.\n\n【23】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n*   Health effects of radiation and other health problems in the aftermath of nuclear accidents, with an emphasis on Fukushima\n    *   437 nuclear power plants are in operation at present around the world to meet increasing energy demands. Unfortunately, five major nuclear accidents have occurred in the past—ie, at Kyshtym (Russia \\[then USSR\\], 1957), Windscale Piles (UK, 1957), Three Mile Island (USA, 1979), Chernobyl (Ukraine \\[then USSR\\], 1986), and Fukushima (Japan, 2011). The effects of these accidents on individuals and societies are diverse and enduring. Accumulated evidence about radiation health effects on atomic bomb survivors and other radiation-exposed people has formed the basis for national and international regulations about radiation protection.\n\n【24】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n*   Nuclear disasters and health: lessons learned, challenges, and proposals\n    *   Past nuclear disasters, such as the atomic bombings in 1945 and major accidents at nuclear power plants, have highlighted similarities in potential public health effects of radiation in both circumstances, including health issues unrelated to radiation exposure. Although the rarity of nuclear disasters limits opportunities to undertake rigorous research of evidence-based interventions and strategies, identification of lessons learned and development of an effective plan to protect the public, minimise negative effects, and protect emergency workers from exposure to high-dose radiation is important.\n\n【25】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n*   Towards long-term responses in Fukushima\n    *   4 years have passed since the nuclear power plant accident at Fukushima, Japan, moving the problems there from an acute nuclear disaster to a chronic environmental disaster, with multiple social, psychological, economic, and political consequences.

The 70th anniversary of this event is marked in the _Lancet_ Series From Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Fukushima. 1–3 The legacy of the atomic bomb extended far beyond Japan with atomic weapons testing programmes conducted worldwide for the next three and a half decades. Just 3 weeks before the atomic bomb attacks on Japan, the first nuclear explosion in history had taken place in secrecy in the desert of New Mexico, USA, when scientists working for the Manhattan Project tested the experimental nuclear bomb codenamed Trinity.\n\n【27】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n\n【28】Related Series\n--------------\n\n【29】Japan: from Hiroshima and Nagasaki to Fukushima\n\n【30】The Lancet\n\n【31】Published: August 1, 2015\n\n【32】On the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a three-part Series looks at the enduring radiological and psychological impact of nuclear disasters, including the most recent accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan in 2011.

This incident will change the image of Nepal from a country of tranquillity to a country of human- generated disaster.\n\n【2】The Nepali people have been thought politically peaceful with little internal or external conflict, and the harsh natural characteristics of the land on which they live are seen as the main source of turmoil. With its rugged and steep topography, Nepal has been thought of as a country prone to natural disaster. Disasters caused by water have been the most common, but most difficult to control. This scenario, however, has been changing since Feb 13, 1996, when the so called Maoists' People War started throughout Nepal.\n\n【3】We compared the number of deaths caused by the Maoist insurgency with those caused by natural disasters such as flood, landslides, fires, windstorms, hailstorms, earthquakes, and avalanches in the past 5 years. The Maoist related data was taken from the Nepal Human Rights Yearbook 2001. The Maoist-related deaths included those caused by police or the Maoists. For natural disasters, we used numbers taken from the Disaster Review made by the Ministry of Water Resources of Nepal and Water Induced Disaster Prevention Technical Centre. Although epidemics of infectious disease are classified as natural disasters, they were excluded from the comparison, since epidemics in Nepal are due to a health-service system whose failings involve natural and human factors.\n\n【4】As is shown in the table , the number of deaths caused by the Maoist insurgency was fewer than 100 in the 1st and 2nd years of their campaign. However, the toll increased rapidly in 1998 and reached a plateau with 400 or more deaths per year since this time. By contrast, the number of deaths related to natural disasters mentioned above has not been increased and has stayed lower than 400. Although the data are not shown in the table, this number has not changed strikingly in the past decade, except for 1993, when flood disaster resulted in 1336 deaths.\n\n【5】Table Maoist-related compared with natural-disaster deaths in Nepal 1996–2000\n\n|  | **Maoist-related deaths** | **Natural-disaster deaths** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996 | 81 | 406 |\n| 1997 | 48 | 176 |\n| 1998 | 409 | 350 |\n| 1999 | 469 | 282 |\n| 2000 | 397 | Data not yet available |\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【7】These results suggest that Nepal has become a country of human- generated disaster since 1998.

Pursuing a life of religious devotion or a career as a top ten tennis professional affects one's cognitions, emotions, and behaviour.

Current biological understanding of perianal fistulising Crohn's disease remains inadequate and previous classification systems have not provided clear guidance on therapy in clinical practice nor on defining patient cohorts within clinical trials. We propose a new classification system for perianal fistulising Crohn's disease that was developed through a modified nominal group technique expert consensus process. The classification identifies four groups of patients. Key elements include stratification according to disease severity as well as disease outcome; synchronisation of patient and clinician goals in decision making, with a proactive, combined medical and surgical approach, on a treat to patient goal basis; and identification of indications for curative fistula treatment, diverting ostomy, and proctectomy. The new classification retains an element of flexibility, in which patients can cycle through different classes over time. Furthermore, with each specific class comes a paired treatment strategy suggestion and description of clinical trial suitability. The proposed classification system is the first of its kind and is an important step towards tailored standardisation of clinical practice and research in patients with perianal fistulising Crohn's disease.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

Before leaving for the cinema, however, they need to know that the film is more allegory than medical thriller, more like _The Plague_ than like _Outbreak_ . The diagnosis of sudden atypical blindness is never in doubt, but no cause or treatment is ever discovered. Nor does it matter. Rather than explore medical details of a specific viral pandemic, factual or fictional, the intent here is to examine how quickly such an event can destroy civilised society. And despite Homer's praise of doctors in the ancient world of the _Iliad_ , in the contemporary urban world of _Blindness_ , it is the doctor's wife who, retaining both literal and moral vision, is the character of quality.\n\n【4】Blinding suddenly and spreading quickly, the White Sickness, as it becomes known, sets off widespread social panic that leads to quarantine, neglect, sadism, and chaos. Contributing to the allegorical effect, neither the setting nor the characters are ever named. As a condition for the rights to his novel, the Nobel Prize-winning author José Saramago required that “the film must not be set in any recognizable countries”. Shot in Brazil, Canada, and Uruguay, the movie has a contemporary urban setting that looks vaguely familiar but is largely unidentifiable. The characters are known only by their role or function: for example, Doctor (Mark Ruffalo), Doctor's Wife (Julianne Moore), Woman with Dark Glasses (Alice Braga), First Blind Man (Yusuke Iseya), First Blind Man's Wife (Yoshino Kimura), Thief (Don McKellar), Man with the Black Eye Patch (Danny Glover), and King of Ward Three (Gael García Bernal). These features help universalise the film so that, as director Fernando Meirelles commented in an interview , it more readily “draws parallels to such disasters as Hurricane Katrina, the global food shortage, and the cyclone in Myanmar”.\n\n【5】The film opens with a massive traffic jam caused by a driver's sudden blindness. Eventually several people come to his car to try to help, and one apparent Good Samaritan volunteers to drive him home, takes him up to his apartment, and then steals his car. The First Blind Man's Wife, the Thief, and the Doctor soon go blind too, thus establishing the mysterious contagious nature of this illness. Only the Doctor's Wife, who rejects her husband's efforts to protect her from the contagion, is immune, but she lies so that she can accompany her husband to the asylum where the blind are quarantined. The Doctor's Wife immediately accepts the moral responsibility to serve as guide and, insofar as possible, protector of the blind, while the Doctor's attempts to establish a kind of representative democracy in the asylum wards are mockingly rebuffed. As food supplies run low, a brutal inmate proclaims himself the King of Ward Three and takes control of the food, demanding that the others offer the men of his ward first their money and jewellery and then their women in exchange for food. Perhaps the most troubling scene in the film is the women's consequent visit to Ward Three, where they are sexually brutalised. Why didn't they resist? The question is familiar; the answer, elusive.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2008 Miramax</u>\n\n【6】Selected as the opening film of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, _Blindness_ received mixed reviews, and Meirelles redid parts of the film as a result. Among the changes, he deleted the narrative voice-over that had been given in the film to the Man with the Black Eye Patch. Perhaps the final version of the film is the better for it, but it is the voice of the narrator that gives Saramago's novel much of its power, and its absence leaves the film lacking in depth and transcendence. Meirelles has taken great care to make a film that does justice to Saramago's work, but the difference between the narrative world of the novel and the visual world of the film leaves a chasm that is not easily bridged.\n\n【7】Metaphorical blindness is rich in mythic allusions—blind seers—and in irony—the sighted who do not see injustice and who have no moral vision. But not everyone is persuaded by its utility or aptness in Meirelles's movie. In the USA, for example, the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) has staged 72 protests against cinemas showing the film, with NFB spokesmen alleging that the movie portrays blind people as monsters and will make it more difficult for them to be accepted into society and find jobs. The news and blog attention that followed gave rise to the perhaps inevitable headline “Blind People Offended by _Blindness_ ” and to observations that blind activists had missed the point: it is not individual blindness but sudden contagious blindness that produces panic, and it is quarantine under inhumane and horrific conditions that results in social breakdown.\n\n【8】Those who go to see this film expecting it to be a “thriller” or a “psychological thriller”, as it has been widely advertised, will probably be disappointed. Those who go prepared for the allegory that Meirelles, following Saramago's lead, has attempted to represent will probably be disturbed and dismayed but challenged to think about human nature and the range of human behaviour. Finally, as Dr Rieux, the narrator of Camus's great allegorical novel _The Plague_ , says at the end of the epidemic, “what we learn in a time of pestilence \\[is\\] that there are more things to admire in men than to despise”. Yet “the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good”. The lesson is painful and haunting—and forgotten at our peril.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【9】### Publication history\n\n【10】Published: 15 November 2008\n\n【11】### Identification\n\n【12】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61717-1</u>\n\n【13】### Copyright\n\n【14】© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Eligible patients with previously untreated limited-stage SCLC received one cycle of etoposide plus cisplatin (intravenous etoposide 100 mg/m 2 on days 1–3; intravenous cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 on day 1) plus AHTRT (1·5 Gy twice daily, 5 days a week, total 45 Gy over 3 weeks). Patients without progressive disease following induction therapy were randomised 删除2:<u>(1:1 ratio, using a minimisation method with biased-coin assignment balancing on ECOG performance status \\[0 _vs_ 1\\], response to induction chemoradiotherapy \\[complete response plus near complete response _vs_ partial response and stable disease\\], and institution)</u> to receive either three further cycles of consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin or irinotecan plus cisplatin (intravenous irinotecan 60 mg/m 2 on days 1, 8, 15; intravenous cisplatin 60 mg/m 2 on day 1). Patients, physicians, and investigators were aware of allocation. The primary endpoint was overall survival after randomisation; primary analysis was by intention to treat. 删除8:<u>This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00144989, and the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number C000000095.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】281 patients were enrolled between Sept 1, 2002, and Oct 2, 2006. After induction etoposide plus cisplatin and AHTRT, 258 patients were randomised to consolidation etoposide plus cisplatin (n=129) or irinotecan plus cisplatin (n=129). In the etoposide plus cisplatin group, median overall survival was 3·2 years (95% CI 2·4–4·1). In the irinotecan and cisplatin group, median overall survival was 2·8 years (95% CI 2·4–3·6); overall survival did not differ between the two groups (hazard ratio 1·09 \\[95% CI 0·80–1·46\\], one-sided stratified log-rank p=0·70). The most common adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were neutropenia (120 \\[95%\\] in the etoposide plus cisplatin group _vs_ 101 \\[78%\\] in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group), anaemia (44 \\[35%\\] _vs_ 50 \\[39%\\]), thrombocytopenia (26 \\[21%\\] _vs_ six \\[5%\\]), febrile neutropenia (21 \\[17%\\] _vs_ 18 \\[14%\\]), and diarrhoea (two \\[2%\\] _vs_ 13 \\[10%\\]). There was one treatment-related adverse event leading to death in each group (radiation pneumonitis in the etoposide plus cisplatin group; brain infarction in the irinotecan plus cisplatin group).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Four cycles of etoposide plus cisplatin and AHTRT should continue to be the standard of care for limited-stage SCLC.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Cancer Center and the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Oncology_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

This display might, at first, seem merely a cabinet of curiosities, but it so intrigued one Irish surgeon that he wrote an article on the topic. Published in the _British Medical Journal_ , Ian Fraser's text emphasised the importance of foreign body collections, claiming that these were not just oddities but told the “story of the human body”.\n\n【1】Many of the specimens described in Fraser's article have since been lost, but other medical collections contain similar exhibits. Most famous perhaps is the Chevalier Jackson Foreign Body Collection at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia's Mütter Museum in the USA, but such objects are also found in British pathology collections. Their location among human tissue specimens raises a number of interesting questions as to why (and how) they were collected, and how these displays were interpreted by collectors. Foreign bodies are often the only non-human specimens in pathology collections, indicating the ambiguous position they hold: a foreign body is not part of the human body, but neither can it be entirely separated from the place it was found.\n\n【2】The term foreign body, as applied to a substance of external origin present within the human body, seems to have entered medical language in the middle of the 18th century. The number of texts on the topic rapidly increased until 1880, followed by another peak around 1918. Often articles described techniques for the removal of such objects, the development of which certainly seems to have been a key point of interest in the early 20th century. Much of Chevalier Jackson's work was dedicated to teaching his students the safe use of the newly available oesophagoscope and bronchoscope (Jackson developed his own in the 1890s). Before the introduction of such instruments, dangerous surgery was often required.\n\n【3】Around this time, radiography was also becoming recognised as an important new diagnostic tool—one that cast new light on foreign bodies. In the UK, the first X-ray produced at the Royal London Hospital, in 1896, was of a foreign body (a needle in the foot of an elderly woman), and photographs of a toy bicycle in the oesophagus of a child, removed by Sir Hugh Rigby in 1906, were reproduced in the literary _Strand_ magazine. Some doctors suggested that the X-ray was a useful tool to detect malingering (which self-inflicted injury might often be described as). In 1899, for example, _The Lancet_ reported the case of a German soldier whose “Self-Inflicted Injuries \\[had been\\] Diagnosed by the Roentgen Rays”. The soldier claimed to have been bitten by a horse: however, an X-ray revealed five needles in the wound. Locating foreign bodies thus became associated with concern over the economic consequences of feigned disease.\n\n【4】Yet this does not, in itself, explain the existence of foreign body collections or, indeed, the interest in reproducing X-rays of these items. In the _Strand_ magazine, Rigby's photograph became a curious artwork, the odd shape of the foreign body as significant as the process of removal. Surgeons often meticulously ordered the items they collected, especially when large numbers were removed from the same individual. Although often accompanied by notes and X-rays, foreign body specimens thus hint at more than either the original ingestion or removal. The objects themselves might even be considered to have anatomical and physiological interest. At times, the foreign body could reveal structures of the human body that were usually hidden. Trichobezoars were often described as “hair casts of the stomach” and, when J M Gage of the Royal Earlswood Institution wrote to the _British Medical Journal_ in 1915, he included a photograph of the stomach-shaped mass of hair, tape, and bootlaces that he had removed from a patient. Gage noted that such an image would be interesting for his colleagues since “so much controversy has been raised lately regarding the shape of the stomach”.\n\n【5】Foreign bodies could also indicate the effects of the human body on objects, and thus the way the body functioned. Fraser, for example, reproduced a photograph of a rubber duck, swallowed by his pet dog. On removal, this had swollen to twice its original size. Meanwhile, a paper by Donald Macalister on the intentional swallowing of a fork in 1929 focused on the changes to the fork in the stomach, not the act of swallowing itself. These changes served as a warning to the surgeon before operating: not to assume that the object removed would necessarily be the same as when it had been swallowed. It was also evidence of the way the body functioned: as Fraser put it, “what it can do to keep itself right, its powers of accommodation, and where its weak points are”. The second of these fascinated many surgeons, who described such changes in peculiarly active terms. In the case of “a curious hysterical girl” who had swallowed a hat pin, Arthur Cooke of the Cambridge University Medical Society declared that “the patient had saved her own life by forming adhesions round the punctured intestine”, implying that the adaptation had been somehow intentional.\n\n【6】This case also indicates something else which puzzled many surgeons in this period: how the foreign body entered the patient in the first place. Jackson associated most cases, particularly in children, with carelessness. English physicians, meanwhile, seem to have been more interested in the intentional ingestion or insertion of objects. This was frequently associated with hysteria, particularly if the patient was female. Reports in medical journals during the late 19th and early 20th centuries were filled with such titles as “Hysteria: willful self-infliction of injury”. American ophthalmologists George Gould and Walter Pyle even coined the term “needle girls” to group together articles gathered from British journals that depicted the “peculiar type of self-mutilation…sometimes seen in hysteric persons…piercing their flesh with numerous needles or pins”. Explanations tended to rely on preconceptions about the nature of so-called hysterical women: a need for attention from others and a deceitful, manipulative nature. In the early 20th century, discussion of foreign bodies also became closely associated with new psychological approaches to mental functioning, such as Freudian psychoanalysis or the work of psychiatrist Pierre Janet. Indeed, Freud and Josef Breuer even used the analogy of the foreign body to explain hysteria, suggesting that “psychical trauma…acts like a foreign body which long after its entry must continue to be regarded as an agent that is still at work”.\n\n【7】Thus, in surgical writings, the foreign body became something from which psychological meaning could be drawn. In 1913, William Clayton-Green puzzled: “Did hair-swallowers desire to do something which others abhorred? Or did they wish to excite wonder and interest and to puzzle their doctors? Or was hair-swallowing a form of psychical tic, occurring in mentally abnormal subjects?” He and his contemporaries struggled to answer such questions. This new interest in a psychological model of the foreign body is also apparent in the case of a young woman, Beatrice A, admitted repeatedly to the Royal London Hospital between 1898 and 1909 for the removal of hairpins inserted into her bladder. On her first admission, the young milliner was described as “\\[m\\]ad as a hatter”. Yet, by 1909, this conclusion did not seem so obvious. Beatrice's actions were now referred to as a “habit”, and it was noted that no other symptoms of insanity had been observed. Beatrice herself informed the surgeon “that she formerly suffered from an impulse to throw herself out \\[of\\] windows \\[and\\] once did it. Many years ago however she gave this up for the now harmless amusement of putting hairpins into her bladder.” This unusual explanation appears to have perturbed Beatrice's surgeons, located as it was somewhere between the rational and the irrational: inserting hairpins did indeed seem less dangerous than falling from a height, but why might she need to do either? Thus articles in the next few decades debated the psychological meaning of foreign bodies, with a wide array of possible explanations suggested from hysteria to malingering, sexual perversion, and “professional swallowing”.\n\n【8】Foreign body collections thus provoked the curiosity of early 20th-century surgeons from a number of perspectives, not only related to their removal. How was the body physically affected by foreign objects and how, in turn, were items changed by their contact with the human body? Why might people intentionally ingest or otherwise insert foreign objects into their bodies? We can perhaps view such curiosity as closely connected to philosophical questions that were of increasing relevance in this period: in particular, where did the human body end and the foreign body begin? The scientific revolution of the 17th century and the industrial revolution of the 18th century had encouraged the use of analogies between man and machine, but it was only around the turn of the 20th century that technological change became surgically applied to the human body. Developments in surgical implants since the 1950s ensure that this concern remains resonant, explaining why foreign body collections continue to exert a strange hold over the imagination. In pathological collections, foreign bodies are still found alongside human tissue but, unlike their fellow exhibits, do not fall under the remit of organisations governing the use and display of human remains. Collections of foreign bodies thus illustrate the porous and flexible nature of the boundary between the human and non-human world.\n\n【9】Foreign bodies removed from the stomach of a woman in 1915\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【10】These objects are from a 26-year-old woman who was admitted to hospital in 1915, having accidentally swallowed a metal hook 2 weeks previously, since when there had been pain and the vomiting of black material.

WHO states that the risk factors covered are “those that make the greatest contribution to mortality and morbidity from chronic diseases”. The organisation focuses its report on tobacco and alcohol use, patterns of physical inactivity, low fruit or vegetable intake, obesity, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes; Ezzati and colleagues focus on 20 other risk factors.\n\n【2】In neither the article nor the WHO publication are medicine-related problems mentioned —ie, negative clinical outcomes resulting from the use (or lack of use) of medicines— despite the fact that such problems fit the three conditions for inclusion as risk factors noted in the SuRF report—namely, they contribute to mortality and morbidity; can be affected by primary interventions; and can easily be measured in populations.\n\n【3】The potential danger of medicines is an important issue, on which much has been published.

Adolescents' behaviours affect their future health, wellbeing, and life expectancy. Changes in the global economy, education, family structure, and technology are altering societies worldwide, and reshaping adolescence. The extent to which these changes affect adolescents' perceptions of health is unknown. Furthermore, many of the most disadvantaged adolescents who live in urban areas have little access to education and employment and other community resources; therefore, other mechanisms to link young people to health information and care are needed. We investigated how disadvantaged adolescents in different urban environments define health and ill health, and described where adolescents go for health information and services, and the barriers they face in seeking or accessing help.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Well-being of Adolescents in Vulnerable Environments is a six-city international study of young people in vulnerable urban environments. We chose six sites: Baltimore (MD, USA), Johannesburg (South Africa), Shanghai (China), New Delhi (India), Ibadan (Nigeria), and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Participants were recruited with different methods depending on the site, through local community workers, flyer distribution, word-of-mouth, or at community events. Researchers in each site used identical methods: 20 male and female adolescents had in-depth face-to-face interviews; 10 male and female adolescents participated in Photovoice, in which participants had photography training and took photographs of what they perceived to be the meaning of health in their communities; 80 adolescents participated in community mapping and focus groups, in which adolescents were grouped on the basis of age and sex and asked to draw maps of their communities and discuss health issues related to their community; and 20 key informant adults who work with young people in their communities were interviewed. Data were recorded, transcribed, and analysed with Atlas.ti (version 7). A core set of codes was used by all sites during the initial coding process and additional site-specific codes were added by the qualitative researcher at each site. Themes were compared across sites by creating matrices of the major codes and examined for patterns and differences.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】468 adolescents, aged 5–19 years, participated in the study. Data from Rio de Janeiro are not included because of delays in data collection. Violence, personal safety, limited access to care, and gender role hierarchies were all top adolescent health concerns, although they differed in priority by site. The factors that contributed to these concerns varied between sites. In New Delhi, concerns about personal safety were related to harassment of girls; in Shanghai, to theft and discrimination; in Baltimore, to gun violence and drugs; in Johannesburg, to neighbourhood violence and overcrowding; and in Ibadan, to harassment of girls and armed robberies at night. Across the sites, female adolescents were perceived to be at greatest risk of victimisation and were generally perceived to be unsafe in their communities. Adolescents made a strong connection between their environment and their health. They described their living conditions as poor and dirty, characterised by inadequate sanitation, overcrowded buildings, and a lack of resources and opportunities. Consequentially, there was generally little trust in adults and service providers in the community, and in the notion that health services could be helpful to them.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Although the sites are in very different places, adolescents had similar health concerns. To promote health, development efforts should be expanded to address gender equality and safety issues for adolescents in severely depressed urban communities and their need for multifaceted health-care services.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】AstraZeneca.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】KNM designed the study, analysed and interpreted data, and wrote the report.

WHO now estimates that pesticide ingestion is the most common method of suicide worldwide, and has responded by launching a global Pesticides and Health Initiative. \n\n【1】Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the high morbidity and mortality associated with pesticide self-poisoning. These strategies include improved clinical management of poisoning, provision of counselling services for vulnerable individuals, and restricted access to toxic pesticides. \n\n【2】Restriction of the availability of pesticides to prevent their use in impulsive acts of self-harm is emerging as a favoured approach. Suggested measures include the development of agricultural practices in which pesticide use is avoided or reduced to a minimum, national bans on highly toxic pesticides, and promotion of initiatives to store pesticides safely. Before one or more approaches are chosen, careful assessment will be required from a combined public-health and agricultural perspective.\n\n【3】The pesticide industry has long argued for secure storage and use of locked boxes to prevent all forms of pesticide poisoning, and has started several projects testing and scaling-up the use of safe-storage boxes. With the active backing of industry, support for this approach has begun to gather momentum at WHO and the International Association for Suicide Prevention, with three meetings in Durban, Singapore, and Geneva. \n\n【4】The pesticide industry's concern about this important public-health issue is welcome. However, industry-led initiatives will probably be affected by corporate priorities for shareholders and profits, and could bypass adequate consideration and assessment of alternative strategies.\n\n【5】A second concern about the rapid scale-up and implementation of the locked-box approach is to carefully ensure that the approach will not have unplanned adverse effects. Intuitively, locked boxes are a sensible solution. However, in a pilot study in Sri Lanka, we found that many of the 172 participating households that received an inhouse storage box changed the location of pesticide storage from their fields (0·1–2 km away) to their homes. After 7 months, the number of households storing pesticides in their household increased from 54% to 98%, and only 84% locked the box. These changes could thus increase access to pesticides at times of stress. The storage box also highlighted where exactly the pesticides were stored; during our study, locked boxes were twice broken into 删除2:<u>( figure )</u> and pesticides ingested, with one death. Another intervention of simple distribution of boxes without education or support resulted in only 30% of households locking their box.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure Pesticide-storing metal box</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【6】This box (45×30×37 cm) has been forced open and the contents used for self-harm.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【7】So far, no studies assessing the feasibility or effectiveness of safe pesticide-storage devices have been published. Such knowledge is needed before the practice can be widely recommended. Variation in cultural beliefs and agricultural practice in different communities and countries highlights the need for qualitative research to ensure generalisability to local circumstances and to implement appropriate modifications. Practical design issues, including ways to increase the likelihood of boxes being locked, should also be assessed before large-scale trials are undertaken. Infield storage devices or community-run stores could be more effective than the currently promoted inhouse boxes, but acceptable models have not yet been developed.\n\n【8】With the public-health community's energy focused on safe storage, policymakers could be distracted from more immediate and longlasting solutions such as sales restrictions, product reformulation, import bans, and general reductions in agricultural pesticide use. Safe-storage interventions should be studied and assessed with other options that might not be as attractive to industry.\n\n【9】DG, ME, and AHD are on the scientific advisory group of a Syngenta-funded study to assess the toxicity of a new formulation of paraquat, and have received travel expenses to attend research group meetings.

Women with singleton fetuses whose estimated weight exceeded the 95th percentile, were randomly assigned (1:1), via computer-generated permuted-block randomisation (block size of four to eight) to receive induction of labour within 3 days between 37 +0 weeks and 38 +6 weeks of gestation, or expectant management. Randomisation was stratified by centre. Participants and caregivers were not masked to group assignment. Our primary outcome was a composite of clinically significant shoulder dystocia, fracture of the clavicle, brachial plexus injury, intracranial haemorrhage, or death. We did analyses by intention to treat. 删除8:<u>This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00190320.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We randomly assigned 409 women to the induction group and 413 women to the expectant management group, of whom 407 women and 411 women, respectively, were included in the final analysis. Mean birthweight was 3831 g (SD 324) in the induction group and 4118 g (392) in the expectant group. Induction of labour significantly reduced the risk of shoulder dystocia or associated morbidity (n=8) compared with expectant management (n=25; relative risk \\[RR\\] 0·32, 95% CI 0·15–0·71; p=0·004). We recorded no brachial plexus injuries, intracranial haemorrhages, or perinatal deaths. The likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery was higher in women in the induction group than in those in the expectant management group (RR 1·14, 95% CI 1·01–1·29). Caesarean delivery and neonatal morbidity did not differ significantly between the groups.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Induction of labour for suspected large-for-date fetuses is associated with a reduced risk of shoulder dystocia and associated morbidity compared with expectant management. Induction of labour does not increase the risk of caesarean delivery and improves the likelihood of spontaneous vaginal delivery. These benefits should be balanced with the effects of early-term induction of labour.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris and the University of Geneva.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

Nonetheless, there are several drawbacks to this study, of which readers should be aware, particularly if one is considering using this information to guide treatment decisions.\n\n【2】Relapses were retrospectively captured at the time of clinic visits. Determination of neutralising antibody status was also retrospective and used a slightly unusual antiviral cytopathic assay that incorporates several different sensitivities. How the quantitative results should be interpreted is therefore unclear, since overall proportions of individuals positive for neutralising antibodies are higher than those previously reported.\n\n【3】The study includes doses of Rebif that are irrelevant in the USA (22 μg three times weekly and 22 μg once weekly), which together account for 265 of the 541 patients analysed at 1year; by contrast, only 82 of those 541 patients received Avonex. None received Rebif 44 μg three times weekly—a dose that has been shown to result in significantly lower neutralising antibody positivity than the 22 μg three times weekly dose. Beyond 3 years, most of the remaining 108 patients were receiving Betaseron (75 patients) or Rebif 22 μg once weekly (24 patients).\n\n【4】Sorensen and colleagues conclude that neutralising antibody positivity can affect relapse rate (which is not a new finding ), without a demonstrated effect on disability progression. Probably more important than positivity is the actual neutralising antibody titre, as suggested by Polman and colleagues, who also showed that there was no effect on disability outcome. In the PRISMS study, the effect of neutralising antibodies on relapses was only noted in years 3 and 4 of the study, and seemed to be dissipating by the study end. Being neutralising-antibody “positive” does not mean permanence and does not equate with complete loss of efficacy.\n\n【5】Sorensen and colleagues also conclude that “treatment decisions should still primarily be based on clinical outcome”. This is in accordance with the guidelines of the American Academy of Neurology, which state that “the biologic effect of neutralising antibody is uncertain” and “the clinical utility of measuring neutralising antibody in an individual on IFNβ therapy is uncertain”. However, Sorensen and colleagues go on to assert that, “in patients with neutralising antibodies a change in treatment would be reasonable if substantial clinical activity is noted”. Surely the most rational treatment approach in such patients would be to change therapy, irrespective of neutralising antibody status. Measuring neutralising antibodies might be sensible in an individual on low-dose interferon therapy who is exhibiting a suboptimum response, before considering dose escalation.\n\n【6】Sorensen and colleagues' results do not clarify the already-existing, murky pool of data and debate regarding neutralising antibodies. Given the continuing dispute about neutralising antibodies, the need for a more widely accepted (eg, MxA ) assay, and the need for prospectively designed studies to assess treatment based on neutralising antibody status, the evidence-based approach remains that of making treatment decisions on the basis of an individual patient's clinical status.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

So, after the largest randomised trial in orthopaedic surgery we are no closer to knowing if thromboembolic prophylaxis is needed for major orthopaedics surgery and, if it is, what type of prophylaxis is best.\n\n【8】Hip fracture is associated with a significant mortality and morbidity. The PEP study suggests that aspirin will not affect this, and the meta-analysis of heparin prophylaxis indicates that heparin has no beneficial effect on mortality. The low clinical incidence of thromboembolic disease, even for hip-fracture patients, suggests that research funds are better directed towards other methods of reducing mortality and that we should end our obsession with thromboembolic disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

General engagement with these services has increased since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore how user engagement patterns with these platforms changed during the pandemic.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In this cohort study, we included individuals aged 14–25 years who signed up to the online mental health platform Kooth in the UK before the pandemic (May 1, 2019 to March 10, 2020) and during the pandemic (March 11, 2020 to Oct 31, 2021). Routinely collected usage data were assessed for consenting users who returned to Kooth at least once after sign-up. We used logistic regression to compare service component usage and overall engagement across cohorts.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】5048 individuals (mean sign-ups per day 9·0 \\[12·0\\]) were included in the pre-pandemic cohort and 13 841 (mean sign-ups per day 11·5 \\[13·9\\]) in the pandemic cohort, representing a significant increase in sign-ups per day during the pandemic compared with the pre-pandemic period (Welch's t-test p=0·0001). Compared with users pre-pandemic, users during the pandemic were less likely to have a drop-in chat with a practitioner (odds ratio \\[OR\\] 0·50 \\[95% CI 0·47–0·54\\], p<0·0001) but were more likely to journal (1·92 \\[1·77–2·07\\], p<0·0001) and comment on existing content (1·10 \\[1·03–1·18\\], p=0·008).

The letter continues: “There are some NGOs still pushing women to participate in the unethical trial. Those people only think about their own benefit, not ours. They have not provided information and documents related to the trial to us … What worries us the most is that the research group does not have a clear ethics protocol for this clinical trial. They are pushing us to do what they think is right and take no concern about our lives.”\n\n【2】It is worthy of note that there has been a reduction of new HIV cases for several years, attributed largely to the rising use of condoms in commercial sex. However, sex workers' powerlessness and consequent vulnerability to HIV is made worse in Phnom Penh where almost all sex workers are raped, usually by police or gangsters who act with impunity because sex workers have no recourse to a justice system. They are treated as non-citizens, without choice or rights. This is exemplified at times by the 100% Condom Use Programme which further deprives workers of control over their working environments. This reality, coupled with the nation's lack of quality medical services, makes current and future promises of medical treatment and negotiations for access to cheap tenofovir sound distressingly empty.\n\n【3】Duan has advocated a consumer model to counter barriers to participation in HIV vaccine trials. Sex workers, who have been subject to research for a couple of centuries with little discernable benefit to them, and often harm, would prefer not to be regarded as consumers of a research package. Sex workers have voices, as individuals and through groups formed to speak on their behalf, and expect to be part of the decision-making process about what research is done using their bodies, the design and implementation of this research, and subsequent follow-up. In the process carried out by researchers funded by the US National Institutes of Health, they were neither placed on the community advisory boards nor directly addressed about their concerns until after they had made such a fuss that the Prime Minister was forced to intervene.\n\n【4】Most generously, sex workers (and their advocates) have indicated their willingness to continue involvement in trials, but a great deal must change before researchers are worthy of their confidence. A political and social environment that undermines their status as human beings, and threatens their lives and wellbeing, must be relevant considerations when making decisions about research. And they must be party to this decision-making process from the earliest stages.\n\n【5】As people living at the margins, sex workers rarely have access to respectful treatment and thus are unlikely to derive benefits from the results of a trial in the long term—even were these to be promised. At the very least, they and their representatives should be treated with respect and their contributions acknowledged in the context of research in which their very vulnerability makes them “ideal” participants.\n\n【6】We thank Andrew Hunter for his contribution to this letter.\n\n【7】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

There exist gaps in evidence on school-based prevention programmes—namely, failure to use experimental designs and standardised validated measures in evaluation, and design limitations in terms of their duration, intensity, and breadth. We aimed to address these gaps in evaluating the effectiveness of Keeping Safe, a whole school child maltreatment prevention programme.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In a two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial, participating schools were randomised (1:1, wait-list control group) using a computer-generated list. Intervention schools implemented Keeping Safe between Sept 16, 2016, and June 30, 2018, while wait-list control schools continued to teach the statutory curriculum as usual. Keeping Safe, which is premised on a whole-school model with components covering all forms of maltreatment, targets children, parents, and school staff. Power calculations indicated that approximately 40 schools are required in each arm of the study to detect a minimum detectable effect size of 0·19 SD with 80% power and 95% significance. This was to allow for a minimum detectable percentage point difference of 2·7 for an outcome that is rare in the control group, at around 5% (ie, disclosure of abuse). Data were collected by teachers and school staff under classroom test conditions following a standard data collection procedure devised by the research team. It was not possible to blind school staff. However, the outcome data were obtained through a self-report measure reducing potential outcome assessor bias. Data processors and the trial statistician were blinded to allocation. Data were collected at baseline (June, 2016), and 1 and 2 years after programme implementation. Primary outcome measures included Children's Knowledge of Abuse Questionnaire (CKAQ), a 33-item questionnaire designed to assess children's knowledge of sexual abuse, and the “What If” Situations Test (WIST), which assesses children's ability to “Identify”, “Refuse”, “Escape” “Tell”, and “Report” inappropriate situations. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and conducted at the level of the individual, taking into account the clustering effects of schools. Here we report analysis of data collected after the first year of implementation (June, 2016, to June, 2017). Ethics approval was given by the NSPCC Research Ethics Committee R/15/67\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】33 schools were allocated to the intervention (1649 children) and 31 to control (1550 children) groups. The ITT analysis ensures that children included at baseline were included at Time 1. After year 1 the intervention group had 31 schools (two schools withdrew in July, 2016, after randomisation, citing changing school leadership as the reason for withdrawal) and the control group had 30 schools (one withdrew in June, 2016, citing sensitive content of questions in outcome measures as reason for withdrawal). There were no statistically significant differences between intervention and control at baseline across all outcomes. After 1 year, the intervention group scored significantly higher than the control group on three of the four knowledge dimensions of the CKAQ (appropriate refusal β=0·241, p=0·001; inappropriate touch β=0·850, p<0·0001; and inappropriate touch in familiar relationships β=0·455, p<0·0001); assessment of appropriate touch was not significantly different. The intervention group also scored higher on four of the five skill dimensions of the WIST (“Identify” β=0·675, p=0·007; “Escape” β=0·741, p=0·049; “Tell” β=0·432, p=0·035; and “Report” β=1·006, p=0·03).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】These results are encouraging and useful for initial planning around scale-up of the Keeping Safe programme.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】The Department of Education Northern Ireland (5 year grant, 2013–18).

However, with only lamivudine widely available in Africa, it is possible that as rollout of antiretroviral therapy reduces AIDS deaths, chronic liver disease including hepatocellular carcinoma will become increasingly common, as has been seen in cohorts from developed nations.

The vast majority of current studies on fluorescence-guided surgery focus on the first near-infrared window (NIR-I, 700–900 nm). NIR-II window has advantage with deeper penetration depth and higher resolution and lower background than NIR-I, however, there is a lack of studies on the use of NIR-II fluorescence imaging for intraoperative navigation of colorectal cancer.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】In this study, we established 2D5-IRDye800CW, an NIR-II targeting probe, which can specifically recognize CEACAM5-positive colorectal cancer. We constructed a variety of colorectal cancer animal models and used human samples to verify the targeting of the probe and the value of NIR-II imaging for colorectal cancer intraoperative navigation.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】Our study provides a new technical means for NIR-II fluorescence imaging to be used in colorectal cancer surgery. It helps to discover and identify deeper vessels and small peritoneal metastases, which can assist surgeons in accurate tumour resection. In addition, our probe is composed of nanobody with high affinity and low immunogenicity conjugated to conventional near-infrared fluorescent dye IRDye800CW, which shows great potential for clinical translation.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the cancers with the highest morbidity and mortality worldwide. Radical surgical resection of all tumour tissue with clear margins remains the mainstay of treatment in the majority of colorectal cancer patients, and complete surgical tumour resection (R0) is associated with better overall survival and lower recurrence rates. However, R0 resection remains challenging in many patients. Tumour-positive resection margins have been reported in 5% of colon cancer cases, but the incidence is higher with increasing tumour stage, up to 14% in T4 colon cancer. In addition, in locally advanced rectal cancer, the proportion of positive tumour margins was 28%, 35% rectal cancer occurred incomplete tumour resection. This rate was even higher in patients with recurrent rectal cancer, with positive resection margins reported in up to 50% of tumours. Moreover, approximately 3–20% of colorectal cancer patients develop peritoneal metastases (PM), and international standards recommend cytoreductive surgery combined with intraperitoneal hyperthermia chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) as a potentially curative procedure. The completeness of cytoreduction is directly associated with survival ; therefore, maximal cytoreduction of small and otherwise undetected tumour lesions is important. In these cases, it is difficult to accurately distinguish adhesions or fibrosis and tumour lesions because the surgeon can only rely on visual and tactile information, and there is a lack of real-time intraoperative imaging technology to assist the surgeon in distinguishing between malignant and benign tissue. \n\n【21】Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is a real-time imaging technology that combines near-infrared fluorescent targeted probes with a fluorescence imaging system to distinguish tumour from normal tissue by identifying specific and highly expressed molecular targets on tumour tissue. Several clinical studies of NIR-targeted probes have been reported for malignancies (colorectal, pancreatic, and ovarian), metastases (liver and peritoneum), and vital anatomical structures (nerves, etc.). Conventional fluorescence-guided surgery focuses on the first near-infrared window (NIR-I, 700–900 nm), which has limited tissue penetration depth of only 1–6 mm. However, the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000–1700 nm) significantly overcomes the effects of strong tissue absorption, autofluorescence, and photon scattering to afford deep tissue penetration (up to 20 mm), micron-scale spatial resolution, and high tumour-to-normal tissue (T/NT, more than 190), which is promising to improve T/NT and tumour margin determination, allowing more precise tumour resection. CEACAM5 is overexpressed in 90% of CRC, and the expression of CEACAM5 in normal tissue is on average 60-fold lower than in tumour tissue, making it an optimal imaging target for CRC. \n\n【22】Although many NIR-II fluorescent probes with excellent imaging performance have been reported, the clinical conversion potential of existing NIR-II targeted probes is still limited due to the unknown immunogenicity of current fluorescent dyes. To the best of our knowledge, the application of NIR-II to CRC intraoperative navigation has not been reported yet. Therefore, in this study, we conjugated the anti-CEACAM5 nanobody (2D5) with the near-infrared fluorescent dye IRDye800CW to construct a targeted NIR-II probe: 2D5-IRDye800CW to explore the value of NIR-II fluorescence in intraoperative navigation of colorectal cancer.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Ethics statement\n\n【25】This study was approved by the medical ethics review team of the third medical center of Chinese PLA General Hospital (ethics number: 2022-27). Informed consent was obtained from all participants included in the study. All animal experiments were performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n【26】### 2D5-IRDye800CW synthesis and characterization\n\n【27】A 5-fold molar excess of IRDye800CW NHS (LI-COR Bioscience) (dissolved at 10 mg/ml in DMSO) was incubated with anti-CEACAM5 nanobody (2D5, Shenzhen Guochuang Nanobody Technology Co. Ltd.) (1 mg/ml) for 2 h at pH 8.5 in the dark. Unbound IRDye800CW NHS was eluted by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) with PBS (pH 7.4) as an elution buffer (0.5 ml/min). The concentration and fluorescence binding ratio of labeled nanobody and the absorption spectra was determined on a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV-Vis spectrophotometer, and the emission spectra were measured on FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments). Affinity was determined using surface plasmon resonance (Biacore T200, GE Healthcare) on 2D5-IRDye800CW proteins immobilized on a CM5 chip (GE Healthcare).\n\n【28】### NIR-I/II imaging of blood vessels and capillary phantom\n\n【29】All animals purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. The head and right hindlimb of 8-week-old C57BL6 male mice were used for depilation, and 2D5-IRDye800CW (1–5 mg/kg) was administrated via tail vein; then, the NIR-II camera (Xenics Cheetah-640CL TE3) was used for imaging. The filters were selected at 1000 nm, 1100 nm, 1200 nm, 1300 nm and 1400 nm, and the excitation laser was 808 nm with the exposure time of 30 ms∼1 s. NIR-I imaging was performed with CMOS, PCO camera, and a bandpass filter of 850 ± 40 nm was connected to capture NIR-I fluorescence. The excitation wavelength was 792 nm and the exposure time was 30 ms. After the images were acquired, the contrast within the region of interest containing blood vessels in NIR-I and NIR-II imaging was quantified by calculating the cross-section fluorescence intensity. For the phantom experiment, 0.01 mg/ml 2D5-IRDye800CW was injected into a capillary glass tube with an inner diameter of 1 mm, soaked with 2% fat emulsion, and the depth was 5 mm for NIR-I/II imaging. All signal intensity profile was Gaussian fitted in the Origin software (OriginPro 2018C, OriginLab).\n\n【30】### Western blot and immunofluorescence\n\n【31】The human CRC cell lines HT29- _Luc_ (BNCC, Cat# BNCC353700, RRID: CVCL\\_5J20), colo201 (BNCC, Cat# BNCC360304, RRID: CVCL\\_F399) and SW480 (BNCC, Cat# BNCC100604, RRID: CVCL\\_0546) were purchased from BeNa Culture Collection, Henan, China, and colo320 (EK-Bioscience, Cat# CC-Y1568, RRID: CVCL\\_1989) was purchased from Shanghai EK-Bioscience Biotechnology Co. Ltd. The Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with protease and protein phosphatase inhibitors, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein (G5001, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) assay kit. Protein samples were then boiled for 10 min, and 20 μg of total protein was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Blocking of the membrane with a 5% BSA was done for 2 h at room temperature (RT). Immunoblotting was performed overnight using a 1:500 dilution of anti-CEACAM5 antibody (Abcam Cat# ab133633, RRID: AB\\_2924882) in a refrigerator at 4 °C, and GAPDH (GB12002, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) was used as an endogenous control. The samples were washed in TBST for three times, and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with goat polyclonal secondary antibody to rabbit IgG-HRP (GB23303; Service-bio, Wuhan, China) for about 1 h at RT. Finally, CEACAM5 expression was detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence, imaged by an Alliance MINI HD 6 analyzer (UVITEC, UK) and calculated by quantifying western blot band intensities using the ImageJ Gel Analyzer plugin. We used PKH26 cell membrane staining (Sigma Aldrich, MINI26) and immunofluorescence to locate the subcellular location of CEACAM5 and the probe. The cells in the exponential growth phase were digested and the cell membrane was stained according to the instructions for PKH26. Then, the cell concentration was adjusted to 1∼5 × 10 5 /ml with a complete medium; and cells were evenly spread on 15mm confocal dishes containing a 0.5ml medium. After cell adhesion, incubated with 0.01 mg/ml 2D5-IRDye800CW for 2 h at RT, then wished with PBS three times, fixed with 4% Paraformaldehyde Fix Solution (PFA) for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, 5% BSA was added, and cells were blocked at RT for 30 min. Adding the diluted (1:2000) Alexa Fluor®488 Anti-CEACAM5 antibody (Abcam Cat# ab214868, RRID: AB\\_2924884) and refrigerating was done at 4 °C overnight. Washing with PBS in the dark for 3 × 5 min, adding DAPI counterstaining for 5 min, and imaging with laser confocal microscope was done.\n\n【32】### _In vitro_ targeting evaluation\n\n【33】Three CRC cell lines HT29- _Luc_ , SW480, colo201 and normal colon epithelial cell line NCM460 (EK-Bioscience, Cat# CC-Y1550, RRID: CVCL\\_0460) were cultured. SW480 was cultured in L15 + 10% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) at 37 °C in 100% air. HT29- _Luc_ , colo201 and NCM460 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium and DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% P/S at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 . Approximately 5 × 10 5 /ml cells were evenly spread in a 15 mm glass bottom petri dish containing 1 ml of culture medium. After the cells grew to the required density (70%–90%), 2D5-IRDye800CW 200 μL of 0.01 mg/ml was added, and cells were incubated for 2 h at RT in the dark, washed with PBS 3 times, fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min, and stained with DAPI for 10 min. Observations were made with a laser confocal microscope (LSM780, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). For the binding site competition blocking experiment, cells were incubated with 2D5 unlabeled with IRDye800CW at 100 times probe concentration for 2 h, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with 200 μL of 2D5-Irdye800CW at 0.01 mg/ml. Nucleus was stained with DAPI and observed by laser confocal microscopy.\n\n【34】### Immunohistochemical staining and HE staining\n\n【35】Fresh tissue was placed in a cryotome cryostat for section. Fixed the tissue sections with cold acetone at 4 °C. Socked the slides in 3% H 2 O 2 solution in PBS at RT for 10 min to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Incubated the samples in 5% BSA blocking solution at 37 °C for 30 min. Then add properly diluted primary antibody to cover the samples (1:400 dilution, Abcam Cat# ab4539, RRID: AB\\_304505). Incubated overnight at 4 °C in a wet box. Cover the samples with properly diluted secondary antibody (1:1000, ThermoFisher, Cat# A10551) at RT after PBS washing. Place sections in solution for DAB reaction. The clinical tumour tissue samples were obtained from clinical surgery, and stored in 4% paraformaldehyde after _in vitro_ imaging. The tissue sections were embedded with embedding agent, frozen, fixed after sectioning, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for pathological analysis.\n\n【36】### Nude mouse colorectal cancer xenograft models\n\n【37】All the mice were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. Approximately 5 × 10 6 colorectal cancer cells were mixed with 125 μL PBS and then inoculated into the right lower back of BALB/c nude mice to construct a subcutaneous tumour model. Imaging was performed when the tumour grew to 0.5 cm–1.0 cm. For the orthotopic model of colorectal cancer, the nude mice were anesthetized and the cecum was exposed by surgical procedures. A 25G standard 1 ml insulin syringe was used to draw 50 μL of cell suspension (1 × 10 5 ), then the needle was slowly inserted between the cecal serosa and the muscularis layer to inject cells, and finally the peritoneum and skin were sutured in layers. The entire process was completed on a sterile ultra-clean bench.\n\n【38】### Bioluminescence imaging\n\n【39】Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was performed using the IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System (Caliper Life Sciences, Waltham, Massachusetts) to locate the tumour. Tumour-bearing mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and then received an intraperitoneal injection with 150 mg/kg D-luciferin in 100 μL of normal saline; BLI images were acquired 10 min after D-luciferin injection.\n\n【40】### NIR-I/II fluorescence imaging\n\n【41】2D5-IRDye800CW at a dose of 3 μg/g was administered through the tail vein into tumour bearing mice. NIR-I fluorescence imaging was performed with a Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) camera (PCO. edge 5.5, PCO, Germany) and IVIS Spectrum In Vivo Imaging System. To obtain NIR-I fluorescence, a long-pass filter with the cutoff wavelength of 850 nm (FEL0850, Thorlabs, USA) was connected with the lens. The wavelength of the excitation laser was 792 nm with the power set to be 20 mW/cm 2 , and the exposure time was 30 ms. NIR-II fluorescence imaging was implemented with an InGaAs SWIR camera (Xenics Cheetah-640CL TE3) coordinated with a lens (Spacecom VF50M SWIR) that can transmit NIR-II light, and a filter wheel (1000 nm, 1100 nm, 1200 nm, 1300 nm, 1400 nm, 1500 nm, Thorlabs, USA) was fixed in the front end of the lens to capture NIR-II fluorescence. The wavelength of the excitation laser was 808 nm with the power set to be 50 mW/cm 2 , and the exposure time was 0.5–2 s. The blocking group was injected with unlabeled 2D5 at a dose of 100 μg/g, and 10min later, 2D5-IRDye800cw was administrated with body weight of 3μg/g for fluorescence imaging. The fluorescence intensity was measured by the software ImageJ, and tumour-background ratio (TBR) is defined as the ratio of fluorescence intensity between tumour and peritumoral tissue.\n\n【42】### Ex vivo molecular imaging of fresh human CRC specimen\n\n【43】We collected endoscopic biopsy CRC specimens (n = 5), and intraoperatively resected CRC tumour with adjacent normal tissue (n = 10) at the Third Medical Center of Chinese PLA General Hospital, patient and tumor characteristics are in the supplementary materials 删除2:<u>( Table S1 )</u>. We did not specifically analyze the effects of different genders on the experiment, but it is necessary to analyze different genders. The fresh specimens were preserved in a tissue preservation solution, and then the blood stains on the specimen's surface were washed with PBS. CRC specimens were incubated with 2D5-IRDye800CW at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 30 min, and normal tissue specimens were used as control. After incubation, tissue specimens were rinsed three times with PBS and imaged with an NIR-II camera. Specimens were further frozen and sectioned to a thickness of 6 μm, and the sections were blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum for 30 min under RT, then incubated with 2D5-IRDye800CW (10 μg/ml) for 20 min at RT, washed three times with PBS, and sealed with anti-fluorescence quenching tablet (including DAPI). Finally, three consecutive sections were cut for HE and CEACAM5 immunohistochemical staining.\n\n【44】### Statistical analysis\n\n【45】The NIR fluorescence images were quantitatively analyzed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) and converted into pseudo color. The experimental data was expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and the comparison between the two groups was evaluated by _Student's t test_ (GraphPad Prism 7, ∗P < 0.05 considered significant, ∗, ∗∗, ∗∗∗, and ∗∗∗∗ represents P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, and P < 0.0001, respectively) because of the two groups of data come from normally distributed populations, and the variance of the data is homogeneous, which satisfies the independence. The apparent width of the corresponding capillary was calculated using the Gaussian fitting full width Half maximum (FWHM) by the Origin software (OriginPro 2018C, OriginLab). Immunohistochemical staining was scored by three pathologists alone, H-Score = ∑(pi × i) = (percentage of weak intensity × 1) + (percentage of moderate intensity × 2) + (percentage of strong intensity × 3), where pi represents the ratio of positive signal pixel area to cell number; i stands for tint intensity.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【46】The sponsors of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analyses, data interpretation, manuscript writing, or the decision to submit the paper for publication.\n\n【47】</u>Results\n-------\n\n【48】### Characterization of 2D5-IRDye800CW\n\n【49】The imaging probe 2D5-IRDye800CW was obtained by conjugated IRDye800CW with the anti-CEACAM5 nanobody (2D5) through random site labeling 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 a)</u>. The optical density (OD) value of 774 nm and 280 nm at different concentrations was measured and standard curves were drawn 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 b)</u>. According to the formula previously reported, the ratio of fluorescence to protein was 1.25, that is, 1.25 fluorescent dyes were attached to an average nanobody. The affinity of 2D5-IRDye800CW was determined by surface plasmon resonance, Kd = 2.29 nM 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 c)</u>. The absorption spectrum and the NIR-I emission spectrum of 2D5-IRDye800CW were further determined, among which the peak value of the absorption spectrum was 776 nm and the peak value of emission was 789 nm. According to a previous report, IRDye800CW had NIR-II emission trailing, so the emission spectrum of 2D5-IRDye800CW in NIR-II was determined, and 2D5-IRDye800CW still had the NIR-II signal at 1600 nm 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 d and e)</u>. In addition, the relationship between the concentration of 2D5-IRDye800CW and the fluorescence intensity was determined. Within a certain range of concentration, the NIR-I or NIR-II fluorescence intensity of 2D5-IRDye800CW was linearly related to the concentration, y = 1610∗x+3318, R 2 \\= 0.99, y = 3330∗ x+6298, R 2 \\= 0.95, respectively 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 f and g)</u>.\n\n【50】Fig. 1 Characterization of 2D5-IRDye800CW.

Imaging of NIR-I at 850 nm revealed only vaguely shaped large vessels after intravenous administration of 2D5-IRDye800CW. While NIR-II imaging at long wavelengths (1000–1300 nm) allowed three clearer blood vessels to be observed 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 a)</u>. Quantitative analysis of fluorescence cross-section intensity distribution showed that, as the wavelength increased from 850 nm to 1300 nm, the peak of NIR-II was higher than that of NIR-I 删除2:<u>(red dotted line in Fig. 2 b)</u>. NIR-I/II fluorescence imaging of the hindlimb blood vessels in mice also showed similar results 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 c)</u>. S/N is defined as the ratio of the fluorescence signal value (counts) of blood vessels to the surrounding tissue, and the S/N of the hindlimb vascular imaging of mice was (white arrows): 1.1 at 850 nm; 1.20, 1.25, 1.15 at 1100 nm; 1.35, 1.5, 1.41 at 1300 nm, and 1.3, 1.81, 1.5 at 1400 nm 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 d)</u>. As the wavelength was extended from NIR-I at 850 nm to NIR-II at 1400 nm, the imaging resolution and signal-to-background ratio of tiny blood vessels were improved.\n\n【53】Fig. 2 2D5-IRDye800CW NIR-II imaging of blood vessels and capillary phantom.

At a depth of 5 mm within the fat, fluorescence was captured in all NIR spectra from 850 nm to 1300 nm, but the most severe scattering was observed in NIR-I imaging (850 nm), whereas NIR-II imaging (1300 nm) was almost non-scattering 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 e)</u>. It is further proved by Gaussian fitting that the same capillary has a lower full width at half maxima (FWHM) at a longer wavelength. At 850 nm, 1000 nm, 1200 nm, and 1300 nm wavelengths, FWHM is 7.41 mm, 6.58 mm, 2.40 mm, and 1.25 mm, respectively, and with the increase of emission wavelength, FWHM was closer to the 1 mm inner diameter of the capillary tube, indicating that this imaging wavelength has less photon scattering 删除2:<u>( Fig. 2 f)</u>.\n\n【55】### Expression of CEACAM5 in human colorectal cancer cell lines\n\n【56】We measured the expression of CEACAM5 in four human colorectal cancer cell lines HT29- _Luc_ , SW480, colo320, and colo201 by western blot. The results showed that HT29- _Luc_ and SW480 overexpressed CEACAM5, while colo201 and colo320 did not express CEACAM5 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 a)</u>. Quantitative analysis showed that the gray value ratio of CEACAM5 bands and internal reference tubulin bands in HT29- _Luc_ , SW480, colo320, and colo201 was 2.20, 1.51, 0.01, and 0.01, respectively 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 b)</u>. The cell membrane of SW480 was stained by PKH26 (red) and colocated with the immunofluorescence results of CEACAM5 (green). The results showed that the two stains could colocalization, and the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) value was 0.90. Colocalization of the probe uptake results (yellow) and PKH26 (red) was then performed, which showed a PCC value of 0.85.

The results showed that HT29- _Luc_ and SW480 were bound to the probe 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 d, red fluorescence)</u>, while NCM460 and colo201 were not. Statistical analysis showed that the intensity of probe fluorescence signal of HT29- _Luc_ was significantly different from that of other cells (P < 0.01, Student's t-test). Binding site blocking experiments further verified the targeting of 2D5-IRDye800CW binding to overexpressing CEACAM5 cells. HT29- _Luc_ was blocked by the unlabeled fluorescent nanobody 2D5, and no fluorescent signal was acquired after incubation with 2D5-IRDye800CW, quantitative analysis showed that the fluorescence intensity of the blocking group was significantly lower than that of the HT29- _Luc_ group 删除2:<u>( Fig. 3 d)</u>.\n\n【60】### _In vivo_ specificity and biodistribution of probes\n\n【61】CRC cell lines HT29- _Luc_ with CEACAM5 overexpression and colo201 without CEACAM5 expression were used to construct the mouse subcutaneous tumour models, respectively. 2D5-IRDye800CW (2 μg/g mouse body weight) was injected into the tail vein of tumour-bearing mice, and fluorescence images were taken with the NIR-II imaging system to evaluate the specificity and body distribution of the probe. After injection of 2D5-IRDye800CW into subcutaneous tumours constructed with HT29- _Luc_ (n = 5), the kidneys showed a strong fluorescent signal that gradually decreased with time. The fluorescent signal was detected in the tumour area after 0.5 hour, and TBR gradually increased with time.

Because of reduced scattering, minimal absorption and negligible autofluorescence, NIR-II imaging provides high resolution, a high signal-to-noise ratio, and deep tissue penetration capability. The first-in-human clinical study of NIR-II fluorescence-guided liver cancer resection has been achieved, and the results show that NIR-II imaging has greater advantages over conventional NIR-I imaging in clinical scenarios.\n\n【78】In this study, we demonstrated a colorectal cancer-specific NIR-II probe 2D5-IRDye800CW, which was synthesized by conjugating the anti-CEACAM5 nanobody 2D5 and the fluorescent dye IRDye800CW. _In vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies showed that 2D5-IRDye800CW (i) has excellent NIR-II (1000 nm–1600 nm) imaging capabilities, exhibiting higher resolution and less tissue scattering; _in vivo_ tumour imaging had a higher TBR, 2.55 ± 0.38 (NIR-II) _vs_ . 1.94 ± 0.20 (NIR-I), P < 0.001, Student's t-test; (ii) binds to CEACAM5-positive colorectal cancer tumour cells with a high affinity (2.29 nM) and high specificity, but does not accumulate in CEACAM5 (−) tumour tissue; (iii) has high penetration and can quickly reach the tumour area within 15 min after intravenous injection (S3) and allows real-time fluorescence image-guided surgery (FGS) on the day after injection (2–24 hours), tumour fluorescence is retained for more than 48 hours, allowing intraoperative, preoperative and postoperative visualization of the tumour and blood vessels throughout the surgical process; (iv) achieves accurate identification and resection of residual tumour lesions and peritoneum metastatic lesions (<2 mm); and (v) can specifically target CEACEAM5-positive human colorectal cancer specimens _in vitro_ , and the tumour fluorescence signal intensity is positively correlated with the immunohistochemical results of CEACAM5.\n\n【79】Several colorectal cancer-targeted fluorescent probes have entered clinical trials, such as bevacizumab-IRDye800CW, SGM101 and \\[111In\\] In-DOTA-labetuzumab-IRDye800CW, these targeting probes are bound by large molecular weight monoclonal antibodies which have longer half-lives, resulting in the generation of non-specific background signals, peak fluorescence accumulation at the tumour and an overall delay in the clearance of unbound probes. In order to perform surgery at the optimal imaging time point, targeted probes need to be injected at 2–4 days or even at 4–6 days before surgery; it is not conducive to complete imaging in a short period of time in specific clinical scenarios such as ordinary endoscopy. CEA is considered to be the preferred biomarker for targeting colorectal cancer _in vivo_ , so we chose anti-CEACAM5 nanobody with a small molecular weight to construct imaging probes, which have the characteristics of high stability, high affinity, rapid metabolism and high permeability. It is conducive to rapid imaging to achieve imaging results on the same day of administration. 2D5-IRDye800CW can be rapidly combined with CEACAM5 overexpressing tumour cells after 15–30 min injection into the tail vein, which the fluorescence signal (TBR = 1.7) of subcutaneous tumours is higher than that of the surrounding skin, showing the ability of high permeability and rapid imaging ability. More importantly, the tumour tissue still has a certain intensity of the fluorescent signal (TBR = 2.1) 48 hours after injection, and the 2–48 hours imaging window provides flexibility in the scheduling and execution of probe injections and surgical procedures. In addition, its ability to rapidly image and its small molecular weight enable topical delivery, which is the easiest way to administer FGS-targeted drugs.\n\n【80】Due to the probe quickly accumulated in the kidneys after being injected into mice, the fluorescence intensity of the kidneys is much higher than the tumour region in the early stage of imaging, resulting in the masking of the tumour signal adjacent to the spatial location of the kidneys. However, when the colorectal orthotopic model is used for imaging, the anatomical position of the kidneys is relatively deep, and it is difficult for the fluorescence signal of the kidneys to penetrate the intestinal tissue covering the kidneys. Therefore, the kidneys can be hidden to reduce the influence of the tumour tissue signal.\n\n【81】Although NIR-II fluorophores exhibit excellent imaging capabilities, however, existing NIR-II fluorophores, including semiconducting inorganic nanomaterials and recently introduced small-molecule organic dyes face significant technical and regulatory hurdles before clinical translation. Recent studies on the spectral characterization of NIR-I dyes such as indocyanine green (ICG), IRDye800CW, and IR-12N3 have revealed long emission tails extending beyond the 1500 nm NIR-II region, which opens up a whole new avenue for clinical NIR-II imaging. Our study demonstrates the imaging capability of the 2D5-IRDye800CW at 1000 nm–1500 nm with deeper tissue penetration and higher spatial resolution, which is beneficial for intraoperative imaging of deeper tissue and fine blood vessels. However, we should also note that the imaging time of 2D5-IRDye800CW in NIR-II sacrifices a certain imaging time, the exposure time at 1000 nm is 30 ms, and the exposure time is 2 s when imaging at 1500 nm.\n\n【82】There are still some limitations of this study when comparing the difference between white light and NIR-II-guided tumour resection; there is a lack of comparison of data such as recurrence rate in subsequent survival. In addition, all mouse orthotopic models adopt the imaging method of the open abdominal cavity, while clinical laparoscopy has been widely used in colorectal cancer surgery. This is because the equipment that is currently available for NIR-II intraoperative navigation is open abdominal visual field imaging. This study explored the application value of the NIR-II imaging modality in CRC. Fluorescence endoscopy for intraoperative navigation of NIR-II has been developed and will accelerate the clinical translation of NIR-II.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【83】Study design: Tian Jie, Zhenhua Hu, Haifeng Liu, Jianqiang Tang.\n\n【84】Literature search: Xiaoyong Guo, Xiaohua Jia, Miaomiao Li, Zeyu Zhang.\n\n【85】Data collection: Xiaoyong Guo, Changjian Li, Xiaohua Jia, Yawei Qu, Qiaojun Qu, Shuangling Luo.\n\n【86】Data analysis: all authors.\n\n【87】Data interpretation: all authors.\n删除4:<u>\nFigures: Xiaoyong Guo, Changjian Li, Xiaohua Jia, Yawei Qu, Caiguang Cao.</u>\n\n【88】Writing: Xiaoyong Guo, Changjian Li, Xiaohua Jia, Yawei Qu.\n\n【89】Revise: Xiaoyong Guo, Xiaohua Jia, Changjian Li, Jianqiang Tang.\n\n【90】Access and verification of the data: all authors.\n\n【91】Responsibilities for the decision to submit the manuscript: all authors.\n\n【92】All authors reviewed, discussed, and agreed with manuscript.\n\n【93】Data sharing statement\n----------------------\n\n【94】The main data supporting the results of this study are available within the paper and its Supplementary materials.

Patients with atrial fibrillation have a five times higher stroke risk than those without this common arrhythmia. Thromboembolism from the functionally asystolic left atrium is thought to cause the stroke. Oral anticoagulation with vitamin-K antagonists, mainly warfarin, reduces the stroke risk to a third of that observed without antithrombotic therapy. However, anticoagulants are patient-unfriendly, difficult to monitor, and are associated with a risk of severe bleeding of at least 1% a year. Alternative anticoagulant therapy with the oral direct-thrombin-inhibitor ximelagatran has proven to be equally effective, but showed unacceptable liver toxicity that prohibited US Food and Drug Administration approval. The only other antithrombotic strategy available in atrial fibrillation is aspirin, which showed efficacy against thromboembolism versus placebo, but proved to be inferior to warfarin. In atrial fibrillation, although aspirin is inexpensive, patient-friendly, and relatively safe, aspirin is indicated only in warfarin-ineligible patients. Possibly a more intense antiplatelet therapy—eg, aspirin plus clopidogrel—which is a successful treatment for acute coronary syndromes with and without coronary stenting, could come close to warfarin in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, but probably with a lower bleeding risk.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

These are less than the official national data of 265, 183, and 103, respectively. The total number of maternal deaths registered by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System has registered a reduction, from 655 in 2000 to 509 in 2008, although we know that there is a substantial amount of under-reporting of maternal deaths, estimated to be 46% in 2002 in the last official study published by the National Statistics Institute. This number of deaths would correlate to an MMR of 84, without any rate of under-reporting, and so the likely MMR in Peru is clearly higher than those estimated by the study, and closer to the range reported in this month's report by the National Statistics Institute (103, range 50–157).\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2010 Corbis</u>\n\n【1】Methodological complexities for estimating global MMRs challenge the data produced for each country. Although analysts may draw on the same _sources_ of data across countries, the _methods_ with which these data are collected varies widely within countries. High uncertainty intervals for MMR—in both global and national estimates—reflect the need to strengthen the capacities of national and local information systems to obtain robust data.\n\n【2】The reduction in the MMR in Peru could be associated with improvements in the four drivers of maternal mortality, especially coverage of skilled birth attendance, which increased remarkably from 56% in 1996 to 83% in 2009. However, deep inequities exist within our country. According to the most recent available data, whereas national figures showed an MMR of 183 per 100 000 livebirths in 2000, the poorest regions of Puno, Huancavelica, and Cusco registered MMRs of 361, 302, and 288, respectively.\n\n【3】In Peru, where there exist serious regional and local disparities in access to responsive 删除2:<u>(accessible, acceptable, appropriate, and of good quality)</u> health services, weak community-based maternal health care, and lack of women's participation in the formation and implementation of policy decisions, maternal mortality estimates provide a telling indicator not only of the social exclusion faced by rural—and especially indigenous—women, but also of the structural deficiencies and inequities that should be addressed within the health system. That requires not just technical interventions, but greater political priority and the involvement of all actors in efforts to tackle inequities.\n\n【4】I agree with the International Initiative on Maternal Mortality and Human Rights when it stresses that “while health care interventions are crucial, maternal death will be averted only if governments act to guarantee women's rights more broadly…Robust health systems that address the needs and rights of all women are at the core of reducing maternal death.” Our efforts should address both the “deliver” aspect and the “women” aspect in an integral, rights-based manner.\n\n【5】删除9:<u>I declare that I have no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Indeed, migrants are the public, and the public are migrants. Having reaffirmed the obvious interchangeability between migrant health and public health, it is important to further explore what is required of the public health sector to challenge the largely unnecessary distinction between migrant and public in public health policy and praxis.\n\n【1】The perpetuation of a distinction between public health and migrant health has served to exemplify the health needs of migrants with mixed consequences. On occasion, academics and practitioners have used the opportunity to draw attention to inequities in access to health care and health outcomes for migrants, and politically mediated intergenerational disparities that persist within communities with a relatively recent history of immigration. Such intellectual and interventional engagement with issues of migration, ethnicity, race, and health speaks to the “quest for equity and social justice” that the editors of _The Lancet Public Health_ wish to see define the discipline.\n\n【2】However, other studies have served misguided narratives that see migration as generative of health insecurity, and specifically as a threat to communicable disease control. Notably, the dependence of some public health institutions on funding from the very right-wing states that promote a narrative that intentionally others and demonises migrants, has drawn such institutions into the generation of so-called evidence for a predetermined policy purpose.\n\n【3】All stages in the generation of evidence and the production of knowledge are political. Who funds what research? Who designs the questions and shapes the methodology? Who interprets the data and determines whether findings will be disseminated publicly? To call for an evidence-driven agenda for migrant health, as was articulated at the May, 2018 World Congress on Migration, Ethnicity, Race and Health, runs the risk not only of oversimplifying the policy process by overlooking the many ways in which evidence-informed decision making for health is inherently political, but also sees a technical, data-guided response as central to improved social policy outcomes.\n\n【4】What if evidence suggested that migrants do not make a net positive economic contribution in the UK? How then would public health advocates seek to challenge racist, anti-migrant sentiment? If the public and policy makers were made aware that 13% rather than 32% of the UK population were immigrants (data that inadvertently still problematises the presence of migrants ), would the UK Government suddenly opt for more inclusive, pro-migrant health and social policies?\n\n【5】What is needed is not more evidence; frontline organisations, who have for decades witnessed and documented the negative health effects of oppressive, anti-migrant regimes, are aware of this point and are increasingly political in their public positioning. Instead, courageous public health advocates, unafraid to be political and to defend those political claims, not on the basis of evidence but on the basis of a moral commitment to solidarity and compassion, are needed.\n\n【6】删除9:<u>I declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Standard imaging work-up and meticulous pathological evaluation are the initial steps in the diagnostic algorithm of a presumed cancer of unknown primary. In recent decades, post-mortem discovery of occult primaries in a high proportion of patients has provided evidence that cancer of unknown primary represents a heterogeneous group of malignancies that share the characteristic of having a primary site that is undetectable with current methods. In this regard, several molecular profiling methods, including DNA microarrays, quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, and microRNAs, have been used to identify the tissue of origin in metastatic samples, with the view to customise therapy to the putative primary—a strategy that might be more effective than empirical chemotherapy in at least several cancer of unknown primary subgroups. Most importantly, genomic characterisation of the tissue of origin, dictated by advances in technology in the current era of personalised medicine, enables the identification of driver mutations that can be used as targets for therapy independent of the site of origin.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet Oncology_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

Birth-asphyxia-related mortality can be reduced with application of basic resuscitation steps that are outlined in the Helping Babies Breathe (HBB) programme. This intervention was used in Georgina Msemo and colleagues' Tanzanian study, which showed early deaths of infants of birthweight 1001–1999 g were significantly reduced from 172 neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths before use of HBB to 69·5 neonatal deaths per 1000 livebirths after implementing the intervention programme (relative risk 0·40, 95% CI 0·28–0·56, p<0·0001).\n\n【2】Clearly, if antenatal corticosteroid treatment is used in isolation to reduce mortality, without addressing the other major contributing factors to mortality, it is highly unlikely to be successful. We suggest that the use of antenatal corticosteroid treatment, targeted at women of estimated 26–34 weeks' gestational age, be coupled with immediate implementation of HBB, maintenance of a normal infant temperature from birth, giving antibiotics to the mother and the premature baby from birth (even if asymptomatic), using Kangaroo Mother Care if possible, and applying essential newborn care.

They highlight that, when comparing outcomes of laparoscopy with those of open surgery, case selection might jeopardise the generalisability of the results.\n\n【1】We acknowledged the potential effect of laparoscopic case selection on the results. Although we agree that case selection might have affected the size of the beneficial effect produced by laparoscopy, the overall conclusion is robust. Several steps were taken to reduce the impact of potential biases that favour laparoscopy. Laparoscopies that were converted to open surgery were analysed as laparoscopic (by intention to treat). We also used multivariable Cox regression analysis to correct for several factors that affect adhesion-related outcomes (eg, type of procedure, malignancy, sex, and age). We are currently doing additional subgroup analyses in a more homogeneous group (ie, colorectal procedures). In multivariate analyses, laparoscopy was a significant independent protective factor for both readmissions directly related to adhesions (hazard ratio 0·68, 95% CI 0·60–0·77) and readmissions possibly related to adhesions (0·89, 0·85–0·94). Nevertheless, not all potential factors that might have affected laparoscopic case selection could be accounted for (eg, serum concentrations of C-reactive protein in cholecystitis, body-mass index, and preoperative radiotherapy). Therefore, we should be cautious about attributing the full size of the effect to laparoscopy alone.\n\n【2】The beneficial effects of laparoscopy are in accordance with studies that have shown a lower incidence and extent of adhesions after laparoscopic surgery compared with open surgery. Notwithstanding, the impact of adhesion-related morbidity remains substantial even in laparoscopic surgery. Søreide and colleagues also justly remark that there are important safety concerns with the implementation of laparoscopy in some specific procedures, currently limiting further increases in the use of laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【3】To further reduce the negative effect of adhesion-related complications on millions of surgical patients worldwide, measures additional to more widespread use of laparoscopy are warranted. These measures could include the use of adhesion barriers and other existing approaches, and novel strategies are being developed to reduce adhesion formation. Evaluating the efficacy of novel adhesion-reducing strategies has historically been cumbersome. Morphological scoring of adhesions during a second-look procedure has not been validated to correlate with morbidity. The evaluation of outcomes, such as readmission related to adhesions as in the SCAR studies, requires very large numbers of patients and long-term follow-up. The newly developed Clinical Adhesion Score can be a useful tool for trials to comprehensively assess the effect of adhesion-reducing strategies on patient outcomes.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

First, given that the incidence of natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is much higher in Europe than in North America, practitioners on either side of the Atlantic might find regionally stratified Kaplan-Meier curves better suited to informed decision making than the published pooled data.\n\n【1】Second, with regard to the additional stratification of patients without previous exposure to an immunosuppressant, four John Cunningham virus (JCV) index categories, with boundary thresholds of 0·6, 1·0, and 1·7, might be more appropriate than the three-category grouping, with thresholds of 0·9 and 1·5, chosen by Ho and colleagues. The reason being that, in the study in question, none of the 68 patients who developed PML had a JCV index of 0·6 or less, compared with 20% of controls. Moreover, patients with a JCV index in the range of 0·9–1·0 carried a risk of PML closer to that of patients in the range of 0·6–0·9 than to those in the range of 1·0–1·5. Patients with an index in the range of 1·5–1·7 had a risk similar to that of those with an index in the range of 1·0–1·5.\n\n【2】Third, for clinicians who view biennial evaluations of natalizumab therapy as sufficient, Kaplan-Meier estimates of the risk of PML during infusions 1–26, 27–52, 53–78, and 79–104 (assuming 13 infusions per year, rather than 12 as reported by Ho and colleagues ) would be helpful, recognising that analyses in the latter range might need to be restricted to patients without previous immunosuppressant exposure because of limited availability of data.\n\n【3】Fourth, some clarification of the risk among JCV seronegative natalizumab users is warranted. In Ho and colleagues' study, the figure of 0·07 per 1000 was obtained by dividing the number of false-negative PML cases (one) by the number of seronegative patients in the cohort (13 996), without stating the treatment interval or accounting for incomplete follow-up.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>I declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The world faces a combustible political predicament. In the UK, university research collaborations with Chinese institutions are being targeted by politicians and media in an unattractive wave of Sinophobia. Japan has approved its largest military expansion since 1945. Meanwhile, China's political stability is far from assured. The country's demographic crisis has started—population has peaked and is now projected to halve by 2100, posing unsustainable challenges for a brittle economy. Taking all of these forces together, the temptation for Western leaders may be to turn away from China. Even to isolate a country it senses it cannot trust. This deepening diplomatic _froideur_ is influencing cooperative programmes in health. Incentives are withering. Criticism is intensifying.

If we are to manage the common dangers we face, “we must all think differently” about how countries work together—“in a future shaped by climate change, pandemics, and technology, all countries ultimately need China to succeed—and vice versa”. Moore calls for a “reframing” of China's relationship with the world. For the reality is that “China is essential to avoiding…planetary catastrophes”. Competition—economic, geopolitical, and ideological—will continue, but must not crowd out cooperation. The great test for the international community will be to judge when to compete and when to cooperate: “Preventing the next pandemic means confronting and correcting old prejudices while better integrating China into the global health landscape.” Political disagreement need not preclude scientific cooperation. Last week, WHO's zero draft of a pandemic prevention treaty was published. The motivation for this legal instrument was “the catastrophic failure of the international community in showing solidarity and equity” during the pandemic. The zero draft raises hard questions and includes many contestable proposals. How should intellectual property rights be managed in a global emergency? How should a pathogen access and benefit-sharing system operate? How can universal health coverage be accelerated as a route to resilient health systems? How should countries be held accountable for their pandemic preparedness responsibilities? How can the treaty be enforced? What is the role of WHO? The idea of a climate-like COP is offered as a governance mechanism. Delivering a global agreement on pandemic preparedness and response would be challenging even in the best of circumstances. And today's fractured and hostile world certainly does not present the best of circumstances. Now is not the time to diplomatically disengage from nations with whom we have political disagreements. As Moore notes, “China plays an especially important role in global public health and pandemic prevention”. Despite China's mysterious balloons, it is time for the global health community and their institutions to lean in.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2023 Lauren DeCicca/Getty Images</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【3】### Publication history\n\n【4】Published: 11 February 2023\n\n【5】### Identification\n\n【6】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00291-X</u>\n\n【7】### Copyright\n\n【8】© 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\n【9】### ScienceDirect\n\n【10】Access this article on ScienceDirect\n\n【11】Offline: Why we must make peace with China\n\n【12】*   \n*   \n*   \n\n【13】Hide Caption Download See figure in article\n\n【14】Toggle Thumbstrip\n删除4:<u>\n*   Figure</u>\n    删除4:<u>\n*   Figure</u>\n    删除4:<u>\n*   Figure</u>\n\n【15】删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download .PPT</u>\n删除4:<u>\nFigures</u>\n-------\n删除4:<u>\n*   Copyright © 2023 Peter Zay/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</u>\n    删除4:<u>\n*   Copyright © 2023 Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images</u>\n    删除4:<u>\n*   Copyright © 2023 Lauren DeCicca/Getty Images</u>\n\n【16】Hide Caption Download See figure in Article\n\n【17】Toggle Thumbstrip\n删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download .PPT</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In many high-income countries, the burden of community-acquired pneumonia is well researched, with many countries having robust surveillance systems in place. However, respiratory disease surveillance remains limited in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Additionally, a majority of published literature on pneumococcal and other respiratory diseases tends to focus on the childhood burden of disease, especially in Asia. We conducted a PubMed search between 2-6 August 2021 and again on 7 July 2022 for studies describing adult community-acquired pneumonia in Asian or other LMICs with the following search terms ((pneumonia) AND (adult OR >65 OR ≥18 OR elderly) AND (Mongolia OR Asia OR LMIC) AND (burden OR determinant OR surveillance)). Studies that focused on disease characteristics related to the SARS-Cov-2 virus and the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded, as our study period occurred prior to the pandemic. A majority of studies were disease-specific with pneumonia being one potential outcome. Six studies in Asia examined the influenza epidemiology or burden of disease, including one study in Mongolia. Two studies focused on atypical pathogens associated with pneumonia. An additional six studies focused on antimicrobial resistance or on serotype replacement post-introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in children. Only three studies from other Asian LMICs focused on the burden of hospitalized pneumonia in adults. No studies systematically studied the burden or determinants of adult pneumonia in Mongolia.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】To our knowledge, this is the first systematic surveillance program examining pneumonia in adults in Mongolia. Notably, we found the incidence for clinical and severe clinical pneumonia hospitalizations to be at least three times higher in adults >65 years than in other age groups. Adults with underlying medical conditions were more likely to have severe clinical pneumonia compared to patients without underlying conditions. Our findings also further describe the indicators of pneumonia severity in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】This study presents important epidemiological information about a previously unknown pneumonia burden in an adult population in Asia. As the proportion of the elderly population in Mongolia is expected to rapidly grow in the coming years, it is likely that pressures on the country's healthcare system will also increase. Our findings suggest that older adults and those with underlying medical conditions are most at risk for developing pneumonia, and with higher disease severity, than other groups. By establishing the adult burden and determinants of pneumonia, targeted interventions can be developed to have a more meaningful impact on the burden of disease.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Community-acquired pneumonia is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In adult populations, pneumonia disproportionally affects individuals >65 years and those with underlying medical conditions, who often endure high rates of hospitalizations and mortality. Smoking status, alcohol intake, comorbidities, and air pollution exposure are important risk factors that contribute to the pneumonia burden. Immunosenescence may also render older adults more susceptible to colonization and infection by pneumonia-causing organisms.\n\n【21】Many respiratory pathogens are known to cause community-acquired pneumonia including _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ , influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. In adults, _S. pneumoniae_ is the leading cause of community-acquired pneumonia, with one meta-analysis attributing 27% of pneumonia cases to the pneumococcus. \n\n【22】While the burden of community-acquired pneumonia is well understood in many high-income countries, respiratory disease surveillance remains limited in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Furthermore, published data on pneumococcal and other respiratory diseases tend to focus on the childhood burden. In the Asia-Pacific region, a gap in understanding the adult burden of community-acquired pneumonia persists, with a recent review finding that the majority of available data were primarily from higher-income countries and those with well-established vaccination programs.\n\n【23】Mongolia is a lower-middle income country in central Asia, with an estimated population of 3·3 million people. In 2018, the average life expectancy in Mongolia was 71·7 years, with almost two-thirds of its population aged between 15–64 years and 4·1% of the population >65 years. Respiratory diseases are a leading cause of morbidity in Mongolia, with pneumonia comprising 51·8% of respiratory admissions across all ages in 2018. High levels of air pollution, high prevalence of cigarette smoking, and cold winter temperatures contribute to Mongolia's pneumonia burden. Currently, there are no recommendations for adult pneumococcal vaccination in Mongolia and a limited number of influenza vaccines are available to high-risk individuals.\n\n【24】To address the high burden of pediatric pneumonia, the Mongolian government introduced the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) into the childhood vaccination schedule from June 2016. An expanded pneumonia surveillance program was established in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar (∼1·5 million population) to better understand the burden of all-cause pneumonia in children 2–59 months old, finding high rates of pneumonia. A subsequent adult surveillance program was established in 2019, as part of a larger study aiming to determine the indirect effect of childhood PCV13 on community-acquired pneumonia in adults. To quantify the burden of adult community-acquired pneumonia in Ulaanbaatar, hospital-based surveillance was initiated in four districts of the city. Our study aims to establish the burden and clinical characteristics of community-acquired pneumonia in adults 18 years or older in Mongolia.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Study design\n\n【27】Data were collected as part of an ongoing hospital-based community-acquired pneumonia surveillance program for adults ≥18 years in four districts of Ulaanbaatar: Songinokhairkhan, Sukhbaatar, Bayanzurkh, and Chingeltei. These are the largest districts in Ulaanbaatar, accounting for approximately 70% of the city's population, with a mixture of formal and traditional (colloquially known as ger) housing.\n\n【28】Surveillance data were collected both retrospectively (January 2015–February 2019) and prospectively (March 2019–March 2022). For the purposes of this analysis, only retrospective data were included.\n\n【29】### Data collection\n\n【30】We constructed a retrospective cohort by conducting medical chart reviews for adult community-acquired pneumonia admissions. Trained staff reviewed hospital admission logs to identify all respiratory admissions. All medical records for respiratory admissions were reviewed to confirm whether the patient had community-acquired pneumonia. Details on eligibility and reasons for exclusion were captured on a screening log. All intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and deaths were also reviewed to ensure that severe disease cases were counted.\n\n【31】Clinical pneumonia was defined as a patient who was diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia at both admission and at time of discharge, and with two or more of the following symptoms (at least one of which must be respiratory): \n\n【32】*   •\n\n【33】    reported fever or measured fever (≥38·0°C)\n\n【34】*   •\n\n【35】    new cough or change in chronic cough\n\n【36】*   •\n\n【37】    new or increased sputum production\n\n【38】*   •\n\n【39】    leucocytosis (>11·0 × 10 9 white blood cells/l) or leukopenia (<4·0 × 10 9 white blood cells/l)\n\n【40】*   •\n\n【41】    dyspnoea or tachypnoea (i.e. difficult breathing or respiratory rate >25 breaths/minute)\n\n【42】*   •\n\n【43】    lung findings on auscultation\n\n【44】*   •\n\n【45】    hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation <90%)\n\n【46】*   •\n\n【47】    pleuritic chest pain\n\n【48】Severe clinical pneumonia was defined as clinical pneumonia with 1) an ICU admission, 2) death during hospital stay, or 3) clinical pneumonia with two or more of the following symptoms: \n\n【49】*   •\n\n【50】    impaired conscious state (Glasgow coma scale <15)\n\n【51】*   •\n\n【52】    respiratory rate of ≥30 breaths per minute\n\n【53】*   •\n\n【54】    hypotension (systolic blood pressure ≤90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≤60 mmHg)\n\n【55】*   •\n\n【56】    hypoxaemia\n\n【57】Patients that met the case definition criteria were included in the study. Staff extracted relevant clinical data from patient medical charts, including clinical presentation at admission and case management, age, underlying medical conditions, and clinical outcomes. Documented underlying medical conditions included asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema, tuberculosis, cirrhosis/liver failure, coronary artery disease, hypertension, heart failure, chronic renal failure, and diabetes. Study case report forms reported a patient as having sequelae if the patient still had any pneumonia-related symptoms or any subsequent complications related to their hospitalization at the time of discharge, based on the clinical judgement of treating physicians. If a patient meeting the study inclusion criteria was readmitted to the hospital for community-acquired pneumonia within 14 days of their previous admission, the subsequent record was considered to be part of the same pneumonia episode and excluded from analysis.\n\n【58】### Statistical analysis\n\n【59】Data were analyzed using Stata version 16·0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX). Case characteristics were classified by disease severity and age, and were summarized by either percentages or medians with interquartile ranges (IQR). For variables with missing data, summary statistics were calculated among those with available data. For all variables other than documented underlying medical conditions and reported antibiotic use, <5% of data were missing from analysis. Data were >85% complete for reported antibiotic use and between 46%–59% complete for individual comorbidities. To explore factors associated with severe pneumonia among admitted patients, we first ran univariable logistic regressions, where each model treated severe pneumonia as the outcome variable and each candidate factor as an independent variable. Because the association between community-acquired pneumonia and older age has been previously reported, we adjusted for age groups (18–25, 26–45, 46–65, >65 years) in additional models to account for potential confounding.\n\n【60】We calculated cumulative incidence rates with Poisson confidence intervals, stratified by age group, for all clinical pneumonia admissions using population denominators for the four districts provided by the Mongolian Health Department census for each year from 2015 to 2018 inclusive. Incidence rates for 2019 were not calculated because the retrospective surveillance concluded in February 2019. To examine the potential impacts of incomplete data on the disease burden, a post-hoc sensitivity analysis was completed. This analysis explored the upper limit of what the incidence would be if all patients with a community-acquired pneumonia diagnosis at admission, but inadequate medical records for study inclusion, had met our case definition for clinical pneumonia.\n\n【61】### Ethical review\n\n【62】The protocol was approved by the Human Research Ethics committees of the Mongolian National Ethics Committee for Health Research and the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne (HREC 38045).\n\n【63】Results\n-------\n\n【64】In total, 12,684 respiratory admissions were screened at four district hospitals 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Of these, 8058 admissions did not meet the inclusion criteria, including 800 admissions (9·9%) where a community-acquired pneumonia diagnosis had been recorded at admission, but medical records were inadequate to determine if patients met inclusion criteria. A further 336 admissions were excluded from analysis because they had not met the case definition. Of 4290 admissions that met the case definition for clinical pneumonia, 430 (10·0%) admissions were classified as severe clinical pneumonia. There were 3,832 (94·7%) patients included once in the study, 191 (4·7%) twice, 24 (0·6%) three times, and one (0·02%) included four times. Of 3459 patients with influenza immunization histories reported on their medical charts, 11 (0·3%) had received influenza vaccinations within the past 12 months. Of 4121 patients with pneumococcal immunization histories reported, three (0·07%) reported receiving either the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine or PCV13 within 30 days of admission, but this could not be verified. Clinical pneumonia hospitalizations showed a seasonal pattern, with the highest number of cases presenting over Mongolia's winter months (November–March) and lowest number of cases presenting during the summer months (June–August) 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. Most adults >65 years (84·2%) had a documented underlying medical condition; underlying medical conditions were reported less frequently in younger age groups: 18-25 years (6·7%), 26–45 years (20·1%), and 46–65 years (61·5%).\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Inclusion of study participants with respiratory-related admissions at four sentinel hospitals in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, January 2015– February 2019.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 Total respiratory and clinical pneumonia hospital admissions in adults ≥18 years old, reported through retrospective chart review, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, January 2015–February 2019.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【65】### Factors associated with disease severity\n\n【66】While adults 26-45 years made up the highest percentage (34·3%) of all clinical pneumonia admissions, adults >65 years made up most cases of severe pneumonia (37·4%) 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Females accounted for more than half of all clinical pneumonia admissions (58·4%); however, just over half of severe pneumonia cases were men (52·6%). Approximately one-third (34·3%) of all clinical pneumonia cases and a quarter (23·6%) of severe pneumonia cases had taken an antibiotic within 48 hours of hospital presentation. Almost two-thirds (64·4%) of severe pneumonia admissions had ≥1 underlying medical condition.\n\n【67】Table 1 Characteristics of adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia included in retrospective medical chart review, by pneumonia severity, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, January 2015– February 2019.\n\n|  | All pneumonia admissions _N_ \\= 4290 | Clinical (non-severe) pneumonia _N_ \\= 3860 | Severe clinical pneumonia _N_ \\= 430 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (years), median (interquartile range \\[IQR\\]) | 49 (32–63) | 47 (32–62) | 58 (44–74) |\n| Age groups (years), n (%) |  |  |  |\n| 18–25 | 465 (10.8) | 451 (11.7) | 14 (3.3) |\n| 26–45 | 1471 (34.3) | 1370 (35.5) | 99 (23.0) |\n| 46–65 | 1423 (33.2) | 1267 (32.8) | 156 (36.3) |\n| \\>65 | 931 (21.7) | 770 (20.0) | 161 (37.4) |\n| Sex, n (%) |  |  |  |\n| Female | 2506 (58.4) | 2302 (59.6) | 204 (47.4) |\n| Male | 1784 (41.6) | 1558 (40.4) | 226 (52.6) |\n| Hospital surveillance district, n (%) |  |  |  |\n| Bayanzurkh | 1250 (29.1) | 1096 (28.4) | 154 (35.8) |\n| Songinokhairkhan | 1537 (35.8) | 1440 (37.3) | 97 (22.6) |\n| Sukhbaatar | 1044 (24.3) | 948 (24.6) | 96 (22.3) |\n| Chingeltei | 459 (10.7) | 376 (9.7) | 83 (19.3) |\n| Reported antibiotic use within 48hrs of hospital presentation, n (%) | 1263/3682 (34.3) | 1184/3347 (35.4) | 79/335 (23.6) |\n| Underlying medical conditions, n (%) |  |  |  |\n| ≥1 underlying medical condition | 1985 (46.3) | 1708 (44.3) | 277 (64.4) |\n| Asthma | 120/2105 (5.7) | 109/1863 (5.9) | 11/242 (4.6) |\n| COPD /emphysema | 143/1989 (7.2) | 101/1759 (5.7) | 42/230 (18.3) |\n| Tuberculosis | 139/2501 (5.6) | 113/2209 (5.1) | 26/292 (8.9) |\n| Cirrhosis/liver failure | 121/2434 (5.0) | 99/2176 (4.6) | 22/258 (8.5) |\n| Coronary artery disease | 548/2006 (27.3) | 442/1768 (25.0) | 106/238 (44.5) |\n| Hypertension | 1334/2342 (57.0) | 1185/2085 (56.8) | 149/257 (58.0) |\n| Heart failure | 182/2445 (7.4) | 134/2166 (6.2) | 48/279 (17.2) |\n| Chronic renal failure | 181/2518 (7.2) | 140/2230 (6.3) | 41/288 (14.2) |\n| Diabetes | 316/2341 (13.5) | 253/2073 (12.2) | 63/268 (23.5) |\n\n【69】a Based on documentation in medical chart.\n\n【70】b Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【71】On univariable analysis, age, sex, and underlying medical conditions were associated with disease severity 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u>.

In a sensitivity analysis that included all pneumonia admissions whose medical records were inadequate for study inclusion from 2015–2018 ( _n=_ 751), we found that the incidence of pneumonia may be up to ∼20% higher than our more conservative estimates 删除2:<u>(S1 Table)</u>.\n\n【96】Discussion\n----------\n\n【97】This study describes the burden and epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults ≥18 years in four districts of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia over a four-year period. While adults 26-45 years made up the highest percentage of pneumonia admissions, severe pneumonia was most common among adults >65 years. Male gender and underlying medical conditions were also associated with severe pneumonia.\n\n【98】In 2018, the incidence of adults hospitalized with clinical pneumonia was 17·65 per 10,000 population, lower than that of several high-income countries, including the USA (24·8 per 10,000 population), Germany (97 per 10,000 person-years), and Japan (169 per 10,000 person-years). Conversely, the incidence of pneumonia in Mongolia was higher than that of other LMICs in Asia, including Vietnam (8·1 per 10,000 person-years) and Malaysia (15·9 per 10,000 population). Several factors may contribute to this difference. First, community-acquired pneumonia surveillance data are limited in many LMICs, and discordance between study case definitions and data sources can make it difficult to compare incidence rates. Second, Mongolia's age distribution differs from that of high-income countries. In Mongolia, <5% of the population is ≥65 years old. Comparatively, between 17-28% of the populations in the USA, Germany, and Japan are ≥65 years. In Malaysia and Vietnam, the proportions of those ≥65 years are higher than in Mongolia (∼7–8%), but still lower than most high-income countries. After age-standardizing the incidence of community-acquired pneumonia in Japan, incidence rates decreased by one-third in individuals aged 15 years or older. Therefore, it is plausible that Mongolia's comparatively low incidence of pneumonia can be partially attributable to varying age distributions between LMICs and higher-income countries. Third, our study targeted adults admitted to district hospitals and did not include adults who sought care at primary health care centers, were admitted to tertiary hospitals, or who never sought treatment. It is unlikely that a large proportion of pneumonia cases were missed from tertiary hospitals, as they are considered specialty facilities that typically require a referral from a secondary hospital. However, out-of-pocket expenses, self-medication, and dissatisfaction with healthcare services remain important barriers in deterring adults from seeking care. Our study found that patients who received antibiotics within 48 hours prior to hospital admission had lower odds of severe pneumonia, indicating that healthcare utilization practices and delay in seeking care may contribute to adverse health outcomes. While nearly all Mongolians have social health insurance and reform efforts have been made to provide equitable access healthcare, financial barriers persist. Despite typically having greater health needs, lower income individuals are more likely to use primary or public secondary care services, whereas higher income individuals are more likely to use secondary or tertiary services regardless of health needs and underestimating the true burden of community-acquired pneumonia. \n\n【99】We found seasonal variations in clinical pneumonia hospitalizations, with the highest incidence rates occurring during the winter months. These results were expected, as pneumonia is considered highly seasonal in Mongolia, where winter temperatures can reach as low as −40°C. During the winter months, Ulaanbaatar's air pollution levels reach well beyond World Health Organization and national guidelines, potentially compounding the pneumonia burden in the population. In an effort to improve air quality in Ulaanbaatar, the Mongolian government banned the consumption of raw coal in 2019. While early reports indicate a notable reduction in particulate matter concentrations, more research is needed to quantify the impacts on the burden of community-acquired pneumonia and other diseases.\n\n【100】The annual incidence for clinical pneumonia and severe pneumonia hospitalizations in adults >65 years was at least three times higher than other age groups, indicating the importance of age as a risk factor for pneumonia morbidity. Several biologically plausible factors may explain these findings. First, the natural ageing process leads to immunosenescence, making it more difficult to fight off infection over time. Second, comorbidities are important risk factors for developing community-acquired pneumonia, with older adults typically having more comorbidities than younger adults. Several underlying medical conditions, including COPD, tuberculosis, cirrhosis or liver failure, coronary artery disease, heart failure, chronic renal failure, and diabetes were independently associated with severe pneumonia in our study. While hypertension was the most common documented underlying medical condition in this study, it is not generally considered a risk factor for pneumonia and was not a risk factor for severe pneumonia. \n\n【101】As LMICs progress and become increasingly urbanized, they develop dual burdens of disease, where non-communicable diseases (NCDs) rapidly increase while the infectious disease burden remains high. Over the last 30 years, Mongolia has undergone such demographic and epidemiological transitions. Strengthened health systems and improved environmental conditions have led to increases in average life expectancy and decreases in some communicable disease burdens. Meanwhile, the burden of chronic NCDs has notably increased. As a result, individuals with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for infectious diseases, including community-acquired pneumonia.\n\n【102】Our study found that males were more likely to develop severe pneumonia. Gender differences in occupation, tobacco and alcohol use, and other environmental exposures likely contribute to the severity of community-acquired pneumonia in men. Men generally participate in more outdoor manual labor than women, increasing their exposure to occupational air pollutants and ambient air pollution. Exposure to silica and other industrial dusts increases the rates of pneumoconiosis, occupational respiratory diseases, and lung cancer in coal mine, power plant, construction, and manufacturing workers. Furthermore, almost half of the male population smokes tobacco and ∼50% drink alcohol, compared with <10% and 30% of the female population, respectively. Men are also less likely to use outpatient services and may delay seeking care for communicable diseases or other health conditions considered less urgent. Consequently, Mongolia has one of the largest life expectancy gaps between males and females globally, with women expected to outlive men by almost a decade. Risk factor data collected as part of the prospective surveillance study will provide additional insights into the burden of disease in men.\n\n【103】The case-fatality ratio in our study was low compared with other LMICs. Because this study was conducted through a retrospective chart review, we were only able to capture deaths reported during hospital stay and did not follow up with patients after hospital transfer or discharge, likely underestimating the true proportion of pneumonia-related deaths in Ulaanbaatar. Additionally, over half of all patients were discharged with sequelae, possibly resulting in a small number of undocumented deaths. Furthermore, higher income individuals typically overutilize inpatient services, whereas lower income individuals underutilize inpatient services due to financial constraints. As a result, different thresholds for hospitalization among different income groups could contribute to an underestimate of the case-fatality rate.\n\n【104】In many LMICs, including Mongolia, chest radiographs, blood cultures, and other diagnostic tests are usually not a part of routine care for adult pneumonia case management due to economic and logistical constraints. As a result, we relied on clinical assessment and did not require diagnostic test results for study inclusion. While this may be seen as a limitation, we do not believe this alters the validity or interpretation of our results for several reasons. First, our case definition was derived from the clinical assessment inclusion criteria in the Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study, which found high congruence (93%) between a treating clinician's clinical assessment and radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Second, a systematic review found that while individual clinical signs or symptoms have a limited ability to be the sole predictor of community-acquired pneumonia, clinical decision tools that include multiple clinical features and biomarkers may be useful in diagnosing pneumonia. Third, while chest radiographs can be important tools in confirming a pneumonia diagnosis, they are considered to be less reliable for elderly patients and for those with dehydration. Additionally, at least two systematic reviews have found chest radiographs to be imperfect diagnostic tools that are not 100% sensitive when diagnosing pneumonia. Fourth, while blood cultures can be useful in determining pneumonia etiology, identifying a causal pathogen continues to be a challenge globally due to low rates of pathogen detection. Fifth, we were unable to test for urea nitrogen in the blood, which limited our ability to scale pneumonia severity using traditional criteria, including the pneumonia severity index and CURB-65. However, studies from LMICs have found mixed evidence to support the validity of these tools in estimating inpatient mortality in resource-limited settings.\n\n【105】There are several limitations to our study in addition to those already discussed. First, because our data were collected through retrospective chart review, some data were missing from patient records and not all relevant risk factors could be assessed. While our sensitivity analysis estimated the upper limit of what the incidence may be if all community-acquired pneumonia admissions with inadequate medical records had met our case definition, the results demonstrated how missing data could bias the analyses. Results from the prospective surveillance data will provide additional insights into better understanding the determinants and etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in Mongolia. Second, incidence rates calculated for hospitalized patients may underestimate the total community-acquired pneumonia incidence in Ulaanbaatar. In cases of mild or moderate community-acquired pneumonia, adults might choose to seek care at their local family health clinic or as an outpatient at the hospital, or choose to not seek any care for their symptoms. Third, we were unable to track mortality after patients were discharged, as comprehensive vital registration data are currently limited in Mongolia. Future studies should consider including follow up periods post-discharge to community-acquired pneumonia surveillance programs to better understand the mortality rates in adults. Fourth, we noted increases in the annual pneumonia incidence over a short timeframe which was surprising. Though we cannot determine the reason for this increase, it is possible that improvements in healthcare utilization or in the healthcare system may have contributed to this trend. Finally, the results of this study are not generalizable to all adults in Mongolia, as it was conducted in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar and did not cover mining districts. Ulaanbaatar is the most densely populated city in Mongolia. Subsequently, the city's rates of respiratory diseases may not be translatable to all other provinces (aimags) in Mongolia. \n\n【106】To our knowledge, this is the first systematic surveillance program examining community-acquired pneumonia in adults in Mongolia. Future studies should examine community-acquired pneumonia etiology and the extent to which important risk factors, such as air pollution and socioeconomic status, impact adult pneumonia morbidity and mortality. Early intervention methods, such as introducing pneumococcal disease and influenza immunization programs for older adults and those with underlying medical conditions, should also be considered. In the coming years, Mongolia's elderly population is expected to more than double, likely resulting in increased rates of chronic NCDs and intensifying demands on the country's healthcare system. By establishing the adult burden and clinical characteristics of community-acquired pneumonia, targeted interventions focusing on high-risk groups can be developed to have a more meaningful impact on the burden of disease.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【107】Conception/design of the work: EKM, CVM; Responsible for study oversight: CVM, TM, BDG, EMD, BT; acquisition of data: MU, BS, DL, DN, BP, TM; analysis of data: KF; drafting of the manuscript: KF.

The burden of invasive meningococcal disease has been reduced in many parts of the world through extensive public health efforts—most notably the introduction of conjugate group C vaccines in the UK in 1999, and conjugate group A vaccines in the African meningitis belt beginning in 2010. Yet, developing vaccines to protect against the diversity of disease-causing meningococcal B (MenB) strains has been challenging. The first vaccines designed to be broadly immunogenic against multiple MenB strains became available only recently, with the 4CMenB vaccine (also known as Bexsero \\[GSK\\]) being licensed in Europe in 2013. The UK became the first country to introduce 4CMenB into a national infant immunisation programme in September, 2015. UK health authorities recommend a reduced two-dose priming schedule at 2 months and 4 months and a booster dose at 12 months of age for all infants born since July, 2015, plus an opportunistic catch-up programme for infants born in May or June, 2015. \n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

Warren, a consultant pathologist now retired from Royal Perth Hospital in Australia, is a reserved man whose colleagues talk about his quiet persistence, thoughtfulness, and careful observation. Marshall, a gastroenterologist 14 years his junior from the University of Western Australia, has described himself as brash. Others list his creativity, determination, and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n【2】Warren's quiet persistence and Marshall's energetic enthusiasm complement one another. They make what both men describe as a “good team” and have together achieved, according to the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute, a remarkable and unexpected discovery that gastritis and peptic ulcers arise from an infection of the stomach caused by the bacterium _Helicobacter pylori_ . In the process, the two researchers have overturned established medical dogma and revolutionised the treatment of peptic ulcers.\n\n【3】The partnership began in 1981 when Marshall, a trainee doctor, asked Warren about the possibility of doing a research project with him. 2 years earlier, Warren had made a historic discovery—that gastric biopsy samples from patients with gastritis had an unexpected burden of curved bacteria. Since 1979, he had been gathering more and more samples. “As far as I was concerned the way they were arranged, they were associated with the gastritis”, Warren said. “But trying to convince other people of that was impossible.”\n\n【4】Warren recalls: “Every time I spoke to a clinician they would say, ‘Robin, if these bacteria are causing it as you say, why hasn't it been described before?'.” Orthodox medical teaching at the time was that bacteria did not grow in a normal stomach. However, as Warren wrote in the 2002 book _Helicobacter Pioneers_ , “I preferred to believe my eyes, not the medical textbooks or the medical fraternity.” Marshall also believed what he saw through Warren's microscope. “The first time I sat down with him he didn't really have any trouble convincing me there were these organisms in the stomach”, he told _The Lancet_ . “As far as I was concerned he was right, and I thought this was a unique observation.”\n\n【5】Soon the two became absorbed in a study of 100 patients, and Marshall had begun trying to culture the organism—a difficult task he finally achieved in early 1982. By the end of that year, armed with preliminary results, Marshall gave a presentation at a local meeting, where he earned a patronising and negative response. “I didn't have all my ammunition ready to go”, he says. “It allowed people to shoot holes in our hypothesis.” It was the kind of response he and Warren were to become familiar with. “I was out there fighting battles with the gastroenterologists”, he recalls. “But Robin's very persistent; I'm also a little the same. Neither of us would really care if there were 1000 people jeering on the sidelines; it would be like water off a duck's back.” Throughout this time, the two men took encouragement from talking to one another and valued the support of their wives—Win Warren and Adrienne Marshall. “In fact, there was only one doctor who did believe in what I was doing”, Warren wrote, “my wife Win, who was a psychiatrist and who encouraged me”.\n\n【6】In 1983, the two published an unusual pair of correspondence letters in this journal, including photographs of the histology and electron microscope images of the organism ( _Lancet_ 1983; **1:** 1273–75). Later that year, at the recommendation of the campylobacter specialist Martin Skirrow from the UK's Public Health Laboratory Service, Marshall presented the findings to the 2nd International Workshop on Campylobacter Infections in Brussels, Belguim.“I think most microbiologists were convinced at the outset that this was linked to gastritis”, Skirrow recalls. “He's a good salesman is Barry. He carried most microbiologists with him in his work.”\n\n【7】Whereas microbiologists had no dogma to overcome about the causes of gastritis and peptic ulcers, the wider medical community remained hard to convince. Even the first major publication of their results, in this journal in 1984, was a difficult hurdle ( _Lancet_ 1984; **1:** 1311–15). The editors, Marshall recalls, found it difficult to find reviewers who could agree the paper was important, general, and interesting enough to be published. It was partly with the assistance of Skirrow that the article finally appeared.\n\n【8】The same year, in an act born to some extent of frustration, Marshall deliberately infected himself by drinking a solution swimming with the bacterium, as part of a successful and widely reported experiment to prove Koch's postulates. But many clinicians still remained unmoved. It wasn't until the early 1990s that the evidence of Marshall and Warren became impossible to ignore, at which point pharmaceutical development and clinical practice underwent a shift towards eradication of _H pylori_ to treat ulcers.\n\n【9】The Nobel Prize came a decade later, and was richly deserved says Adrian Lee, a leading _H pylori_ researcher who was among those microbiologists at the Brussels conference. Although other researchers had reported seeing spiral bacteria in the stomach before the west Australian duo, their achievement stands alone, he notes. “There was no accumulation of evidence”, he says. “What happened was that people had made observations, but had drawn no conclusions. This was a paradigm-shifting discovery.”\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 22 October 2005\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67587-3</u>\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The first open slot in his diary (which rumour has it is divided into 15 minute slots) was 6 weeks after our introduction, but his office is neat, he is unruffled, and even for an interview from a trainee psychiatrist, he is meticulously prepared.\n\n【2】Given free reign over the conversation, the world renowned Professor of Community Psychiatry delves straight into his key interest of global mental health. He addresses a false paradox—that although only a quarter of people with mental health problems in the UK are getting the help they need, the NHS provides among the best mental health care in the world, as “the overall state of play is dreadful. In lower and middle income countries, only 10% or even 5% of people who need mental health treatment are getting it. The world mental health survey found that in Nigeria, that number was 2%”.\n\n【3】Thornicroft's achievements have ensured that this is far from his first interview, yet his matter-of-fact tone portrays a striking modesty. With typical humility he raises his involvement with the development of the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme, an undertaking designed to help remedy the drastic inequality in global mental health coverage: “It was a major leap forward, something very practical and algorithmic”. The easy-to-use set of mental health guidelines were designed to be implemented by local non-specialist health-care workers in developing countries but their development wasn't straightforward. The choice between using only culturally relevant evidence or evidence developed in more affluent countries posed a particular problem. “If you do the former, you've got very little evidence, not enough to recommend anything. If you do the latter, you don't know how far you can generalise the evidence.” After settling on a series of filters to judge if each piece of evidence was applicable to local settings or not, he set out to remedy the absence of culturally relevant evidence himself, culminating in the publication of an RCT suggesting that community-based care for people with severe mental illness can be effective in developing countries.\n\n【4】Also widely renowned for his work on stigma, Thornicroft tells me how his difficult initial foray into the topic during a sabbatical drove him to reconsider the very term itself: “I became increasingly frustrated and angry with the concept of stigma. It's rather ill-defined and it has very few practical beneficial consequences. Although it's a helpful overarching concept, it's more of an umbrella term for unhelpful knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours”. And it is through work on the direct effect of these behaviours—discrimination—that he sees the most potential for change: “You don't have to work for decades to create a new legal framework. There aren't laws against stigma, but there are laws against discrimination, equality laws, which can be used in many countries to change things”.\n\n【5】Drawing together his work on both global mental health and stigma, Thornicroft set up an international collaboration designed to investigate stigma worldwide, firstly by gauging the extent of it. “The proposal was pretty ridiculous— we told them that we had no money, but would they like to join in on a voluntary basis? To my surprise, to begin with, colleagues in 27 countries said yes. They felt it was important.” The newly formed group published their first large-scale study in _The Lancet_ in 2009. By talking to more than 700 people with schizophrenia in 27 countries, they found that more than 90% had experienced discrimination, many over a variety of settings. “In fact, in many cases, expectations of discrimination preceded actually being discriminated against in real life.”\n\n【6】In response to claims that schizophrenia was an exceptional case, the now 39 country-strong group spoke to over 1000 people with major depressive disorder, finding similar results. “It's having had a diagnosis of any mental illness that seems to drive the discrimination rather than a specific category or diagnostic group. There's something common about being exposed to specialist services, a highly toxic effect which causes reputational damage to individuals.”\n\n【7】On being asked how he intends to take his work in other countries forward, Thornicroft shows a modesty which typifies my whole interaction with him—he explains that we have to realise the limits of our own usefulness as foreigners, to focus on helping other countries to help themselves: “I see it in partnership terms, being part of a network of people who are bringing their skills together to secure funding for projects. We need to identify capable early career researchers and policy makers and support their careers, to help them remain situant instead of contributing to the brain drain.”\n\n【8】Even with such a consuming interest in global mental health, the growing strain on services far closer to home has not escaped Thornicroft. He singles out the cuts to early intervention services as particularly financially illogical: “I understand the need to reconfigure services because of cost pressures, but if you don't give people with complex needs a high level of support, then they're more likely to relapse and require a bed.” A knack for taking a broad, holistic view of a problem is clearly one of his finest skills, deployed here as well as ever. “We need to get the balance between hospital and community services right, seeing each as an interdependent component of the system of care.”\n\n【9】Thornicroft says that “After 30 years in psychiatry I'm still fascinated with how you can help people in those complex and hybrid ways”, and his advice for newly qualified psychiatrists draws on another aspect of his research— advancing service user-led research and service development. He says “listen repeatedly to what patients and their families are saying about what's wrong with the system— about what needs to be improved most and quickest. Become part of the solution rather than the problem. When we ask service users about where stigma comes from, they give health-care staff as one of the primary sources and I think we have a real challenge in addressing that in the future”.\n\n【10】A small crowd has been forming outside the office. The first few knocks on the door are politely waved away, but their frequency builds and it's clear that more important business is pressing. I'd like to find out a little more about the man himself— he's a keen amateur pilot and must have travelled the world with his research—but it looks like I'll have to save that for another 15 minute slot.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【11】### Publication history\n\n【12】Published: November 2014\n\n【13】### Identification\n\n【14】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(14)00016-9</u>\n\n【15】### Copyright\n\n【16】© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to establish whether the combination of benzylpenicillin and gentamicin or chloramphenicol would be better as first-line treatment in children with severe pneumonia in Papua New Guinea.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did an open randomised trial in which we enrolled children aged 1 month to 5 years of age who fulfilled the WHO criteria for very severe pneumonia and who presented to hospitals in two provinces. Children were randomly assigned to receive chloramphenicol (25 mg/kg 6 hourly) or benzylpenicillin (50 mg/kg 6 hourly) plus gentamicin (7·5 mg/kg daily) by intramuscular injection. The primary outcome measure was a good or an adverse outcome.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】1116 children were enrolled; 559 children were treated with chloramphenicol and 557 with benzylpenicillin and gentamicin. At presentation the median haemoglobin oxygen saturation was 71% (IQR 57–77) for those allocated chloramphenicol and 69% (55–77) for those allocated penicillin and gentamicin. 147 (26%) children treated with chloramphenicol and 123 (22%) treated with penicillin and gentamicin had adverse outcomes (p=0·11). 36 children treated with chloramphenicol and 29 treated with penicillin and gentamicin died. More children treated with chloramphenicol than penicillin and gentamicin represented with severe pneumonia within 1 month of hospital discharge (p=0·03).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】For children with severe pneumonia in less-developed countries the probability of a good outcome is similar if treated with chloramphenicol or with the combination of benzylpenicillin and gentamicin.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【9】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【10】Already registered?\n\n【11】Log in to existing account\n\n【12】Forgot password?\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Not yet registered?\n\n【16】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Their work emphasises the public health importance of health-care-associated bloodstream infections, which have become one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. We did a 1 year study in 2008 confirming the importance of this problem at a tertiary care referral centre with 2789 beds, admitting roughly 120 000 patients yearly in Marseille, France.\n\n【1】1033 patients had health-care-associated bloodstream infections and positive blood cultures at least 48 h after admission. We assessed whether syndromic surveillance (ie, surveillance, collection, and analysis of data about a clinical syndrome that substantially affects public health) of deaths from health-care-associated bloodstream infections was better for monitoring than the mandatory reporting system that was in place. Deaths occurring within 15 days of admission were attributed to health-care-associated bloodstream infections. In 2008, 115 (11%) of the 1033 patients died within 15 days of onset. We calculated an attributable mortality by subtracting the proportion of deaths that were not attributed to health-care-associated bloodstream infections from that attributed to health-care-associated bloodstream infections. By contrast, only ten deaths were reported in the official way. Thus we think that automatic syndromic surveillance is better than is self-reporting.\n\n【2】Extrapolation of our data to a national level suggests that roughly 12 400 patients might have died from health-care-associated bloodstream infections, which is more than ten times the official number of deaths and would make these infections the sixth leading cause of death in France, causing more deaths than suicides and car accidents. Similar data have been reported in the USA. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bloodstream infection was the 11th leading cause of death in the USA in 2011. Furthermore, researchers in Pennsylvania reported that catheter-associated bacteraemia was the 12th most common cause of death in the USA in 2007. Thus, health-care-associated bloodstream infections are a public health priority and are substantially underestimated.

We investigated associations between self-reported stressful working conditions and psychosomatic symptoms among nurses in the Hebron district, occupied Palestinian Territory, and whether there are differences the sexes in the perceptions of working conditions and psychosomatic symptoms.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did a cross-sectional survey between Oct 7 and Dec 10, 2012, among registered nurses in all health sectors in Hebron district. A nine-point ordinal scale of working conditions was used to categorise perception of stress as low, medium, or high, and seven psychosomatic symptoms were recorded on a checklist coded as never (0), seldom (1), occasionally (2), or often (3), allowing for a total score between 0 and 21. All analyses were done with STATA (version 10). P values of less than 0·05 were significant. Participation in the study was voluntary, and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics, Norway. Permission to do the study was obtained from the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Among 372 eligible nurses, ten were on extended leave from work, 16 declined to participate, and four had incomplete data, giving a final sample of 342 nurses (92% response rate). 212 (62%) were women and 130 (38%) were men. Low levels of stress were reported by 42 (12%) nurses, medium levels by 206 (60%), and high levels by 94 (28%). The mean score of psychosomatic symptoms for the group was 10·4 (SD 4·02, range 0–21). Scores did not differ significantly between men and women. Mean symptom scores differed between nurses with self-reported highly stressful working conditions and those with low levels of stress (12.6 _vs_ 8.4, difference 4·1, 95% CI 2·7–5·5; p<0·001). Among male nurses, those with self-reported highly stressful working conditions had a mean psychosomatic symptom score of 13.0, compared with that was 7.7 among those working in low-stress conditions (difference 5·3 units, p<0·001). This effect remained significant after adjustment for the covariates age, education, number of children, work schedule, and years of experience (12·6 _vs_ 7·7, difference 4·9 units, 95% CI 2·6–7·2). Among female nurses, the scores among those with high-stress working conditions was 12.4 and for those with low-stress working conditions was 9.0 (difference 3·4 units, p<0·001). After adjustment the difference remained similar (12·4 _vs_ 9·0, difference 3·5 units, 95% CI 1·7–5·3, p<0·001).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】We found that psychosomatic symptoms increased as self-reported perception of stressful working conditions increased, irrespective of sex. The study had a cross-sectional design and both exposure and outcomes were measured using self-report and, therefore, interpretation of the results should be made with caution. Longitudinal epidemiological studies are recommended. Future studies should investigate whether stressful working conditions affect the quality of patients’ care in health services.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Norwegian Programme for Development, Research and Education.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】YJ, EB, and RB-P, designed the study.

We assessed in this trial's participants how results differed according to patients' CHADS 2 , CHA 2 DS 2 VASc, and HAS-BLED scores, used to predict the risk of stroke and bleeding.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】ARISTOTLE was a double-blind, randomised trial that enrolled 18 201 patients with atrial fibrillation in 39 countries. Patients were randomly assigned apixaban 5 mg twice daily (n=9120) or warfarin (target international normalised ratio 2·0–3·0; n=9081). The primary endpoint was stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. We calculated CHADS 2 , CHA 2 DS 2 VASc, and HAS-BLED scores of patients at randomisation. Efficacy analyses were by intention to treat, and safety analyses were of the population who received the study drug. ARISTOTLE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00412984.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Apixaban significantly reduced stroke or systemic embolism with no evidence of a differential effect by risk of stroke (CHADS 2 1, 2, or ≥3, p for interaction=0·4457; or CHA 2 DS 2 VASc 1, 2, or ≥3, p for interaction=0·1210) or bleeding (HAS-BLED 0–1, 2, or ≥3, p for interaction=0·9422). Patients who received apixaban had lower rates of major bleeding than did those who received warfarin, with no difference across all score categories (CHADS 2 , p for interaction=0·4018; CHA 2 DS 2 VASc, p for interaction=0·2059; HAS-BLED, p for interaction=0·7127). The relative risk reduction in intracranial bleeding tended to be greater in patients with HAS-BLED scores of 3 or higher (hazard ratio \\[HR\\] 0·22, 95% CI 0·10–0·48) than in those with HAS-BLED scores of 0–1 (HR 0·66, 0·39–1·12; p for interaction=0·0604).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Because apixaban has benefits over warfarin that are consistent across patient risk of stroke and bleeding as assessed by the CHADS 2 , CHA 2 DS 2 VASc, and HAS-BLED scores, these scores might be less relevant when used to tailor apixaban treatment to individual patients than they are for warfarin. Further improvement in risk stratification for both stroke and bleeding is needed, particularly for patients with atrial fibrillation at low risk for these events.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

WHO recommends contact investigation in close contacts of patients with MDR and XDR tuberculosis. We aimed to assess the burden of tuberculosis disease in household contacts of such patients.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We undertook a retrospective cohort study of household contacts of patients treated for MDR or XDR tuberculosis in Lima, Peru, in 1996–2003. The primary outcome was active tuberculosis in household contacts at the time the index patient began MDR tuberculosis treatment and during the 4-year follow-up. We examined whether the occurrence of active tuberculosis in the household contacts differed by resistance pattern of the index patient: either MDR or XDR tuberculosis.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】693 households of index patients with MDR tuberculosis were enrolled in the study. In 48 households, the _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolate from the index patient was XDR. Of the 4503 household contacts, 117 (2·60%) had active tuberculosis at the time the index patient began MDR tuberculosis treatment—there was no difference in prevalence between XDR and MDR tuberculosis households. During the 4-year follow-up, 242 contacts developed active tuberculosis—the frequency of active tuberculosis was nearly two times higher in contacts of patients with XDR tuberculosis than it was in contacts of patients with MDR tuberculosis (hazard ratio 1·88, 95% CI 1·10–3·21). In the 359 contacts with active tuberculosis, 142 (40%) had had isolates tested for resistance against first-line drugs, of whom 129 (90·9%, 95% CI 85·0–94·6) had MDR tuberculosis.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In view of the high risk of disease recorded in household contacts of patients with MDR or XDR tuberculosis, tuberculosis programmes should implement systematic household contact investigations for all patients identified as having MDR or XDR tuberculosis.

The truth is, New York was just as involved; this city's economy was tied to slavery, and New York merchants financed the South's cotton trade”, observed Howard Dodson, Director of Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the opening of the African Burial Ground National Monument in Lower Manhattan, New York, last year. Adjacent to the site of the African Burial Ground, where around 15 000 African slaves and their descendants were buried in the 17th and 18th centuries, the centre is just a short walk from Wall Street where those same slaves were once traded. By the end of the American Revolution (1776), about a fifth of the population of New York City was of African descent, and almost all of these people were enslaved. Slave labour was crucial to the construction of the city under Dutch colonial rule as well as English.\n\n【1】Slaves were “property” and therefore regarded as less than human; they were denied rights in life, and also in death. They could be buried only outside the city limits. Their bodies were interred, sometimes three or four to a grave, in plots north of Manhattan's Chambers Street, across from the paupers' cemetery where the indigent of the city were buried. Slaves could not afford coffins or winding cloths and were usually laid to rest in bare earth. Their cemetery was originally called the “Negroes Burying Ground”, the name that appears on old maps.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2011 IAM/akg-images</u>\n\n【2】However, for some of those laid in the Burying Ground there was to be little in the way of eternal rest. Both the Ground and the paupers' graveyard were a short distance from Columbia College, which at the end of the 18th century housed the city's only School of Medicine. Charles McKnight, Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at Columbia, like every professor of medicine at the time, bemoaned the lack of cadavers for dissection. Post-mortem dissection was considered an indignity to the dead and the city fathers even forbade using bodies abandoned in the rougher parts of the city. McKnight was highly esteemed in New York, but he probably did not discourage his “students of physic” from making their own efforts to obtain cadavers. “Resurrection”, as body-snatching or grave-robbing was called, was the cheapest, surest way to obtain the remains of the newly deceased, especially in the winter when bodies decayed at a slower rate. Doctors and medical students turned to the cemeteries of the poor and of people of colour. As long as body-snatching was limited to these two repositories of the dead, many New Yorkers felt they could overlook the nocturnal activities of the resurrectionists.\n\n【3】There was another New York doctor whose name was uttered in less reverential tones than McKnight's. Richard Bayley, born and bred in Connecticut, had received his medical education in England where body-snatching was more common. There were whispers about him “cutting up his patients and performing cruel experiments upon the sick”. However, his skills and the shortage of physicians kept doors open for him. Bayley and his young protégé, Wright Post, were not part of the Columbia faculty but made use of two rooms in the New York Hospital for medical dissections. Since the hospital was just a short distance from the Burying Ground, it is probable that these doctors also suggested to students ways to remedy the cadaver situation. Apparently such suggestions were not tempered by advice to proceed with caution. Dissection began immediately a corpse was obtained, since decay set in as soon as the last breath had been taken. Limbs could be packed in snow, individual organs could be pickled in wine, whisky, or vinegar, or cured like bacon, but there was no method to preserve an entire body. Embalming with arsenic or formaldehyde would not be developed for decades. In the winter of 1788, it seems students began digging up bodies more frequently than usual and without covering their tracks.\n\n【4】The students of physic in New York began their college careers at the age of 15 years, before being apprenticed to physicians, so perhaps their youth was part of the problem. They strutted about the city in black suits, the traditional attire of physicians, unconcerned as tales of their behaviour began to circulate more widely. The poor certainly lamented the loss of the bodies of their loved ones but it was in the African Burial Ground that resurrection assumed a disquieting racial element that was to continue in medical schools for years to come.\n\n【5】However, black New Yorkers objected. On Feb 3, 1788, a group of black freedmen petitioned the city's Common Council to prevent further desecration of their graveyard:\n\n【6】“Most humbly sirs, we declare that it has lately been the practice of a number of young gentlemen in this city who call themselves students of the physic, to repair to the burying ground, assigned for the use of your petitioners. Under cover of the night, in the most wanton sallies of excess, they dig up bodies of our deceased friends and relatives of your petitioners, carrying them away without respect for age or sex. Your petitioners are well aware of the necessity of physicians and surgeons consulting dead subjects for the benefit of mankind. Your petitioners do not presuppose it as an injury to the deceased and would not be adverse to dissection in particular circumstances, that is, if it is conducted with the decency and propriety which the solemnity of such occasion requires. Your petitioners do not wish to impede the work of these students of the physic but most humbly pray your honors to take our case into consideration and adopt such measure as may seem meet to prevent similar abuses in the future.”\n\n【7】But their petition was ignored and the looting of the African Burial Ground continued.\n\n【8】In April, 1788, a group of children playing outside the New York Hospital ventured near Bayley's rooms where a student named John Hicks was dissecting an arm. Hicks is said to have waved the arm out the window at the children, including one small boy who had recently lost his mother. Hicks supposedly called to the child: “This is your mother's arm! I just dug it up!” The youngster ran home, his father enlisted help to exhume his wife's coffin, which was found to be empty—and the riot was on.\n\n【9】Citizens began to mass around the hospital building. Hicks, with other medical students and professors, beat a hasty retreat. By the time the mob broke in, the hospital was abandoned except for Post and four senior medical students, all determined to save a valuable collection of anatomy specimens accumulated over many years. But they were outnumbered, and although not harmed themselves all the specimens were taken and destroyed.\n\n【10】James Thacher, a physician who witnessed the riot, described it in his memoirs: “The concourse assembled on this occasion was immense, and some of the mob having forced their way into the dissecting-room, several human bodies were found in various states of mutilation. Enraged at this discovery, they seized upon the fragments, as heads, legs and arms, and exposed them from the windows and doors to public view, with horrid imprecations.” The mob dragged Post and his students into the street as an estimated 2000 people watched. Mayor James Duane fought his way through the crowd and, in an attempt to protect the doctors from being torn apart, ordered them escorted by bailiffs to the jailhouse for their own protection. Bands of rioters moved across the city, spreading word of the horrors they had seen. The medical students who had escaped were hurried out of town while the physicians who remained in the city were forced to “slip out of windows, creep behind bean barrels, crawl up chimneys and hide beneath feather beds”. As more New Yorkers joined the rioting, the threat of outright rebellion loomed. When the mob started down Broadway in search of the real culprit, “the odious Dr Hicks”, Bayley joined Post and the students in the jailhouse for his own safety. The unrest continued overnight and into the following days. By the time 5000 frenzied people were massed outside the jailhouse demanding blood, the militia had been called in. The rioters began throwing rocks; Governor Clinton sent in the cavalry who galloped up Broadway and charged the mob. At least three and possibly up to 20 people died in the mêlée; many of the rioters are thought to have later died from their wounds. For the next few days, the militia patrolled the streets as life gradually returned to normal.\n\n【11】The anger and ill will towards the physicians did not end with the riot and the doctors who remained in the city trod lightly. Charges were attempted against the students but Hicks himself never appeared in court. In January, 1789, the State Legislature pushed forward a statute to prevent “the odious practice of digging up and removing for the purpose of dissection, dead bodies interred in cemeteries or burial places”. Anyone who broke the law would stand on the pillory or be publicly whipped, fined, or imprisoned. The statute also permitted the bodies of executed criminals to be used in dissection, “in order that science \\[might not\\] be injured by preventing the dissection of proper subjects”. Now medical students could legally do something that they had been doing for years, cooling their heels next to the hangman's noose, but the corpses of executed criminals were not sufficient to fulfil their needs. “Resurrection men”, professionals who used stealth and discretion, were recruited to replace the students and went on to control the supply of cadavers for generations.\n\n【12】The African Burial Ground became a victim of the extension of Chambers Street and disappeared from city maps until 1991, when excavation unearthed the skeletons of some 400 African-Americans. The Burial Ground is now a National Historical Landmark, a place of appropriate respect for the dead, and the visitor centre has taken on the task of educating all Americans in its history.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

He has since been able to re-integrate into his community with acceptable restoration of his quality of life.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】This clinical report of the first documented human facial retransplantation is proof-of-concept that the loss of a facial transplant after CAMR can be mitigated successfully by retransplantation combined with an aggressive desensitisation process.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris.\n\n【10】</u>To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

Early reports suggest atypical presentations. We aimed to investigate clinical and virological characteristics of cases of human monkeypox in Spain.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study was done in three sexual health clinics in Madrid and Barcelona, Spain. We enrolled all consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox from May 11 to June 29, 2022. Participants were offered lesion, anal, and oropharynx swabs for PCR testing. Participant data were collected by means of interviews conducted by dermatologists or specialists in sexually transmitted infections and were recorded using a standard case report form. Outcomes assessed in all participants with a confirmed diagnosis were demographics, smallpox vaccination, HIV status, exposure to someone with monkeypox, travel, mass gathering attendance, risk factors for sexually transmitted infections, sexual behaviour, signs and symptoms on first presentation, virological results at multiple body sites, co-infection with other sexually transmitted pathogens, and clinical outcomes 14 days after the initial presentation. Clinical outcomes were followed up until July 13, 2022.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】181 patients had a confirmed monkeypox diagnosis and were enrolled in the study. 166 (92%) identified as gay men, bisexual men, or other men who have sex with men (MSM) and 15 (8%) identified as heterosexual men or heterosexual women. Median age was 37·0 years (IQR 31·0–42·0). 32 (18%) patients reported previous smallpox vaccination, 72 (40%) were HIV-positive, eight (11%) had a CD4 cell count less than 500 cells per μL, and 31 (17%) were diagnosed with a concurrent sexually transmitted infection. Median incubation was 7·0 days (IQR 5·0–10·0). All participants presented with skin lesions; 141 (78%) participants had lesions in the anogenital region, and 78 (43%) in the oral and perioral region. 70 (39%) participants had complications requiring treatment: 45 (25%) had a proctitis, 19 (10%) had tonsillitis, 15 (8%) had penile oedema, six (3%) an abscess, and eight (4%) had an exanthem. Three (2%) patients required hospital admission. 178 (99%) of 180 swabs from skin lesions collected tested positive, as did 82 (70%) of 117 throat swabs. Viral load was higher in lesion swabs than in pharyngeal specimens (mean cycle threshold value 23 \\[SD 4\\] _vs_ 32 删除3:<u>\\[6\\]</u>, absolute difference 9 \\[95% CI 8–10\\]; p<0·0001). 108 (65%) of 166 MSM reported anal-receptive sex. MSM who engaged in anal-receptive sex presented with proctitis (41 \\[38%\\] of 108 _vs_ four \\[7%\\] of 58, absolute difference 31% \\[95% CI 19–44\\]; p<0·0001) and systemic symptoms before the rash (67 \\[62%\\] _vs_ 16 \\[28%\\], absolute difference 34% 删除3:<u>\\[28–62\\]</u>; p<0·0001) more frequently than MSM who did not engage in anal-receptive sex. 18 (95%) of 19 participants with tonsillitis reported practising oral-receptive sex. The median time from onset of lesions to formation of a dry crust was 10 days (IQR 7–13).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In our cohort, monkeypox caused genital, perianal, and oral lesions and complications including proctitis and tonsillitis. Because of the variability of presentations, clinicians should have a low threshold for suspicion of monkeypox. Lesion swabs showed the highest viral loads, which, combined with the history of sexual exposure and the distribution of lesions, suggests close contact is probably the dominant transmission route in the current outbreak.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】None.\n\n【10】</u>Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Autochthonous cases of monkeypox infection were initially confirmed in England from May 6, 2022, and subsequently throughout Europe. In Spain, as in other countries, the current outbreak has mainly affected men who have sex with men (MSM) without any documented history of travel to countries where monkeypox is endemic. By June 27, more than 800 cases had been reported in Spain. The pathogen has been identified as monkeypox virus from the west African clade, which is often associated with milder disease than the Congo basin clade. Nevertheless, some outbreak clade mutations have been identified in proteins involved in virus transmission and virulence.\n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【14】We searched PubMed for articles reporting clinical and virological features of the recently reported outbreak of monkeypox virus, which has affected various European countries. Searches using the key term “monkeypox” with no language restrictions among articles published from May 1, 2022, after the first case was reported, up to Aug 1, 2022, retrieved 268 results. Most publications were letters to the editor, perspectives, and case reports of fewer than ten participants. Three articles reported the results of observational studies on the clinical course of human monkeypox infection. One study reported the clinical findings of 54 outpatients attending a sexual health centre in London, UK. Two other studies described new clinical presentations and complications of the disease, including a study in 528 patients with human monkeypox enrolled from 16 countries outside countries where the disease is endemic, and a single-centre study of 197 patients with human monkeypox in central London.\n\n【15】**Added value of this study**\n\n【16】In our prospective assessment of 181 patients with new diagnoses of monkeypox, we investigated the relationship between sexual behaviour and clinical presentation, virological features, and progression patterns by systematically collecting information on sexual practices, carrying out a detailed clinical examination and follow-up, and testing for viral presence in specimens obtained from skin lesions, throat, and anal mucosa. We confirmed clinical characteristics observed in other observational analyses, and described in more detail several complications, including a proctitis-related syndrome and ulcerative tonsillitis. Additionally, we report how specific types of sexual practices are related to clinical presentation. Compared with some previous studies, recruitment of all consecutively selected patients from three sexual health clinics helps provide some indication of the number and proportion of different types of clinical presentations. Compared with the three studies outside endemic countries, we used a larger sample size to define the incubation period and to estimate the differences in viral load in different mucocutaneous sites. Our study confirms the short incubation period reported previously and provides an estimate of the time to the dry crust phase of lesions. Importantly, the finding of higher viral loads in skin lesions compared with the upper respiratory tract reinforces the likelihood of skin-to-skin contact as the dominant transmission route, whereas respiratory transmission seems to be less important.\n\n【17】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【18】The evidence available to date suggests that skin-to-skin contact is the dominant transmission route of the monkeypox virus in this outbreak, whereas respiratory transmission is probably less relevant, encouraging the revision of isolation measures in these patients. Additionally, the presence of atypical manifestations, which might be associated with the body site of viral entry, encourages a low threshold for clinical suspicion of monkeypox, particularly in areas with high transmission rates or in individuals who might be at high risk of contagion. The short incubation period suggests that postexposure vaccination strategies are unlikely to be effective.\n\n【19】Infections caused by orthopoxviruses can be classified as either systemic or localised (at the site of virus entry). The type of infection depends on the species of orthopoxvirus, the route of entry, and the species and genus of susceptible animals and their immune status. Typically, generalised infections caused by orthopoxviruses manifest as a diffuse rash. By contrast, clinical descriptions of smallpox cases from early medical writings describe a localised rash at the site of virus entry following cutaneous inoculation. \n\n【20】Historically, the signs and symptoms of monkeypox in countries in Africa where it is endemic consisted of a characteristic rash of several hundred simultaneous lesions in multiple regions of the body, including the face, arms, legs, and less commonly the palms, soles, or genitalia. The rash was normally preceded by prodromal symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and influenza-like symptoms. Initial evidence from the current outbreak suggests cases are atypical, with the rash in fewer regions of the body, in particular the genital and perianal areas, without spread to other body regions and with a relative mildness or absence of prodromal symptoms.\n\n【21】Detailed information regarding the epidemiology and the clinical features of monkeypox in the 2022 outbreak is scarce. In this study, we aimed to comprehensively evaluate the epidemiology, clinical features, and virological features of patients diagnosed with monkeypox at three large hospitals in Spain.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Study design and participants\n\n【24】In this multicentre, prospective, observational cohort study we enrolled all consecutive patients diagnosed with monkeypox from May 11 to June 29, 2022, at three hospitals in Spain (Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid; BCN Checkpoint Sexual Health Clinic, University Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Barcelona; and Drassanes Sexual Health Clinic, University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona). The first is a public general hospital, and the last two are open-access, community-based sexual health clinics. Together, the three units treat approximately 100 patients with sexually transmitted infections each day. All participants suspected to have monkeypox were offered triple-site (ie, lesion, anal, and oropharynx swabs) monkeypox PCR testing. A confirmed case of monkeypox was defined as a positive result on high throughput sequencing or real-time RT-PCR assay of skin lesion, anal, or oropharynx swab specimens. Only patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox were included in the analysis.\n\n【25】The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol. Oral informed consent was obtained from all participants. Written informed consent for anonymised publication of images was individually sought and obtained from participants.\n\n【26】### Procedures\n\n【27】Twelve dermatologists or specialists in sexually transmitted infections interviewed participants for this study. We obtained demographic, epidemiological, clinical presentation, laboratory, and clinical outcome data using a standardised case report form. Data on sexual history, including sexual practices, and the number of sexual partners were also collected. Clinical outcomes were followed up to July 13, 2022. The case definitions were established before the start of data collection. Broadly, case definitions consisted of participants with one or more papular, vesicular, or pustular skin lesion, or signs or symptoms of proctitis. When a new sign or syndrome was identified, the case definition was agreed upon by all recruiting physicians. If any data were missing or clarification was needed, we obtained the information by direct communication with the patient.\n\n【28】Laboratory confirmation of monkeypox was done at the Spanish National Microbiology Centre reference laboratory before June 6, 2022, and subsequently in local certified tertiary care hospitals. Skin lesion, anal, and oropharynx swabs were collected and examined with real-time RT-PCR. Monkeypox virus DNA was detected by LightMix Modular Orthopox Virus assay (TIB MolBiol, Berlin, Germany) on LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR equipment (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) amplifying a 113-base-pair long fragment of the 14 kDa gene specific to orthopoxviruses. A comprehensive sexual health screen was offered to all individuals, including a fourth-generation enzyme immunoassay for HIV serology, syphilis serology (Alinity i Syphilis TP \\[Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA\\] and Axis-Shield RPR \\[Abbott\\]), and triple-site _Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae,_ and _Mycoplasma genitalium_ screening from a pharyngeal swab, a rectal swab, and a first-void urine sample 删除2:<u>(Allplex STI Essential Assay \\[Seegene, Seoul, South Korea\\] or Aptima Combo 2 assay \\[for _C trachomatis_ and _N gonorrhoeae_ ; Hologic, Marlborough, MA, USA\\] and Aptima _M genitalium_ assay \\[Hologic\\])</u>. Additionally, participants presenting with clinical signs of proctitis were screened for _Treponema pallidum_ DNA using PCR in rectal swabs 删除2:<u>(Allplex STI Genital Ulcer assay; Seegene\\])</u> and participants with tonsillitis were screened for group A _Streptococcus_ (Abbott SD Bioline rapid antigen detection test \\[Abbott\\]). All procedures were done as planned, with no deviations from the approved study protocol.\n\n【29】### Outcomes\n\n【30】In all participants, we described demographics, patient-reported historic smallpox vaccination, comorbidities (including HIV status), epidemiological data (ie, incubation period, exposure to someone with monkeypox, travel, mass gathering attendance, and risk factors for sexually transmitted infections), sexual practices, signs and symptoms on first presentation, virological results at multiple body sites (including analysis of cycle threshold values), co-infection with other sexually transmitted pathogens, and clinical outcomes 14 days after the initial presentation to determine progression of disease.\n\n【31】We classified sexual orientation as heterosexual or MSM, including gay and bisexual men. For the purpose of analysis, we differentiated three presumed routes of infection that might be relevant for pathogenesis: anal-receptive sex in MSM, non-anal-receptive sex in MSM, and non-MSM sex. The first and second categories were mutually exclusive, so participants who had receptive anal intercourse were classified in the first group regardless of whether they had engaged in other types of sexual activity. The incubation period was defined as the interval between the potential earliest date of contact with a presumed transmission source (ie, a person with suspected or confirmed monkeypox) and the potential earliest date of symptom onset (ie, influenza-like symptoms or skin rash). To calculate the incubation period, we excluded participants whose timing of exposure was unclear. We defined at least one systemic feature as the presence of any of influenza-like illness, fever, headache, or arthralgia. Skin rash severity was classified as moderate when there were more than 20 lesions, mild when there were three to 20 lesions, and minimal when there were one or two lesions. Acute proctitis was defined as rectal pain and tenesmus or purulent discharge, tonsillitis as sore throat or trouble swallowing and acute enlargement and reddening of the tonsil or tonsils, moderate to severe penile oedema as swelling of the penile glans or foreskin, such that the retracted foreskin cannot be returned to its anatomic position (ie, paraphimosis), and exanthem as a widespread rash of pink-to-red spots on the trunk, arms, and legs.\n\n【32】### Statistical analysis\n\n【33】Continuous variables were expressed as medians and IQRs or ranges, as appropriate. Categorical variables were summarised as absolute values and proportions. No imputation was made for missing data. We described clinical features, including the distribution of skin lesions and the incubation period stratified by the presumed route of exposure, and PCR cycle threshold values by pharyngeal or ulcer swab. Analyses were considered descriptive and exploratory. We compared continuous variables using the _t_ test and proportions using a χ 2 test. All tests were two-sided with a significance threshold of 0·05. All analyses were performed with R (version 3.6.2).\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【34】There was no funding source for this study.\n\n【35】</u>Results\n-------\n\n【36】181 patients with monkeypox were assessed at the three participating centres during the study period, all of whom consented to take part in the study (99 at Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, 67 at BCN Checkpoint, and 15 at Drassanes).

There were no deaths.\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】In the early stages of the monkeypox outbreak in 2022, diagnosis and disease control have been difficult because many cases have not followed the patterns of illness described in the medical literature. In concert with recent studies, we found that most participants presented with a low number of lesions located in one or more of the genital, oral, and anal regions and that systemic symptoms were very common. Almost half of the participants had systemic illness before the rash appeared (prodromal stage) and just over half had systemic illness shortly afterwards (early clinical stage). These symptoms are attributable to the invasive phase of illness, which might sometimes occur after lesions have formed at the site of inoculation. During the invasive phase, the virus might spread to distant areas such as the face, limbs, and trunk and cause lesions at a different stage of progression than the initial local rash. In contrast to previous reports of monkeypox virus infections, no generalised swelling of the lymph nodes was observed, but regional lymphadenopathies were often present in the lymph catchment area of lesions. Nearly all participants had previous sexual exposure to an individual known to have monkeypox or had risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases, such as multiple sexual partners in the 12 weeks before their monkeypox diagnosis or use of recreational drugs during sex. The fact that 32 individuals acquired monkeypox despite smallpox vaccination in their childhood is of note and warrants further investigation to better understand the protection provided by vaccination in the context of the current outbreak. Additionally, 40% of individuals were HIV-positive, including eight participants with a CD4 cell count of less than 500 cells per μL. Neither the severity nor the progression of the disease differed between people who were HIV-positive and the rest of the participants. Given the high CD4 counts of participants in this study, we cannot comment on whether more immunosuppressed individuals might develop more severe disease. Due to the sampling strategy, we could not assess whether people who were HIV-positive were more susceptible to monkeypox infection because half of the participants were recruited from a hospital that provides health services to many individuals with HIV.\n\n【57】More than a third of participants presented with complications that required pain-relief medication. The most common complications were proctitis (sometimes extremely painful and in other cases associated with very intense itching), tonsillitis, paraphimosis due to penile oedema, and bacterial abscesses. Participants reporting anal-receptive sex were more likely than others to have early systemic symptoms before developing skin lesions. One explanation is that anal sex might damage the epithelium and enable blood entry, allowing greater viraemia at an early stage when local lesions have not yet developed. An alternative explanation is that these participants did have rectal lesions at the time of initial presentation, but these were missed. A similar phenomenon has been observed in patients with syphilis: MSM are less likely to present with primary syphilis because rectal chancres are often missed.\n\n【58】There are questions about whether monkeypox is sexually transmitted via semen and vaginal secretions. However, the extended definition of sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis and herpes simplex includes the presence of pathogens in purulent genital lesions that are transmitted through superficial abrasions in the skin or mucous membranes. Anorectal and genital epithelium routes exhibit the highest probability of sexually transmitted infection acquisition because they have a lower degree of keratinisation and a higher frequency of antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. Using the PCR cycle threshold as a proxy, we found that viral load in lesions was significantly higher than in pharyngeal swabs. Although imprecise, these findings are consistent with a viral load more than three orders of magnitude higher in lesion samples compared with respiratory samples. This observation, together with the localisation of the lesions, the exposure history of the individuals, and the concurrent sexually transmitted infections, suggests that close contact during sex is the dominant form of monkeypox transmission in the current outbreak. Public health messaging needs to be targeted at appropriate populations who might be at risk and needs to be adapted to highlight the risk of transmission related to close skin-to-skin contact.\n\n【59】Our finding of low viral loads or even negative results in respiratory samples suggests that there might be differences from previous imported cases, which have shown prolonged monkeypox virus DNA detection in swabs of the upper respiratory tract. We speculate that local replication of the virus at the point of entry within lesions of the genital or oral tract might be followed by low-grade or no viraemia, resulting in minimal replication in the respiratory tract and little or no transmission through respiratory droplets. In smallpox, accidental local inoculation or intentional inoculation (ie, variolation) resulted in locally restricted satellite lesions around the point of entry in the absence of disseminated lesions. By contrast, generalised poxvirus infections progress in a stepwise manner (with an initial amplification of viral load in the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen), resulting in a high-grade viraemia that leads to disseminated infection of the skin and respiratory tract, and the excretion of infective respiratory droplets. Besides the change in the route of transmission, there might be alternative reasons for the localised presentation of monkeypox, such as a novel gain-of-function mutation, that might become evident when more viral sequences are available. Additionally, mild trauma in the pubic, inguinal, and perianal regions during sexual intercourse might cause local vasodilation and a higher density of skin lesions in that particular region (also known as the garter effect).\n\n【60】Our study has some limitations. First, we could not estimate the incubation period in 37 participants because they reported multiple possible exposure events. Second, participants from one of the sexual health clinics did not undergo collection of a throat or anal swab on presentation due to logistical reasons. Third, we only collected samples at diagnosis and did not collect semen samples as part of this study. We are collecting samples, including semen, at multiple timepoints in a currently enrolling study, which might provide more information on viral kinetics (NCT05476744). Similarly, we did not have complete information on skin healing (eg, desquamation of crust and new skin underneath) and had to use the formation of dry crust as the parameter for assessing lesion healing. Finally, blood testing was not routinely done; therefore, we had to infer dissemination from the point of entry to a distant site on the basis of testing of throat swabs, which might have underestimated the number of participants with viraemia. Nevertheless, many participants had samples collected at more than one body site, which enabled us to investigate associations between rash distribution and dissemination of the virus.\n\n【61】Our study strengthens the evidence for skin-to-skin contact during sex as the dominant mechanism of transmission of monkeypox, with important implications for disease control. First, the putative change compared with previous outbreaks in the route of transmission from respiratory to direct contact might promote the spread of the disease through sexual networks. This scenario is similar to previous outbreaks, such as lymphogranuloma venereum L2b, antibiotic-resistant _Shigella_ , and hepatitis A, which were transmitted predominantly within sexual networks of MSM. Second, because monkeypox might present with atypical manifestations, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of the disease, particularly in individuals living in areas with high transmission rates or with potential exposure. Specifically, we describe a proctitis-related clinical syndrome, with different clinical features, including systemic manifestations before lesion onset, in individuals reporting anal-receptive sex, which differs from other presentations. Third, because of the short incubation period, pre-exposure vaccination of groups who are at high risk is likely to be more effective than postexposure vaccination for public health control of the infection. Finally, the strikingly higher viral loads in lesion swabs than in pharyngeal swabs should be further investigated to guide the decision on whether respiratory transmission is relevant and respiratory isolation at home is necessary.\n删除4:<u>\n**This online publication has been corrected.

However, we believe that they were remiss in not including lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention in their list of recommended strategies.\n\n【1】Dietary choices, physical inactivity, and excess weight—the targets of lifestyle interventions—are clearly causal for diabetes (criterion 1), and five large, randomised trials in the USA, Finland, Sweden, China, and India, have shown that lifestyle interventions result in a substantial reduction in the incidence of diabetes (criterion 2). Both the US Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and the Indian Diabetes Prevention Programme (IDPP) were cost-effective (criterion 3) and affordable in low-income to middle-income countries (criterion 4). The estimated cost of implementing lifestyle interventions in developing countries ranged from US$60 to $130 per quality-adjusted life year. The IDPP intervention has directly shown that it would cost $1052 per case of diabetes prevented in India.\n\n【2】The number of individuals with diabetes is growing at an alarming rate. Studies are needed to show the translation and scalability of studies such as the DPP and the IDPP; however, in the meantime, countries should not ignore this major public-health problem.

However, the relative frequencies of hypoglycaemic events by hour of day showed a similar distribution profile, with peaks at 2 pm for lispro and 3 pm for glargine. A further explanation is given by the subgroup analysis of patients not given glimepiride. A threefold higher incidence of hypoglycaemic events per patient was seen in those on lispro (7·2 _vs_ 2·3).\n\n【1】In response to Michael Roden's question, we want to allude to the webfigure associated with our paper. Mean daily insulin doses increased during the 44-week observation period, reaching a plateau at 28 weeks and 36 weeks for insulin lispro and insulin glargine, respectively. Since curves for bodyweight and insulin dose strictly ran in parallel over time, they seemed to be influenced by the same factors.\n\n【2】We do not agree with Juliana Helena Oliveira and colleagues that the higher frequency of self-monitoring blood glucose values was responsible for the fourfold increased hypoglycaemic rate in the lispro group. The frequency of unconfirmed symptomatic hypoglycaemia as well as perceived hypoglycaemia were significantly higher in the lispro cohort, arguing against the use of the glucose meter as a simple reason for recording more hypoglycaemic events. Instead, we agree with McMahon and Dluhy that the 4-T trial results, now confirmed by APOLLO, will have consequences for current clinical practice because they show that prandial insulin formulations carry a high risk of hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, with progression of the disease and on the basis of the results of the APOLLO trial, prandial boluses of insulin added to basal insulin will be required in about a third of patients to sustain daytime glycaemic control.\n\n【3】In their Comment accompanying our paper, Yogish Kudva and Victor Montori conclude that the APOLLO trial and the 4-T trial differ in location, study design, and therapeutic targets. We do not agree with their conclusion. Patients in our trial were recruited mainly in central Europe, and patients of the 4-T trial in England; in both trials more than 90% of patients were white. These open, randomised, controlled, multicentre trials both included basal and prandial therapeutic groups; inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar; the primary outcome was glycosyated haemoglobin at about 1 year (44 weeks in APOLLO, 52 weeks in 4-T); most of the secondary outcomes were the same; and targets for blood glucose concentrations were identical in both trials (4·0 mmol/L for fasting, 5·5 mmol/L for preprandial).\n\n【4】Furthermore, Kudva and Montori state that no adherence to therapy was reported in either trial. If adherence is reflected by the proportions of patients finally achieving glycosyated haemoglobin levels of 7% or less, we saw a greater success rate in the APOLLO trial: 57% versus 27·8% in the basal group and 69% versus 48·7% in the prandial group.\n\n【5】In principle, we agree with Kudva and Montori's statement that more independent and outcome-related trials are needed. As far as independence is concerned, both trials clearly indicated the possible conflicts of interest according to international standards.\n\n【6】TL received an unrestricted grant from Sanofi-Aventis.

Now, a country rich in natural resources is submerged in a complex humanitarian emergency due to the politico-economic crisis that started in 2008, progressively destroying the health-care system.\n\n【1】In this issue, Page and colleagues discuss the current situation in Venezuela and explain how the crisis has threatened the nation's public health, resulting in increases in morbidity and mortality. The authors also report on the observations they made when visiting the Venezuelan borders with Colombia and Brazil, where the movement of Venezuelan migrants has already resulted in a strain on both countries' health-care systems. Another worrying implication of the movement of migrants into neighbouring countries is the quick dissemination of infectious diseases, such as malaria and Chagas. A Review in _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_ analysed the return of vector-borne diseases and the implications for spillover in the region. For example, the number of malaria cases increased by 359% between 2000 and 2015, and by a further 71% in 2017 (411 586 cases). Dengue incidence increased by more than four times between 1990 and 2016. These epidemics are exacerbated by the decline in public health programmes, such as childhood immunisation, insufficient potable water, and poor sanitation conditions.\n\n【2】In 2018, 82% of people in Venezuela (about 28·5 million people) and 75% of health centres around the country did not have a continuous supply of water, according to a report on the right to water published by five Venezuelan non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Running water is provided sporadically (in some areas this can be once every 20 days) and the water that does reach the population is of poor quality or not potable. To aggravate the situation, shortages of electricity have been recurrently reported over more than 3 months and have culminated in a widespread blackout between March 7 and March 11, leaving homes and hospitals in the dark. Failures in the electricity supply system were reported as causing the death of 79 patients between Nov 16, 2018, and Feb 9, 2019, in the 40 main hospitals of the country. These data are from a national survey , _Encuesta Nacional de los Hospitales 2019_ which also notes that 1557 patients died because of insufficient hospital supplies. The medical NGO that published these data explained that these are conservative estimates as many deaths are not reported.\n\n【3】In the meantime, hyperinflation (estimated by the International Monetary Fund to be at 10 million % in 2019) puts the cost of daily food out of reach for nine in ten Venezuelans, according to the ENCOVI (Living Conditions survey) 2017. The food crisis is further exacerbated by absence of food diversity and collapse of food infrastructure (production, distribution, and access to food). As a result, between 2016 and 2018, the proportion of the population that is undernourished increased from 5% to 12%, according to a report on the right to food published by three Venezuelan NGOs. Poor nutrition between conception and 2 years of age is threatening the physical, mental, and social development of new generations. Venezuela is the only country in Latin America showing a deterioration in child survival back to the levels of the 1990s. According to estimates in a recent study in _The Lancet Global Health_ , the infant mortality rate reached 21·1 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2016, almost 40% higher than in 2008.\n\n【4】Vowing to improve the situation, on March 1, the UN security council voted on two resolutions related to Venezuela but failed to pass either of them because the USA, Russia, and China clashed over the issue. The USA recognises Juan Guaido, leader of the National Assembly, as the country's president, whereas China and Russia continue to recognise Nicolás Maduro as leader of the country. While the divisive debate regarding last year's disputed presidential elections continues to rage, Venezuela is struggling with hunger and preventable diseases.\n\n【5】As we went to press, a UN team was visiting the country on an official human rights mission following a surprising invitation from Maduro, who has been reluctant to accept humanitarian aid. There is hope that Maduro will be transparent with the UN team and allow them to observe the true complexity of the situation. The UN human rights team is also scheduled to speak with members of Guaido's party. Whatever the outcome of the UN's mission, the urgent implementation of effective measures to facilitate the coordinated international response to the Venezuelans' plight cannot come soon enough. The right to health and to food cannot be politicised and the international community is failing if these universal rights are not restored in Venezuela.\n\n【6】删除1-1:<u>For the Encuesta Nacional de los Hospitales **2019** see https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/0f3ae5\\_20a71632b12b4924bcee0e06e659361d.pdf</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2019 Luis Robayo/Getty Images</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 23 March 2019\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)30729-9</u>\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace and early childhood development and evaluate the extent to which this association is mediated by reductions in traffic-related air pollution and noise.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This population-based birth cohort study comprised singleton births in Metro Vancouver, BC, Canada, between April 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2005. Children and mothers had to be registered with the mandatory provincial health insurance programme, Medical Services Plan, and have lived within the study area from the child's birth to the time of outcome assessment. Early childhood development was assessed via teacher ratings on the Early Development Instrument (EDI), and we used the total EDI score as the primary outcome variable. We estimated greenspace using percentage vegetation derived from spectral unmixing of annual Landsat satellite image composites. Lifetime residential exposure to greenspace was estimated as the mean of annual percentage vegetation values within 250 m of participants’ residential postal codes. Multilevel modelling, adjusted for eight covariates, was used to investigate associations between greenspace exposure and EDI scores. We estimated the mediation effects of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), fine particulate matter (PM 2·5 ), and noise levels using causal mediation analyses.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of the 37 745 children born in Metro Vancouver between April 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2005, 27 372 were included in our final study sample. In the adjusted model, 1 IQR increase in percentage vegetation was associated with a 0·16 (95% CI 0·04–0·28; p=0·0073) increase in total EDI score, indicating small improvements in early childhood development. We estimated that 97·1% (95% CI 43·0–396·0), 29·5% (12·0–117·0), and 35·2% (17·9–139·0) of the association was mediated through reductions in NO 2 , PM 2·5 , and noise, respectively.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Increased exposure to residential greenspace might improve childhood development by reducing the adverse developmental effects of traffic-related exposures, especially NO 2 air pollution. Our study supports the implementation of healthy urban planning and green infrastructure interventions.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Canadian Institutes of Health Research.\n\n【10】</u>Introduction\n------------\n\n【11】Growing evidence suggests that exposure to greenspace, such as forests, street trees, parks, and gardens, has a positive effect on early childhood development. Exposure to greenspace is associated with better wellbeing; reduced behavioural problems; fewer symptoms, and a decreased incidence of, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder; and improvements in attention and working memory in children. Studies have also shown positive associations between exposure to greenspace surrounding schools and academic performance in reading, writing, and mathematics.\n\n【12】Several pathways have been proposed to explain the association of exposure to greenspace with childhood development, including increased physical activity, enhanced mental restoration, and improved social cohesion. The beneficial effects of greenspace on development might also accrue through the ability of vegetation to reduce levels of air pollution and noise via, for example, direct removal, distance buffering, or source emission reductions. Vegetation-related reductions in exposure to air pollution and noise might support improved childhood health and development through subsequent reductions in the adverse health effects associated with early life exposure to these harmful environmental factors, including impairments in brain function and cognitive development. Exposure to air pollution and noise might adversely affect childhood health and development through, for instance, increased stress, sleep disturbance, and CNS damage via inflammation and oxidative stress. \n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【15】We searched Web of Science, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO without language restrictions for articles published between database inception and Feb 11, 2021, using the search terms: (green space? or greenspace? or green?ess) and (child\\*) and (health or development\\*) and (air pollution or noise). We also searched the reference lists of previous articles and reviews on this subject identified in our datatabase search. We included experimental and observational studies that investigated the effects of greenspace exposure on early childhood development or the associations between greenspace exposure and early childhood development (eg, using cognitive, socioemotional, behavioural, or academic measures) and assessed the potential mediation effects of air pollution, noise, or both. We limited our search to peer-reviewed publications that involved participants younger than 12 years and were based on quantitative analyses. We found seven studies examining the mediation effects of harmful exposures on associations between greenspace and childhood developmental outcomes. All seven studies analysed the mediation effects of air pollution, and only one study evaluated the mediation effects of noise. Most studies included children older than 6 years and assessed the mediation effects of a single harmful exposure. Available literature was limited by the use of single year estimates of residential greenspace exposure rather than time-varying cumulative estimates that accounted for residential mobility.\n\n【16】**Added value of this study**\n\n【17】We found that higher levels of lifetime residential exposure to greenspace were associated with an increased ability to meet age-appropriate developmental expectations in kindergarten, as measured by the Early Development Instrument. This positive association was partially mediated through reductions in nitrogen dioxide, fine particulate matter, and noise levels. Compared with previous studies, the strengths of our research included the use of a large, population-based birth cohort and the assessment of the mediation effects of both traffic-related air pollution and noise exposure. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we are the first to use a novel greenness metric that more accurately quantifies urban vegetation than does commonly used vegetation metrics (eg, the normalised difference vegetation index).\n\n【18】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【19】Lifelong exposure to local greenspace might promote healthy childhood development, in part, by reducing the adverse developmental effects of harmful environmental exposures. Researchers, urban planners, and public health professionals should work together to develop policies and interventions that increase the availability of greenspace to support optimal childhood development, which could have potential health benefits across the life course.\n\n【20】Although most previous studies suggest the existence of positive associations between greenspace exposure and childhood development, the results have been inconsistent. Moreover, few studies have investigated the underlying pathways linking greenspace and developmental outcomes among children. Some research suggests that the positive effect of greenspace is due to reduced exposure to traffic-related air pollution, but few studies have analysed similar underlying mechanisms related to reduced exposure to noise.\n\n【21】Therefore, we aimed to investigate associations between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace and early childhood development in a large population-based birth cohort. In addition, we aimed to evaluate whether the effects of greenspace exposure on childhood development are mediated through reduced exposure to traffic-related air pollution and noise.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Study design and participants\n\n【24】This population-based birth cohort study was done in Metro Vancouver, southwestern BC, Canada. Metro Vancouver is the third largest metropolitan area in Canada, comprising more than 2·5 million residents. The region spans 2883 km 2 and has a population density of approximately 855 people per km 2 . The area is characterised by diverse land use types, including densely built areas, low-density suburban areas, and agricultural lands.\n\n【25】The study cohort was identified by use of administrative data from the British Columbia Ministry of Health, the British Columbia Vital Statistics Agency, Perinatal Services British Columbia, and the Human Early Learning Partnership. Individual-level data linkage was completed by Population Data British Columbia by use of a probabilistic-deterministic linkage approach. The cohort comprised singleton births in Metro Vancouver between April 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2005. Participants (mean age 5·6 years, range 4·88–6·99, SD 0·29.) attended kindergarten (preschool) between the school years 2005–06 and 2010–11. To be eligible, children and their mothers had to be registered with the mandatory provincial health insurance programme, Medical Services Plan, and have lived within the study area for the duration of the exposure period. The exposure period was from birth to the time of outcome assessment. Ethics approval for this study was granted by the University of British Columbia Behavioral Research Ethics Board (certificate H18–00908).\n\n【26】### Procedures\n\n【27】We analysed early childhood development using data sourced from the Early Development Instrument (EDI), a population-level tool assessing children's development in kindergarten. Kindergarten teachers complete the EDI for each child in their class in February on the basis of classroom observations in the previous 6 months. The EDI consists of demographic information and 103 binary and Likert scale items assessing children's ability to meet age-appropriate developmental expectations in five domains: (1) physical health and wellbeing; (2) social competence; (3) emotional maturity; (4) language and cognitive development; and (5) communication skills and general knowledge. For each of the five domains, a child receives a domain score, calculated as the mean across all items in a domain, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Children also receive a total EDI score, calculated as the sum of the domain scores, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 50 (highest). For our study, we assessed childhood development using total EDI scores as the primary outcome variable and mean score for the language and cognitive development domain. The language and cognitive development domain score, which captures children's acquisition of literacy, numeracy, and memory skills, was included as a secondary outcome variable as we hypothesised that this domain would be the most helpful in examining the potential mediation effects of harmful exposures on the association between greenspace exposure and childhood development, given the adverse effects of traffic-related air pollution and noise exposure on childhood cognition. \n\n【28】We selected all potential confounders of the association between greenspace exposure and childhood development a priori using a directed acyclic graph. Individual-level covariates for children's sex (male or female), season of birth (January–March as winter; April–June as spring; July–September as summer; and October–December as autumn), and lone-parent household at the time of birth (yes or no) were obtained from the British Columbia Perinatal Data Registry . Information on a child's English as a second language status (yes or no) recorded in the EDI was acquired from the Human Early Learning Partnership. Maternal age (<25 years, 25–40 years, or >40 years) at the time of the child's birth was accessed via the British Columbia Vital Statistics Agency. Health practitioner premium subsidy codes recorded in the Medical Services Plan , which indicate the rate of health insurance premium subsidy provided by British Columbia province, were used as a proxy of low household income. In line with previous research, we created a binary variable (no subsidy or subsidy) to indicate whether a child received a subsidised Medical Services Plan for their earliest recorded health practitioner visit.\n\n【29】Neighbourhood-level socioeconomic status was assessed by use of the material deprivation dimension of the 2006 Canadian Marginalization Index. The material deprivation dimension indicates education, employment, income, and family structure measures within dissemination areas, which are small, relatively stable geographical units composed of 400–700 people. Material deprivation values were assigned to participants by use of six-digit postal codes, with higher values corresponding to areas of greater marginalisation. Neighbourhood-level urbanicity (urban _vs_ rural or rural–urban fringe), geocoded to six-digit postal codes , was derived from Statistics Canada British Columbia Perinatal Data Registry. Neighbourhoods are classified as urban if they are located in regions in which the surrounding census metropolitan area has a population of at least 50 000 individuals. Rural-urban fringe includes small urban areas not contiguous with the urban core, while rural is all area not defined as urban core or rural-urban fringe.\n\n【30】Environmental exposure variables (ie, greenspace, nitrogen dioxide \\[NO 2 \\], fine particulate matter \\[PM 2·5 \\], and noise) were assigned to individuals by use of six-digit residential postal codes recorded in the health-care system that were summarised on an annual basis. The six-digit postal code is a common spatial unit applied in Canadian epidemiological studies and generally corresponds to a side of a street block in urban areas. For each exposure variable, a time-weighted cumulative lifetime estimate was calculated by finding the mean annual values over the exposure period (from birth to the time of EDI assessment), while accounting for participants changing their residential address. Residential mobility was defined as any changes in the child's recorded six-digit postal code across the exposure period. Exposure estimates were linked to all outcome variables and covariates at the six-digit postal code level.\n\n【31】To estimate residential greenspace, we used a novel Landsat greenness time series 删除2:<u>( figure )</u>. Details of the metric have been described elsewhere. In brief, annual Landsat satellite image composites (with a 30 m spatial resolution) spanning the summer growing period of 1984–2016 were used to identify three spectral attributes of physical features per pixel in the study dataset: vegetation (ie, green vegetation), high albedo (eg, impervious surfaces), and dark (eg, shadows cast by objects, such as buildings). By use of the three spectral attributes, a sub-pixel linear spectral unmixing algorithm was applied to each year and the annual percentage of each spectral attribute per pixel in the study area was extracted. In our study, we used the annual percentage of the vegetation attribute per pixel to represent greenspace for each year of the study period, corresponding from birth to time of EDI assessment. Residential exposure to greenspace was calculated as the mean percentage vegetation value within a 250 m buffer surrounding participants’ six-digit postal code centroid. We selected a buffer size of 250 m to serve as a proxy for exposure within a walkable distance from home, assuming that, before entering elementary (primary) school (children typically aged 5 years to 12 years), children would be spending most of their time at or within close proximity of their residence.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure Greenspace in Metro Vancouver, BC, Canada</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【32】Greenspace was estimated via linear spectral unmixing of annual Landsat satellite image composites (with a 30 m spatial resolution).

A regional land use regression model (adjusted _R_ 2 \\=0·84 and root mean square error=1·59 parts per billion) was applied to estimate residential exposure to NO 2 . Details on the measurements and geospatial predictors are provided elsewhere. The land use regression model was developed by use of a mixed effects deletion–substitution–addition machine learning algorithm that incorporates air pollutant measurements from 128 monitoring locations and geospatial predictor variables, including elevation, meteorological conditions, distance to and the length of roadways, and land use 删除2:<u>( appendix p 1 )</u>. Estimates of residential exposure to PM 2·5 were provided by the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE) and were estimated by use of a national land use regression model. Ground-level PM 2·5 was estimated by combining an optimal estimate-based aerosol optical depth retrieval at a resolution of 0·01° × 0·01° with aerosol vertical profile and scattering properties. To adjust for residual bias in PM 2·5 estimates, geographically weighted regression that incorporated ground-based observations was applied.\n\n【34】Residential exposure to community noise was estimated by use of a deterministic noise prediction model. Details of the noise model are presented elsewhere. In brief, annual day–evening–night (whole day) A-weighted equivalent noise levels (L den ) in dB(A) were estimated by use of predictors such as street and rail layout, road type, traffic volume, railway frequency, aircraft forecasts, topography, and building heights and footprint. The community noise metric applied a weight to evening (5 dB(A)-weighting) and night (10 dB(A)-weighting) noise levels to reflect individuals’ increased sensitivity to noise levels during these times relative to during the day. Annual mean A-weighted noise levels were calculated for a 10 m × 10 m grid and then mean for each six-digit postal code polygon area.\n\n【35】### Statistical analysis\n\n【36】Because of the nested nature of the data (ie, children were grouped in schools and rated by their kindergarten teachers), we used multilevel regression models, with the total EDI score and the EDI score for language and cognitive development as outcomes, residential exposure to greenspace as a fixed effect, and teacher as a random effect. We tested for residual independence with Moran's _I_ statistic and found no evidence of spatial autocorrelation, so spatial dependence was not formally included in our statistical analyses. We estimated the change in outcome scores associated with 1 IQR increase in lifetime mean percentage vegetation. The IQR was deemed an appropriate unit, as it closely approximated the SD and is in alignment with previously published environmental health literature. We tested multicollinearity among the covariates with generalised variance-inflation factors. With the largest generalised variance-inflation factor of 1·123, we found little evidence of multicollinearity; therefore, we controlled for all eight covariates (ie, sex, birth season, lone-parent household, English as a second language, maternal age, Medical Services Plan subsidy status, material deprivation, and urbanicity) in adjusted models. Respondents with missing or invalid data for any of the outcome, exposure, or confounder variables were excluded from the study sample. We tested for potential differences in estimated effects depending on a child's sex and socioeconomic status (proxied by Medical Services Plan subsidy status) through interaction terms and stratified analyses.\n\n【37】We used a causal mediation analysis framework to evaluate whether decreased levels of traffic-related air pollution and noise are possible pathways underlying associations between residential exposure to greenspace and childhood development. We specified NO 2 , PM 2·5 , and noise as mediators in the greenspace–health association and, therefore, assumed a causal relation between residential greenspace and levels of air pollution and noise. The mediating effects were estimated separately for each exposure by use of the mediation package in R. For each mediation model, we estimated the mean total effect, the mean direct effect of greenspace, and the mean mediated effect of the mediator. In addition, we estimated the percentage of the total association between residential exposure to greenspace and childhood development explained by the mediator. Mediator and outcome models controlled for all eight covariates and included teacher as a random effect. We used 1000 bootstrap simulations to obtain 95% CIs. We reported changes in outcomes associated with one IQR increase in the environmental exposure.\n\n【38】Although we hypothesised that the language and cognitive development domain would be the strongest domain to investigate mediation effects, we ran complementary post-hoc analyses evaluating associations between residential greenspace exposure and the scores of the five EDI domains separately to evaluate the consistency of results across all dimensions of early childhood development. We also did prespecified sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the findings to different measures of the outcomes and the exposures. First, we analysed associations between residential greenspace exposure and EDI scores with multilevel logistic regression by dichotomising outcomes to reflect developmental vulnerability (not vulnerable _vs_ vulnerable). Using standardised approaches, children were considered vulnerable in language and cognitive development if their score in this domain was in the bottom 10th percentile of a provincial distribution; they were considered vulnerable in their overall EDI score if any of their five domain scores were within the bottom 10th percentile. Second, we repeated the main analyses with lifetime residential greenspace exposure calculated as the mean of annual percentage vegetation within 100 m and 500 m buffer zones. Finally, we repeated the main analyses with lifetime residential greenspace exposure estimated as the mean of annual mean normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) values within 100 m, 250 m, and 500 m buffers. NDVI values were provided by the CANUE, and were derived from Landsat (with a 30 m spatial resolution) and Planet Scope (with a 3 m spatial resolution) satellite images. All analyses were done in R, version 4.0.3. We considered p<0·05 as statistically significant.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【39】The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.\n\n【40】</u>Results\n-------\n\n【41】Between April 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2005, 37 745 children were born in Metro Vancouver, of whom 27 372 were included in our final study sample 删除2:<u>( appendix p 2 )</u>.

Specifically, we observed that an IQR increase in percentage vegetation within 250 m buffers around postal codes was associated with an increase of 0·16 in total EDI score. This association was partially mediated by reductions in NO 2 , PM 2·5 , and noise that explained 97·1%, 29·5%, and 35·2% of the estimated associations between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace and total EDI scores, respectively. We did not observe any association between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace and language and cognitive development domain scores.\n\n【53】Our finding of a weak positive association between greenspace exposure and early childhood development is consistent with previous research that reports that sociodemographic factors are more important in explaining variation in EDI outcomes across children than are aspects of the physical environment. Although our estimated effect of greenspace exposure on EDI scores is small, our findings agree with studies that indicate a positive influence of greenspace on child development outcomes. Previous research has shown that exposure to residential greenspace is associated with better intellectual, behavioural, and psychomotor development among children, and access to neighbourhood greenspace is associated with a reduced odds of childhood social vulnerability. Studies also indicate that access to greenness might reduce behavioural problems in children.\n\n【54】We did not observe any associations between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace and the language and cognitive development domain score, which captures children's acquisition of literacy, numeracy, and memory skills. This finding is inconsistent with previous research that indicates that greenspace exposure is positively associated with aspects of childhood cognition, including attention, working memory, and academic performance. Our null association might in part be due to our outcome metric, which, by contrast to previous work that primarily used measured responses on tasks (eg, test scores), captured teacher ratings on children's skills in cognitive activities. Furthermore, most studies on cognitive outcomes conducted analyses on samples that included children aged at least 6 years, so it could be that associations between greenspace exposure and childhood cognition are stronger in later childhood. Alternatively, our null findings might be attributable to our estimate of greenspace exposure, which differed from most previous research in that it used a more sensitive measure of urban vegetation and captured lifetime exposure. Moreover, we estimated greenspace exposure surrounding children's postal codes rather than around other potentially important environments, such as childcare and school locations.\n\n【55】Results from our mediation analyses suggest that the observed association between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace and total EDI score was partially mediated through reductions in NO 2 , PM 2·5 , and noise exposure levels. Very few studies have estimated the mediation effect of air pollution in associations between greenspace exposure and childhood development, and, to our knowledge, only one study has evaluated the mediating role of noise. Our findings are consistent with those of Dadvand and colleagues, who reported that indoor concentrations of elemental carbon explained 20–65% of associations between greenspace exposure and 12-month progress in cognitive functions among schoolchildren, and with those of Asta and colleagues, who reported that reductions in NO 2 concentrations accounted for 7–62% of associations between residential greenness and arithmetic test scores among 7-year-old children. Similarly, Liao and colleagues reported that reductions in PM 2·5 concentrations explained 13·6–28·1% of the association between greenspace exposure and neurodevelopment at 24 months of age. Previous studies have also suggested a potential mediation effect of air pollution on associations between greenspace exposure and childhood neurobehavioural health, motor development, and the rates of psychiatric disorders. Our findings on noise are consistent with a study in Belgium that reported noise as a partial mediator in associations between natural landscapes and children's emotional state. Although our estimates of mediation by PM 2·5 and noise are within similar ranges to previous studies, our estimated mediation effect of NO 2 is higher. This finding might, in part, be attributable to the reduced misclassification of the exposure associated with our use of NO 2 exposure values estimated from high-quality, temporally aligned data. Moreover, by contrast with previous studies, we used a life course approach to estimate exposure from birth to the time of the EDI assessment. Nearly all NO 2 in Metro Vancouver is locally derived via transportation sources, as there is little industry and no combustion power plants are within the region; thus, NO 2 concentrations are strongly linked to local road networks that are inversely correlated with greenspace. Sources of NO 2 emissions and subsequent correlations with greenspace might differ in other geographical contexts.\n\n【56】We found that harmful exposures were not equal in their mediation effects on the association between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace and total EDI score, with the strongest mediation effect found for NO 2 air pollution. Exposure levels of air pollution and noise are probably lower in areas with greater vegetation than in areas with less vegetation, in part, because of the paucity of air pollution-emitting and noise-emitting sources in these locations, direct removal (eg, deposition), and buffering (eg, a barrier to dispersion). The mediation effects of NO 2 might be greater than those of PM 2·5 given that concentrations of NO 2 are more spatially variable than those of PM 2·5 ; the same might be true for noise. Differences in the mediation effects of NO 2 and PM 2·5 might also be attributable to the varying capacity of vegetation to remove each air pollutant; however, research to support this assumption has been inconclusive. The relatively small mediation effect size for noise might be partly due to our greenness metric, which did not offer information on vegetation characteristics that are important for noise attenuation, including composition, structure, and distance from a source.\n\n【57】Our study has several strengths. First, we used a large population-based cohort to examine the association between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace (from birth to kindergarten) and childhood development, accounting for residential mobility. Most previous research has adopted cross-sectional study designs with smaller sample sizes. Second, we addressed important gaps in the literature by estimating the mediating effects of traffic-related air pollution and noise on associations between greenspace exposure and childhood development. Third, we used high-quality exposure data and estimated residential greenspace using a novel metric that previous research has shown to be a more sensitive measure of vegetation than commonly used greenness metrics (eg, the NDVI), particularly in urban settings. Finally, to our knowledge, this epidemiological study is the first to examine the association between residential greenspace and childhood development as measured by the EDI. Several studies have documented the EDI's validity and reliability. \n\n【58】Despite these strengths, we acknowledge several limitations. First, because administrative data are not generally collected for research purposes, the absence of individual-level variables might have led to residual confounding. To address this limitation, we used all available variables to operationalise constructs for which we did not have direct measures (eg, Medical Services Plan subsidy status as a proxy for household income). Due to a high proportion of missing values, we were unable to account for other potentially important risk factors (eg, maternal education, smoking, alcohol consumption, and substance use). Second, because of the absence of longitudinal data on the EDI outcomes, some portion of the observed effects could be the result of residential self-selection of higher income families into greener neighbourhoods. Third, we specified air pollution and noise as mediators of the greenspace–health association, assuming a causal relation. Although there is supportive evidence for this assumption, we acknowledge that the effect of greenspace on harmful exposures might not be causal and, as such, air pollution and noise might be more appropriately classified as confounders of greenspace–health relations. Fourth, environmental exposures were assigned to postal codes, probably resulting in some exposure misclassification associated with spatial discrepancies between participants’ postal codes and their true residential locations; however, the error is probably minimal given the small size of urban postal codes. Additionally, referencing exposure to children's residential postal codes might not accurately reflect the activity spaces of children and the environments in which health effects are most likely to accrue. Future research should also consider exposure outside the home, including in childcare and school locations. Moreover, our estimates of greenspace exposure did not account for the type, quality, or use of greenspace, which might be important factors in understanding the associations between nature and health. Fifth, although the validity and reliability of the teacher-rated EDI has been shown in numerous studies, our study should be replicated using other measures of children's developmental outcomes, including objective and parent-reported measures. Finally, our sample largely comprised of children from multiparent households, who did not receive a subsidised Medical Services Plan, and who resided in urban areas. Moreover, Metro Vancouver is a region with high proportions of vegetation cover and low concentrations of air pollution. As such, our findings might not be generalisable to other sociodemographic groups or geographical contexts.\n\n【59】In this population-based birth cohort, we found evidence for a weak positive association between lifetime residential exposure to greenspace and early childhood development. These positive associations were partially mediated by reductions in traffic-related air pollution and noise exposure levels, and particularly NO 2 air pollution. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings, which, if replicated, could have important implications for urban planning and green infrastructure interventions that support childhood health and development across the life course.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n\n【60】MvdB conceived the original research idea and study design, acquired funding, and was responsible for project administration.

Indications for surgery in patients with bone metastases are controversial. We aimed to assess a protocol for the surgery of patients with lung cancer and bone metastases.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We developed a surgical protocol for both spinal and appendicular metastases. According to the aim of surgery, eligible patients were placed into four classes (class 1: solitary metastatic bone lesion; class 2: spinal cord compression or pathological fracture; class 3: impending fracture; and class 4: severe pain after medical treatment or radiation). We assessed mobility and neurological functions 1 day before and 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after surgery with the visual analog scale for pain (VAS; scale 1–10), Karnofsky performance status scale (KPS), mobility scale with a score of 0 representing no limitation, a score of 1 representing limitation without the need for orthopaedic aids, a score of 2 representing limitation necessitating orthopaedic aids, and a score of 3 representing bedridden operative technique. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to calculate survival. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Sixth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Written informed consent was provided by the patient or their legal guardian.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between Jan 1, 2005 and Jan 1, 2014, 134 patients underwent surgery (49 spine lesions and 86 appendicular skeleton lesions; one patient was operated in both lumbar and pelvis). VAS decreased after surgery (mean score 6·58 \\[SD 1·12\\] before _vs_ 5·33 \\[1·38\\] at 1 week, 4·39 \\[1·35\\] at 1 month, 3·71 \\[1·29\\] at 3 months, and 3·99 \\[1·02\\] at 6 months, all p<0·0001 _vs_ baseline). KPS and mobility scale scores were decreased 1 week after surgery (KPS 69·2 \\[SD 8·8\\] _vs_ 65·4 \\[9·1\\], p=0·0012; mobility scale score (0/1/2/3) 32/47/34/21 _vs_ 19/43/48/23, p<0·0001), and returned to preoperative levels at 1 month for appendicular surgery (KPS 67·2 \\[10·1\\] and mobility 21/34/19/11) or 3 months for spinal surgery (KPS 70·8 \\[11·7\\] and mobility 21/13/11/4). Mobility scale scores increased at 3 months and 6 months after surgery (48/46/26/12 at 3 months, p<0·0001; 54/39/21/6 at 6 months, p<0·0001). Frankel classification in patients with spinal metastases also improved at 3 months and 6 months after surgery (D/C/B/A from 17/5/3/4 to 12/4/3/2 and 19/0/0/1; p=0·0234 and p=0·0114), as did Musculo-Skeletal Tumor Society rating scale (MSTS) scores in patients with appendicular metastases (from 14·8 \\[6·1\\] 1 week after surgery to 20·3 \\[5·8\\] at 1 month, 24·1 \\[4·3\\] at 3 months, and 22·6 \\[5·5\\] at 6 months; all p<0·05 _vs_ 1 week postoperative). The amounts of blood loss in spinal surgery were larger than appendicular surgery (mean 1620 mL \\[SD 1078\\] _vs_ 571 mL 删除3:<u>\\[775\\]</u>; p<0·0001). Median overall survival time after surgery was 13·5 months \\[SD 0·8\\]. Survival time in the group aimed at radical cure (Class 1: 27·0 months \\[3·5\\]) was significantly longer than the other three group (Class 2: 12·6 months \\[1·0\\]; Class 3: 13·1 months \\[1·0\\]; Class 4: 9·6 months \\[0·7\\]; p<0·0001).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Appropriate surgery provides pain relief, improvement of quality-of-life, and increased neurological function with an acceptably low rate of complications. Our protocol enabled physicians to identify patients with lung cancer and bone metastases who might be candidates for radical surgery.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Natural Science Foundation of China Grant (81201628).\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>\n\n【11】**Declaration of interests**\n\n【12】WZ, ZR, and WS collected the data.

Since macrophages have a crucial role in synovitis, PET targeted to translocator protein (TSPO), a mitochondrial protein upregulated in macrophages, is postulated to be a sensitive and specific means of imaging synovitis. We aimed to ascertain whether the TSPO tracer \\[ 11 C\\]PBR28 can detect and quantify synovitis in a proof-of-principle study.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Ten participants with clinical evidence of synovitis in one or both knees (five with rheumatoid arthritis, five with psoriatic arthritis), and four age-matched healthy volunteers, were included. Patients underwent clinical examination, ultrasound scanning, and PET-CT of both knees, as well as synovial biopsy of one knee over 10 days, in addition to routine blood tests. Synovial tissue from biopsy was stained for TSPO, and for the macrophage markers CD68 and CD163, and scored semiquantitatively. All knees were scored according to semiquantitative synovitis severity scores on clinical examination and ultrasound by two independent assessors.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】A significant difference was observed between average tracer uptake in knees of different synovitis severity scores on both clinical examination and ultrasound (p<0·0001, ANOVA); knees with lowest synovitis scores on examination or ultrasonography had the least tracer uptake, and those with highest synovitis scores had the most tracer uptake. TSPO staining score on histology likewise positively correlated with tracer uptake from the biopsy compartment ( _r_ \\=0·67, p=0·02). A positive correlation was observed between C-reactive protein and average tracer uptake in both knees ( _r_ \\=0·81, p=0·03).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】To our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate that \\[ 11 C\\]PBR28 PET can detect and quantify synovitis in patients with arthritis. The correlation between TSPO staining and tracer uptake implies that tracer uptake is the result of target expression and not due to confounding factors such as blood flow, but awaits confirmation with an in-vivo blocking study. Larger studies with \\[ 11 C\\]PBR28 before and after initiation of therapy will help ascertain its sensitivity as a tool for assessing response to treatment for inflammatory arthritis.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Imanova Academic Centre for Imaging Sciences (IMPETUS grant).\n\n【10】Poster 74\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【11】NN designed all aspects of the study (from study protocol to management and carrying out all ethics approval processes), was responsible for recruitment, was the study doctor for all visits, was responsible for taking biopsy samples from patients with arthritis, conducted all experiments, performed statistical analysis, and wrote the abstract.
