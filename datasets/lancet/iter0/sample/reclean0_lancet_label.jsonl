The headache had begun suddenly at the top of her forehead, before radiating, then moving, to the back of her head. When the headache started, the patient had seen “lightning bolts”, then lost the vision in her right eye for several seconds; her vision had since been blurred, with diplopia. She had also been feeling sick and vomiting. She had previously felt well. There was no recent head injury or strenuous activity. She was not drowsy. She did not take any medications, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Her medical history was notable only for migraine—she had five to six episodes per year, each lasting about 12 h. Although her migraines manifested as headache, blurred vision, and nausea, this episode felt very different, since the symptoms were more severe and were accompanied by neck pain and diplopia.\n\n【1】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

Wilcox and colleagues' study provides intriguing evidence that use of disinfectants with insufficient efficacy to _C difficile_ might actually increase opportunities for spread and persistence of _C difficile_ strains in the hospital environment.\n\n【3】As Wilcox and colleagues state, the hospital environment is closely implicated in the spread of _C difficile_ infection, and tube feeding is seen as a risk factor mainly through contamination with _C difficile_ during routine manipulation of the tube-feeding system. In our department, we have recommended a chlorine-based cleaning agent (Milton, Kyorin, Tokyo) as a disinfectant for feeding tubes, and the tube-fed patients in our department always wash the feeding tubes with this cleaning agent before intubation. However, we found that _C difficile_ toxin was very frequently detected by latex agglutination immunoassay and PCR in the faeces of patients undergoing elemental diet therapy, who were taking no antibiotics. _C difficile_ toxin was detected in 41·2% (seven of 17 cases), which was significantly higher than the rate among patients with diarrhoea in our hospital (5·12%), and among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (13·4%). Of seven patients (six men, one woman, average age 35·6 years), positive for faecal _C difficile_ one was non-tube fed and six were tube fed; five had Crohn's disease and two indeterminate intestinal ulcer cases, but detection of _C difficile_ toxin did not correlate with disease activity. _C difficile_ toxin disappeared soon after elemental diet therapy was stopped.\n\n【4】These observations prompted us to clarify whether elemental diet promotes the proliferation of _C difficile_ . We first proved that the toxigenic _C difficile_ strain (ATCC 9689) proliferated significantly when this strain was cultured in the medium-containing elemental diet (p=0·0163, figure ).\n\n【5】Figure Proliferation rate of _C difficile_ in culture medium\n\n【6】Show full caption\n\n【7】Vertical bar=SE at time of peak optical density.\n\n【8】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【9】We suggest that a high concentration of some aminoacids (leucine, isoleucine, &c), which are necessary for growth of _C difficile_ , and lack of short-chain fatty acids and fermentable fibres, which prevent growth and toxin elaboration of _C difficile_ , are associated with the function of elemental diet to proliferate _C difficile_ significantly. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> We believe that tube feeding with elemental diet can be a risk factor for acquisition and proliferation of C difficile, even though chlorine-based cleaning agents are used to disinfect feeding tubes, and, therefore, antibiotics should be administered to such patients with much care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The disease can affect about 20% of such patients and is characterised clinically by increased serum bilirubin concentrations, tender hepatomegaly, fluid retention, and weight gain. Liver injury occurs early after transplantation and results in occluded venules, sinusoidal fibrosis, and hepatocyte necrosis. Veno-occlusive disease is caused by toxins in some conditioning regimens and thus the reported incidence varies with the composition and intensity of the conditioning regimen, from zero after most reduced-intensity regimens to about 50% after ablative conditioning. Only a few prospective studies have suggested a benefit for the prophylactic use of drugs such as heparin, prostaglandin E1, pentoxifylline, or ursodeoxycholic acid. Therefore, the evidence base for veno-occlusive disease prophylaxis is insubstantial, although heparin (100 U/kg per day) and ursodeoxycholic acid are widely used in transplantation centres worldwide.\n\n【1】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

The effect of outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatments on COVID-19 outcomes among patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease is unclear. We aimed to evaluate temporal trends, severe outcomes, and COVID-19 rebound among patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease and COVID-19 who received outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment compared with those who did not receive outpatient treatment.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did a retrospective cohort study at Mass General Brigham Integrated Health Care System, Boston, MA, USA. We included patients aged 18 years or older with a pre-existing systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease, who had COVID-19 onset between Jan 23 and May 30, 2022. We identified COVID-19 by positive PCR or antigen test (index date defined as the date of first positive test) and systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases using diagnosis codes and immunomodulator prescription. Outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatments were confirmed by medical record review. The primary outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalisation or death within 30 days after the index date. COVID-19 rebound was defined as documentation of a negative SARS-CoV-2 test after treatment followed by a newly positive test. The association of outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment versus no outpatient treatment with severe COVID-19 outcomes was assessed using multivariable logistic regression.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between Jan 23 and May 30, 2022, 704 patients were identified and included in our analysis (mean age 58·4 years \\[SD 15·9\\]; 536 \\[76%\\] were female and 168 \\[24%\\] were male, 590 \\[84%\\] were White and 39 \\[6%\\] were Black, and 347 \\[49%\\] had rheumatoid arthritis). Outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatments increased in frequency over calendar time (p<0·0001). A total of 426 (61%) of 704 patients received outpatient treatment (307 \\[44%\\] with nirmatrelvir–ritonavir, 105 \\[15%\\] with monoclonal antibodies, five \\[1%\\] with molnupiravir, three \\[<1%\\] with remdesivir, and six \\[1%\\] with combination treatment). There were nine (2·1%) hospitalisations or deaths among 426 patients who received outpatient treatment compared with 49 (17·6%) among 278 who did not receive outpatient treatment (odds ratio \\[adjusted for age, sex, race, comorbidities, and kidney function\\] 0·12, 95% CI 0·05–0·25). 25 (7·9%) of 318 patients who received oral outpatient treatment had documented COVID-19 rebound.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Outpatient treatment was associated with lower odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared with no outpatient treatment. These findings highlight the importance of outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment for patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease and COVID-19 and the need for further research on COVID-19 rebound.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】None.\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】Outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment options include monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, and oral medications such as nirmatrelvir–ritonavir and molnupiravir. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> For patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease, effective COVID-19 treatments are important because altered immunity and immunosuppression might affect vaccine response <sup>, </sup> and COVID-19 severity. COVID-19 rebound is a complication after treatment, characterised by recurrence of symptoms and test positivity after regimen completion. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> However, there is a paucity of data on outcomes with and without outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment among patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease and COVID-19, and on the prevalence of rebound COVID-19. The trials showing efficacy of outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatments were done before the emergence of contemporary viral variants and the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> Also, although these trials focused on people at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, people who were immunosuppressed, such as those with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease, were infrequently enrolled (eg, 0% in the nirmatrelvir–ritonavir trial and 4% in the outpatient remdesivir trial). <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> Thus, the potential benefit of outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment among patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases and immunosuppression who develop COVID-19 after vaccination and during an omicron-dominant period is unclear.\n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【15】We searched PubMed on Dec 2, 2022, for articles published from database inception to Dec 2, 2022, with no language restrictions, using the terms: ((“rheumatic” or “immunosuppressed”) AND “COVID-19” AND (“outpatient” OR “nirmatrelvir” OR “molnupiravir”) NOT ((review) OR (editorial) OR “case report”)). The search yielded 86 articles. Many of the articles pertained to vaccine response rather than SARS-CoV-2 infection. A single-centre study in 2022 investigated breakthrough COVID-19 among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who had received B-cell-depleting therapy. The authors found that outpatient treatment with monoclonal antibodies was associated with lower risk of severe COVID-19 compared with no outpatient treatment, but this analysis was performed before the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant was dominant and before oral outpatient treatment options were available. A large study in Israel using administrative data found that only 4737 (2·6%) of 180 351 patients at high risk of severe COVID-19 in early 2022 were treated with nirmatrelvir–ritonavir, and this treatment was associated with lower risk of severe COVID-19, but the study did not focus on patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease and immunosuppression. We found no studies that investigated COVID-19 rebound (recurrence of symptoms and test positivity after regimen completion) after oral outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment.\n\n【16】**Added value of this study**\n\n【17】To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to evaluate outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatments among patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease that includes oral outpatient treatment options and quantifies the prevalence of COVID-19 rebound. Even among a cohort of patients with rheumatic disease and immunosuppression who were mostly vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, outpatient treatment was associated with substantially reduced odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared with no outpatient treatment. At least 8% of patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease who received oral outpatient treatment had COVID-19 rebound.\n\n【18】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【19】These results should encourage clinicians to prescribe—and patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease and COVID-19 to seek—prompt outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment. This research provides an early estimate of the prevalence of COVID-19 rebound after oral outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment, which could be used to quantify this risk to clinicians and patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease and encourage future research.\n\n【20】We aimed to evaluate outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatments and outcomes, including COVID-19 rebound, in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases and COVID-19. First, we examined temporal trends and the proportion of patients receiving SARS-CoV-2 outpatient treatment (monoclonal antibodies, oral medications, or remdesivir). Second, we compared severe COVID-19 outcomes among patients who received outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment with those who did not receive outpatient treatment. Third, we examined the prevalence of COVID-19 rebound among patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease who received oral outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Study design and participants\n\n【23】We did a retrospective cohort study at Mass General Brigham Integrated Health Care System, Boston, MA, USA. Mass General Brigham is a multicentre health-care system that includes 14 hospitals and primary care or specialty outpatient centres. We included patients aged 18 years or older with a pre-existing systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease who had COVID-19 onset between Jan 23 and May 30, 2022. This study was approved by the Mass General Brigham Institutional Review Board. Patient informed consent was not required for this retrospective study.\n\n【24】We identified patients with COVID-19 using an electronic query of the Mass General Brigham Research Patient Data Registry, which gathers data from the electronic health record. We identified COVID-19 as a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antigen test, or a positive COVID-19 flag in the electronic health record, or both. At Mass General Brigham, a positive COVID-19 flag indicates a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and captures patients with a positive test outside of the Mass General Brigham health-care system, including home rapid antigen assay reported to health-care providers or clinics and when ordering or administering outpatient treatments. The index date was defined as the date of the first positive test or flag within the study dates.\n\n【25】From this cohort of patients with COVID-19, we identified patients who had a pre-existing systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease at onset of COVID-19. We previously described identification of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases at Mass General Brigham using administrative data for COVID-19 studies in detail, validated with a 90% positive predictive value. Briefly, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases were defined as at least two International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes ( appendix p 2 ) for a systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease within 2 years before the index date and separated by at least 30 days, and prescription of a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug within 12 months before the index date or a glucocorticoid prescription within 6 months before the index date ( appendix pp 3–4 ). Patients with osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, or crystalline arthritis only (or a combination thereof) were not included.\n\n【26】### Procedures\n\n【27】The primary exposure variable of the study was any outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment versus no outpatient treatment. The decision to prescribe or not prescribe outpatient therapy was likely to be multifactorial, reflecting both patient and health-care provider factors, which could include insurance coverage, geographical location relative to treatment availability, delays in time to notifying the health-care provider of infection, contraindications to treatment, and socioeconomic status factors contributing to access to care, among others. A single factor to determine why a patient did not receive outpatient treatment could not be identified in this retrospective observational study. Secondary exposures were specific treatments. Because we aimed to investigate oral outpatient treatment options, we only analysed a time period when these were available locally. Nirmatrelvir–ritonavir received emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration on Dec 22, 2021, for patients at high risk of severe COVID-19; molnupiravir received authorisation on Dec 23, 2021. The start of this study was on Jan 23, 2022, when these treatments were first prescribed.\n\n【28】We performed manual medical record review of all identified patients to accurately classify outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatments or verify no outpatient treatment. If a patient received more than one therapy in the outpatient setting, they were classified as having received combination treatment.\n\n【29】### Outcomes\n\n【30】The primary outcome was severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalisation or death within 30 days after the index date. This outcome was identified using an electronic query, as in previous studies. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> In a sensitivity analysis, we required that the outcome occurred at least 1 day after the index date, because some patients might have been unable to receive outpatient treatment in time to prevent hospitalisation. Also, some patients might have been incidentally found to have COVID-19 while hospitalised for other reasons and been ineligible for outpatient therapy. In another sensitivity analysis, we limited the outcomes to hospitalisations or deaths that were due to COVID-19, either primarily or as a contributor. We further quantified the number of patients who had COVID-19 pneumonia, and those who died after COVID-19.\n\n【31】Among patients who received oral outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment, we performed medical record review to identify patients who had COVID-19 rebound documented in the electronic health record. As in a previous study, COVID-19 rebound was defined as: completion of oral outpatient regimen, documentation of negative then newly positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within 7 days of regimen completion, and recurrence in COVID-19 symptoms (after improvement in most or all symptoms) within 7 days of regimen completion. Patients who had little or no improvement in symptoms throughout follow-up were not considered to have COVID-19 rebound. Patients with prolonged viral shedding without a negative test in the interim were not considered to have rebound COVID-19.\n\n【32】We classified each patient's systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease diagnosis using ICD-10 codes, as described previously. Immunomodulatory medications were identified using prescription data preceding the index date. For conventional synthetic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), we separately considered the most recent prescriptions. For CD20 inhibitors, we classified exposure if last received within 1 year before the index date, due to lengthy effects that can impact vaccine response and COVID-19 severity. <sup>, </sup> <sup>,</sup>\n\n【33】We used an electronic query to identify most covariates. Demographic factors were age, sex, race (White, Black, Asian, other, or unknown), and ethnicity (Hispanic or Latinx, or non-Hispanic). We measured area-level social deprivation using median household income by zip code area. Lifestyle factors were BMI (continuous) and smoking status (never, past, current, or missing). We calculated the Charlson Comorbidity Index from ICD-10 codes in the 1 year before the index date. We also identified individual components of the Charlson Comorbidity Index as well as interstitial lung disease, which has been previously associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation without the race multiplier. We categorised eGFR as less than 30 mL/min/1·73 m <sup>2 </sup> (severely decreased kidney function), 30 mL/min/1·73 m <sup>2 </sup> to less than 60 mL/min/1·73 m <sup>2 </sup> (moderately decreased kidney function), or 60 mL/min/1·73 m <sup>2 </sup> or greater (normal kidney function), because this affects nirmatrelvir–ritonavir dosing and eligibility.\n\n【34】COVID-19 vaccine types and dates were extracted from patients' electronic health record. Vaccination status was classified as unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, two doses of mRNA vaccine or one dose of adenovirus vaccine, or additional vaccine doses. For patients initially classified as unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, we reviewed their medical records to accurately classify vaccination status. For patients who had received vaccines, we also calculated time from last dose to the index date, because immunity wanes over time. Electronic query identified previous COVID-19 before the current episode. Medical record review determined tixagevimab–cilgavimab use.\n\n【35】### Statistical analysis\n\n【36】We plotted the total number of COVID-19 cases per calendar week in the study period and subdivided this by outpatient treatment received (nirmatrelvir–ritonavir, molnupiravir, monoclonal antibodies, remdesivir, combination treatment, or no outpatient treatment). We used the χ <sup>2 </sup> test to calculate the p value for trend of the proportion of patients who received outpatient treatment across the ordinal variable of calendar week. We reported baseline characteristics using descriptive statistics according to outpatient treatment exposure status.\n\n【37】The primary analysis compared any outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment versus no outpatient treatment for the outcome of severe COVID-19. We used an unadjusted logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for severe COVID-19. In the multivariable model, we included age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, eGFR, and race (White or non-White) as possible confounders. We used directed acyclic graphs ( appendix p 5 ) to choose these as potential confounders that might influence both the decision to prescribe outpatient treatment as well as the risk of severe COVID-19. As there were relatively few outcomes in the group who received outpatient treatment, we also performed an analysis using Poisson regression to obtain risk ratios (RRs) to negate sparse-data bias. <sup>,</sup>\n\n【38】We performed similar analyses for other comparisons of outpatient treatments for risk of severe COVID-19: nirmatrelvir–ritonavir versus no outpatient treatment, monoclonal antibodies versus no outpatient treatment, nirmatrelvir–ritonavir versus no outpatient treatment and all other treatments, monoclonal antibodies versus no outpatient treatment and all other treatments, and nirmatrelvir–ritonavir versus monoclonal antibodies. We were unable to investigate molnupiravir, outpatient remdesivir, or combination treatment use because few patients received these therapies. We also performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we only considered severe COVID-19 outcomes that occurred at least 1 day after the index date. Second, we only considered severe COVID-19 outcomes that occurred at least 1 day after the index date up to day 14. Third, we performed medical record review of all severe outcomes masked to outpatient treatment status and excluded those felt to be unrelated to COVID-19 after adjudication by two study physicians (eg, admission for labour and delivery, scheduled procedures, wound infection, and nosocomial infections after admission).\n\n【39】We also performed subgroup analyses for COVID-19 severity for the following comparisons that each had adequate sample size: any outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment versus no outpatient treatment, nirmatrelvir–ritonavir versus no outpatient treatment, and monoclonal antibodies versus no outpatient treatment. We analysed participants in subgroups by age (<65 years _vs_ ≥65 years), sex (male _vs_ female), dichotomised Charlson Comorbidity Index (0–1 _vs_ ≥2), eGFR (<30 mL/min/1·73 m <sup>2 </sup> _vs_ ≥30 mL/min/1·73 m <sup>2 </sup> ), vaccination status (unvaccinated, two mRNA vaccines or 1 adenovirus vaccine, or additional doses \\[none were partially vaccinated\\]), and time since last vaccine dose (≤6 months _vs_ \\>6 months). We reported the numbers of outcomes and total number of participants in each subgroup and multivariable ORs and 95% CIs in forest plots. We also performed subgroup analyses among patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as among patients who were receiving the most prevalent immunomodulatory medications (methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine) in our cohort.\n\n【40】For COVID-19 rebound, we reported the number of confirmed cases over the denominator of patients who received either nirmatrelvir–ritonavir, or molnupiravir (either as monotherapy or in combination with other medications, such as monoclonal antibodies).

Characteristics of patients who had COVID-19 rebound are shown in the appendix (pp 13–15 ).\n\n【88】Discussion\n----------\n\n【89】In this contemporary cohort of patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease and COVID-19, outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment with antivirals or monoclonal antibodies was associated with substantially lower odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared with no outpatient treatment. Outpatient COVID-19 treatment increased in frequency over the study period; the most common outpatient treatments were nirmatrelvir–ritonavir and monoclonal antibodies. Among patients who received oral outpatient treatment, the prevalence of COVID-19 rebound was 7·9%, which was likely to be a conservative estimate because of the requirement of electronic health record documentation. These findings highlight the importance of early outpatient treatment in this vulnerable population, even among patients who have been vaccinated, and emphasise the need to further investigate COVID-19 rebound in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease.\n\n【90】Despite advances in prevention and associated improvements in outcomes, patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease remain at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe COVID-19 outcomes, and prolonged symptom duration, especially those who are receiving B-cell-depleting therapy or who have comorbid conditions, such as interstitial lung disease. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> Although vaccination reduces risk of severe outcomes, patients with rheumatoid arthritis have increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes compared with the general population. Thus, even with improving COVID-19 outcomes, some patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease remain vulnerable to poor COVID-19 outcomes. <sup>, </sup> A large study in Israel using administrative data investigated nirmatrelvir–ritonavir use among patients at high risk of severe COVID-19 early in 2022 and found that few patients received nirmatrelvir–ritonavir, but those who did had lower risk of severe COVID-19 than those who did not receive this treatment. However, the study was not focused on patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases who were at risk of severe COVID-19 due to immunosuppression. In this context, our novel findings regarding the substantially lower odds of severe COVID-19 associated with outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment are an important reminder to clinicians to consider early outpatient treatment for patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease and COVID-19. We observed a strong association between outpatient treatment and lower risk of severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR 0·12). This result is similar to the pivotal clinical trial for nirmatrelvir–ritonavir that observed a RR of 0·11 for severe COVID-19 compared with placebo. To further evaluate the potential effect of sparse-data bias, we did a sensitivity analysis using Poisson regression and confirmed the robustness of our results. Importantly, our findings persisted across all subgroups examined, including in younger (<65 years) patients and those who remained unvaccinated during this study period characterised by predominance of the highly contagious omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants. Most patients in the outpatient treatment group in our study received nirmatrelvir–ritonavir and monoclonal antibodies; few received molnupiravir (1%), remdesivir (<1%), or combination treatment (1%). Whether similar patterns of benefit will be observed in other centres or with receipt of these less frequently used treatments requires further investigation.\n\n【91】COVID-19 rebound is characterised by re-emergence of test positivity and symptoms after completion of oral outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatments. Rebound might have societal effects related to extension of isolation along with health effects and reduced quality of life from prolonged viral infection. The exact mechanisms of COVID-19 rebound are unknown, but it might reflect incomplete viral eradication at the completion of oral treatment. People with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease have altered underlying immunity and are immunosuppressed, with some known to have prolonged viral shedding, so it is possible that patients with immunosuppression could have higher risk of COVID-19 rebound. We found that 7·9% of patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease who received oral outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatments had documented COVID-19 rebound. Because our study was retrospective, and we required documentation of recurrent positive test results and symptoms to confirm rebound cases, 7·9% is likely to be an underestimate of the true incidence of COVID-19 rebound. Notably, no patients in our study who had documented COVID-19 rebound were subsequently hospitalised, which is reassuring. Overall, this finding highlights the need for further research on COVID-19 in this vulnerable population, including prospective ascertainment of COVID-19 rebound, possible relationships with severe COVID-19 and long-COVID, and consideration of longer courses of oral treatment regimens.\n\n【92】Monoclonal antibodies were the first outpatient treatment shown to be effective in preventing severe COVID-19 among patients at high risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies might also reduce severe outcomes, and among patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease who received B-cell-depleting therapy, monoclonal antibodies might be effective, even after vaccination. <sup>, </sup> Our study adds to the literature by investigating all patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease, not only those at highest risk of severe outcomes due to B-cell depletion. Compared with no outpatient treatment, monoclonal antibodies were associated with substantially lower odds of severe COVID-19. These patients might have had high clinical suspicion to progress to severe COVID-19. Indeed, patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease who received monoclonal antibodies had more comorbidities and worse kidney function than those who did not receive outpatient treatment. Even with oral options available, many clinicians and patients might choose to receive monoclonal antibodies, due to contraindications for the use of nirmatrelvir–ritonavir or to avoid COVID-19 rebound after oral medications. In the analysis that compared nirmatrelvir–ritonavir with monoclonal antibodies, there was no significant difference between these treatments, which suggests that they might be similarly effective. Our findings were robust across many subgroups and sensitivity analyses that shortened the window for severe COVID-19 outcomes and excluded some severe outcomes that might not have been related to COVID-19 or where COVID-19 was diagnosed after hospitalisation. We had access to individual medical record data and were able to provide clinical detail on the severe COVID-19 outcomes and confirm that the majority of hospitalisations in this analysis were due to COVID-19, rather than an incidental diagnosis.\n\n【93】This study has some limitations. First, the sample was from a single geographical area with a high COVID-19 vaccination coverage, so might not be generalisable to other settings. However, we still detected significant differences in severe COVID-19 risk that might be even more pronounced in populations with lower vaccination coverage. Second, we might not have identified all COVID-19 cases, particularly in those who used home antigen tests and did not inform their health-care provider of the results. Thus, the true denominator of patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease and COVID-19 might be larger than our study reported. However, people at high risk of severe COVID-19 might be more likely to seek testing and treatment, which might have therefore biased our findings towards the null. Third, some of the severe COVID-19 outcomes might have been due to incidentally diagnosed COVID-19 from screening during hospitalisations for other reasons or could have been nosocomial infections. Our findings remained robust in a sensitivity analysis that required a time separation between the index date and outcome. Fourth, it is possible that the results might have been affected by unmeasured confounding that might include specific contraindications to nirmatrelvir–ritonavir, social determinants of health, and access to care. However, in the additional multivariable analysis that adjusted for area-level household income, the results were similar. Fifth, although the results were robust across many subgroups and sensitivity analyses, we performed many comparisons and some subgroups were small, so these results should be considered exploratory and interpreted with caution. Although we were able to detect associations, the precision of effect size estimates was low due to relatively few outcomes, resulting in wide 95% CIs, so the magnitude of the associations should be interpreted with caution. Although we attempted to correct for possible sparse-data bias by also calculating RRs for analyses in which point estimates for ORs were far from the null, this still might not have completely overcome this issue due to few outcomes in the group who received outpatient treatment. Finally, we relied on medical documentation to identify cases of COVID-19 rebound. It is possible that some patients had COVID-19 rebound and it was not documented. Therefore, we presented only descriptive results, and this estimate should be viewed as conservative.\n\n【94】In conclusion, we found that outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment was associated with reduced odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes compared with no outpatient treatment. Over time, more patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease received outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment, mostly with nirmatrelvir–ritonavir or monoclonal antibodies. The proportion of patients who received outpatient treatment who had confirmed COVID-19 rebound was at least 7·9%, a conservative estimate due to the stringent definition we used that required documentation. These findings should encourage outpatient SARS-CoV-2 treatment among patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease.\n\n【95】Contributors\n\n【96】GQ, ZSW, and JAS designed the study, were responsible for the acquisition, analysis, and interpretation of the data, and drafted and revised the manuscript.

Today most neurologists and cognitive scientists suggest that it was the human brain that evolved first, undergoing a series of changes over millions of years that led to its increased size and complexity. The mind, on the other hand, developed as a latter part of this process, providing human beings with a level of consciousness unknown in other species. Brain functions such as perception and memory come together to constitute this sense of self, shaping the way a person experiences the world and also how she projects herself into it. The mind's eye, to keep someone in mind, to mind a friend's behaviour, to mind the gap—the mind is where our awareness is as we navigate through a world both within us and without.\n\n【1】In many ways, the mind of the medieval and Renaissance years bears a striking similarity to more modern conceptions, with natural philosophers often describing it as the point of intersection between thinking and feeling capabilities. Reason, memory, and the will—all commonly located in the brain—are either part of the mind or close friends. At the same time, however, such writings also link the mind with the heart, long seen as the seat of sensation, emotion, and also the soul, and it is here that current and historical conceptions of the mind diverge. In early philosophical and medical works, “mind” and “soul” are often used interchangeably, with both signifying a form of inner life that is incorporeal and immortal. The mind in this sense is not something that arises from the body, but rather a divine force that occupies, animates, and eventually leaves it. We can see some trace of a more spiritual mind in the term psyche, a word issuing from the Greek term for soul but now more familiar in terms such as psychology.\n\n【2】Thus, while modern sciences posit that the mind is a function of the brain, in the past the brain, heart, and all other organs were regarded as instruments of an all-powerful mind. To some extent new research on “little brains” is narrowing this gap, arguing that organs such as the heart have enough neural complexity to carry out their own cognitive functions, meaning that our concept of mind could move beyond the brain and into the rest of the body. Still, in this model the mind remains fundamentally body-dependent, an idea at odds with the beliefs of our more religious forebears.\n\n【3】Article info\n------------\n\n【4】### Publication history\n\n【5】Published: 03 April 2010\n\n【6】### Identification\n\n【7】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60501-6\n\n【8】### Copyright\n\n【9】© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A recipient of the world's most prestigious award for contributing to human understanding must still do domestic chores. And they must also love. Whether or not a scientist ultimately loves their subject more than any person is another matter, but these relationships will be intimately interlinked. The domestic and intellectual life of Marie Curie is the inspiration for _Radiance_ , a new play by award-winning actor and writer Alan Alda, with Cathy Tyson in the lead role. I have long been a fan of Tyson, from the days of _Mona Lisa_ and _Band of Gold_ .\n\n【1】Marie Curie, Polish by birth, who adopted France when she discovered her sex made it impossible to continue studying in her homeland, was the first woman to be awarded a Nobel Prize. She won two prizes: the 1903 physics prize with Henri Becquerel and her husband Pierre for their work on radiation, and the 1911 prize in chemistry for the discovery of radium and polonium. Together, Marie and Pierre prepared the way for radiotherapy and nuclear power.\n\n【2】_Radiance_ starts with a green substance glowing quietly in the dark. And we are soon reminded that scientists can be both brave and foolhardy. Pierre Curie—played by Clive Moore with gravitas and depth—strapped a piece of radium to his wrist for days to reveal its harmful effects on human tissue. Marie's hands, we are told, are also damaged from her research. The play reminds us of their dedication to their work in the name of knowledge.\n\n【3】But _Radiance_ isn't just about the sacrifices the couple make for their work, but how Marie responds when faced with terrible loss. One day, Pierre is killed by a carriage when crossing the road. In her grief, Marie writes to him every day and in her fantasy he visits her. Her friend tells her she has “a talent for suffering”.\n\n【4】Marie then falls into a passionate affair with Paul Langevin, who is married. The handsome physicist, played by James Palmer, comes across as a bit of a player, getting Curie to pity him by describing his abusive wife's violence, while the scenes with his wife, Jeanne (played by Zoe Teverson), make it all feel a little less cut and dried. Jeanne takes her revenge on Marie in a very modern way, through the press. Marie is vilified by some, and called a “concubine”. This play echoes with signs of things to come—media intrusion, and trolls stoning her house and calling her a “Polish whore”.\n\n【5】At this point _Radiance_ rapidly became more dramatic and engaging. (This was helpful because I had found it hard to concentrate from the start due to the uncomfortable seating which, as with so many other theatres, was designed for a smaller iteration of mankind.) Tyson shows enthusiasm for her role here: her performance combines intellect and passion. But I felt she played lower key than she could have, and I wanted to see more raw power. This might have been a tall order, however, because the first half of the play felt too conventional in its delivery. It may have been the Edwardian costumes, the “Englishness” in the acting, and the traditional appearance of the set that encouraged this. Some lines were played a bit too much for laughs and the jocularity of some of the “science humour” felt jarring. I wonder if the period feel of the set and costumes actually detracted from the script. A minimal presentation in this case could have given the words more depth.\n\n【6】*   View Large Image\n\n【7】Copyright © 2014 Richard Davenport\n\n【8】Near the end, Langevin's wife, a self-described non-intellectual, speaks of the potential for destruction inherent in Marie's incredible discoveries while Marie, who has frequently talked up the beauty of pure science, insists that it is a power for good. It is left to us to decide whether it was worth it. It's a powerful final image to hold onto, Marie Curie working by the light of the glowing chemical, slowly poisoning herself. She eventually slammed the door on her lover, but she never stopped working.\n\n【9】*   View Large Image\n\n【10】Copyright © 2014 Richard Davenport\n\n【11】**Radiance: the Passion of Marie Curie** A play by Alan Alda, directed by Mark Giesser, until Feb 28, 2015. http://www.tabardweb.co.uk/radiance.htm\n\n【12】Article info\n------------\n\n【13】### Publication history\n\n【14】Published: 21 February 2015\n\n【15】### Identification\n\n【16】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60277-X\n\n【17】### Copyright\n\n【18】© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, treatment is started when arthritis is clinically apparent. We aimed to evaluate whether earlier intervention, in the preceding phase of arthralgia and subclinical joint inflammation, could prevent the development of clinical arthritis or reduce the disease burden.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept-trial at the Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, Netherlands. Adults aged 18 years or older with arthralgia clinically suspected of progressing to rheumatoid arthritis and MRI-detected subclinical joint inflammation were eligible for enrolment across 13 rheumatology outpatient clinics in the southwest region of the Netherlands and randomly assigned (1:1) to a single intramuscular glucocorticoid injection (120 mg) and a 1-year course of oral methotrexate (up to 25 mg/week), or placebo (single injection and tablets for 1 year). Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment. Follow-up continued for 1 year after the end of the 1-year treatment period. The primary endpoint was development of clinical arthritis (fulfilling the 2010 rheumatoid arthritis classification criteria or involving two or more joints) that persisted for at least 2 weeks. Patient-reported physical functioning, symptoms, and work productivity were secondary endpoints, which were measured every 4 months. Additionally, the course of MRI-detected inflammation was studied. All participants entered the intention-to-treat analysis. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2014-004472-35, and the Netherlands Trial Register, NTR4853-trial-NL4599.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between April 16, 2015, and Sept 11, 2019, 901 patients were assessed for eligibility and 236 were enrolled and randomly assigned to active treatment (n=119) or placebo (n=117). At 2 years, the frequency of the primary endpoint was similar between the groups (23 \\[19%\\] of 119 participants in the treatment group _vs_ 21 \\[18%\\] of 117 in the placebo group; hazard ratio 0·81, 95% CI 0·45 to 1·48). Physical functioning improved more in the treatment group during the first 4 months and remained better than in the placebo group (mean between-group difference in Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index over 2 years: –0·09, 95% CI –0·16 to –0·03; p=0·0042). Similarly, pain (on scale 0–100, mean between-group difference: –8, 95% CI –12 to –4; p<0·0001), morning stiffness of joints (–12, –16 to –8; p<0·0001), presenteeism (–8%, –13 to –3; p=0·0007), and MRI-detected joint inflammation (–1·4 points, –2·0 to –0·9; p<0·0001) showed sustained improvement in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. The number of serious adverse events was equal in both groups; adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile for methotrexate.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Methotrexate, the cornerstone treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, initiated at the pre-arthritis stage of symptoms and subclinical inflammation, did not prevent the development of clinical arthritis, but modified the disease course as shown by sustained improvement in MRI-detected inflammation, related symptoms, and impairments compared with placebo.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】Dutch Research Council (NWO; Dutch Arthritis Society).\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【17】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【18】### Subscribe:\n\n【19】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【20】Already a print subscriber?

The Nrf2/ARE pathway is known to protect cells against various stress stimuli, primarily oxidative stress associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nrf2 activity is tightly regulated by a cytoplasmic inhibitory protein Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap-1) which acts as an adaptor between Nrf2 and cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase and promotes rapid proteasomal degradation of Nrf2. Being a sensor of various exogenous and endogenous electrophilic compounds and ROS, Keap-1 undergoes conformational changes upon interaction with such agents and this causes Nrf2 release from the complex, thus allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and transactivate Nrf2-responsive genes \\[see ( , ) for recent reviews\\].\n\n【1】In their study, Khan et al. (this issue) demonstrate that there is also an alternative mechanism whereby the Nrf2/ARE pathway can be activated in human leukemia cells performing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The authors found that while OXPHOS results in increased generation of ROS, the induction of the “classical” Nrf2-responsive genes encoding heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) can also occur in a ROS-independent manner. This was associated with a decrease in Keap-1 mRNA levels, implying that lower protein levels of Keap-1 may facilitate stabilization of the _de novo_ synthesized Nrf2 protein, thus increasing the functional activity of the Nrf2/ARE pathway. The data also show that the MAPK ERK5 is upregulated in this system. This suggests that ERK5 kinase is responsible for the downregulation of Keap-1, which may be mediated by the downstream target of ERK5, the transcription factor MEF2C. Khan et al. show that MEF2C binds to the promoter of the microRNA miR-23a–27a–24-2 cluster and that miR-23a destabilizes Keap-1 mRNA by interacting with its 3′-untranslated region (3'UTR). Taken together, the results suggest that downregulation of Keap-1 in leukemic cells performing OXPHOS is mediated by the ERK5/MEF2/miR-23a signaling and that the resulting stabilization of Nrf2 leads to the activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway, thus protecting the cells from the deleterious effects of ROS.\n\n【2】The findings by Khan et al. are in line with the previously reported ability of microRNAs to downregulate Keap-1 expression by targeting the 3′-UTR of its mRNA in several types of cancer cells ( , , ). Interestingly, MEF2A and MEF2C were shown to positively regulate the expression of different microRNAs, including miR-23a, in human vascular smooth muscle cells undergoing oxidative stress-induced senescence ( ) and in cardiac myocytes from mice with myotonic dystrophy ( ), respectively. Therefore, the ERK5/MEF2/miR-23a/Keap-1 axis may represent a key regulatory pathway in a broad range of cell types under various pathological conditions.\n\n【3】The importance of microRNAs in regulation of hematopoiesis and its aberrations has been known for several years \\[e.g., ( )\\]. For instance found that the upregulation of miR-32 by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D <sub>3 </sub> in human myeloid leukemia cells leads to the targeting of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, and inhibition of cytarabine-induced apoptosis, the latter frequently the result of excess generation of intracellular ROS. The report by Khan et al. demonstrates the important connection between microRNAs, Keap-1 and the alleviation of cellular oxidative stress. As such, it may indicate one basis for the emergence of resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy of human neoplastic diseases. The novel, ERK5/microRNA-dependent, mode of Keap-1 downregulation suggested by this study adds to the reported mechanisms related to Keap-1 promoter hypermethylation and inactivating mutations that lead to hyperactivation of Nrf2/ARE, and thus to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance \\[e.g., ( )\\]. In this scenario, anti-sense oligonucleotides which block miR-23a expression can be developed as therapeutic agents to fight consequences of the loss of function of Keap-1.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In March, a woman in the USA was arrested for alleged criminal exposure to HIV through spitting. And in July, a Canadian man was sentenced to 43 months in prison for not disclosing his HIV status, even though his sexual partners did not contract the virus. Too often, the criminal law is applied to people with HIV in an overly broad manner. To combat myths and misconceptions that fuel HIV criminalisation, 20 experts in HIV science, epidemiology, and clinical care have released a consensus statement on the science of HIV in the context of criminal law, launched in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on July 25 at the AIDS 2018 conference.\n        \n    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n\n【21】Hide Caption Download See figure in Article\n\n【22】Toggle Thumbstrip\n\n【23】*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

So the laboratory it was. But is it possible for one discipline to link with the other, and perhaps from one to even learn from the other?

We took this approach because when deciding whether or not to add fluoride to water, this is the most relevant measure of risk.\n\n【2】Downey suggests that the absence of positive findings in our study may have resulted from confounding by other sources of fluoride such as tea. However, an important risk from fluoride in water would only have been missed through such confounding if there were a strong inverse relation between exposure to fluoride in water and other sources of the mineral. We have no reason to expect this. Furthermore, as described in our paper, we found only a weak and insignificant association between hip fracture and reported consumption of tea.\n\n【3】Mansfield proposes that the bioavailability of fluoride in water may depend on the cations with which it is associated. We did address this issue in our discussion, and we think an important effect of this kind is unlikely. The question could, however, be answered by biomonitoring studies in places with high concentrations of fluoride in soft as compared with hard water. Because artificial fluoridation of water in the UK did not begin until the 1950s, negative results in a case-control study of exposure from this source would still leave open the question of whether exposure early in life caused an increase in risk.\n\n【4】Article info\n------------\n\n【5】### Publication history\n\n【6】Published: 06 May 2000\n\n【7】### Identification\n\n【8】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)72548-4\n\n【9】### Copyright\n\n【10】© 2000 Elsevier Ltd.

Depending on their efficacy, onset of immunity, length of protection, and cost and ease of administration, these vaccines could contain or even prevent an outbreak.\n\n【1】During an outbreak, a vaccine could prevent infection of front-line health workers and staff who are engaged in patient transport and burial. In terms of containment action, vaccination of whole households of patients could prevent any tertiary cases that might occur from persons infected secondarily by caring for the initial household case. Populations at high risk, eg, villages or urban wards where multiple transmission chains have been identified, could also be targeted in a vaccination programme. Because exposure risk is time-limited in most outbreaks, these vaccination strategies might not need a vaccine that triggers long-lasting immunity.\n\n【2】An Ebola vaccine that induces long-lasting immunity could, however, find a place in outbreak prevention. Routine vaccination of health workers in areas where Ebola infection is known to be a risk within west and central Africa, could be a major intervention to prevent Ebola outbreaks. The majority of outbreaks, including the most recent outbreak in DR Congo in 2014, occurred after health workers became infected. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> Infected heath workers inadvertently serve as a conduit of infection to their own family members or caretakers, and from these initial infections, transmission is sustained in the community by direct contact with patients or dead bodies. Some evidence indicates that if Ebola emerges and its transmission is not amplified by infection of health workers, outbreaks do not occur. <sup>, </sup> More widespread preventive vaccination in general populations living in high-risk areas would depend on cost-benefit analysis, operational feasibility, and acceptance.\n\n【3】Previous Ebola vaccines have been developed with financial aid of grants provided by various US defence and health agencies because of concern that the Ebola virus could be used deliberately for bioterrorism, but no public health call for such vaccines from WHO or other international organisations, African countries, or civil society was ever made prior to the current outbreaks. Although the Board of GAVI, the vaccine alliance, has approved plans of up to US$300 million for vaccine procurement and up to $90 million for the strengthening of infrastructure to provide vaccines, a long-term market will depend on the WHO recommendations for vaccine use, once the vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective, and the ability of countries and the donor community to provide funding for procurement.\n\n【4】Phase 1 clinical trials have been completed for three candidate vaccines, and these vaccines are entering or are about to enter phase 2 and 3 clinical trials in countries where Ebola outbreaks are occurring. Time is of the essence because efficacy trials can only be completed while the Ebola virus continues to circulate. WHO is facilitating a process to devise an emergency regulatory pathway in these countries such that rapid introduction of vaccines for clinical trials and general distribution is feasible without compromising scientific standards and rigour. With the support of UNICEF, WHO, and the clinical trial consortia, efforts to raise large-scale community engagement are underway in these countries to build trust and allay concerns about clinical trials. Ethical and human participant review processes in the countries where trials will be done are also underway, and final clearance is being sought from heads of state.\n\n【5】Logistically, clinical trials will not be easy. Vaccine formulations have yet to be optimised, and some vaccine preparations must be stored well below −20°C until use. Without an understanding of the serological correlates of protection in humans, clinical trials to assess vaccine efficacy can only be done while the Ebola virus is circulating in human populations. Research consortia are now setting up logistical support platforms, training research assistants for clinical trial conduct, ensuring community engagement, and obtaining national ethical and regulatory clearance and other permissions required so that trials can begin. There is urgency to complete these efforts because Ebola incidence is decreasing as countries place more emphasis on surveillance and contact tracing and as communities build a better understanding of how to prevent transmission and spread.\n\n【6】What will happen if phase 3 trials have insufficient power to determine efficacy as or if incidence continues to wane as hoped? A logical conclusion would be that trials would need to rapidly reassume when and where the next Ebola outbreak occurs. Because emergence that leads to an outbreak is a random and unpredictable event, this emergence might not occur in the countries that are working to prepare for the trials at present. Lessons from the multicentre Mechanisms of Severe Acute Influenza Consortium (MOSAIC) project in the UK might be of use. Designed and funded to improve the understanding of clinical and immunological progression of H1N1 virus while it was circulating among UK populations, the MOSAIC project faced many delays in start-up. The conclusions were that expedited ethical approval, a single pre-existing template for any material transfer agreements, and research and development approvals in advance of the expected influenza season of high transmission were crucial to the efficient management of an outbreak.\n\n【7】Much more must be done to ensure that vaccine trials can be rolled out again, if necessary, once the present outbreak is over and the next outbreak occurs. Vaccines already produced must be stored, optimised, and maintained in sufficient quantities; funders of clinical trials must maintain fluid funding to roll out trial operations when needed; countries at risk of an Ebola outbreak must provide ethical, regulatory, and other clearances in the period between outbreaks and maintain these clearances until future outbreaks occur; and scientists must keep the clinical trial protocols on the shelf and be ready to rapidly implement them when needed.\n\n【8】WHO, together with regulatory agencies in countries where vaccines will be studied and a wider group of African regulators has begun a process to address some of the above-mentioned challenges. Regulatory agencies in Africa, the US Food and Drug Administration (which already has a so-called animal rule policy when human vaccine efficacy trials are not possible), the European Medicines Agency, and other regulatory agencies should actively engage to jointly consider an accelerated licensure strategy that does not rely on vaccine efficacy, but is rather based primarily on adequate safety and immunogenicity in the relevant human populations.\n\n【9】Adequate safety data should include at least the amount and quality of data that would be expected under a normal licensure process. Typically, this would imply safety data from thousands of adult participants, paediatric and elderly age groups, and key populations regarded as at high risk (eg, pregnant women, persons who are malnourished, with HIV infection, or otherwise immune-compromised). A full complement of preclinical toxicology studies, including reproductive toxicity data, would also be expected.\n\n【10】Central to the approval process would be the establishment of a functional relation between immune responses in human beings and those obtained in vaccinated non-human primates protected against experimental challenge. Trust must also be built within the study populations to avoid counterproductive reactions ranging from rumours of adverse effects to full-blown conspiracy theories that could easily undermine this accelerated approach. Finally, accelerated licensure would need to come with a commitment that additional efforts to confirm efficacy would be undertaken post-licensure.\n\n【11】An accelerated approach could possibly lead to full registration of one or more Ebola vaccines within the next 12–18 months, with the understanding that post-approval commitments would be in place for confirmatory trials to establish vaccine efficacy in properly designed and executed clinical trials in time for a new outbreak. Large community-based trials would be far easier to do with a vaccine that was already registered and stockpiled, and for which policy recommendations for use were in place. With this approach in place, industry might be more inclined to scale up and dedicate manufacturing capacity for a vaccine that could be registered in the near term than it would be for a vaccine approved under traditional approaches. But it must be clear to all, including pharmaceutical companies, that accelerated licensure does not equate to accelerated marketing, but rather, that registration of an Ebola vaccine in advance would make it much simpler to introduce the vaccine for study in the event of a new outbreak.\n\n【12】Past experience suggests that post-licensure promises of further research by some companies, as indicated by a regulator, are ignored or not fully completed. If WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization were to provide a recommendation for GAVI to support purchase of stockpile vaccine for efficacy studies, there might be a way to decrease the risk of broken post-licensure promises. The vaccine stockpile would require periodic renewal as the vaccines are used up in trials or expire, and a contract to replenish or renew the stockpile could be made conditional on compliance with efficacy trials. An even stronger mechanism could be for a regulatory agency to block sales of vaccine to non-government purchasers or to put an expiration clause into the approval letter that would require the manufacturer to repeat safety tests. Post-approval safety monitoring also requires national pharmacovigilance systems, but such systems are fledgling or non-existent in most developing countries, and there is an urgent need to implement these systems. Even so, any commitment for post-approval efficacy studies will always be conditional upon there being another outbreak.\n\n【13】Lessons from WHO's attempts to ensure that stockpiled smallpox vaccine could be used urgently, should smallpox be reintroduced, might also be applicable. WHO defined the criteria for release of unlicensed vaccine from its stockpile, and a vaccine request form was provided to countries that met those criteria, along with a disclaimer and a letter about the regulatory needs for use of the vaccine, such that when vaccine was released from the stockpile, it could be immediately licensed and used. Such measures would facilitate a release of the vaccine for efficacy trials into the field as early as possible.\n\n【14】In the past, a continuum of vaccine research and development activities for emerging pathogens once outbreaks have ended was difficult and almost impossible to maintain. During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), vaccine developers began research and development, only to see the outbreak fade and funding decreased. Continued funding could have resulted in a vaccine candidate effective in animal models infected with SARS and possibly other coronaviruses, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which is now emerging and re-emerging in the Middle East. And continued readiness for clinical vaccine trials by specific countries and the international community could have facilitated vaccine efficacy trials in the Middle East and led the world closer to an effective coronavirus vaccine.\n\n【15】Serious consideration should also be given to the creation of an internationally supported facility dedicated to rapidly developing vaccines against known emerging pathogens, such as a multivalent Filovirus vaccine that could protect against multiple Ebola virus strains and the Marburg virus.\n\n【16】Once the west Africa Ebola outbreak is over and the generous and innovative national and international response has drawn to an end, the challenge might again be to maintain the continuum of vaccine studies that lead to an effective vaccine. This time the opportunities must not be lost.\n\n【17】**Contributors**\n\n【18】All authors contributed equally to planning, writing, and revising this report.\n\n【19】**Declaration of interests**\n\n【20】We declare no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

An association between changes in cIMT and cardiovascular risk is frequently assumed but has rarely been reported. Our aim was to test this association.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We identified general population studies that assessed cIMT at least twice and followed up participants for myocardial infarction, stroke, or death. The study teams collaborated in an individual participant data meta-analysis. Excluding individuals with previous myocardial infarction or stroke, we assessed the association between cIMT progression and the risk of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death, or a combination of these) for each study with Cox regression. The log hazard ratios (HRs) per SD difference were pooled by random effects meta-analysis.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of 22 eligible studies, 16 with 36 984 participants were included. During a mean follow-up of 7·0 years, 1519 myocardial infarctions, 1339 strokes, and 2028 combined endpoints (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) occurred. Yearly cIMT progression was derived from two ultrasound visits 2–7 years (median 4 years) apart. For mean common carotid artery intima-media thickness progression, the overall HR of the combined endpoint was 0·97 (95% CI 0·94–1·00) when adjusted for age, sex, and mean common carotid artery intima-media thickness, and 0·98 (0·95–1·01) when also adjusted for vascular risk factors. Although we detected no associations with cIMT progression in sensitivity analyses, the mean cIMT of the two ultrasound scans was positively and robustly associated with cardiovascular risk (HR for the combined endpoint 1·16, 95% CI 1·10–1·22, adjusted for age, sex, mean common carotid artery intima-media thickness progression, and vascular risk factors). In three studies including 3439 participants who had four ultrasound scans, cIMT progression did not correlate between occassions (reproducibility correlations between _r_ \\=−0·06 and _r_ \\=−0·02).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The association between cIMT progression assessed from two ultrasound scans and cardiovascular risk in the general population remains unproven. No conclusion can be derived for the use of cIMT progression as a surrogate in clinical trials.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【17】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【18】### Subscribe:\n\n【19】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【20】Already a print subscriber?

More than a decade ago, international researchers established diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for IVLBCL and distinguished two clinical forms: classic IVLBCL, which affects almost all patients diagnosed in European and North American countries; and a haemophagocytic syndrome-related form, which is a more aggressive type and is frequently diagnosed in Japan. After two studies from the Japanese Society of Hematology and the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group showed a positive survival effect of rituximab, most patients with IVLBCL have been treated with R-CHOP (rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone).

Globally, WHO reports 764 474 387 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 6·9 million deaths at the time of writing this letter. The pandemic has brought about a plethora of health challenges, both physical and mental. Among these challenges, the sense of isolation and loneliness experienced by many people is particularly noteworthy. Consider a scenario where a person was away from home for work purposes but became stranded due to the pandemic. Unfortunately, during this period, the person's mother passed away due to COVID-19. Regrettably, pandemic-related travel restrictions prevented the individual from returning home to pay their last respects to their deceased mother. The person had no one to confide in personally. Months later, when the restrictions eased, the person returned to work but struggled to connect with their colleagues and chose to isolate themself from others. The experience left the person feeling lonely and isolated. The emotional toll of this traumatic event is unimaginable.\n\n【1】This person is not the only one who feels the weight of loneliness, as many adults have been hit hard by this feeling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, these feelings are likely to continue and experts are concerned about the potential for loneliness to become a chronic issue. If left unaddressed, chronic loneliness can lead to various severe mental and physical health conditions. It is crucial for the medical community to recognise the impact of loneliness on individuals and take steps to address it. Loneliness is a painful, subjective experience characterised by a feeling of insufficient or unsatisfactory desired social connections. Loneliness can result in unhealthy behaviours, such as poor sleeping patterns, lack of exercise, and unhealthy dietary habits, which can contribute to an increased risk of premature mortality by 26% if not appropriately dealt with. Moreover, loneliness is believed to be associated with the adverse effects of chronic stress on the body, including inflammation, weakened immune function, and an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Health-care providers can incorporate screening for social isolation and loneliness into routine assessments and develop care plans that address these issues to avoid any further mental health-related concerns due to any novel illnesses.\n\n【2】For the **WHO COVID-19 Dashboard** see https://covid19.who.int/\n\n【3】We declare no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

However, some inevitable biases would have existed since the assignment could not be blinded to health-care providers.\n\n【1】First, Bernitz and colleagues did not report an indication for ICS after diagnosis of labour dystocia, and we are concerned that the decision to perform ICS might have been widely varied at attending physicians' discretion. In the process of decision making of ICS for labour dystocia, the augmentation period is important. For example, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that physicians should wait at least 4 hours with adequate uterine contraction or 6 hours of oxytocin administration with inadequate uterine contraction before doing ICS.\n\n【2】Second, to classify the cause of ICS for labour dystocia is substantially difficult.

In 2010, 272 children with severe pulmonary problems as a consequence of heart malformation had to be admitted to the intensive-care unit. 53 died (20%). The other 219 children were discharged still in a critical state, and their parents were told that they could not be saved. They died later at home.\n\n【4】This is the reason why we have installed in Siem Reap Angkor, as a logical step to reduce the mortality rate, interventional cardiology for closure of patent ductus arteriosus and atrial and ventricular septal defects, dilation of pulmonary and aortic stenoses, and cardiac surgery for more complex congenital malformations via a partnership involving the teams of the University Children's Hospital Zurich, Switzerland; Chaîne de l'Espoir, Paris, France; and Fondation le Petit Coeur, Zurich. This strategy is based on epidemiological data and translates the will to decrease mortality in severely sick children in a sustainable way.\n\n【5】*   View Large Image\n\n【6】Copyright © 2012 Corbis\n\n【7】We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【8】Article info\n------------\n\n【9】### Publication history\n\n【10】Published: 31 March 2012\n\n【11】### Identification\n\n【12】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60510-8\n\n【13】### Copyright\n\n【14】© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The accompanying Comment correctly notes that efficacy of non-surgical β-blocker therapy might not be extrapolable to the surgical setting, where an unpredictable stress response exists.\n\n【1】We submit that, by dosing patients to a predefined fixed target heart rate and blood pressure in the POISE trial, the importance of individual adaptive responses within biological systems and the timeframe required to reset these might have been underestimated. Specifically, the drug was not titrated to achieve an optimum change within the cardiovascular physiology of each patient. The importance of tight intraoperative haemodynamic control in a relatively homogeneous population, manifesting as improved 30-day mortality, has recently been emphasised.\n\n【2】We speculate whether other factors, intrinsic to the dynamic surgical stress response, also significantly contributed to adverse outcome. Participants in the POISE study were patients with major cardiovascular risk undergoing non-cardiac surgery, and were therefore undoubtedly affected by impaired vascular homoeostasis. The surgical stress response induces a proinflammatory–prothrombotic–antifibrinolytic milieu that might contribute to increased risk of perioperative adverse outcome. Endothelial dysfunction has been reported to predict adverse acute and long-term outcome after vascular surgery, and improved perioperative survival has been attributed to the pleiotropic (anti-inflammatory, endothelial-modulating) effects of statin therapy.\n\n【3】We suggest that individualised tight haemodynamic control and microvascular homoeostasis both significantly contribute to perioperative outcome in non-cardiac surgery, and need to be carefully considered when assessing therapeutic options for these patients.\n\n【4】We declare that we have no conflict of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Gone will be Soviet-era training in which doctors spent their career in one hospital, and over-crowded outpatient clinics that too often underutilised the expertise of staff and underserved the needs of patients. Instead, medical schools are asked to admit more, higher calibre students, and provide better quality teaching that is accredited by the Chinese Medical Doctor Association. After 5 years of medical school, graduates will enter a 3-year standardised residency programme at the start of specialisation. New 5+3 doctors must demonstrate adequate competencies, confirmed by examination, before a nationally recognised certificate is issued. Once in practice, distance-learning will support life-long professional development. This is arguably the most important directive since medical reform was accelerated in 2009, and will reshape the delivery of care in China.\n\n【1】The patient-centred approach intends to provide access to doctors with the right skills and attitudes to achieve the Healthy China 2030 targets. This plan requires more general practitioners, paediatricians, psychiatrists, and geriatricians, among others, and inducements to ensure good-quality care in rural areas. A radical overhaul in medical education and workforce planning is needed to meet that goal, as described by Jiming Zhu and colleagues in _The Lancet_ last year. But with more than 3 million doctors in China, half of whom do not have bachelor degree-level education, there is much to do before health equity is assured and less formal training programmes disappear. Some might question the feasibility of such large changes, so quickly, and the adequacy of funding.\n\n【2】Professional attitudes need to be caught as well as taught: communication, compassion, empathy, respect, and ethics must become as recognisable a mark of doctors in China as a stethoscope. If done well, the reforms will benefit patients, doctors, and hospitals. For doctors in China, the reforms herald a rising professional status and opportunity for greater leadership, with commensurate mobility, salary, and responsibilities.\n\n【3】*   View Large Image\n\n【4】Copyright © 2017 Fotolia xixinxing #55841568\n\n【5】For **Healthy China 2030** see http://en.nhfpc.gov.cn/2016-11/07/c\\_70516.htm\n\n【6】Article info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 22 July 2017\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(17)31921-9\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

There is, however, a fundamental flaw in the approach adopted in this and previous publications.\n\n【1】An attempt is made to allow for differences in the populations studied by correcting for LDL cholesterol; presented data show observations corrected to that expected per mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. This correction assumes that risk reduction is proportional to the LDL reduction, on the basis of the observation that trials with the greatest reduction in LDL cholesterol also had the greatest reduction in risk.\n\n【2】Although risk reduction might correlate with LDL reduction, there are other differences between the trials that could contribute to the noted differences, not least the baseline risk. Webtable 3 confirms that groups with a higher predicted risk at baseline had a greater absolute reduction in LDL; these groups tended to predominate in trials in which the greatest absolute reduction in risk was seen. “Correcting” for observed LDL cholesterol reduction could thus introduce bias. Values corrected in response to an assumption should not be used to prove that this assumption is indeed correct.\n\n【3】It would be valid and informative to subgroup individual trial results by observed LDL cholesterol reduction, then compare the reductions of risk seen across trials in each subgroup. Thus graphs such as figure 5 could reflect real data rather than what seems to be a display of values calculated using a linear regression model, and as such could show nothing other than straight lines.\n\n【4】I (and my employer) have received speakers' honoraria from AstraZeneca, Merck Sharp and Dohme, and Schering Plough.

The reality is that 87 million people have died from tobacco-induced diseases since the beginning of the FCTC negotiations; this is a greater toll than any other single cause and far outstrips the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Although progress has been made in reducing smoking rates in high-income countries and some middle-income countries, there has been little impact on the tobacco industry itself, which continues to expand its global presence and profits, and devastation.\n\n【1】The world faces huge development issues ranging from eliminating poverty, to the climate crisis, as recognised in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The challenge is to focus attention on actions that create a fairer and healthier world and, which, in turn, will contribute to many of the SDGs. Reducing and ultimately eliminating the impact of the tobacco industry is clearly a top public health issue, since it is responsible for around 6 million deaths each year, with the potential to kill 1 billion people by the end of the century.\n\n【2】In New Zealand, tobacco causes approximately 15% of deaths each year and is a major driver of unacceptable health inequalities. In 2011, in response to an inquiry into the ravages of tobacco on Maori people, the Government accepted the goal of New Zealand achieving a minimal level of smoking, less than 5% of all adults continuing to smoke daily, by 2025 (Smokefree 2025). The goal is world leading and goes much further than the WHO target of a 30% reduction in global prevalence from 22% in 2010, to 15% in 2025.\n\n【3】Since the Smokefree 2025 goal was adopted 5 years ago, the government has put in place important policies: annual tax increases of 10%, a ban on point-of sale displays, smoke-free prisons, and legislation for the standardised packaging of tobacco products. The government-funded national tobacco advocacy service has been shifted to a Maori provider. Political champions and opportunistic political leadership have been key to progress.\n\n【4】Despite the policy progress, New Zealand is not on track to achieve the Smokefree 2025 goal, except for the most privileged 40% of the population who are already close to reaching the goal. The New Zealand Survey data for 2015–16 estimates that 14% of adults (16% men, 13% women) smoke cigarettes daily. This is only a small improvement over recent years. Huge socioeconomic and ethnic inequalities remain and a renewed effort is needed to reduce the prevalence in Maori (36%) and Pacific people (23%) and the most disadvantaged groups.\n\n【5】Our engagement in tobacco control prevention spans almost 40 years, from the development of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) New Zealand, based on the UK model, to involvement setting priority of global goals and targets for the major NCDs and their risk factors. With less than a decade to go before 2025, re-engaging in the battle against the tobacco industry in New Zealand and Pacific countries, and reaching a smoke-free country, seems to be the single most achievable public health issue that will contribute to a fairer and healthier society for all New Zealanders in the near future.\n\n【6】So, what would it take to achieve this already agreed upon 2025 goal in New Zealand and how can this experience provide a positive example for other countries? Government policies to reduce demand in New Zealand must continue to be strengthened, especially more substantial tax increases; small increases in taxation are not sufficient because smokers quickly adjust.\n\n【7】The greatest gains in the future will depend on addressing supply-side issues beginning with a greatly reduced availability of tobacco in New Zealand; tobacco products are available from about 8000 retail outlets. In addition, we require greatly increased funding for targeted mass and social media campaigns, increased smoke-free public places and smoke-free cars carrying children, and complete divestment from tobacco. Electronic nicotine-delivery devices and low-nicotine cigarettes may have a role to play in achieving the 2025 goal by encouraging cessation.\n\n【8】The only tobacco manufacturer in New Zealand is Imperial Tobacco; British American Tobacco (BAT) and Philip Morris import their products, mostly from Australia. An important overarching goal will be to encourage Imperial Tobacco to downsize and leave the country.\n\n【9】Achieving the Smokefree 2025 goal will make New Zealand both a fairer and healthier society, will have major social and economic benefits, and will set an example for the rest of the world.\n\n【10】We declare no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Gluten can be detected in the stool of the most patients with coeliac disease on a gluten-free diet, suggesting that inadvertent contamination is frequent. Gluten-free alternatives are costly and not readily available everywhere. Thus, there is a growing interest in developing adjuvant therapies for coeliac disease. Because coeliac disease is driven by pathogenic gluten-specific CD4 <sup>+ </sup> T cells, modulation of this pathway has long been sought.

These results have led to increased off-label use of molecularly targeted agents on the basis of identified molecular alterations. We assessed the efficacy of several molecularly targeted agents marketed in France, which were chosen on the basis of tumour molecular profiling but used outside their indications, in patients with advanced cancer for whom standard-of-care therapy had failed.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】The open-label, randomised, controlled phase 2 SHIVA trial was done at eight French academic centres. We included adult patients with any kind of metastatic solid tumour refractory to standard of care, provided they had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, disease that was accessible for a biopsy or resection of a metastatic site, and at least one measurable lesion. The molecular profile of each patient's tumour was established with a mandatory biopsy of a metastatic tumour and large-scale genomic testing. We only included patients for whom a molecular alteration was identified within one of three molecular pathways (hormone receptor, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAF/MEK), which could be matched to one of ten regimens including 11 available molecularly targeted agents (erlotinib, lapatinib plus trastuzumab, sorafenib, imatinib, dasatinib, vemurafenib, everolimus, abiraterone, letrozole, tamoxifen). We randomly assigned these patients (1:1) to receive a matched molecularly targeted agent (experimental group) or treatment at physician's choice (control group) by central block randomisation (blocks of size six). Randomisation was done centrally with a web-based response system and was stratified according to the Royal Marsden Hospital prognostic score (0 or 1 _vs_ 2 or 3) and the altered molecular pathway. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation. Treatments in both groups were given in accordance with the approved product information and standard practice protocols at each institution and were continued until evidence of disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population, which was not assessed by independent central review. We assessed safety in any patients who received at least one dose of their assigned treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01771458.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between Oct 4, 2012, and July 11, 2014, we screened 741 patients with any tumour type. 293 (40%) patients had at least one molecular alteration matching one of the 10 available regimens. At the time of data cutoff, Jan 20, 2015, 195 (26%) patients had been randomly assigned, with 99 in the experimental group and 96 in the control group. All patients in the experimental group started treatment, as did 92 in the control group. Two patients in the control group received a molecularly targeted agent: both were included in their assigned group for efficacy analyses, the patient who received an agent that was allowed in the experimental group was included in the experimental group for the purposes of safety analyses, while the other patient, who received a molecularly targeted agent and chemotherapy, was kept in the control group for safety analyses. Median follow-up was 11·3 months (IQR 5·8–11·6) in the experimental group and 11·3 months (8·1–11·6) in the control group at the time of the primary analysis of progression-free survival. Median progression-free survival was 2·3 months (95% CI 1·7–3·8) in the experimental group versus 2·0 months (1·8–2·1) in the control group (hazard ratio 0·88, 95% CI 0·65–1·19, p=0·41). In the safety population, 43 (43%) of 100 patients treated with a molecularly targeted agent and 32 (35%) of 91 patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy had grade 3–4 adverse events (p=0·30).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The use of molecularly targeted agents outside their indications does not improve progression-free survival compared with treatment at physician's choice in heavily pretreated patients with cancer.

More than mere semantics\nWe read with interest the excellent Series paper by Alexander Ford and colleagues describing the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of functional dyspepsia. We commend the authors for establishing a timely and informative overview of this disorder.\n\n【1】Ford and colleagues use the terms early satiety and early satiation interchangeably. In fact, the Rome IV paper on gastroduodenal disorders does the same, albeit the symptom definition in the diagnostic criteria refers specifically to early satiation. Early satiation is also a distinctive feature of the postprandial distress syndrome subtype of functional dyspepsia, which is characterised by symptom triggering or aggravation by a meal. However, we would like to emphasise that, although regularly used as synonyms, satiety and satiation are two different entities. Satiety refers to the feelings of fullness between meals, whereas satiation reflects feelings of fullness during ingestion of a meal, acting as a terminating factor. This distinction can be relevant as it potentially reflects different underlying mechanisms. Meal nutrient volume-induced satiation is probably closely related to gastric accommodation—ie, mechanosensory reaction of the proximal stomach. However, as the stomach does not meaningfully detect nutrient composition of a meal, the feeling of satiety involves neurohormonal signals that originate from more distal parts of the gastrointestinal tract—ie, the duodenum.\n\n【2】Because of the heterogeneity of the disorder and the complexity of its symptomatology, it is important to use clear and consistent terminology to support unravelling pathophysiological mechanisms and to improve treatment outcomes.\n\n【3】DK reports grants from Will Pharma, Allergan, Grunenthal, ZonMw, Maag-Lever-Darmstichting, United Europe Gastroenterology, and EU Horizon 2020, unrelated to this Correspondence.

Blocking fatty acid oxidation can enhance AAD-mediated anti-tumor effects in colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, we hypothesised that genetic variants in the lipid metabolism pathway may predict clinical outcomes \\[overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)\\] in metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients receiving bevacizumab-based first-line treatment.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Genomic DNA from blood samples of patients enrolled in FIRE-3 (a global, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial, between 2007-6-23 and 2012-9-19, discovery cohort: FOLFIRI/bevacizumab arm, n = 107; control cohort: FOLFIRI/cetuximab arm, n = 129) and MAVERICC (a global, randomised, open-label, phase II study, between 2011–8 and 2015–7, in United States, Canada, Estonia, Ireland, Switzerland, Norway, and Portugal. Validation cohort: FOLFIRI/bevacizumab arm, n = 163) trials, was genotyped using the OncoArray-500 K beadchip panel. The impact on OS and PFS of 17 selected SNPs in 7 genes involved in the lipid metabolism pathway (CD36, FABP4, LPCAT1/2, CPT1A, FASN, ACACA) was analysed using Kaplan–Meier curves, the log-rank test for univariate analyses and likelihood ratio tests of Cox proportional hazards regression parameters for multivariable analyses. ORR and SNP associations were evaluated using Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】In the discovery cohort, patients with _FASN_ rs4485435 any C allele (n = 21) showed significantly shorter PFS (median PFS: 8.69 vs 13.48 months) compared to carriers of G/G (n = 62) in multivariable (HR = 2.87; 95%CI 1.4–5.9; _p =_ 0.00675) analysis. These data were confirmed in the validation cohort in multivariable analysis (HR = 2.07, 95%CI: 1.15–3.74; _p =_ 0.02), but no association was observed in the cetuximab cohort of FIRE-3. In the comparison of bevacizumab vs cetuximab arm in FIRE-3, a significant interaction was shown with _FASN_ rs4485435 ( _p =_ 0.017) on PFS **.**\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Our study demonstrates for the first time, to our knowledge, that _FASN_ polymorphisms may predict outcome of bevacizumab-based treatment in patients with mCRC. These findings support a possible role of the lipid metabolism pathway in contributing to resistance to anti-VEGF treatment.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute \\[P30CA 014089 to H.-J.L.\\], Gloria Borges WunderGlo Foundation, Dhont Family Foundation, Victoria and Philip Wilson Research Fund, San Pedro Peninsula Cancer Guild, Ming Hsieh Research Fund, Eddie Mahoney Memorial Research Fund, Shanghai Sailing Program (22YF1407000), China National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents (BX20220084), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2022M710768), National Natural Science Foundation of China (82202892).\n\n【11】Keywords\n--------\n\n【12】*   Lipid metabolism\n*   Colorectal cancer\n*   Bevacizumab\n*   Biomarker\n\n【13】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【14】ADD ( antiangiogenic drug ), CRC ( colorectal cancer ), ORR ( overall response rate ), OS ( overall survival ), PFS ( progression-free survival ), mCRC ( metastatic colorectal cancer ), FAO ( fatty acids β-oxidation ), SNP ( single nucleotide polymorphisms ), MAF ( minor allele frequency ), ECOG PS ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ), AIM ( ancestry informative markers ), MUFA ( monounsaturated fatty acids ), 3' UTR ( 3′ untranslated regions ), CORECT ( Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary ), CEU ( Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection ), CPT1A ( carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A ), LPCAT1 ( lysolecithin acyltransferase 1 ), LPCAT2 ( lysolecithin acyltransferase 2 ), ACACA ( acetyl-coA carboxylase ), FASN ( fatty acid synthase )\n\n【15】Research in context\n\n【16】### Evidence before this study\n\n【17】Colorectal cancer (CRC) could rely on fatty acids β-oxidation (FAO), the most energetically efficient way to provide sufficient energy for the proliferation and spread of cancer cells, through the elevated exogenous FAs uptake or de novo FA synthesis. We searched PubMed for original studies (with no start date and up to March 31, 2022) to explore the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lipid metabolism (involving FA uptake, FA synthesis, FAO and lipid membrane remodeling) and clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) receiving bevacizumab-based first-line treatment. Terms used in this search were “lipid metabolism”, “bevacizumab”, “colorectal cancer” and “efficacy”. There was a paucity of published literature in this area. _CD36_ A52C polymorphism was reported to be related to the elevated risk of CRC. Hence, the impact of SNPs involved in the lipid metabolism on the efficacy of bevacizumab in mCRC remains unknown.\n\n【18】### Added value of this study\n\n【19】The current study explored the association of SNPs in the lipid metabolism and clinical outcomes in mCRC patients receiving bevacizumab-based first-line treatment, using genetic and clinical data from FOLFIRI-bevacizumab cohorts in randomised trials, FIRE-3 and MAVERICC.

These findings support a possible role of the lipid metabolism pathway in contributing to resistance to anti-VEGF treatment.\n\n【22】Introduction\n------------\n\n【23】Metabolic adaption is a hallmark of cancer. Beyond the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis), certain cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), also rely on fatty acids β-oxidation (FAO), the most energetically efficient way to provide sufficient energy for the proliferation and spread of cancer cells, through the elevated exogenous FAs uptake or de novo FA synthesis. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> In details, cancer cells could enhance the acquisition of exogenous FAs through the upregulation of cell surface fatty acid translocase (e.g., CD36) or fatty acid-binding proteins (e.g., FABP4). The activation of de novo FA synthesis could be mediated by the upregulation of key rate-limiting enzymes of FA synthesis, such as acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACACA) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). ACACA carboxylates acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA, which is further catalysed to the saturated FA palmitate by FASN at the terminal step of FA synthesis. Palmitate could be further converted into long-chain FAs and monounsaturated FAs, which are transported into mitochondria by carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 A (CPT1A) for FAO-mediated ATP production. Besides, accumulated FAs in cancer cells can also be esterified into saturated phospholipids by lysolecithin acyltransferase 1/2 (LPCAT1/2), incorporated into membrane lipids by proliferating tumor cells. <sup>, </sup> Saturated phospholipids are packed more densely, accompanied with the alteration of membrane fluidity, the decrease of receptor internalization and the limitation of drug uptake, leading to the tumor dissemination and the resistance to oxidative stress-induced cell death. The high expression of these molecules (CD36, FABP4, FASN, ACACA, CPT1A, LPCAT1/2) was reported to be associated with malignant phenotype of tumor cells in CRC and could be used as biomarkers for poor prognosis and chemoresistance. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>,</sup>\n\n【24】Bevacizumab, as an anti-VEGF antibody inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, combined with standard chemotherapy is the one of the cornerstones in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, not all patients with mCRC could benefit from bevacizumab-based treatment. Identifying predictive biomarkers and reversing resistance to bevacizumab are clinically critical. Iwamoto et al. revealed that lipid metabolism confers antiangiogenic drug (AAD) resistance in CRC. Mechanically, AAD exacerbated the depletion of oxygen and nutrient in the tumor environment, switching the glucose-dependent to lipid-dependent metabolism, via the release of free FA, increased FA uptake and the activation of FAO pathway. Inhibition of these processes of lipid metabolism may overcome the resistance to AAD in CRC. Incio et al. suggested that hypoxia induced by AAD may also contribute to AAD resistance via the increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and FGF2. Accordingly, accumulating clinical studies show an inverse correlation between obesity and clinical benefits in patients who received AAD. <sup>,</sup>\n\n【25】Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are stable biomarkers of germline background of the host (patient), which may have impacts on the structure, stability and expression of mRNA or protein. For example, the G allele of FBAP4 rs1054135, located on its 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs), was significantly associated with increased tumor recurrence risk of triple-negative breast cancer, probably due to the increased plasma FABP4 levels. CD36 A52C Polymorphism was related to the elevated risk of CRC, which might be linked to its function as not only a long-chain fatty acid translocase but also a scavenger of oxidised low-density lipoprotein. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association between SNPs in the lipid metabolism (involving FA uptake, FA synthesis, FAO and lipid membrane remodeling) and clinical outcomes \\[overall response rate (ORR), progression Free Survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)\\] using genetic and clinical data from FOLFIRI-bevacizumab cohorts in FIRE-3 and MAVERICC. We also examined these associations in the FOLFIRI-cetuximab arm of FIRE-3 as control.\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Study design and patient population\n\n【28】A total of 968 patients with mCRC were enrolled in randomised, open-label FIRE-3 (NCT00433927, from June 23, 2007 to Sept 19, 2012) and MAVERICC (NCT01374425, from August, 2011 to July, 2015). The FOLFIRI regimen was comparable among the two studies as described previously. Treatment cycles were 14 days. On day 1, patients received irinotecan at a dose of 180 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> of body-surface area over 1 or 2 h; leucovorin at a dose of 400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> of body-surface area over 2 h; fluorouracil as an intravenous bolus of 400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> of body-surface area, and then a continuous 46 h infusion of 2400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> of body surface area. Bevacizumab was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg on day 1 every 14 days with no differences between the two trials. Cetuximab was given weekly at the initial dose 400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> of body-surface area over 2 h, followed by a weekly dose of 250 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> of body surface area over an hour. In both trials, treatments continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, complete response, surgical resection, or patient-requested or physician-decided withdrawal of therapy.\n\n【29】Only 399 patients with mCRC receiving FOLFIRI-based treatment with sufficient samples and SNPs data were analysed in our study. Patients treated with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in FIRE-3 and MAVERICC were selected as the discovery cohort (n = 107) and the validation cohort (n = 163) respectively, while those treated with FOLFIRI plus cetuximab in FIRE-3 as the negative control cohort (n = 129). FIRE-3 and MAVERICC trials were approved by the institutional review committees at each centre and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\n\n【30】The study protocols were approved by the institutional review board of each participating institution and was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki as well as the Good Clinical Practice and the reporting recommendations for tumor marker prognostic studies (REMARK) guidelines. The protocols for FIRE-3 and MAVERICC are available on the websites ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00433927 or http://www.klinikum.uni-muenchen.de/CCCLMU-Krebszentrum-Muenchen/download/inhalt/studien/fire3/en/FIRE3\\_EN\\_translation\\_protocolTLO.pdf for FIRE-3; and https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01374425 for MAVERICC).\n\n【31】### Genotyping and selecting polymorphisms\n\n【32】Genomic DNA was genotyped through the OncoArray including 530 K SNP markers (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) as described previously. SNP data quality control and imputation were conducted within the Colorectal Cancer Transdisciplinary (CORECT) Study. Stringent quality control procedures were applied at both the individual and SNP levels as described. Prior imputation, SNPs with call rate below 98% and minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01 in either European or Asian samples were excluded. The imputation panel reported in the prior CORECT study was updated to the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. Seventeen candidate SNPs of genes in FAs uptake ( _CD36_ rs1761667, rs7755, rs1194197; _FABP4_ rs1054135, rs16909187, rs2290201), lipid synthesis ( _FASN_ rs4246444, rs4485435, rs6502051; _ACACA_ rs7211875, rs1714987), FAO ( _CPT1A_ rs2278908, rs11228373) and phosphatidylcholine remodeling ( _LPCAT1_ rs7737692; _LPCAT2_ rs9302667, rs893260, rs837550) were selected using the following criteria as previously described ( Table S1 ): (1) MAF in Caucasians should be equal or greater than 10%, based on Ensemble Genome Browser ( https://www.ensembl.org/index.html ). (2) SNPs with potential biological functions based on published papers or public databases (snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/snpfunc.html). (3) Tag SNPs with R <sup>2 </sup> threshold of 0.8 based on HapMap genotype data within the CEU (Utah residents with Northern and Western European ancestry from the CEPH collection) population.\n\n【33】### Clinical outcomes\n\n【34】ORR was defined as the percentage of patients in a cohort who achieved completed response and partial response to treatment. PFS was defined as time from randomization until disease progression, death or until last follow-up in patients who were alive and remained free of disease progression. OS was defined as time from randomization until death. Patients still alive were censored at the last date of follow-up.\n\n【35】### Statistical analysis\n\n【36】The aim of this study was to identify associations between SNPs within genes involved in the lipid metabolism and clinical outcome in patients with mCRC receiving bevacizumab/cetuximab-based first line treatment, using the dominant model. Possible associations between patient characteristics, ORR and selected SNPs were evaluated using the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. To assess associations between these SNPs and PFS or OS, the log-rank test was conducted in univariable analyses and likelihood ratio tests of parameters from Cox proportional hazards regression in multivariable analyses. Study-specific adjustment covariates in the Cox models included sex, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), primary tumor site, liver-limited disease, and RAS/BRAF status for FIRE-3; ethnicity, sex, age, ECOG PS, primary tumor site, primary tumor resected, number of metastases, and RAS status were included for MAVERICC. The first three principal components computed from ancestry informative markers (AIMs) included on the OncoArray were also included as adjustment covariates for both cohorts. A two-sided _P_ < 0.05 was considered statistically significant, and _P_ \\-values are reported without adjustment for multiplicity. The Cox PH assumptions were evaluated using Schoenfeld residuals. No major violation of the PH assumption was observed. All analyses were performed in R version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Our study was constructed in accordance with REMARK reporting guidelines.\n\n【37】### Role of the funding source\n\n【38】The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. All authors confirm that they had full access to all the analysed data in the study and accept the responsibility to submit for publication.\n\n【39】Results\n-------\n\n【40】### Patient characteristics\n\n【41】Baseline characteristics of patients in the discovery (FIRE-3 FOLFIRI+bevacizumab), validation (MAVERICC FOLFIRI+bevacizumab), and control (FIRE-3 FOLFIRI+cetuximab) cohorts are outlined in Fig. 1 and Table S2 . Right-sided primary tumors ( _p_ < 0.0001), metastases in >2 organs ( _p =_ 0.003), RAS mutation rates ( _p_ < 0.0001) are more prevalent in the bevacizumab arm of MAVERICC, while the resection rate of primary tumors was lowest, compared to those in both bevacizumab and cetuximab arms of FIRE-3. Patients in cetuximab arm had more males than the other two cohorts ( _p =_ 0.037). The median PFS and OS were 11.5 months and 31.4 months in the discovery cohort, 12.5 months and 27.4 months in the validation cohort, and 12.8 months and 49.8 months in the control cohort, respectively.\n\n【42】Fig. 1 **Consort diagram.** SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism. ∗ The number of patients in the SNP analyses varied due to variation in the SNP call rate from SNP to SNP. The call rate for a given SNP is defined as the proportion of individuals in the study for which the corresponding SNP information is not missing. Here, we filter using a call rate of 98% during the process of imputation, meaning we retain SNPs for which there is less than 2% missing data.\n\n【43】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【44】### Predictive and prognostic values of the SNPs involved in the lipid metabolism in the discovery cohort\n\n【45】The association between the selected SNPs involved in the lipid metabolism and clinical outcomes in the discovery cohort was shown in Table S3 and Fig. 2 . Among them, _FASN_ rs4485435, _FASN_ rs6502051 and _ACACA_ rs1714987 were significantly associated with the efficacy of bevacizumab in both uni- and multi-variate analyses ( Table 1 ). Patients with any C allele in _FASN_ rs4485435 (n = 21) had significantly shorter median PFS \\[8.69 months vs 13.48 months, univariate: hazard ratio (HR): 2.88, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.57–5.29, _p =_ 0.00039; multivariate HR: 2.87, 95%CI: 1.4–5.9, _p =_ 0.0068.\\] than those with the G/G genotype (n = 62) ( Fig. 3 A). No significant association between _FASN_ rs4485435 and OS was observed after adjustment for covariates (median OS: 24.69 months vs 41.77 months, univariate: HR: 2.29, 95%CI: 1.15–4.54, _p =_ 0.015, multivariate: HR: 1.87, 95%CI: 0.79–4.43, _p =_ 0.17, Fig. 3 B). Patients with any A allele in _FASN_ 6502051 (n = 72) had significantly shorter median PFS (10.23 months vs 14.89 months, univariate: HR:1.78, 95%CI: 1.07–2.94, _p =_ 0.024; multivariate: HR: 2.01, 95%CI: 1.11–3.66, _p =_ 0.02) than those with the C/C genotype (n = 34) ( Fig. S1A ). Patients carrying any G allele in _ACACA_ rs1714987 (n = 32) showed a significantly longer PFS (13.54 months vs 10.49 months, univariate: HR: 0.56, 95%CI：0.34–0.93, _p =_ 0.023; multivariate: HR: 0.53, 95%CI: 0.3–0.94, _p =_ 0.02) than carriers of C/C (n = 75) ( Fig. S2A ).\n\n【46】Fig. 2 **The potential relationship between the lipid metabolism pathway and the efficacy of bevacizumab.** A.

Patients with any C allele in _FASN_ rs4485435 (n = 39) had significantly shorter median PFS (11.17 months vs 14.06 months) than those with G/G genotype (n = 91) in both univariable (HR: 1.56, 95%CI: 1–2.41, _p =_ 0.047) and multivariable (HR: 2.07, 95%CI: 1.15–3.74, _p =_ 0.02) analyses ( Fig. 3 C and D). No significant association between _FASN_ rs6502051 (median PFS: 12.75 months vs 11.07 months, multivariate HR: 1.04, 95%CI: 0.62–1.77, _p =_ 0.88), _ACACA_ rs1714987 (median PFS: 14.98 months vs 12.32 months, multivariate HR: 0.94, 95%CI: 0.53–1.66, _p =_ 0.83) and PFS in patients with mCRC recieving FOLFIRI/bevacizumab in the MAVERICC trial ( Table 1 , Fig. S1B , Fig. S2B ).\n\n【56】### Evaluation of the predictive values of the SNPs involved in the lipid metabolism in the control cohort\n\n【57】In the control cohort, there was no evidence for associations of _FASN_ rs4485435 (median PFS: 13.54 months vs 10.82 months, multivariate HR: 0.86, 95%CI: 0.51–1.45, _p =_ 0.56), _FASN_ rs6502051 (median PFS: 12.26 months vs 13.28 months, multivariate HR: 1.36, 95%CI: 0.82–2.25, _p =_ 0.23), and _ACACA_ rs1714987 (median PFS: 13.54 months vs 11.77 months, multivariate HR: 0.92, 95%CI: 0.57–1.51, _p =_ 0.75) with PFS in patients with mCRC receiving FOLFIRI/cetuximab ( Table 1 , Table S5 , Fig. 3 E–F, Fig. S1C , Fig. S2C ). Treatment-SNP interaction test confirmed the poor predictive value of _FASN_ rs4485435 for the efficacy of bevacizumab vs cetuximab ( _P_ <sub>interaction-for-PFS </sub> \\= 0.017, P <sub>interaction-for-OS </sub> \\= 0.09) in the FIRE-3 trial ( Fig. S3 ).\n\n【58】Discussion\n----------\n\n【59】The application of bevacizumab suppressed tumor angiogenesis, accompanied by the severe depletion of glucose supply, resulting in a metabolic shift toward FA uptake or de novo lipogenesis to fuel cancer cells. <sup>, </sup> These preclinical data highlight the vital role of the enhanced lipid metabolism in the resistance to anti-angiogenesis treatment. However, the predictive value of genes involved in the lipid metabolism for the efficacy of bevacizumab has never been examined in patients with mCRC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify genetic variants involved in lipid metabolisms that may predict the efficacy of bevacizumab-based first line treatment in patients with mCRC.\n\n【60】Our data suggest that bevacizumab might be a better choice for patients with mCRC carrying _FASN_ rs4485435 G/G allele, identified in the discovery and validation cohorts, while cetuximab for _FASN_ rs4485435 C allele, observed in the control cohort. The association between _FASN_ rs4485425 C allele and shorter PFS remained significant in FOLFIRI/bevacizumab cohorts, when BMI was added as a categorical variable, with categories <25, 25–30, and >30 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> (multivariate: discovery cohort: HR 3.13, 95%CI 1.51–6.52, _p =_ 0.0039; validation cohort: HR 2.14, 95%CI 1.17–3.9, _p =_ 0.015; control cohort: HR: 0.9, 95%CI 0.53–1.53, _p =_ 0.7). Similar to our results, _FASN_ rs4485435 any C allele also exhibited a poor prognosticator for recurrence-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. <sup>, </sup> Mechanically, rs4485435, located in the exon 21 of _FASN_ , may participate in alternative splicing of mRNA, via modifying the binding affinity for splicing factors SF2ASF1/2, SC35, and SRp55, which is described on the SNP website ( https://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/snpfunc.html ). No significant association between _FASN_ rs4485435 and OS in the multivariate analysis in both FIRE-3 and MAVERICC trials. However, the potential effect of _FASN_ rs4485435 on OS in the bevacizumab-based chemotherapy can be noticed. This difference in the effect of _FASN_ rs4485435 between PFS and OS could be due to the subsequent therapies, in consideration that patients receiving bevacizumab-based chemotherapy may further received cetuximab or immune checkpoint inhibitors. Rs6502051, located in the 3′UTR region of _FASN_ , may regulate gene transcription by affecting binding activity of transcription factor ( https://snpinfo.niehs.nih.gov/snpinfo/snpfunc.html ). It was reported that rs6502051 was associated with lower incidence of prostate cancer, which may be associated with the lower levels of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) (25). Conversely, our data showed that rs6502051 any A genotype was associated with shorter PFS in patients with mCRC receiving bevacizumab-based chemotherapy in the FIRE-3, probably due to the context-dependent role of _FASN_ rs6502051 in the tumor progression. _ACACA_ rs1714987 is a missense SNP, located on splicing abolish domain, were predicted to be associated with benign disease ( http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/ ). Consistent with this function, we found _ACACA_ rs1714987C allele was associated with longer PFS in the discovery cohort. However, the impact of _FASN_ rs6502051 and _ACACA_ rs1714987 on the efficacy of bevacizumab was not observed in the validation cohort.\n\n【61】Tumor adaptation to antiangiogenic therapy through a metabolic shift toward the lipid metabolism in tumors, indicated by the upregulation of FASN. The inhibition of FASN could block tumor regrowth and metastatic dissemination after anti-angiogenesis treatment withdrawal. A phase I clinical trial about a FASN inhibitor, TVB-2640, combined with paclitaxel, has shown promising results, indicated by the disease control rate of 70% (NCT02223247). Based on these findings, it would be reasonable to explore whether the combination of TVB-2640 and bevacizumab could produce the greater and more durable antitumor effects in preclinical models of CRC, such as patients derived xenografts, and clinical trials.\n\n【62】Cetuximab combined with standard chemotherapy is the one of the cornerstones in the treatment of RAS/BRAF wildtype and left-sided mCRC. Metabolically, cetuximab blunts carbohydrate metabolism by blocking glucose uptake and glycolysis, with little impact on the microvessels and the supply of oxygen and nutrients. Under the nonmonic condition, free FAs has no impact on cancer cell proliferation. In addition, AMPK activation could overcome KRAS-induced resistance to cetuximab by the inhibition of MCL-1 translation via the suppression of the mTOR pathway. Meanwhile, the upregulation of AMPK could activate FAO pathway to supply energy for the accelerated tumor growth. Consistent with treatment-by-SNP interaction analysis, we speculated that patients with FASN rs4485435 any C allele might benefit from cetuximab, rather than bevacizumab.\n\n【63】Limitations of this work need to be mentioned. First, the retrospective setting of this study may introduce the selection bias, thus, these results need to be validated in prospective clinical trials, including more social and demographic factors, such as smoking and co-morbidities such as diabetes. Besides, ethnicity data was not provided in the FIRE-3, which may influence the multivariate analysis. However, majority of patients were white, as patients were recruited in Germany and Austria. Second, MMR status has not been tested in patients because these two trials were initiated before the publication of NCT01876511. Therefore, MMR status was not accounted for the multivariate analysis. Third, the biological function of the identical SNPs, as well as the associations with the efficacy of bevacizumab, should be further confirmed _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ .\n\n【64】In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, that genetic variants in the lipid metabolism pathway could predict outcomes of bevacizumab-based treatment in patients with mCRC, which may potentially guide personalised treatment decisions. These finding may also provide insights for the combination of a FASN inhibitor and anti-angiogenesis therapy in patients with mCRC. Further _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies are warranted to validate our novel findings.\n\n【65】Contributors\n------------\n\n【66】J. Wang and H.-J. Lenz designed the study and wrote the manuscript. S.

We agree that dementia and amnesia are very rare symptoms and do not represent the typical course of refractory TLE. However, we feel that their optimistic conclusions are based on a very selective interpretation of the passive vocabulary-intelligence test (MWT-B). In this test, patients have to identify a real word among four pseudo-words in rows with increasing difficulty. To succeed, a written target word has to be recognised or a familiar word has to be discriminated from unfamiliar words. Consequently, correct answers could exclusively be based on lexical decisions without the patient knowing the meaning of the word. This ability has been shown to be highly resistant in brain-damaged individuals. One objective of the MWT-B is to provide an estimate of pre-morbid intelligence as a reference value for diagnostics of brain-damaged patients. Several studies showed that most patients with cerebral lesions or dementia are unimpaired in this test, whereas the same patients do worse in standard IQ-tests. The difference between the MWT-B and standard IQ-tests is considered to be a measure of cognitive decline. Therefore, we suspect that the MWT-B alone is an appropriate measure of whether refractory TLE is associated with cognitive decline.\n\n【2】We reanalysed our own test results of 37 consecutive patients (23 men) with refractory TLE (18 left-sided) using the MWT-B (mean IQ 102 \\[SD15\\]) and a full scale IQ measure derived from the German version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Revised (WAIS-R, mean IQ 90·8 \\[21·2\\]). The duration of epilepsy (19·8 \\[12\\] years\\] was taken as the difference between age at investigation (34·3 \\[11\\] years) and the age at epilepsy onset (14·5 \\[8·9\\] years). Correlating the difference between the WAIS-R-IQ and the estimated MWT-B-IQ with the duration of epilepsy we found a negative correlation (r=0·37, p=0·012, single tailed). Generally, IQ values were based on normative data of age-matched controls. Therefore, the negative correlation cannot be attributed to age effects. The figure shows the difference values of the 37 patients as a function of the duration of epilepsy. Patients with a long duration of epilepsy more frequently showed a considerable difference between both IQs compared with patients with a shorter duration of TLE. We suggest that studying the duration of illness-related changes in comprehensive intellectual abilities as reflected by full scale IQs, rather than the ability to recognise a real word among foils, may answer the question as to whether refractory epilepsy leads to a decline of intellectual capacities. These capacities are one of the fundamental dimensions for the diagnosis of dementia. Our data indicate a slow but ongoing decline in intellectual functioning, probably as a result of various transient and chronic brain electric and neurochemical disturbances associated with refractory TLE. <sup>,</sup>\n\n【3】Figure Difference values, of the estimated WAIS-R full scale IQ minus MWT-B-IQ (vocabulary intelligence), as a function of the duration of epilepsy\n\n【4】Show full caption\n\n【5】Data of 37 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy are shown.

Unlike in idiopathic MN where IgG4 prevails, in this patient IgG3 was predominant in glomerular deposits in the absence of circulating anti-phospholipase A <sub>2 </sub> receptor antibodies, suggesting a distinct pathologic process. Here we documented that IgG4 retrieved from the serum of our propositus reacted against carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) at the podocyte surface. In patient's biopsy, glomerular CAII staining increased and co-localized with subepithelial IgG4 deposits along the capillary walls. Patient's IgG4 caused a drop in cell pH followed by mitochondrial dysfunction, excessive ROS production and cytoskeletal reorganization in cultured podocytes. These events promoted mitochondrial superoxide-dismutase-2 (SOD2) externalization on the plasma membrane, becoming recognizable by complement-binding IgG3 anti-SOD2. Among patients with IgG4-related disease only sera of those with IgG4 anti-CAII antibodies caused low intracellular pH and mitochondrial alterations underlying SOD2 externalization. Circulating IgG4 anti-CAII can cause podocyte injury through processes of intracellular acidification, mitochondrial oxidative stress and neoantigen induction in patients with IgG4 related disease. The onset of MN in a subset of patients could be due to IgG4 antibodies recognizing CAII with consequent exposure of mitochondrial neoantigen in the context of multifactorial pathogenesis of disease.\n\n【4】Keywords\n--------\n\n【5】*   IgG4-related disease\n*   Membranous nephropathy\n*   Carbonic anhydrase II\n*   Superoxide dismutase 2\n*   Podocyte\n\n【6】1\\. Introduction\n----------------\n\n【7】Hyper-IgG4-associated abnormalities are common denominators for several autoimmune fibroinflammatory diseases that can affect any organ from the salivary glands to the pancreas or kidneys, collectively referred to as IgG4-related disease \\[ \\]. Characteristic pathological features in various affected sites consist of lymphoplasmacytic infiltration with IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis, and variably elevated levels of IgG4 \\[ \\]. Kidney lesions are usually accompanied by tubulointerstitial nephritis \\[ \\]. Glomerular lesions, including membranous nephropathy (MN), have been reported less frequently \\[ , \\].\n\n【8】We described a 54-year-old male patient with IgG4-related disease manifesting as pancreatitis, Mikulicz disease that later developed nephrotic-range proteinuria, and MN \\[ \\] with glomerular lesions partly different from the idiopathic form. Indeed the predominant immunoglobulin deposited in the renal tissue was IgG3, while staining for IgG4 was weak in the absence of circulating anti-phospholipase A <sub>2 </sub> receptor (PLA <sub>2 </sub> R) antibodies, possibly implying a distinct process. Moreover, no detectable immune complexes were found in the patient's serum \\[ \\]. On the other hand, we found IgG3 reactivity against superoxide-dismutase-2 (SOD2) \\[ \\], a mitochondrial antioxidant previously identified as an autoimmune target in patients with idiopathic MN \\[ \\]. The first aim of this study was to clarify the role of IgG4 antibodies in our patient's renal disease, and cellular mechanisms underlying SOD2 enrichment on the podocyte plasma membrane. We also wanted to establish whether IgG4-related disease and MN development have a common pathogenic event. Addressing those questions in our patient and in four other IgG4-related disease patients without MN, allowed us to recapitulate the pathogenetic chain of events taking advantage of _in vitro_ disease modeling. Here we propose a two-stage model in which IgG4 anti-carbonic anhydrase II (CAII), an autoantigen candidate in IgG4-related disease patients, is critical for altering pH homeostasis, mitochondrial dynamic, and SOD2 corticalization. At a later stage, mislocated SOD2 serves as a target for the binding of IgG3-subtype autoantibodies capable of fixing complement and amplifying podocyte injury, which contribute to the MN lesion, likely favored by individual genetic predisposition.\n\n【9】2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\n【10】### 2.1 Study Participants\n\n【11】We analyzed our propositus diagnosed with IgG4-related disease with autoimmune pancreatitis and Mikulicz disease admitted to the Nephrology Unit of the Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy as reported \\[ \\]. Moreover, we enrolled four additional patients with a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. Sera from patients with IgG4-related disease with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) (IgG4-RD1, IgG4-RD2 and IgG4-RD4) or without renal involvement (IgG4-RD3) were provided by Professor Takao Saito (General Medical Research Center, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan). The research protocols were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Clinical Research Center of the Mario Negri Institute, the Clinical Study Review Board at Fukuoka University Hospital and the Medical Ethics Committee of Kanazawa University. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines.\n\n【12】### 2.2 Total IgG and IgG4 Purification\n\n【13】IgG purification was performed through affinity chromatography using Affi-Prep-Protein A (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) \\[ \\]. Serum was centrifuged (11,000 × _g_ , 20 min) and particulate and lipid fractions were removed. The sample diluted with binding buffer (glycine 1.5 M–NaCl 3 M, pH 8.9) was loaded on the column and eluted with citric acid 0.1 M, pH 3. The eluate was concentrated and dialyzed against PBS (phosphate 10 mM–NaCl 150 mM, pH 7.3) with Amicon concentrators (Amicon Ultra-15 100 KD, Millipore, Temecula, CA). IgG4 purification was performed using affinity chromatography with CaptureSelect IgG4 (Hu) affinity matrix (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) containing a 12 kDa Llama antibody fragment recognizing human IgG4. The serum was applied to the column and eluted with glycine 0.1 M, pH 3. Sample was concentrated and dialyzed against PBS with Amicon concentrators. To prevent damage to immunoglobulins due to exposure to the acidic medium, for both total IgG and IgG4 purification, during the elution step the pH was continuously adjusted to neutrality by adding 1 M Tris pH 9 to the collecting tube.\n\n【14】### 2.3 Cell Culture and Incubations\n\n【15】Conditionally immortalized human podocytes (kindly provided by Prof. M.A. Saleem, Children's Renal Unit and Academic Renal Unit, University of Bristol, Southmead Hospital, Bristol) were differentiated for 12 days as previously described \\[ \\]. In preliminary experiments, we found that the patient's serum at the dilution of 1:3 had no cytotoxic effect (data not shown). Podocytes were incubated for different time intervals with RPMI 1640 medium (medium), H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> (150 μM), patient's serum (1:3), total IgG (1 mg/ml) or purified IgG4 (100 μg/ml) from the patient or from healthy volunteers (n = 3). To document the effect of the binding of anti-CAII IgG4 on SOD2 expression, podocytes were exposed for 15 h to anti-CAII antibody (5 μg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) or to normal IgG (5 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). In additional experiments, podocytes were exposed for 15 h to the patient's serum (1:3) that was pre-incubated with purified CAII (100 μg/ml for 6 h at 4 °C) to saturate the binding of IgG4 anti-CAII. To study the role of reactive oxygen species in F-actin remodeling, the SOD2 mimetic manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin (mnTBAP) (100 μM, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used. The effect of the carbonic anhydrase II inhibitor acetazolamide (500 μM) on intracellular pH was also investigated. In selected experiments, sera (1:3) from other patients with IgG4-related disease were used.\n\n【16】### 2.4 Immunofluorescence Analysis on Cultured Podocytes\n\n【17】Differentiated podocytes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA) and 4% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 2% FBS, 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% bovine gelatin in PBS 1 ×. Cells were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-SOD2 antibody (1:500, Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) or anti-CAII antibody (1:10,000, Abcam) followed by incubation with the appropriate Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). For colocalization analysis, cells were then incubated with a FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG3 (1:25, Sigma-Aldrich) or with a FITC-conjugated anti-C3 (1:25, Dako A/S, Glostrup, Denmark). CAII expression was evaluated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-CAII antibody (1:200, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by a goat anti-rabbit Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). To study F-actin rearrangement, fixed podocytes were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) and then incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin (20 U/ml, Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich). Negative controls were obtained by omitting primary antibodies. Samples were examined using a confocal inverted laser microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The quantification of externalized SOD2 on the plasma membrane and the count of podocytes with peripheral F-actin distribution were performed on 15 random fields per sample. Specifically, the area corresponding to the SOD2 staining was measured in pixels by using the Image J 1.40 g software and normalized for the number of nuclei identified by DAPI staining.\n\n【18】### 2.5 Podocyte Subcellular Fraction and Whole Extract Preparation\n\n【19】The subcellular fractionation of human podocytes was performed as previously described \\[ \\] with minor modifications. After incubations, cells were gently scraped and incubated in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 200 μM PMSF, 1 mM benzamidine, 10 μg/ml pepstatin and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 20 min on ice and then lysed by sonication. An aliquot of the total cell lysate (HPE) was saved for Western blot analysis and the remaining sample was centrifuged (1,000 _xg_ , 10 min, 4 °C) to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was centrifuged at 31,000 _xg_ for 60 min to pellet crude plasma membranes (CPM).\n\n【20】### 2.6 Western Blot Analysis\n\n【21】Podocyte whole extracts (20 μg), membrane extracts (20 μg), recombinant human GST-tagged carbonic-anhydrase-II (rhCAII, 0.5 μg; Abnova, St. Taipei, Taiwan) were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and blotted on PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The membranes were blocked with 0.1% TWEEN 20 and 0.5% powdered milk in PBS 1 ×. The reactivity of sera from patients with IgG4-related disease and healthy subjects (n = 6) against CAII was tested by blotting membranes with serum diluted 1:10 followed by mouse anti-human IgG4-HRP antibody (clone HP6025, 1:1,000; Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MA). To confirm the specific reactivity of IgG4 against CAII, membranes were stripped and reprobed with a rabbit anti-human CAII antibody (1:10,000; Abcam) followed by a goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:5,000; Sigma-Aldrich) antibody. To assess the reactivity of sera from patients with IgG4-related disease against SOD2, recombinant human GST-tagged SOD2 (rSOD2, 0.6 μg, Abnova) was electrophoresed as above and membranes were blotted with serum diluted 1:10 followed by mouse anti-human IgG3-HRP antibody (1:1,000; Life Technologies). To screen the reactivity of IgG subclasses against SOD2 and CAII in patients' sera, recombinant human GST-tagged SOD2 (rSOD2, 0.6 μg, Abnova) and purified CAII (pCAII, 0.5 μg, Sigma-Aldrich) were electrophoresed as above and membranes were blotted with patient's serum diluted 1:10 followed by mouse anti-human IgG1-HRP antibody (clone HP6069, 1:1,000; Life Technologies), mouse anti-human IgG2-HRP antibody (clone HP6014, 1:500; Life Technologies), mouse anti-human IgG3-HRP antibody (clone HP6047, 1:500; Life Technologies) and mouse anti-human IgG4-HRP antibody (clone HP6025, 1:1,000; Life Technologies). Bands were visualized with the ECL Western blotting Detection Reagent (Pierce/Celbio, Pero, Italy).\n\n【22】### 2.7 Intracellular pH Determination\n\n【23】The method was previously described \\[ \\] and calibrated by using the following procedure. Podocytes were loaded with 8 μM BCECF-AM (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen) for 15 min in RPMI 1640 medium at 37 °C. The cells were washed and incubated for 10 min with a modified Ringer solution adjusted to different pH values (125 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl <sub>2 </sub> , 1 mM CaCl <sub>2 </sub> , 20 mM Hepes) supplemented with nigericin (10 μM, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). The fluorescence intensities were then determined at the cellular level by the multimode microplate reader TECAN Infinite M200® PRO (Tecan Group Ltd., Mannedorf, Schweiz) at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm, and the values were used to generate a calibration curve. To evaluate changes in intracellular pH after podocyte stimulation, cells were incubated with 8 μM BCECF-AM in the last 15 min of the stimuli. The fluorescence intensity was determined as above and the intracellular pH was extrapolated from the calibration curve.\n\n【24】### 2.8 Mitochondrial Morphology and Membrane Potential Detection\n\n【25】The fluorescent probe MitoTracker® Red (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), which covalently binds to mitochondrial proteins by reacting with free thiol groups of cysteine residues regardless of membrane potential, and JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen), a mitochondrial membrane potential sensor, were used to monitor mitochondrial mass and membrane potential, respectively. The MitoTracker® (250 nM) or JC-1 (5 μg/ml) was added to podocytes in the last 30 min of the stimuli. Cells were then rinsed twice in cold PBS 1 × and fixed. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Samples were examined under confocal inverted laser microscopy (LSM 510 Meta).\n\n【26】### 2.9 Mitochondrial ROS Production\n\n【27】Mitochondrial ROS were measured using MitoSOX™ Red, a live-cell-permeant mitochondrial superoxide indicator (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen). Cells were exposed to 5 μM MitoSOX added to the medium for the final 30 min of the treatment. Cells were collected by trypsinization, washed and mitochondrial superoxide was determined by FACS (FACS Canto, BD Biosciences, MI, Italy). MitoSOX Red was excited by laser at 510 nm wavelength and data collected at 580 nm (FL2) channel. The data were expressed as mean intensity of MitoSOX fluorescence and % of MitoSOX fluorescent cells.\n\n【28】### 2.10 Cell Fixation and Embedding for Electron Microscopy\n\n【29】Cells seeded on Thermanox coverslips were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde and 0.01% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and then embedded in LR White resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) according to the standard protocol. Briefly, cells were quickly dehydrated in a series of ethanol solutions (30, 40, 50, 60, 70%; 10 min each), and then incubated with a mix of 70% ethanol/resin (1:1) for 30 min, followed by pure resin. Samples were infiltrated overnight with a fresh portion of pure resin at 4 °C and then LR White resin was polymerized at 4 °C under UV light.\n\n【30】### 2.11 Immunogold Labeling\n\n【31】Fragments of kidney biopsies from the archives of the Nephrology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy, were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde and 0.01% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, dehydrated through ascending grades of alcohol and embedded in LRW resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, EMS). Ultrathin sections (120 nm thick) were cut and mounted on 100-mesh copper grids. Antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, and microwaved for 4–5 min. Non-specific labeling was blocked by 1% BSA in PBS and then sections were incubated with primary antibodies rabbit anti-human SOD2 (1:100; Millipore) and rabbit anti-human CAII (1:5,000, Abcam) followed by 12-nm gold conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Sections were then contrasted with uranyl acetate. Ultrathin sections were examined and images were acquired using a Philips Morgagni transmission electron microscope (FEI Company, Eindhoven, The Netherlands).\n\n【32】### 2.12 Immunofluorescence Analysis on Renal Tissue\n\n【33】Kidney biopsy from our patient from the archives of Nephrology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy, was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in OCT compound and used for immunofluorescence analysis. In addition, renal biopsies from an uninvolved portion of kidney collected from tumor nephrectomy specimens were obtained from 8 patients and used as controls. Written informed consent was obtained from all these patients. Sections (3 μm) were air-dried, fixed with cold acetone and washed with PBS. After blocking non-specific sites with 1% BSA, slides were incubated with rabbit anti-human SOD2 (1:50, Millipore), rabbit anti-human CAII (1:600, Abcam) and mouse anti-human podocalyxin (1:150, gift from Professor Robert Atkins, Department of Nephrology, Monash Medical Centre, Clayton, VIC, Australia) followed by the species-specific Cy3 or FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). IgG4 deposits were immunolocalized by FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG4 (1:50, Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Negative controls were obtained by omitting primary antibodies from adjacent sections. Fluorescence was examined using an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (LMS 510 Meta). Z-stack glomerular images were collected with a spacing of 0.37 μm. The co-localization areas were visualized in each confocal optical section within the Z-stack by using appropriate software (LSM 510 Meta).\n\n【34】### 2.13 Electron Microscopy Analysis of Mitochondria in Renal Biopsy\n\n【35】Renal biopsy samples were processed using the standard technique for transmission electron microscopy. Briefly, the fragments (1 mm <sup>3 </sup> ) were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, and dehydrated in alcohol for embedding in Epon resin. Ultrathin sections (100 nm) were cut on an EM UC7 ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany), collected on copper grids, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate for analysis.\n\n【36】### 2.14 Statistical Analysis\n\n【37】Results are expressed as mean ± SE. Data analysis was performed using the computer software Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego USA). Comparisons were made by analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post hoc test or unpaired or paired Student's T test as appropriate. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.\n\n【38】### 2.15 Funding\n\n【39】The project was supported by a grant from the Halpin Foundation, Inc. (Jupiter, USA) and a contribution from Minetti S.p.a (Bergamo, Italy). These funding sources did not have any role in the manuscript.\n\n【40】3\\. Results\n-----------\n\n【41】### 3.1 Patient parameters\n\n【42】Patient IgG4-RD1 is a 73-year-old male with a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease involving the lung and TIN. His laboratory parameters at time of sampling were: serum creatinine 0.79 mg/dl, protein excretion 77 mg/gCr, total IgG 3426 mg/dl and IgG4 1230 mg/dl.\n\n【43】Patient IgG4-RD2 is a 61-year-old male with a history of IgG4-related disease involving the lacrimal glands, salivary glands, and lung. In this patient a diagnosis of TIN was made. The patient suffered from a MALT-lymphoma and underwent surgery for a renal carcinoma. At time of sampling laboratory parameters were: serum creatinine 1.32 mg/dl, protein excretion 500 mg/gCr, total IgG 1876 mg/dl and IgG4 628 mg/dl.\n\n【44】Patient IgG4-RD3 is 54-year-old female with IgG4-related disease involving the lung, lymph nodes and aorta. She had autoimmune pancreatitis. The following values of laboratory parameters were found at the time of sampling: serum creatinine 0.71 mg/dl, protein excretion negative, total IgG 1968 mg/dl and IgG4 536 mg/dl.\n\n【45】Patient IgG4-RD4 is a 75-year-old male with IgG4-related disease involving the lacrimal glands and aorta. He suffered from autoimmune pancreatitis and is affected by TIN. His laboratory parameters at time of sampling were: serum creatinine 1.34 mg/dl, protein excretion 0.2 g/day, total IgG 5380 mg/dl and IgG4 587 mg/dl.\n\n【46】### 3.2 The Patient's IgG4 Specifically Recognizes Carbonic Anhydrase II on Cultured Podocytes\n\n【47】We found that IgG4 in our patient's serum recognized a recombinant GST-tagged CAII protein with a molecular weight of 55 kDa ( Fig. 1 A , first lane) as well as a 30 kDa protein corresponding to CAII in protein extracts from cultured human podocytes ( Fig. 1 A, second and third lanes, arrowhead). The possible existence of other unknown antigens could not be excluded because the patient's IgG4 also recognized other bands in the podocyte extracts ( Fig. 1 A, second lane). No IgG4 reactivity against CAII was found in sera from healthy subjects ( Fig. 1 A, right lane). Western blot analysis of purified CAII protein revealed that IgG4 was the predominant IgG subclass of anti-CAII antibodies in the patient's serum while reactivity of other IgG subclasses was absent ( Fig. 1 B). In podocytes, CAII clearly localized in the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery of permeabilized cells ( Fig. 1 C, left). We also found high CAII membrane expression in non-permeabilized cells ( Fig. 1 C, middle). CAII membrane localization was confirmed by the detection of a 30 kDa band using Western blotting in podocyte crude plasma membranes ( Fig. 1 C, right). Immunogold labeling confirmed CAII cytoplasmic and membrane expression in podocytes in a control subject's biopsy as shown in Fig. 1 D.\n\n【48】Fig. 1 Patient's IgG4 recognized CAII on podocytes.\n\n【49】Show full caption\n\n【50】(A) Western blotting of the 55 kDa recombinant human GST-tagged CAII (rhCAII, 0.5 μg) or human podocyte extracts (HPE, 20 μg) with patient's (first and second lanes) or control's serum (fourth lane).

CAII was also expressed in tubuli of both control subjects, as previously reported \\[ \\] and the IgG4-related disease patient ( Fig. 2 A and B). Double immunostaining with CAII and the podocyte marker podocalyxin showed that CAII localized in podocytes ( Fig. 2 C). The co-localization was also confirmed in z-axis, as reported in Supplementary Fig. 1 . In patient's glomeruli, double immunostaining documented that CAII strongly colocalized with deposited IgG4 ( Fig. 2 D). The co-localization between CAII and IgG4 was robust, albeit partial, and consistently present along the z-axis ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Triple immunostaining revealed that CAII and IgG4 colocalized with podocalyxin ( Fig. 2 E). No IgG4 staining was found in renal biopsies of control subjects ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ).\n\n【54】Fig. 2 Glomerular CAII increased and co-localized with IgG4 deposits in podocytes in patient's biopsy.\n\n【55】Show full caption\n\n【56】(A and B) Representative images of CAII immunofluorescence in controls' (A) and patient's (B) glomeruli.

We compared the effect of acetazolamide, a known CAII pharmacologic inhibitor, on intracellular pH with that of IgG4 immunopurified from the patient's serum. The intracellular pH time-dependently decreased in cultured podocytes after acetazolamide exposure ( Fig. 3 A ). The patient's IgG4, but not the IgG4 isolated from healthy volunteers (control's IgG4), caused a pronounced drop in pH to very low levels, reproducing an even more powerful effect than that reached by the CAII inhibiting action of acetazolamide ( Fig. 3 A). Immunofluorescence analysis in cultured podocytes showed fragmentation of the mitochondrial network after exposure to the patient's IgG4, but not to the control's ( Fig. 3 B, left). This was associated with collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential ( Fig. 3 B, right) as revealed by a red-to-green shift of the fluorescence emission of the mitochondrial potential-sensitive probe. A similar effect on mitochondria was observed in podocytes exposed to hydrogen peroxide (H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> ) ( Fig. 3 B), known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which mediate mitochondrial dysfunction. Electron microscopy analysis of the patient's renal biopsy showed mitochondrial alterations with matrix loss and cristae disorganization, which appears rather consistent with the _in vitro_ findings. Those changes were variably associated with dense cytoskeletal-like cytoplasmic strands and junctional abnormalities ( Fig. 3 C). Podocyte exposure to either IgG4 from our patient or H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> triggered mitochondrial generation of superoxide anion as detected by the fluorescent dye MitoSOX at both 6 and 15 h ( Fig. 3 D and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). The patient's IgG4 induced only at 15 h a corticalization of F-actin filaments that, in contrast, were distributed across the cell body in the unstimulated or control's IgG4-treated podocytes ( Fig. 3 E). H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> also caused F-actin rearrangement to a lesser extent than the patient's IgG4 ( Fig. 3 E), suggesting a role for oxidative stress in cytoskeletal alteration. This was confirmed by the addition of the antioxidant MnTBAP, a mitochondrial-targeted SOD2-mimetic, which prevented F-actin corticalization in podocytes incubated with the patient's IgG4 ( Fig. 3 E).\n\n【60】Fig. 3 Cell acidification, mitochondrial alterations and ROS-dependent cytoskeletal dysfunction induced by patient's IgG4.\n\n【61】Show full caption\n\n【62】(A) Fluorimetric assay detecting intracellular pH in podocytes exposed to control's or patient's IgG4 (100 μg/ml), control medium (medium) or acetazolamide (ACZT, 500 nM). °°p < 0.01 vs control's IgG4; \\*p < 0.05, \\*\\*p < 0.01 vs medium (n = 4 experiments).

Exposure to the patient's IgG4 or H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> resulted in a significant increase in SOD2 staining on the podocyte surface ( Fig. 4 A and B ). However, only the patient's IgG4 was able to elicit the SOD2 cluster formation on the podocyte membrane ( Fig. 4 A and C). The control's IgG4 had no effect ( Fig. 4 A–C). The patient's IgG4-induced SOD2 externalization was dependent on mitochondrial dysfunction, since Cyclosporin A – an inhibitory agent of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore \\[ \\] – significantly attenuated SOD2 expression on the podocyte surface ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ). To further prove the functional link between anti-CAII antibody and SOD2 externalization, non-permeabilized cultured human podocytes were incubated with a specific anti-CAII antibody. After 15-hour incubation, a strong presence of SOD2 at the podocyte surface was observed ( Fig. 4 D, middle panel). SOD2 externalization was not detected when podocytes were exposed to normal IgG ( Fig. 4 D, right panel). In an additional set of experiments, cultured human podocytes were exposed to patient's serum either alone or following pre-exposure to purified CAII to specifically saturate the CAII binding sites of the patient's IgG4. The patient's serum alone elicited the formation of clustered SOD2 on the cell surface ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ), effect that was not obtained when the patient's serum was previously pre-incubated with purified CAII ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).\n\n【66】Fig. 4 Patient's IgG4 leads to SOD2 externalization to podocyte plasma membrane.\n\n【67】Show full caption\n\n【68】(A) Representative images of SOD2 expression (red) on the surface of cultured human podocytes exposed 15 h to control's or patient's IgG4 (100 μg/ml), control medium (medium) or H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> (150 μM).

The patient's serum, as a source of complement and IgG, also induced complement activation and C3 recruitment to SOD2 ( Fig. 5 B). No effects were observed when the control's IgG or sera were used ( Fig. 5 A and B). To further assess the potential role of the SOD2/anti-SOD2 system in the MN pattern found in our patient, we determined the glomerular localization of SOD2 in biopsy tissue. SOD2 was not detectable in normal kidney glomeruli. We found granular peripheral SOD2 staining along the patient's glomerular capillary walls ( Fig. 5 C). This staining in MN reflected extracellular localization and accumulation of both antigen and anti-SOD2 antibodies in subepithelial deposits \\[ \\].

Discussion\n--------------\n\n【81】The majority of patients with IgG4-related disease, particularly when associated with autoimmune pancreatitis, have circulating IgG4 subclass antibodies that recognize CAII \\[ , \\]. The patient with hyper-IgG4 described here does indeed have both circulating IgG4 reacting with CAII and MN, and we disclose a functional link between the binding of the patient's IgG4 to podocytes and the intracellular events underlying the development of the MN lesion. CAII is expressed in most segments of the human kidney, including proximal and distal tubules \\[ \\]. In addition to its typical cytosolic distribution, CAII has been found to localize close to the plasma membrane where it interacts with the electroneutral Cl <sup>− </sup> /HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> anion exchanger 1, giving rise to a transport metabolon wherein HCO <sub>3 </sub> <sup>− </sup> is transferred from CAII to the anion exchanger, maximizing its cotransporter activity \\[ \\].\n\n【82】Here we found that podocytes, both _in vitro_ and in kidney-biopsy tissue sections, express CAII. Furthermore, IgG4 purified from the patient's serum elicits early intracellular acidification with profound effects on podocyte homeostasis as a likely consequence of the interaction of IgG4 autoantibodies with membrane CAII. The drop in cytosolic pH over time is even greater than the acidification elicited by a specific pharmacologic CAII inhibitor, indicating direct and potent inhibitory action of the patient's IgG4 on podocyte CAII that can behave as a functional pathogenic target. Notably, this interaction is reminiscent of the ability of non-complement-fixing IgG4 autoantibodies to interact with an antigen in terms of inhibiting its function, as has been shown for IgG4 to muscle-specific kinase in patients with myasthenia gravis \\[ , \\] and suggested for anti-PLA <sub>2 </sub> R antibodies in patients with idiopathic MN \\[ , \\]. In this regard, in the case of our patient, the co-localization of CAII and IgG4 deposited in the glomeruli indicates that CAII is indeed present in the subepithelial immune deposits. This observation offers an important clue, which suggests that anti-CAII antibodies, which in our patient are restricted to the IgG4 subtype, could be responsible for initiating the disease.\n\n【83】Relying on evidence of mitochondrial disruption after early acidification in response to injurious stimuli \\[ \\], we next analyzed the consequences of low pH on mitochondrial functions. Our data that the decrease of podocyte pH preceded mitochondrial alteration and fragmentation provide a link between IgG4-driven intracellular acidification and perturbation of mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondrial dysfunction in IgG4-treated podocytes was associated with massive ROS production, which in turn promoted F-actin cytoskeletal alterations. In this regard, an important role for ROS in inducing cytoskeletal reorganization in injured podocytes has been documented \\[ \\].\n\n【84】Another major finding of the study consists in the externalization of the mitochondrial enzyme SOD2 in clusters in direct response to the patient's IgG4-CAII ligation _in vitro_ . The causal role of IgG4 anti-CAII challenge on SOD2 externalization is provided by the combined evidence that incubating the cells with an anti-CAII antibody induced the mislocation of SOD2 on the podocyte surface and that the saturation of patient's serum antibodies with purified CAII prevented the SOD2 mobilization. This would indicate a direct effect of the patient's IgG4 anti-CAII in the activation of intracellular signaling that leads to SOD2 trafficking to the podocyte plasma membrane. The observed mitochondrial fragmentation along with the consequent altered membrane potential in response to anti-CAII IgG4 could affect the release of matrix proteins from failing mitochondria \\[ \\], including SOD2. The finding that prevention of mitochondrial depolarization attenuated IgG4-induced SOD2 externalization on the membrane of damaged podocytes points to mitochondrial dysfunction as the major cause of SOD2 mislocation after exposure to the patient's IgG4.\n\n【85】Protein membrane trafficking in podocytes is regulated by cytoskeletal F-actin filaments \\[ \\] and cytoskeletal alterations have been associated with SOD2 mistargeting from spoiled mitochondria to the cell surface \\[ \\]. Here we suggest that the patient's IgG4-induced cytoskeletal F-actin corticalization could drag the released SOD2 toward the plasma membrane and influence its spatial patterning in podocytes. In line with our findings, a local enrichment of cortical actin filaments was found to regulate nanocluster formation of membrane proteins \\[ \\]. The role of cytoskeletal remodeling in SOD2 cluster formation rests on the evidence that H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> , while promoting strong SOD2 externalization, did not induce the SOD2 cluster formation. This difference could conceivably be a consequence of the lower capacity of H <sub>2 </sub> O <sub>2 </sub> to induce F-actin corticalization compared to IgG4. The consequent C3 deposition on the cell surface indicates that the externalized SOD2 is the target for the binding of the patient's IgG3, leading to complement activation. Since SOD2 becomes recognizable on the podocyte surface via a process that can be related to the patient's IgG4 and is induced with disease, SOD2 behaves like a neoantigen, as other intracellular proteins, which are not abundantly expressed in the normal glomerulus \\[ \\]. Given the absence of detectable circulating immune complexes in our patient and according to known disease models, these findings converged to suggest intraglomerular interaction between IgG3 and SOD2 further shaping the MN lesion in the presence of anti-CAII IgG4 (see scheme Fig. 6 E).\n\n【86】Although SOD2 has been suggested as a possible neoantigen in non-PLA <sub>2 </sub> R associated MN, it is not clear whether or not the anti-SOD2 antibodies could worsen the existing disease or be informative as to its immunologic duration \\[ \\]. Together, our data lend further support to the view that SOD2 is not a primary antigen in MN, and in our patient. On the other hand, the early nature of anti-CAII IgG4-dependent podocyte injury could be suggested by findings that among additional patients with IgG4-related disease, only the sera of those with IgG4 anti-CAII antibodies promoted _in vitro_ externalization and clustering of SOD2. The fact that not all of them could develop full-blown MN can be explained by multiple factors that possibly include genetic risks, epitope spreading, preformed or natural IgG against SOD2, duration, or insults such as a microbial infection as suggested for PLA <sub>2 </sub> R-associated MN \\[ \\]. Duration in particular might be important both in primary and secondary forms of the disease. In patients with autoimmune pathologies like systemic lupus erythematosus, a series of autoimmune changes leads to the appearance of different autoantibodies that usually precede the onset of clinical illness by many years \\[ \\]. Remarkably in this context, in all IgG4-related disease patients described to date, CAII antibodies were mutually exclusive with PLA2R antibodies, like the recently recognized Thrombospondin Type-1 Domain-Containing 7A antibodies do in idiopathic MN patients \\[ \\], which would be entirely consistent with CAII as a primary target in podocytes at least in our patient.\n\n【87】Advances in identifying novel biomarkers, including serological signatures and early key autoantibodies, provide a predictable tool for diagnosing and screening for disease while patients are still asymptomatic. Likewise, the identification of autoantibodies involved in early-stage MN pathogenesis, possibly including IgG4 anti-CAII antibodies in a subset of patients, may provide a crucial site for potential therapeutic intervention to halt the initial MN lesions and the ensuing clinical onset of the pathology.\n\n【88】The following are the supplementary data related to this article.\n\n【89】Supplementary Fig. 1 CAII/PDX co-localization area (yellow) at different levels along the biopsy's z-axis in a patient's glomerulus.

Born on Jan 17, 1917, in Albany, NY, USA, he died on April 17, 2011, in Manhattan, NY, aged 94 years.\n\n【3】How disconcerting to start the day with a psychiatric disorder but finish without it—not because of some dramatic therapeutic intervention but because a group of doctors have decided, on a vote, that your “illness” does not exist. Such was the experience of gay men and women on Dec 15, 1973, when the American Psychiatric Association (APA), under the leadership of Alfred Freedman, changed the official medical view of the nature of homosexuality. Nor was this the only instance in which Freedman's professional interests and social concerns came together.\n\n【4】During a long career, which began in 1941 with his graduation from the University of Minnesota Medical School, issues ranging from poverty to torture made appearances on his radar. An internship at Harlem Hospital in New York was his first experience of providing medical services to a poor community. After the attack on Pearl Harbour he joined the armed services as a medical officer, leaving in 1946 to train in pathology at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital. His intention was to study the biological basis of human behaviour; but he left a year later to work in the Army Chemical Center. His laboratory studies there on the mechanism of convulsions, although successful, were no substitute for clinical work, and the summer of 1948 found him training in psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital. 2 years later he joined the hospital's Child Psychiatry Unit, where he stayed until 1954.\n\n【5】Freedman moved to Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn to build up its child psychiatric service. There, he studied the influence of biological and social factors during pregnancy and early childhood. 5 years later he became head of the Department of Psychiatry at New York Medical College in East Harlem. Michael Blumenfield, emeritus professor of psychiatry at the college, first met Freedman in 1980. “Working in metropolitan areas he was very involved in developing programmes for substance abuse and, as a child psychiatrist, in identifying the multiplying effects of poverty and mental illness”, he says.\n\n【6】The APA presidency came at a time when its membership was preoccupied with the Vietnam war and the status of homosexuality as a disease. In a 2007 interview, Freedman recalled the conservative nature of the APA. “From the end of World War II until the 1970s the APA had been run by a clique. It was an old boys' club. The nominating committee would present a slate with a single candidate for each office, and they'd automatically be elected.” Freedman was approached by a reformist group, the Committee of Concerned Psychiatrists, who asked him to stand as president. He agreed and, by the narrowest of majorities, won. He then backed a resolution put forward by APA member Robert Spitzer to remove homosexuality from the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ (DSM). This was an important decision says psychiatrist Jack Drescher, editor emeritus of the _Journal of Gay and Lesbian Mental Health_ . “So much of the stigma of homosexuality was tied up with the medical diagnosis. With its removal from the _DSM_ , discussions about homosexuality left the realm of medicine.” This, Drescher believes, was the first and necessary step without which subsequent developments would have been impossible.\n\n【7】The APA too changed under Freedman's presidency. One of his successors, Carolyn Robinowitz, who held the post in 2007–08, says he made the organisation more socially engaged. “Now we take it for granted, but he was an agent of that change. A remarkable man, very open to other people's ideas.” Freedman travelled to the Soviet Union. “At that time”, says Blumenfield, “they were putting political prisoners in psychiatric hospitals. He spoke out against it. As president of the APA he had a lot of clout.” When he stepped down from academic psychiatry Freedman continued speaking out. With another psychiatrist, Abe Halpern of New York Medical College, he argued against the involvement of psychiatrists in executions. “He also maintained that psychiatrists should have nothing to do with training people to interrogate prisoners or participate in any way”, says Blumenfield. More recently Freedman criticised events in Guantanamo Bay and the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. He maintained an interest in psychiatry to the end of his life. “You didn't think of him as person who was old”, says Robinowitz. “Just as someone who was still excited by new knowledge.” He leaves a wife, Marcia, and two sons.\n\n【8】Article info\n------------\n\n【9】### Publication history\n\n【10】Published: 28 May 2011\n\n【11】### Identification\n\n【12】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60773-3\n\n【13】### Copyright\n\n【14】© 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is primarily elective, is sometimes done by religious scholars, and is considered sacred to the Jewish and Muslim faiths. Yet many today consider it to be a human-rights violation. The global debate over religious circumcision erupted anew in June, 2012, after a regional court in Cologne, Germany, banned the procedure.\n\n【1】Other countries imposed similar bans, and amidst the furore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released its _Circumcision Policy_ Statement on Aug 27. The guidelines declare that the benefits of circumcision for newborn boys outweigh the risks, especially with regard to a decrease in risk of acquiring a sexually transmitted infection. The statement supports circumcision for those who choose it for religious reasons, but does not recommend the procedure be done on all newborn boys. The AAP calls for the operation to be available to all US families who request it, and for it to be covered by Medicaid.\n\n【2】In 1999, the AAP declared that despite the potential health benefits of circumcision in newborn boys, they felt unable to recommend the practice. By 2008, US circumcision rates had fallen from 67% to 55–57%. On Aug 20, Seema Kacker and colleagues estimated in Archives _of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine_ that a continuing decline in circumcisions could total in excess of US$4 billion in associated health-care costs in the next 10 years.\n\n【3】The AAP's position change is likely to cause a resurgence of requests for non-medically indicated circumcision of newborn boys, and debate between US presidential candidates over who should foot the bill. To clinicians, however, patient safety must remain the priority. Respectful dialogue between clinicians and religious leaders, and effective training schemes for both allies, are needed to ensure that all circumcisions are done in safe and sterile conditions, with adequate pain control.\n\n【4】**This online publication has been corrected.

Likewise, the number of benign and malignant nodules that were diagnosed correctly and incorrectly by the radiologists without ThyNet, ThyNet-only, and the radiologists with ThyNet should also be presented along with the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.\n\n【2】ThyNet's diagnostic ability to identify follicular thyroid carcinomas should be properly evaluated in accordance with actual clinical settings, in which, many types of benign (nodular hyperplasia, follicular adenoma, and hurthle cell adenoma) and malignant (follicular thyroid carcinomas, Hurthle cell carcinoma, and follicular variant papillary thyroid carcinoma) nodules with follicular patterns that are difficult to differentiate. Proportioning the number of benign and malignant subtypes in the training set and test set A, B, and C to be representative of the real clinical setting would empower ThyNet with greater clinical relevance. Likewise, presenting ThyNet's performance results in diagnosing each pathological subtypes from the whole group would help readers to comprehensively understand the ability of the AI.\n\n【3】We declare no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Government policies provide incentives for large-scale agriculture and cattle ranching, but growing numbers of producers are investing in cattle production. In Panama, after World War II, the government encouraged rural colonisation, and in 1950–60, many migrants from the hinterlands settled close to the transit zone of the Panama canal. This waterway triggered a process of urbanisation and the formation of an internal beef market. “Colonisation of the jungle” became a development policy associated with the expansion of the cattle front and transformed the landscape from wet forest to pasture. In the late 1940s forests still covered 70% of the Isthmus, but by the 1970s 80% of the forests had been destroyed, giving way to pasture lands.\n\n【2】These environmental changes in Panama favoured the proliferation of _Attalea butyracea_ , which formed large forests of palm trees, especially in the oriental region of the Panama Canal. _A butyracea_ is the primary biotope of _Rhodnius pallescens_ —the main species of insect vector that transmits _Trypanosoma cruzi_ , the causative agent of Chagas' disease—and a good ecological indicator of risk areas. Chagas' disease is characterised by developing chronic symptoms up to 40 years after contamination. By increasing the distribution and the densities of this palm tree, human activities stimulated and concentrated the population of wild insects. Most cases of Chagas' disease occur in communities adjacent to the canal zone, which have probably been infected since the deforestation period.\n\n【3】The high frequency with which insects are captured today inside houses in the canal zone, the high rate of infection by _T cruzi_ (60% of the adult population), the high rate of _A butyracea_ infestation (up to 100%), and occasional registry of cases of Chagas' disease, make us think that, in the absence of domiciliation of the insect species, transmission occurs as a result of frequent contact between the wild insect and people inside houses. In La Cascada (Arraiján district), we found up to 20% of children younger than 15 years old had positive seroprevalence for _Trypanosoma_ spp and 36% of pet dogs tested positive for _T cruzi_ . Thus, policies of urban and rural development have not only transformed Panama's tropical rain forests, but also had long-term health effects and increased costs to the public-health service.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

This study aimed to explore the effect of behavioral and biomedical interventions on the HIV epidemic and forecast the time required to eliminate HIV transmission among Japanese MSM.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】A deterministic compartmental model was built to estimate and forecast the HIV epidemic among Japanese MSM from 2010 to 2050. Elimination of HIV transmission among MSM was defined as incidence less than 1/1000 person-years. The time required for eliminating HIV transmission under different scenarios was calculated.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Under the current policies, HIV transmission cannot be eliminated by 2050. Both behavioral and biomedical interventions can achieve elimination of HIV among MSM by 2050 with annual number of sexual partners among high-risk MSM less than 9, or with condom use rate above 65%, or with testing and treatment rate above 80%, or with more than 10% PrEP coverage rate. Under comprehensive interventions, HIV elimination will be achieved in 2032, 2025 and 2024 using weak, moderate and strong intervention combinations, respectively.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Both behavioural and biomedical interventions can achieve elimination of HIV among MSM by 2050, but comprehensive interventions can accelerate the realization of this goal with higher feasibility.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】This study was funded by a Health and Labor Sciences Research Grant (Research on HIV/AIDS) from The Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (21HB0701) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81773543 and 81973150), and the KC Wong Education Foundation.\n\n【11】Keywords\n--------\n\n【12】*   HIV infections\n*   Japan\n*   Incidence\n*   Policy\n*   Interventions\n*   Mathematical models\n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】### Evidence before the study\n\n【15】We searched pubmed for studies related to HIV in Japan, HIV elimination in Japan, and HIV policy. We also performed a Japanese language websearch, and searched the available policy documents in Japanese for information about the current progress towards HIV elimination in Japan. Past studies showed that the incidence of HIV may have plateaued in the last 5 years, but past mathematical modeling studies showed prevalence will continue to grow without additional policy interventions, in particular the expansion of voluntary testing and counseling (VCT) combined with pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and improved entry into treatment. No past studies identified conditions for or timelines to achieve elimination.\n\n【16】### Added value of the study\n\n【17】Although past studies have identified likely future trends in HIV incidence and prevalence, this is the first study to assess conditions for the elimination of HIV in Japan. This study uses an up-to-date mathematical model to assess improvements in behavioral and biomedical strategies required to achieve elimination of HIV. It describes a viable and feasible pathway to achieve elimination based on current understanding of the HIV epidemic in Japan, and gives an approximate estimate of how long it will take to achieve elimination.\n\n【18】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【19】Although incidence may have plateaued in Japan, prevalence will continue to rise under current policies and the epidemic will not be stopped under the status quo. However, a combination of small reductions in behavioral risk, combined with moderate improvements in testing and speed of treatment entry, would be sufficient to eliminate new cases of HIV by the middle of the next decade at the latest.\n\n【20】Introduction\n------------\n\n【21】The HIV epidemic has been a major global health challenge since the early 1980s with 32.7 million cumulative deaths from AIDS and 38.0 million people living with HIV (PLWH) at the end of 2019. Great efforts have been made globally to prevent HIV transmission, but the pandemic persists. In the early years of the pandemic, condom use was the only method to prevent HIV transmission. After effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) was found to prevent HIV transmission to sexual partners, treatment as prevention (TasP) and test-and-treat became major components of global HIV prevention strategies <sup>, </sup> and led to the Fast Track strategy of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) to end the AIDS pandemic by 2030, along with the associated 2025 targets for interventions required to achieve this goal.\n\n【22】In Japan, there has been a concentrated HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) and MSM are considered the key population. The number of new HIV notifications among Japanese MSM has outpaced those of all the other routes since the early 2000s. While the MSM population accounts for 2.9% to 4.6% of the Japanese male population, <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> it disproportionately accounted for 75.4% of male HIV cases, 58.1% of male AIDS cases, and 66% of new HIV notifications in 2018, which is much higher than those in other Asian countries. Therefore, the key to the goal of ending the HIV epidemic in Japan lies in controlling HIV transmissions among MSM.\n\n【23】Japan has established a nationwide scheme for free and anonymous testing at public health centers. However, the HIV testing rate remains low among the key population, leading to high rates of late diagnosis of HIV infection. Among newly diagnosed HIV cases in 2018, 28.6% were in the stage of AIDS. The 2017 Love Life and Sexual Health (LASH) survey of treatment and prevention intentions targeting the MSM population found 62% of respondents had ever had an HIV test and 55.4% of them had their test within a year, showing the testing rate was far from the recommendation of annual HIV testing to MSM in the guidelines of many other countries. <sup>,</sup>\n\n【24】Japanese ART guidelines are consistent with those of other countries in recommending immediate ART after HIV diagnosis, but there have been challenges to implementing a comprehensive test-and-treat strategy. Although 70% of the medical cost can be covered by health insurance, the remaining cost for ART is still a large financial burden for PLWH that increases the difficulty of payment and acts as a barrier to early entry to HIV treatment. In recognition of this, there has been a disability certificate policy for PLWH which reduces the co-payment to less than JPY 20,000 per month. However, there are clinical indications that limit issuing the disability certificate in levels of CD4 count and HIV viral loads and AIDS history <sup>, </sup> and the process of issuing the disability certificate usually takes two months for asymptomatic patients. Those conditions have prevented Japan from achieving a full test-and-treat strategy.\n\n【25】Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is another core element of the current global HIV prevention strategies, <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> though, Japan has not officially approved the usage of antiretroviral drugs for PrEP. It is legally possible to purchase antiretroviral drugs for PrEP online if the purchaser is able to bear the out of pocket costs. In the 2017 LASH report, 63.1% of respondents indicated willingness to take anti-HIV drugs (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection, while their top concern in using PrEP was its cost.\n\n【26】Traditional venue-based (such as bars, clubs or saunas) and online-based activities led by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have taken important roles in HIV prevention campaigns that encourage behavioral changes among key populations. Although the Japan Foundation for AIDS Prevention (JFAP), a non-governmental foundation, redistribute funds and donations to NGOs to support their HIV prevention activities in the community-based approach, <sup>, </sup> government support is not enough to effectively reach out to key populations and change their behavior. <sup>, </sup> It is therefore essential to identify to what extent behavioral and biomedical interventions need to be implemented to plan effective HIV prevention programs among Japanese MSM. We previously published estimated trends in HIV prevalence among Japanese MSM under the enhanced test-and-treat strategy and PrEP. However, little research so far has identified the collected impact of behavioral and biomedical interventions in Japan. In this study, we explored the effects of the combination of partner reduction, increasing condom use, enhancing test-and-treat, and introducing PrEP on the future HIV epidemic among Japanese MSM and project the time required to eliminate HIV transmission by mathematical modelling.\n\n【27】Methods\n-------\n\n【28】### A deterministic compartmental model of HIV\n\n【29】A deterministic compartmental model was built to reflect the mechanism of HIV progression, running on the Japanese MSM population aged 18-59 years old. This population was further divided into low risk MSM (LRMSM) and high risk MSM (HRMSM) groups based on the number of sexual partners they had in the past year. LRMSM were defined as all men up to the 80th percentile of partner numbers, and HRMSM were the men in the highest quintile of partner numbers. The model was applied to both LRMSM and HRMSM.\n\n【30】The model divides the MSM population into 15 compartments based on their HIV serostatus, CD4 count, recognition of HIV serostatus and treatment activity. The structure of the model is shown in Figure 1 . Five columns represent one uninfected stage and four different progressive stages of HIV infection. Acute infection is the earliest stage of HIV infection, in which the virus is multiplying rapidly so the newly infected person will be highly infectious during this time, followed by three stages of HIV and AIDS. Three rows represent recognition of HIV serostatus and treatment engagement. From top to bottom, these are untested, tested but not on treatment, and on treatment, respectively. For the first column in the last row, “treatment” represents PrEP. The rate of change of the number of people in each compartment is described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Table 1 shows the parameters involved in the model. A detailed description of the system of ODEs is given in Supplementary Section 1.\n\n【31】Figure 1 Compartmental structure of the model.\n\n【32】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【33】Table 1 Model parameters\n\n| Parameter | Value | References |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| _Demographic_ |  |  |\n| Initial population (age 18-59) |  |  |\n| Men | 35763734 |  |\n| MSM (%) | 3.5 | , , |\n| Low-risk MSM (%) | 80 |  |\n| High-risk MSM (%) | 20 |  |\n| Background maturation and entry rates |  |  |\n| Annual maturation rate, male | 0.0271 | Calculated a |\n| Annual entry rate, male | 0.0167 | Calculated b |\n| Background mortality rate |  |  |\n| Annual mortality rate, male | 0.00486 |  |\n| Annual mortality rate without ART |  |  |\n| Acute | 0.003 |  |\n| Asymptomatic (CD>500) | 0.03 |  |\n| Asymptomatic (200<=CD4<=500) | 0.1 |  |\n| AIDS (CD4<200) | 0.48 |  |\n| Annual mortality rate with ART |  |  |\n| Acute | 0.002 | , |\n| Asymptomatic (CD>500) | 0.002 | , |\n| Asymptomatic (200<=CD4<=500) | 0.01 | , |\n| AIDS (CD4<200) | 0.02 | , |\n| _Biological_ |  |  |\n| Duration of HIV progression status converted to months\\* |  |  |\n| Acute to CD4>500 | 3 |  |\n| CD4>500 to 200<=CD4<=500 | 14.3 |  |\n| 200<=CD4<=500 to CD4<200 | 80.33 |  |\n| Probability of HIV transmission per partnership |  |  |\n| Acute (within 3 months) | 0.21 |  |\n| Asymptomatic (CD>500) | 0.003 |  |\n| Asymptomatic (200<=CD4<=500) | 0.045 |  |\n| AIDS (CD4<200) | 0.12 |  |\n| Reduction in infectivity (multiplicative) due to ART | 0.99 |  |\n| _Behavioral_ |  |  |\n| Annual number of partners |  |  |\n| MSM, total | 4.1 |  |\n| Low risk MSM | 1.6 | Calculated c |\n| High risk MSM | 14.1 |  |\n| Condom use (% of sexual encounters) |  |  |\n| Condom use rate (%) | 35% | , |\n| Condom effectiveness | 0.9 |  |\n| Others |  |  |\n| Proportion of members of one group having sexual interaction with members of the other group | 0.3 | Assumed |\n| Reduction in sexual behavior after HIV diagnosis | 0.2 | Assumed |\n| Reduction in sexual behavior among AIDS patients | 0.9 | Assumed |\n| _Biomedical_ |  |  |\n| HIV testing rate |  |  |\n| Proportion of population tested in past 12 months, % | 35% | , |\n| Rate of detection of HIV through passive case-finding | 0.1 | Assumed |\n| Rate of detection of AIDS through passive case-finding | 1 | Assumed |\n| Average duration that uninfected individuals remain identified after testing in risk | 12 months |  |\n| Monthly entry rate to ART (treatment rate) |  |  |\n| Acute | 0.2 | Calculated d |\n| Asymptomatic (CD>500) | 0.29 | Calculated d |\n| Asymptomatic (200<=CD4<=500) | 0.38 | Calculated d |\n| AIDS (CD4<200) | 0.43 | Calculated d |\n| Pre-exposure prophylaxis |  |  |\n| Rate of uninfected people start taking PrEP(PrEP coverage rate) | \\- | Based on the scenarios |\n| Rate of PrEP dropout | 0 | 100% adherence |\n| PrEP Effectiveness | 0.9 under 100% adherence |  |\n| _Transmission force_ |  |  |\n| Transmission force e (k=1,2 means not in PrEP, k=3 means in PrEP) | \\- |  |\n\n【35】NOTE: \\*Duration doubled after ART.

The analysis was conducted in 2020 – 2021 using data collected from official sources over that time period and forecast to 2050.\n\n【39】### Intervention scenarios\n\n【40】We changed the values of the number of sexual partners, condom use rate, testing and treatment rate and PrEP coverage rate in the compartmental model from 2022 to model enhancing interventions from 2022, and then explored the effects of single measure behavioral or biomedical intervention and comprehensive combination of those interventions. The specific scenarios are as follows.\n\n【41】*   •\n    \n    Scenario 0 (Status Quo): No additional intervention over the status quo of current policies. The information under status quo is shown in Table 1 .\n    \n\n【42】#### Behavioral interventions\n\n【43】*   •\n    \n    Scenario 1 (Partner reduction): Control the annual number of sexual partners per capita of HRMSM no more than 14 (i.e., between 1 to 14), other conditions maintain the status quo level.\n    \n*   •\n    \n    Scenario 2 (Increased condom use rate): Increase the overall condom use rate to over 40% (i.e., between 40% to 100%), with 90% condom effectiveness, other conditions maintain the status quo.\n    \n*   •\n    \n    Scenario 3 (Behavioral combination intervention): Control the annual number of sexual partners per capita of HRMSM to no more than 14, increase the overall condom use rate to over 40%, other conditions maintain the status quo.\n    \n\n【44】#### Biomedical interventions\n\n【45】*   •\n    \n    Scenario 4 (Enhanced test-and-treat): Increase both the overall testing rate and the treatment rate to over 50% (i.e., between 50% to 100%), representing TasP and the test-and-treat strategies, other conditions maintain the status quo.\n    \n*   •\n    \n    Scenario 5 (Introducing PrEP): Introduce PrEP to both LRMSM and HRMSM, with coverage rates between 10% to 100%, with 90% effectiveness under 100% adherence, <sup>, </sup> other conditions maintain the status quo.\n    \n*   •\n    \n    Scenario 6 (Biomedical combination intervention): Increase both the overall testing rate and the treatment rate to over 50%, introduce PrEP to both LRMSM and HRMSM with coverage rates over 10%, other conditions maintain the status quo.\n    \n\n【46】#### Comprehensive behavioral and biomedical interventions\n\n【47】*   •\n    \n    Scenario 7 (Weak comprehensive intervention): Reduce 10% of the sexual partners in the HRMSM group, increase the overall condom use rate to 40%, with 50% overall testing and treatment rate and 10% PrEP coverage rate, other conditions maintain the status quo.\n    \n*   •\n    \n    Scenario 8 (Moderate comprehensive intervention): Reduce 20% of the sexual partners in HRMSM group, increase the overall condom use rate to 50%, with 70% overall testing and treatment rate and 20% PrEP coverage rate, other conditions maintain the status quo.\n    \n*   •\n    \n    Scenario 9 (Strong comprehensive intervention): Reduce 30% of the sexual partners in HRMSM group, increase the overall condom use rate to 60%, with 90% overall testing and treatment rate and 30% PrEP coverage rate, other conditions maintain the status quo.\n    \n\n【48】### Elimination analysis\n\n【49】We used the effective reproduction number in 2022 ( _R2022_ ) as a necessary precondition for elimination, with _R2022_ <1 indicating that transmission will begin to decline, and incidence rate<1/1000 person-years as the threshold for eliminating HIV transmission based on Granich's previous work. We used the next generation method to calculate _R2022_ under the different scenarios. The detailed calculation process of _R2022_ is given in Supplementary Section 2, and the calculation process for other epidemiological outcomes (such as prevalence and incidence) is given in Supplementary Section 3.\n\n【50】### Model calibration\n\n【51】Model calibration was conducted to select the most reliable model by sampling the key parameters within their possible range. The key parameters include: the percentage of MSM in the Japanese male population, number of partners, condom use rate, testing and treatment rate. Details of model calibration is given in Supplementary Section 4. All models were run using MATLAB R2019b.\n\n【52】### Role of the funding source\n\n【53】The funding source had no role in the preparation of this paper and did not have any influence on the decision to publish.\n\n【54】Results\n-------\n\n【55】### HIV epidemic forecast under status quo\n\n【56】Figure 2 shows the trend in HIV prevalence and incidence under the current policies (solid lines). The incidence among Japanese MSM has been increasing since 2010 and will peak at 11.60 per 1000 person-years in 2028 and decline afterwards in the model. The incidence will still be greater than the threshold for eliminating HIV transmission of 1 per 1000 person-years in 2050. The prevalence has a similar trend to incidence, increasing since 2010 and peaking at 10.50% in 2040, followed by a gradual decrease. Under the status quo, _R2022_ is expected to be 1.45 (sensitivity range 1.34 to 1.54), indicating the HIV epidemic will persist for a long time if policies are unchanged, which is consistent with the model projection.\n\n【57】Figure 2 HIV prevalence (A) and HIV incidence rate (B) under status quo of current policies and three kinds of comprehensive behavior and biomedical interventions.\n\n【58】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【59】### Effect of behavioral interventions\n\n【60】We explored the effect of the implementation of two behavioral interventions from 2022. Figure 3 A and 3 B show the trend in _R2022_ and time required to eliminate HIV transmission under different numbers of sexual partners in the HRMSM group. The value of _R2022_ decreases with reduction in the number of sexual partners, and the time required to eliminate HIV transmission is shortened as _R2022_ declines. When the number of sexual partners in HRMSM is reduced to less than 10, _R2022_ will be less than 1 and transmission will be eliminated by 2050 when the annual number of sexual partners in HRMSM can be controlled under 9.\n\n【61】Figure 3 _R2022_ (A) and the time required to eliminate HIV (B) under partner reduction intervention. **(The blank for values above 9 in the right panel indicates failure to achieve HIV elimination within 28 years (i.e., by 2050)).** _R2022_ (C) and the time required to eliminate HIV (D) under increased condom use intervention. **(The blank for values below 65% in the right panel indicates failure to achieve HIV elimination within 28 years).** _R2022_ (E) and the time required to eliminate HIV (F) under behavioral combination intervention. **(The numbers on the curves represent the value of _R2022_ in the left panel and the time required to eliminate HIV in the right panel at the partners numbers and condom use rate corresponding to any points on the curves).**\n\n【62】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【63】Figure 3 C and 3 D show the trend in _R2022_ and time required to eliminate HIV transmission under different condom use rates. The condom use rate has a linear relationship with _R2022_ . If overall condom use rates increase from 40% to 100%, _R2022_ will decrease from 1.35 to less than 0.21. HIV transmission cannot be eliminated by 2050 when the condom use rate is less than 65%, but rapid elimination can be achieved when the condom use rate is higher than 80%.\n\n【64】Figure 3 E and 3 F show the trend in _R2022_ and time required to eliminate HIV transmission under behavioral combination interventions. The numbers on the curves represent the value of _R2022_ in the left panel and the time required to eliminate HIV in the right panel at the partners numbers and condom use rate corresponding to any points on the curves. With relatively smaller behavioral changes than single measure behavioral interventions, such as just a two partners reduction in HRMSM and 50% condom use rate, _R2022_ can be reduced below 1 and achieve elimination by 2050.\n\n【65】### Effect of biomedical interventions\n\n【66】We explored the effect of introducing two different biomedical interventions from 2022. Enhanced test-and-treat strategy is an effective method to control the HIV epidemic since Japan still has low testing rates and barriers to immediate ART initiation. Figure 4 A and 4 B shows the trend in _R2022_ and time required to eliminate HIV transmission under different testing rates. The range of _R2022_ is from 1.25 to 0.90 coresponding to the annual testing rate and monthly treatment rate from 50% to 100%. _R2022_ will be less than 1 if both testing and treatment rate are over approximately 80%. However, this will still require a long time to achieve elimination of HIV transmission, and much higher testing and treatment rates are needed to shorten the elimination time. For example, testing and treatment rates over 95% can achieve elimination of HIV transmission within 10 years.\n\n【67】Figure 4 **_R2022_ (A) and the time required to eliminate HIV (B) under enhanced testing and treatment intervention.** (The numbers on the curves represent the value of _R2022_ in the left panel and the time required to eliminate HIV in the right panel at the testing rate and treatment rate corresponding to any point on the curve). **_R2022_ (C) and the time required to eliminate HIV (D) under introducing PrEP. _R2022_ (E) and the time required to eliminate HIV (F) under biomedical combination intervention.** (The numbers on the curves represent the value of _R2022_ in the left panel and the time required to eliminate HIV in the right panel at the testing and treatment rate and PrEP coverage rate corresponding to any points on the curves).\n\n【68】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【69】Figure 4 C and 4 D show the trend in _R2022_ and time required to eliminate HIV transmission under different PrEP coverages. PrEP coverage also has a linear relationship with _R2022_ . As PrEP coverage increases from 10% to 100%, _R2022_ will decrease from 1.40 to 0.97. HIV transmission will be eliminated after 25 years when there is 10% PrEP coverage, and the time required for elimination is decreased to 8 years when there is 80% coverage. Further increases in PrEP coverage beyond 80% have little additional benefit. We further analyzed the impact of PrEP for each group, finding the policy was more efficient in the high-risk group than the low-risk group, with less person-years of intervention required to avert one infection when PrEP was supplied to only the high-risk group. Detailed results are given in Supplementary Table S3.\n\n【70】The results of biomedical combination interventions also demonstrated the possibility that smaller changes in each in dimension could reduce _R2022_ and achieve elimination ( Figure 4 E and 4 F). With a limited coverage rate of PrEP, such as 10%, HIV transmission can be eliminated after 13 years with 65% testing and treatment rate, an achievement which is impossible by 2050 with a single enhanced test and treatment intervention at 65% testing and treatment rate.\n\n【71】### Effect of comprehensive interventions\n\n【72】Behavioral and biomedical interventions can achieve elimination of HIV transmission by 2050, with different intervention intensities requiring different time to achieve elimination. We explored the effect of combining both behavioral and biomedical interventions at three possible intensities. The prevalence and incidence rate under three intensities of combined intervention are shown in Figure 2 . All three interventions can drastically reduce the incidence rate that is expected to continue to rise under the current policies, thereby rapidly reducing the prevalence. Even the weak combination intervention, with only 10% changes for each dimension, can play a great role in the control of the HIV epidemic. The years of elimination required under different intervention scenarios are shown in Table 2 . The time to elimination required in comprehensive interventions is much less than that in each single intervention, with elimination of HIV transmission estimated to be achievable in 2032 (sensitivity range 2031 to 2033), 2025 (sensitivity range 2024 to 2026) and 2024 (sensitivity range 2023 to 2024) under weak, moderate and strong comprehensive interventions, respectively. Under the three intensities in Table 2 , the time to elimination required under biomedical combination interventions (Scenario 3) is much smaller than that of behavioral combination interventions (Scenario 6), and the time gap between biomedical combination interventions and comprehensive interventions is relatively smaller, indicating that enhanced testing and treatment and PrEP play a greater role in comprehensive intervention than behavioral interventions. We also explored the time to elimination under a smaller threshold (incidence rate <1/10000 person-years), finding all three comprehensive interventions can achieve elimination of HIV transmission by 2050 but need 12 years, 5 years and 3 years longer respectively. The detailed results are presented in Supplementary Table S4.\n\n【73】Table 2 Years of elimination of HIV transmission under different intervention scenarios.\n\n| Intensity | Intervention | Year of elimination of HIV transmission |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Scenario 1 (Sensitivity range) | Scenario 2 (Sensitivity range) | Scenario 3 (Sensitivity range) | Scenario 4 (Sensitivity range) | Scenario 5 (Sensitivity range) | Scenario 6 (Sensitivity range) | Comprehensive interventions (Sensitivity range) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Weak | Partner reduction: 10% | After 2050 |  | After 2050 |  |  |  | 2032 (2031 – 2033) |\n| Weak | Condom use rate: 40% |  | After 2050 | After 2050 |  |  |  | 2032 (2031 – 2033) |\n| Weak | Testing and treatment: 50% |  |  |  | After 2050 |  | 2038 (2036 -2039) | 2032 (2031 – 2033) |\n| Weak | PrEP coverage rate: 10% |  |  |  |  | 2047 (2046 –2049) | 2038 (2036 -2039) | 2032 (2031 – 2033) |\n| Moderate | Partner reduction: 20% | After 2050 |  | 2037 (2031-2043) |  |  |  | 2025 (2024 – 2026) |\n| Moderate | Condom use rate: 50% |  | After 2050 | 2037 (2031-2043) |  |  |  | 2025 (2024 – 2026) |\n| Moderate | Testing and treatment: 70% |  |  |  | After 2050 |  | 2030 (2029 – 2031) | 2025 (2024 – 2026) |\n| Moderate | PrEP coverage rate: 20% |  |  |  |  | 2040 (2038 – 2041) | 2030 (2029 – 2031) | 2025 (2024 – 2026) |\n| Strong | Partner reduction:30% | After 2050 |  | 2030 (2026 -2032) |  |  |  | 2024 (2023 – 2024) |\n| Strong | Condom use rate: 60% |  | After 2050 | 2030 (2026 -2032) |  |  |  | 2024 (2023 – 2024) |\n| Strong | Testing and treatment: 90% |  |  |  | 2034 (2030 – 2037) |  | 2027 (2026 – 2028) | 2024 (2023 – 2024) |\n| Strong | PrEP coverage rate: 30% |  |  |  |  | 2036 (2034 –2037) | 2027 (2026 – 2028) | 2024 (2023 – 2024) |\n\n【75】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【76】Table 3 shows the epidemiological impact under three levels of comprehensive interventions.

Under current policies, our modeling found that the HIV epidemic cannot be rapidly controlled, and HIV transmission will not be eliminated by 2050, which is consistent with previous research findings. <sup>, </sup> Although the number of new HIV notifications reported by MHLW has been declining since it peaked in 2013, the trend is based on the data of the entire population rather than the MSM population. Moreover, the decreasing number of annual newly notified cases may not reflect improvements in HIV control, but may just be the result of the recent stagnation in HIV testing.\n\n【82】The large number of sexual partners and low condom use rates are great behavioral risks to HIV infection. This study found that to achieve HIV elimination by 2050 only with improvements in risky behaviors, the annual number of sexual partners in HRMSM needs to be reduced by at least 35% to less than 9, or condom use rates almost doubled to 65%. Strategies encouraging reduced sexual partners are controversial and past abstinence campaigns in other countries were ineffective in reducing HIV transmission at population-level due to failure to reduce partner numbers.\n\n【83】The large reduction in partner numbers required to control HIV identified in this study shows why such programs are unlikely to be effective, and is unlikely to be a realistic goal in the Japanese context. Given the magnitude of the required partner reduction identified in this study, increasing condom use is a more realistic intervention. However, this increased condom use rate is also challenging and will require redoubled efforts. Behavioral change requires long-term efforts and public campaigns should be conducted with commitments of various kinds of stakeholders. Further enhancement of ongoing HIV education programs through multiple media <sup>, </sup> as well as community-based approaches is needed to achieve the higher condom use rate.\n\n【84】Against this backdrop of increasing incidence in the status quo scenario, increasing testing and treatment rates can reduce HIV transmission risk by accelerating the process from HIV infection to receiving ART (99% of the PLWH receiving ART in Japan have achieved viral suppression. ). Under the current policies, it is estimated to take approximately three years (based on current testing rate) for newly-infected persons to be identified, and approximately two to five months (based on current treatment rate) for identified persons to receive treatment. The process can be shortened to approximately one year if more than 95% take annual testing and treatment initiation occurs within one month, greatly reducing the risk of infected persons being exposed to the population to spread disease. HIV prevention in Japan should incorporate more measures such as self- or home- testing to increase the testing rate and ensure immediate treatment options. Some countries have successfully shortened the time from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation, but achieving this level of testing is likely impossible. Even countries with best practice in preventing the HIV epidemic have struggled to achieve such high testing rates, with Australia achieving annual testing rates of 70.8% in gay and bisexual men in 2018 and the UK achieving a rate of 67% in 2013. Models of PrEP delivery like London's Dean Street clinic offer new ways of increasing testing coverage as part of comprehensive prevention programs, but data on testing rates in their catchment population is not yet available, and Japan is yet to establish dedicated, free, anonymous clinics for sexual minorities, and until Japan adopts a model similar to those used in Australia and the UK, achieving these high rates of testing will remain a challenge.\n\n【85】PrEP is highly effective to prevent HIV transmission and 10% coverage with 100% adherence will enable Japan to achieve HIV elimination by 2050. Since using antiretroviral drugs for PrEP has not been officially licensed in Japan, the coverage of PrEP in the Japanese MSM population is much lower than the UK and the USA. With strong willingness to use PrEP among Japanese MSM, the government should consider approval of PrEP at reasonable prices with enough medical support and care. In particular, adherence support is essential to ensure the effectiveness of PrEP interventions. Considering that the intervention effect of PrEP is more effective in high-risk groups, in the allocation of limited PrEP resources, high-risk groups should be prioritized to improve the effectiveness of the intervention.\n\n【86】The study found relatively small changes in comprehensive interventions could rapidly eliminate HIV transmission. Although the change in partner numbers identified as necessary to achieve elimination was very large, a weak intervention with approximately only 10% changes in both behavioral and biomedical interventions will prevent 81.2% of new infections and achieve elimination of HIV transmission in 2032. Both behavioral and biomedical interventions are effective and could achieve HIV elimination by 2050, but isolated interventions requiring larger changes, such as those required for behavioral interventions alone, may encounter large implementation challenges in reality. Comprehensive interventions allowing small simultaneous changes could solve this problem, which not only reduce the difficulty of implementing each intervention, but also accelerate the realization of HIV elimination. Although this study cannot determine which comprehensive intervention is the most cost-effective or cost beneficial, it did find decreased additional prevention benefit in higher intensity interventions, indicating that it may not be necessary to implement strong interventions to achieve elimination. Detailed cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit studies are needed to identify the best trade-off between time and financial burden and explore the resource requirements of these interventions in the future.\n\n【87】Our study enables decisions to be made about the prioritization of interventions. We found that a combination of higher testing rates and more rapid entry into treatment were effective strategies, either alone or in combination, as were PrEP strategies. These combination strategies are easily achievable in theory with changes to treatment guidelines and administrative procedures for admission to treatment, but in practice they are also impeded by stigma, discrimination and exclusion that still affect sexual minorities in Japan. Continued improvements in the rights of these sexual minorities, along with reduction in stigma and marginalization, are essential to enable the most effective interventions for HIV prevention in Japan, and further efforts are needed across society to reduce the exclusion of sexual minorities.\n\n【88】### Limitations\n\n【89】The present study has several limitations. First, heterosexual transmission was not considered in the model, although a small portion of MSM have male and female partners. Since the majority (90%) of HIV transmission are among men, the lack of heterosexual transmission will not have much influence on the results. Second, the quality of parameters in the model greatly affects the outcomes. We used model calibration to select the most reliable model by sampling the key parameters within their possible ranges. However, multiple parameters were sampled simultaneously, which causes a relatively wide range of the uncertainty. Third, we used the same condom use rate, testing and treatment rate for HRMSM and LRMSM, and more detailed field investigations are needed to obtain group-specific data for these parameters that can be used to better model intervention impacts. Fourth, our study does not take into account the possibility of risk compensation among Japanese MSM, because in the absence of any current PrEP programs we are unable to determine what level of risk compensation might occur. However, in a previous study we modeled risk compensation as part of a PrEP program and found that with high adherence, even extreme levels of risk compensation (up to and including 100% risk compensation, i.e. not using any condoms at all) have no significant effect on program effectiveness. It is therefore likely that risk compensation will not be an issue in a Japanese PrEP program, provided that adherence is good. This will require that early roll-out of PrEP in Japan be accompanied by development of strategies to encourage adherence which work in the Japanese context, and there is a risk that PrEP will be less effective if such strategies are not incorporated into PrEP rollout. Finally, this study does not include the time needed to scale up the implementation of corresponding interventions, and in reality the time to achieve elimination may be longer than that predicted in our research.\n\n【90】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【91】HIV transmission will not be eliminated by 2050 in the Japanese MSM population under current policies, and enhanced interventions are necessary to control the epidemic. Both behavioral and biomedical interventions can achieve elimination of HIV transmission by 2050, but comprehensive interventions can accelerate HIV control with high feasibility. By a small reduction in behavioral risk in Japan's most high-risk MSM populations, combined with improved testing infrastructure, improved treatment guidelines, and the introduction of PrEP, Japan can make the elimination of HIV transmission a reality within just one decade.\n\n【92】Contributions\n-------------\n\n【93】SG, JL, YW and JT conceived of the study.

In 2007, we reported that cumulative length of deployment was associated with mental illness in military personnel. Our findings provided empirical evidence to support the UK advisory policy for tour length, known as the Harmony Guidelines. If fully implemented, these guidelines could aid prevention of mental illnesses. We aimed to reassess the association between cumulative length of deployment and number of deployments with mental illness in the UK forces.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Our analysis was based on data from a representative study of the military for UK regular personnel who had completed a questionnaire between Nov 2, 2007, and Sept 24, 2009, and were deployed in the 3 years before questionnaire completion. Study outcomes were presence of possible post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), psychological distress, multiple physical symptoms, alcohol misuse, problems at home during and after deployment, and relationship or family problems. The key independent factors were deployment for 13 months or more, and months and number of deployments in the past 3 years.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】8278 regulars responded to the questionnaire, of whom 3982 (48%) had been deployed in the 3 years before questionnaire completion. Deployment for 13 months or more decreased from 22% in March, 2005, (median March 8, 2005 \\[IQR Oct 10, 2004 to April 28, 2005\\]), to 12% in May, 2008, (May 17, 2008, \\[Feb 14, 2008, to Dec 5, 2008\\]). We noted an association between cumulative time deployed as a continuous variable and a score of 40 or more on the PTSD checklist (p=0·002), presence of psychological distress (p=0·018), and multiple physical symptoms (p=0·030; table 2 ). Furthermore, 13 months or more of deployment was associated with multiple physical symptoms (adjusted odds ratio \\[OR\\] 2·15, 95% CI 1·39–3·32), a PTSD checklist score of 40 or more (2·02, 1·31–3·12), and problems at home, but not a PTSD checklist score of 50 or more (1·50, 0·82–2·75), psychological distress 1·34, 0·98–1·85), or alcohol misuse (1·32, 0·97–1·80). Number of deployments was not associated with worse mental illness status or problems at home.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The Harmony Guidelines can prevent mental illness in the UK Armed Forces and, since 2006, their introduction has prevented personnel from being deployed for a longer period than recommended in the guidelines. Monitoring of cumulative length of deployment might reduce mental illness in the UK military.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】The UK Ministry of Defence.\n\n【11】This article is available free of charge.\n\n【12】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【13】Already registered?\n\n【14】Log in to existing account\n\n【15】Forgot password?\n\n【16】One-time access price info\n\n【17】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【18】Not yet registered?\n\n【19】Register for free", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

To assess public receptivity to such strategies, we compared adoption of preventive behaviours in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic among the public in five countries and examined whether certain non-pharmaceutical behaviours (such as handwashing) were deterrents to vaccination. We also assessed public support for related public health recommendations.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We used data from simultaneous telephone polls (mobile telephone and landline) in Argentina, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the USA. In each country, interviews were done in a nationally representative sample of adults, who were selected by the use of random digit dial techniques. The questionnaire asked people whether or not they had adopted each of various preventive behaviours (non-pharmaceutical—such as personal protective and social distancing behaviour—or vaccinations) to protect themselves or their family from H1N1 at any point during the pandemic. Two-tailed _t_ tests were used for statistical analysis.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】900 people were surveyed in each country except the USA where 911 people were contacted. There were wide differences in the adoption of preventive behaviours between countries, although certain personal protective behaviours (eg, handwashing) were more commonly adopted than social distancing behaviours (eg, avoiding places where many people gather) across countries (53–89% _vs_ 11–69%). These non-pharmaceutical behaviours did not reduce the likelihood of getting vaccinated in any country. There was also support across all countries for government recommendations related to school closure, avoiding places where many people gather, and wearing masks in public.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】There is a need for country-specific approaches in pandemic policy planning that use both non-pharmaceutical approaches and vaccination.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Public Health Information Coalition.\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【17】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【18】### Subscribe:\n\n【19】Subscribe to _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_\n\n【20】Already a print subscriber?

A little more than 100 years later, we now know that _Plasmodium falciparum_ , the parasite responsible for the most severe cases of malaria, has 14 chromosomes and about 5300 protein-encoding genes, that almost two-thirds of its proteins seem to be unique to this organism, and that about 208 genes are known to be involved in the evasion of the host immune system. We also know the genome of one of its vectors _Anopheles gambiae_ or “man's deadliest foe” as Andrew Spielman describes it in his book _Mosquito_ . Together with the expected completion of the human genome next year, this is the first time that all three elements leading to an infectious disease—organism, vector, and host—have been fully sequenced. Scientists around the world show optimism, hailing a new era of malaria research, and are rekindling the hope of conquering a disease that has proven extremely difficult to control and treat.\n\n【1】Every year, more than 5% of the world's population are infected at any given time (most in sub-Saharan Africa), more than 1 million die from malaria (most are children younger than 5 years), and some economists believe that in countries with high transmission, economic growth is decreased by up to 1·3% every year. Efforts to combat malaria were once more given momentum in October, 1998, when Roll Back Malaria was initiated by WHO, UNDP, UNICEF, and the World Bank. The initiative's aim is to halve the burden of malaria by 2010 by enabling everyone at risk to sleep in a mosquito-free environment, providing prompt diagnosis and treatment, giving antimalarial treatment to all pregnant women at risk, and establishing early identification and effective response to epidemics. The plan, as agreed at the African Summit in Abuja, Nigeria, in 2000, was to achieve 60% coverage for the first three actions by 2005.\n\n【2】These aims would go a long way towards alleviating burden of disease, and therefore poverty, in sub-Saharan Africa. But increasing resistance by the parasite to affordable drugs and by the vectors to insecticides, the phasing out of DDT as agreed at the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants in 2001, and the lack of funds to provide an adequate infrastructure and simple and affordable preventive measures, such as insecticide-treated bednets, make these goals increasingly unrealistic. New drug compounds are few and too expensive. Vaccines are at best more than 10 years away from being safe enough to be broadly applied to populations at risk. Will the knowledge about the genomes turn the tide?\n\n【3】Perhaps it will open up new avenues for drug and vaccine development. Perhaps it will make a genetically modified mosquito that cannot act as vector a reality once processes are in place to deal with ethical, legal, and social issues. But any new developments are unlikely to happen before the 2010 deadline set for Roll Back Malaria. New drugs based on knowledge about the genome will probably not be affordable to those countries that need them most. Scientists are right to be excited from a scientific point of view and most are appropriately cautious. In a press conference, Neil Hall from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute likened the discovery to “a haystack … and now scientists have to find the needle”. Further research needs to be carefully planned and ideally should be a concerted effort between researchers in the developed world and those at the frontline in African countries. In the short-term, however, the danger is that even more funds will be poured into basic research and established and relatively cheap preventive measures will be further neglected.\n\n【4】Of the more than 300 received proposals, the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria awarded money for 40 in its first round, but only about 10% of resources went to the least “prestigious” disease malaria (see _Lancet_ 2002; **360** : 888–89). Hopefully this imbalance can be redressed in the second round of grants to be awarded in January, 2003. What is urgently needed is an increased effort by wealthy nations and the international community to pledge sufficient funds to malaria prevention. If the genome publications will indirectly contribute to this effort by shifting malaria into the limelight, there is hope for a new era of public health.\n\n【5】Article info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: 12 October 2002\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(02)11207-4\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2002 Elsevier Ltd.

No effective means exist to prevent viral transmission to the fetus. We aimed to investigate whether valaciclovir can prevent vertical transmission of cytomegalovirus to the fetus in pregnant women with a primary infection acquired early in pregnancy.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was done at the Infectious Feto-Maternal Clinic of Rabin Medical Center (Petach Tikvah, Israel). Pregnant women aged 18 years or older, with serological evidence of a primary cytomegalovirus infection acquired either periconceptionally or during the first trimester of pregnancy, were randomly assigned to oral valaciclovir (8 g per day, twice daily) or placebo from enrolment until amniocentesis at 21 or 22 gestational weeks. Randomisation was done separately for participants infected periconceptionally or during the first trimester and was done in blocks of four. Patients and researchers were masked to participant allocation throughout the entire study period. The primary endpoint was the rate of vertical transmission of cytomegalovirus. Statistical analyses were done according to per-protocol principles. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02351102.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between Nov 15, 2015, and Oct 8, 2018, we enrolled and randomly assigned 100 patients to receive valaciclovir or placebo. Ten patients were excluded, five from each study group; therefore, the final analysis included 45 patients (all singletons) in the valaciclovir group and 45 patients (43 singletons and two sets of twins) in the placebo group. In the valaciclovir group, including both first trimester and periconceptional infections, five (11%) of 45 amniocenteses were positive for cytomegalovirus, compared with 14 (30%) of 47 amniocenteses in the placebo group (p=0·027; odds ratio 0·29, 95% CI 0·09–0·90 for vertical cytomegalovirus transmission). Among participants with a primary cytomegalovirus infection during the first trimester, a positive amniocentesis for cytomegalovirus was significantly less likely in the valaciclovir group (two \\[11%\\] of 19 amniocenteses) compared with the placebo group (11 \\[48%\\] of 23 amniocenteses; p=0·020. No clinically significant adverse events were reported.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Valaciclovir is effective in reducing the rate of fetal cytomegalovirus infection after maternal primary infection acquired early in pregnancy. Early treatment of pregnant women with primary infection might prevent termination of pregnancies or delivery of infants with congenital cytomegalovirus.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】None.\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【17】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【18】### Subscribe:\n\n【19】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【20】Already a print subscriber?

This promise did not refer to provision of highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) at a subsidised cost but, as the scientific chairs assured us, to “the need … to make the … scientific knowledge and experience accessible to all”. A look at the registration fee for regular delegates, however, indicates otherwise.\n\n【1】The conference registration fee of US$1125 (including VAT) made it one of the most expensive medical conferences worldwide. Add to this sum the cost of international air travel and a stay in Bangkok, and one's expenses could have approached $2000—several months' salary for many doctors from low-income and middle-income countries. The organisers, thus, effectively excluded a large proportion of their target audience—ie, the doctors who care for the majority of people with HIV/AIDS.\n\n【2】Such a high registration fee for a conference held in Thailand, a nation known for bargain prices, is unacceptable, especially in view of the substantial financial support the event received from sponsors. It would be enlightening to know how many Thai doctors could even afford to attend this conference, which was held in their own country.\n\n【3】The organisers tried to make amends with the promise of scholarships worth more than $100 000. However, how these scholarships were to be distributed was unclear. Applications for funds were accepted online, where no opportunity is given to present details of one's work setting and needs. Past experience suggests that a large part of the fund will have paid for representatives of various non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to attend the conference. Although the sentiment is commendable and aimed in part at bringing patients' advocates to the conference, the organisers probably overlooked the fact that many NGOs receive ample support from various funding agencies. Such resources are often not available to doctors who work in the public sector in many low-income countries. Yet this group is the one that would most benefit from a scientific conference on HIV/AIDS. _The Lancet_ , a trusted medical journal, assumes part responsibility for the organisers' flawed claims by prominently advertising the conference on its back cover (June 12).\n\n【4】The organisers owe an explanation to the practitioners and delegates from low-income countries for the exorbitant price of registration. Why is a premier scientific conference being run as a business opportunity? We propose that in the future the conference organisers set the registration fee at an affordable price for all, and that they set aside a portion of their budget to help investigators and family doctors from low-income countries to attend.\n\n【5】MD had an abstract accepted for the XV International AIDS Conference, which was later withdrawn because of insufficient funds.\n\n【6】Article info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 24 July 2004\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16706-8\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

{"seq_id": "56c9a593-156a-4acb-a95c-0e9fea6baa6e", "title": "Cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "text": "【0】Cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis\nSummary\n-------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】Most prospective studies on the health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure have focused on high-income countries, which have much lower pollutant concentrations than low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and different sources of pollution. We aimed to investigate the cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure in LMICs exclusively.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, LILACS, Global Health, and Proquest for studies published between database inception and Nov 28, 2016, investigating the cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exposure in LMICs. Data were extracted from published studies by one author, and then checked and verified by all authors independently. We pooled estimates by pollutant type (particulate matter with a diameter of <2·5 μm \\[PM <sub>2·5 </sub> \\] or 2·5–10 μm \\[PM <sub>10 </sub> \\]), lag, and outcome, and presented them as excess relative risk per 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in particulate ambient air pollution. We used a random-effects model to derive overall excess risk. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016051733.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of 1553 studies identified, 91 met the full eligibility criteria. Only four long-term exposure studies from China were identified and not included in the meta-analysis. A 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in same-day PM <sub>2·5 </sub> was associated with a 0·47% (95% CI 0·34–0·61) increase in cardiovascular mortality and a 0·57% (0·28–0·86) increase in respiratory mortality. A 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in same-day PM <sub>10 </sub> was associated with a 0·27% (0·11–0·44) increase in cardiovascular mortality and a 0·56% (0·24–0·87) increase in respiratory mortality.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Short-term exposure to particulate ambient air pollution is associated with increases in cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality in LMIC's, with apparent regional-specific variations.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】None.\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】Ambient air pollution is one of the biggest environmental threats to human health and is estimated to contribute to 2·9 million annual deaths globally, of which more than 85% occur in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Particulate matter (PM), a heterogeneous mixture of suspended solid and liquid particles from different sources and varying in size, mass, and chemical composition, is often acknowledged as the most damaging element of ambient air pollution to human health, particularly PM <sub>2·5 </sub> (PM with an aerodynamic diameter of <2·5 μm) with its ability to penetrate deeply into the human respiratory and circulatory systems and cause direct localised and systemic damage. Both short-term (days) and long-term (years) exposure to PM has been independently associated with increased risks for mortality and morbidity, particularly cardiorespiratory outcomes. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> Additionally, unlike other environmental risk factors, PM has no observable threshold, and adverse health outcomes have been recorded at levels lower than the most stringent air quality guidelines.\n\n【13】High concentrations of PM have been reported from metropolitan areas around the world, particularly LMICs, because of recent sharp economic growth. However, research on the health effects of PM is unreflective of PM's growing ubiquity across the world, with most studies, particularly multicity studies, mainly done in North America <sup>, </sup> and western Europe, <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> despite populations in LMICs having the greater burden of PM. In an attempt to quantify global health effects of PM pollution, exposure–response functions from high-income countries are often extrapolated to LMICs. This approach is inadequate because it assumes similarities between high-income countries and LMICs in the source, characteristics, and spatial variability of PM, and in their underlying population and health-care characteristics. To accurately quantify the health burden of PM, researchers urgently need to obtain an exposure–response function that is specific to LMICs, which would minimise the spatial uncertainty introduced by extrapolation of results from high-income countries. As such, the aim of this study is to investigate the cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution exclusively within LMICs.\n\n【14】**Research in context**\n\n【15】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【16】We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, LILACS, Global Health, and Proquest for manuscripts published in English between database inception and Nov 28, 2016. Our search terms included a list of low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) as defined by the World Bank, and terms for particulate ambient air pollution and cardiorespiratory outcomes. From this search we identified 91 studies from five World Bank regions meeting the full inclusion criteria, of which 85 were included in the meta-analysis. Although systematic reviews and meta-analyses had been done on particulate air pollution, particularly for cause-specific outcomes, these mostly applied either no spatial quantification, often with a wider global focus, or, contrastingly, concentrate exclusively on a single (often high-income) country.\n\n【17】**Added value of this study**\n\n【18】To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution across LMIC regions exclusively. This study both acknowledges and shows the growing importance of particulate ambient air pollution in LMICs without introducing spatially anecdotal evidence by including studies from high-income regions. In LMIC regions exclusively, we found particulate ambient air pollution to be associated with both cardiorespiratory mortality and morbidity, with more consistent estimates found for mortality (both for cardiovascular and respiratory). We found substantial spatial variations in cardiorespiratory outcomes from the regional level down to the city level; regional variations were also apparent for cause-specific outcomes such as stroke. However, all studies used fixed-site monitoring as a surrogate for personal exposure. Consequently, the studies were unable to account for the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of air pollution, potentially leading to exposure misclassification and biased risk estimates.\n\n【19】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【20】The high number of studies identified with our search strategy initially showed a promising evidence base on the health impacts of particulate ambient air pollution in LMICs. The identified studies allowed us to show how particulate ambient air pollution is associated with both cardiovascular and respiratory mortality and morbidity in LMICs exclusively, with clear spatial variations apparent. However, the absence of studies that deploy any kind of reliable personal exposure assessment is concerning, and highlights the need to investigate the health effects with more accurate exposure assessment. Only then can results be generated that fully incorporate LMICs into the global ambient air pollution policy debate, and ultimately reduce the effect of particulate ambient air pollution on LMIC populations.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Search strategy and selection criteria\n\n【23】For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, LILACS, Global Health, and Proquest for studies published in English between database inception and Nov 28, 2016. Search terms included “air pollution” and “particulate air pollution”, plus appropriate terms for LMICs and cardiorespiratory outcomes ( appendix ). We also did hand searches of the relevant scientific literature. We applied no study design restrictions to the search. This study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines.\n\n【24】Studies included investigated the cardiorespiratory effects of PM ambient air pollution (PM <sub>2·5 </sub> \\[PM with a diameter of <2·5 μm\\] and PM <sub>10 </sub> \\[PM with a diameter of 2·5–10 μm\\]) within an LMIC (as defined by the World Bank classification ). We included all studies investigating mortality or morbidity, or both, by cardiorespiratory cause (International Classification of Diseases, 9th \\[390–459/460–519\\] and 10th \\[I00–I99/J00–J99\\] revisions) in adults (age ≥18 years). After the removal of duplicates, two authors (KN and CK) independently screened study titles and abstracts, with any disagreements resolved by inclusion of a third author (OK). Selected studies were then screened on the basis of the full inclusion criteria as specified in our PROSPERO protocol.\n\n【25】### Data analysis\n\n【26】Data were extracted by one investigator (KN) and stored in an Access database. Extracted data included study design, study population demographics, region, pollutant characteristics, sample size, types of cardiorespiratory events, exposure classification method, confounders addressed, analysis methods, and generated effect estimates by pollutant, outcome, and associated lag time. A second author (OK) reviewed data extraction from 10% of included studies, with no disagreements found. For the remaining studies, the other three coauthors independently checked and verified the extracted data. We calculated standardised risk estimates to show associations between cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality per 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in particulate ambient air pollution. If alternative metrics were presented, we converted estimates using the formula shown in the appendix . If a study did not have quantifiable parameters, we contacted the authors for additional data.\n\n【27】We assessed each study for potential biases, including exposure assessment bias, detection bias, selection bias, and adjustment for confounders. For exposure assessment bias, we deemed that studies using less than three fixed-site monitors to assign participant PM levels had high risk of exposure assessment bias; that studies using three or more had moderate risk, and that studies using personal exposure or atmospheric modelling had low risk (see appendix for exposure classification assessment). We also regarded studies as having a high risk of exposure assessment bias if they were done before 1980 because insufficient technological and methodological precision in measuring and assigning PM exposure was available during that period. We deemed studies with health outcomes not based on International Classification of Diseases diagnosis codes or clinically confirmed outcomes to have a high risk of detection bias, and studies with unrepresentative study populations to have a high risk of selection bias. We also regarded studies that did not adjust for at least three of the following main confounders—long-term trends, seasonality, weather, influenza, population characteristics, and lifestyle factors (such as smoking status and alcohol consumption)—as having a high risk of bias.\n\n【28】Due to the expected heterogeneity in both pollutant and population characteristics resulting from differing study designs, we pooled estimates using the random-effects model, incorporating both between-study and within-study variation. We present pooled summary statistics as the excess relative risk \\[RR\\] associated with a 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in particulate pollutant levels (significance level 0·05). We pooled estimates by pollutant (PM <sub>2·5 </sub> or PM <sub>10 </sub> ), lagged days, and health outcome (cardiovascular and respiratory mortality or morbidity). One study estimate was included per city for the same study periods to ensure results were not biased by multiple inclusion of one city. Where duplicate cities were presented for the same study periods, we selected one estimate for meta-analysis by prioritising multicity designs because of their standardised and often higher quality methodologies, and then, if duplicates were still present, selecting the study with the lower risk of exposure assessment bias.\n\n【29】Providing study numbers were sufficient for each subgroup (>2), the subgroup analysis examined specific cardiorespiratory outcomes, adjustment for other co-pollutants, estimates with high risk of bias removed, and regional and city specific estimates. Because we anticipated fewer available effect estimates for the subgroup analysis than for the main analysis, we pooled effect estimates for lags 0–3 inclusively (apart from regional subgroups), generating sufficient numbers for meta-analysis. We assessed publication bias graphically using funnel plots with trim and fill, and estimated bias using Eggers tests. We assessed heterogeneity using the _I_ <sup>2 </sup> statistic, with percentages higher than 75% reflective of high levels of heterogeneity. We used meta-regression to determine sources of heterogeneity, particularly if heterogeneity persisted after the subgroup analysis. All analyses were done in R (version 3.3.2). The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42016051733.\n\n【30】### Role of the funding source\n\n【31】The study had no funder. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n【32】Results\n-------\n\n【33】Of 1553 studies identified, 91 met the full eligibility criteria ( figure 1 ). We excluded a further six studies (two did not provide CIs and four were cohort studies <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> investigating long-term health outcomes), leaving 85 studies (72 with a time-series design, <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> ten with a case-crossover design, <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> and three using both designs <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> ) for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Two of the four papers on long-term health outcomes were derived from the same cohort study reporting different endpoints: respiratory and cardiovascular. The other two studies were based on populations from similar Chinese regions. <sup>, </sup> Because of the limited number of studies available, we opted not to include these papers in the meta-analysis, although their findings were summarised in the results section. Most included studies were from east Asia and the Pacific region (n=63), and 16 were from Latin America and the Caribbean. Very few were from Europe and central Asia (n=2; Turkey and Serbia), the Middle East and north Africa (n=3), or sub-Saharan Africa (n=1). We extracted 989 risk estimates from these studies. The studies included around 1 million cardiorespiratory events in total ( appendix ). Where provided, we also extracted the mean particulate matter levels reported in the included studies at the city level ( table 1 ).\n\n【34】Figure 1 Study selection for the cardiorespiratory effects of particulate air pollution in LMICs\n\n【35】Show full caption\n\n【36】LMICs=low-income and middle-income countries.

Of these, 39 reported on PM <sub>10 </sub> only, 11 on PM <sub>2·5 </sub> only, and six on both. Most of the studies (33 \\[39%\\] of 85) relied on national or municipal centres for disease control to obtain mortality and morbidity counts ( table 2 ).

For respiratory mortality, moving average measures of both PM <sub>10 </sub> and PM <sub>2·5 </sub> resulted in associations similar in magnitude to that of the concurrent day, with the exception of PM <sub>10 </sub> , which at a lag of 0–3 days was associated with 1·12% (0·78–1·61) excess mortality; however, at a lag of 0–2 days, no significant association was seen for PM <sub>10 </sub> (0·20%, −0·42 to 0·81; figure 2 ).\n\n【56】31 of the included studies examined the association between PM and morbidity, of which 26 reported on PM <sub>10 </sub> whereas only nine reported on PM <sub>2·5 </sub> . The associations between morbidity and PM were less consistent than those seen for mortality, particularly for cardiovascular morbidity, with no significant associations for PM <sub>10 </sub> and not enough estimates available to pool for PM <sub>2·5 </sub> ( figure 2 ). However, a 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in PM <sub>10 </sub> or PM <sub>2·5 </sub> on the concurrent day was associated with an increase in respiratory morbidity ( figure 2 ).\n\n【57】Most studies were from east Asia and the Pacific region; as such, stratification by region was not possible for all outcome pollutant combinations.

The associations between increased risk of respiratory mortality and PM <sub>10 </sub> in Guangzhou were not significant. Despite low excess mortality in Beijing, the city had high respiratory morbidity in association with PM <sub>10 </sub> ( figure 6 ). Among the larger Chinese cities analysed, the risk of cardiovascular mortality per 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in PM <sub>2·5 </sub> was highest in Guangzhou, followed by Shenyang and Beijing.\n\n【63】Figure 5 Pooled association between PM <sub>2·5 </sub> and mortality and morbidity stratified by city\n\n【64】Show full caption\n\n【65】Estimates show excess relative risk of cardiorespiratory outcomes observed for a 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in PM <sub>2·5 </sub> across pooled study estimates stratified by city.

PM <sub>10 </sub> showed evidence of publication bias for both cardiovascular and respiratory mortality and morbidity. No individual study showed substantial detection or selection bias and all studies adjusted for at least three of the main confounders; however, 36 were assigned high or unclear risk of exposure bias. We did a subgroup analysis removing these high risk estimates from the meta-analysis ( figure 8 ). Only PM <sub>10 </sub> had enough estimates for this subgroup analysis. The most significant effect was seen for PM <sub>10 </sub> and respiratory morbidity, for which the removal of studies with high risk of bias increased the associations across all lags, with the greatest change observed for lag 2. Heterogeneity across the initial results was high, and although stratification by city and pollutant reduced some of this heterogeneity, it remained high for specific cities (Beijing, Guangzhou, and São Paulo). For Beijing, pooling of effects across 0–3 day lags contributed to higher heterogeneity (p<0·0001), whereas pooling the effect estimates from different study periods contributed to high heterogeneity for São Paulo (p<0·0001) and Guangzhou (p=0·0004).\n\n【77】Figure 8 Pooled associations between PM <sub>10 </sub> and cardiorespiratory outcomes with studies with high risk of bias removed\n\n【78】Show full caption\n\n【79】Estimates show excess relative risk of cardiorespiratory outcomes observed for a 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in PM <sub>10 </sub> , with estimates from studies assigned a high risk of exposure assessment bias removed from the meta-analysis.

The 85 studies across 12 countries within LMIC regions (predominantly east Asia and the Pacific) show associations between short-term PM exposure and cardiorespiratory outcomes, with stronger risk for mortality than for morbidity. However, removal of respiratory morbidity studies with high risk of exposure assessment bias resulted in increased strength of association, which was expected because these studies were prone to measurement errors. Long-term ambient air pollution exposure also seemed to be consistently associated with increased risks for cardiovascular mortality, although the available evidence from LMICs was limited and all existing studies were from China. Although not included in the meta-analysis, the four identified cohort studies, all done in China, still contribute to the evidence base in LMICs. Estimates from studies of chronic exposure tend to be greater than estimates of acute exposure. The four identified papers are reflective of three cohort studies done in similar regions of China. In a cohort based in Shenyang, northern China, a 10 μg/m <sup>3 </sup> increase in long-term PM <sub>10 </sub> exposure was found to be associated with a 49% excess risk of cerebrovascular mortality (HR 1·49, 95% CI 1·45–1·53) and a 67% excess risk of respiratory mortality (HR 1·67, 1·60–1·74). The risk for cardiovascular death was somewhat smaller in a multicity study that also included Shenyang (RR 1·23, 95% CI 1·19–1·26; see appendix for full descriptive results of identified cohort studies). Additionally, the explicit requirement of high resolution spatial exposure variation remains a prominent issue in all four of the identified studies with a reliance on fixed-site monitoring data only to quantify exposure. This issue remains prominent in most long-term air pollution exposure research and improvements in exposure classification are urgently needed.\n\n【83】Our results are similar in magnitude to those emerging from high-income countries; however, estimates for short-term PM exposure and both cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality are relatively smaller than estimates emerging from single-city and multicity studies in the USA <sup>, </sup> and western Europe. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> A European meta-analysis found a similar association between PM <sub>10 </sub> and cardiovascular mortality (0·9%) but with greater excess risk for respiratory mortality (1·3%). Unsurprisingly, our results are consistent with the few multicity studies emerging from LMIC regions; <sup>, </sup> however, additional multicity studies are needed to analyse morbidity. Studies from high-income Hong Kong (in southern China) produced similar results to ours for cardiorespiratory mortality, <sup>, </sup> but studies from Taiwan and South Korea have reported no significant associations with mortality. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> This variability in risk of PM to cardiorespiratory outcomes might be due to variations in health-care availability and uptake between LMICs and these more developed areas, rather than pollutant or climatic factors, because the pollutant and climatic factors of Taiwan and South Korea would be similar to Chinese cities due to their close proximity.\n\n【84】Apart from concurrent day PM, we observed what seem to be stronger associations between PM and cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality with longer moving average lags than with a single day lag. This temporal variability is seen across studies in both developed and developing regions, possibly due to grouping health outcomes with varying onset times. However, our study could not address this hypothesis because it did not provide enough estimates to analyse cause-specific outcomes by lag time, warranting further research.\n\n【85】For cause-specific outcomes, PM <sub>10 </sub> had the largest associations with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) morbidity, which is unsurprising in view of the substantial evidence base showing associations of PM with COPD (both development <sup>, </sup> and exacerbation ), with exposure to PM associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress induction, <sup>, </sup> and pulmonary inflammation. Although coarse particles (PM <sub>10 </sub> ) could be filtered out by the body's defence mechanisms and are too large to cross alveolar epithelial cells, their capacity to induce both pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses and alter autonomic cardiac function could account for some of the associations of PM <sub>10 </sub> with cardiovascular cause-specific outcomes. Fewer estimates were available for PM <sub>2·5 </sub> and the scarcity of significant associations between PM <sub>2·5 </sub> and cause-specific outcomes contradicts the growing evidence base of the more prominent role of PM <sub>2·5 </sub> in cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality among the PM fractions. The scarcity of observed associations between PM <sub>2·5 </sub> and stroke morbidity could be the result of fewer individuals surviving stroke in LMICs than in high-income countries, PM particle numbers being more important in terms of health effects than mass concentration, or the elemental composition of PM having a greater health effect than particle diameter.\n\n【86】The between-city differences in cardiorespiratory mortality and morbidity is probably reflective of the spatial heterogeneity of cities included. Reported measured concentrations of PM varied substantially across the included cities ( table 1 ). When analysing city-specific results by pollutant level, we found that some cities such as Guangzhou with lower concentrations of PM showed greater associations with cardiorespiratory mortality than cities such as Beijing with higher concentrations of PM, with higher concentrations indicative of a flattening of the exposure–response curve at higher levels, an effect supported by the scientific literature. <sup>, </sup> However, other factors might partly account for the smaller effect sizes in very large (Chinese) cities such as Beijing, where a high quality health-care infrastructure and insurance system is available for permanent residents but not migrant workers. As such, a combination of a healthier population of permanent residents and under-reporting of adverse health among migrant workers might have resulted in smaller effect sizes.\n\n【87】Our systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to analyse the cardiorespiratory effects of both short-term and long-term exposure of PM in LMICs exclusively. However, several limitations should be noted. First, we were only able to identify four studies on long-term ambient air pollution exposure and most studies are from east Asia, specifically China; there remains a need for research in other regions, particularly Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, to fully assess the effect of PM, particularly its long-term exposure, on cardiorespiratory health across all LMICs. A further limitation was the use of fixed-site monitoring (and in small numbers) as the standard surrogate for personal exposure throughout the included studies, which is less likely to represent true personal exposures than other forms of exposure assessment such as land-use regression, chemical transport models, and satellite remote sensing, particularly in large cities. Substantial heterogeneity was seen for several estimates, which was assessed with meta-regression when possible; however, often too few individual estimates were available to fully explore this heterogeneity. All included studies used clinically confirmed outcome ascertainment ( table 2 ); however, variability in documentation procedures and associated quality of the routine health-care data is a likely source of heterogeneity and a potential limitation of our study, with reliance on accurate recording of health outcomes crucial to this study. However, substantial systematic differences are unlikely to be present between whole LMIC regions and, as such, we estimate the introduction of systematic error to be minimal. However, for estimates across smaller spatial resolutions, such as our city-specific estimates, such variability in health data collection could be more exaggerated and reflected as part of the observed heterogeneity between cities. Finally, because the examined time lags between PM exposure and event onset were small, mortality displacement cannot be excluded as accounting for at least a portion of the associations observed.\n\n【88】The health effects of particulate ambient air pollution in LMICs are of increasing importance. LMIC populations now consistently have a greater burden of PM than populations in high-income countries, with the growth in anthropogenic PM resulting in its widespread distribution. This systematic review and meta-analysis has reported the variation in cardiorespiratory health effects of particulate ambient air pollution from the regional level down to the city level. Further studies with improved exposure classification, done in specific LMIC areas exclusively, are needed to effectively provide information on the health effects of PM. Improved exposure classification is particularly needed in studies of long-term exposure, which remains particularly under-researched across LMICs. These recommendations are vital to accurately inform policy makers and ultimately reduce the burden of particulate ambient air pollution in LMICs.\n\n【89】**Contributors**\n\n【90】All authors were involved in study design, data interpretation, and write up.

The study aimed to provide an overview of the effects of 5 years of treatment with agalsidase alfa on cardiac mass and function, renal function, pain, and quality of life. Our intention was specifically to focus on the long-term effects of enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase alfa in adults with Fabry's disease. We were therefore rigorous in including only patients on continuous treatment for whom data were available at baseline and after 5 years of treatment. We realise that this imposes certain limitations, a fact that we openly acknowledge in our paper.\n\n【1】32 of the 555 patients who had received enzyme replacement therapy at some time had died. As explained in another paper, almost all these patients were severely affected before the start of enzyme replacement therapy. The Fabry Outcome Survey (FOS) database contains information about 98 patients who were reported to have discontinued agalsidase alfa.\n\n【2】Reasons for stopping treatment were entered in FOS in 81 cases. The most commonly cited reasons were reimbursement issues or completion of a clinical trial (about 40% of cases). Continued deterioration of the disorder was recorded as a reason in about 15% of cases. Other reasons were less frequent and included, among others, infusion-related reactions, pregnancy, patients' compliance, and needle phobia. These data must, however, be interpreted with care since information was missing for some patients. Similarly, we cannot guarantee that complete data were entered in all cases owing to entry being at the discretion of the treating physician. Despite the above-mentioned caveats, available data suggest that treatment failure was not the predominant cause of treatment cessation.\n\n【3】Treatment with agalsidase alfa was subsequently restarted in several patients. Treatment switch from agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta was reported in six patients. We cannot exclude the possibility that, after leaving FOS, other patients, particularly those who participated in US clinical trials, subsequently received treatment with agalsidase beta. In the overall FOS population at the time of the study, eight patients were reported to have received treatment with agalsidase beta before entering FOS.\n\n【4】Renal response to enzyme replacement therapy in Fabry's disease is critically affected by differences in disease status at baseline. Patients who were selected for the clinical trial by Germain and colleagues were young (mean age 31·1 years \\[range 17–62\\]), relatively healthy, and had normal median estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at baseline. By contrast, patients enrolled in FOS were on average older (38·6 years \\[18·2–70·8\\]), more severely affected by Fabry's disease, and many showed considerable renal involvement at baseline.\n\n【5】The mean annualised change in GFR seen in men in our study was better than that reported in some studies of controls with established disease but not treated with enzyme replacement therapy, especially in those with proteinuria. Although the progression of renal disease is clearly more pronounced in patients with high levels of proteinuria than in those with lower levels, this was not studied in our paper. However, most previous studies of enzyme replacement therapy, with the exception of one, have illustrated that although enzyme replacement therapy stabilises GFR, it does not reduce proteinuria. <sup>, </sup> For example, in the study by West and colleagues, positive effects of treatment with agalsidase alfa on measured GFR were seen in the absence of changes in proteinuria levels. As we note in the Discussion, there have been substantial improvements in supportive care in recent years, including better management of blood pressure, and these will have contributed to the reduction in blood pressure seen in patients with hypertension receiving agalsidase alfa in our study.\n\n【6】We hope that these details help to clarify the results of our study, which shows what can currently be achieved with long-term treatment with agalsidase alfa.\n\n【7】AM has received speaker fees, research support, and funding for symposium attendance from Shire HGT, Genzyme, and Actelion.

Four were excluded because they pertained to non-randomised trials. Of the remaining 71, we obtained permission to use 64. After contacting investigators and database searching, we identified published reports for 37 trials (50 reports). We checked consistency between protocols and published reports and assessed the prevalence of selective reporting of outcomes and subgroup analyses in the trial reports.\n\n【2】In 11 of the 37 trials, there were major differences between the protocols and the reports for primary outcomes. We found 64 primary outcomes in the protocols—a median of one per trial. However, in the published reports, there were 73 primary outcomes—a median of two per trial. Five trials had an unreported primary outcome and eight introduced a new primary outcome. In two trials the protocol primary outcome was reported as secondary.

Participants were stratified by age (18–55 and ≥ 56 years) and received one of the following CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 booster formulations: MV(D614) (n = 1285), MV(B.1.351) (n = 707) or bivalent D614 + B.1.351 (BiV; n = 625). Unvaccinated adults who tested negative on a SARS-CoV-2 rapid diagnostic test (control group, n = 479) received two primary doses, 21 days apart, of MV(D614). Anti-D614G and anti-B.1.351 antibodies were evaluated using validated pseudovirus (lentivirus) neutralization (PsVN) assay 14 days post-booster (day \\[D\\]15) in 18–55-year-old BNT162b2-primed participants and compared with those pre-booster (D1) and on D36 in 18–55-year-old controls (primary immunogenicity endpoints). PsVN titers to Omicron BA.1, BA.2 and BA.4/5 subvariants were also evaluated. Safety was evaluated over a 12-month follow-up period. Planned interim analyses are presented up to 14 days post-last vaccination for immunogenicity and over a median duration of 5 months for safety.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】All three boosters elicited robust anti-D614G or -B.1.351 PsVN responses for mRNA, adenovirus-vectored and protein vaccine-primed groups. Among BNT162b2-primed adults (18–55 years), geometric means of the individual post-booster versus pre-booster titer ratio (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\]) were: for MV (D614), 23.37 (18.58–29.38) (anti-D614G); for MV(B.1.351), 35.41 (26.71–46.95) (anti-B.1.351); and for BiV, 14.39 (11.39–18.28) (anti-D614G) and 34.18 (25.84–45.22 (anti-B.1.351). GMT ratios (98.3% CI) versus post-primary vaccination GMTs in controls, were: for MV(D614) booster, 2.16 (1.69; 2.75) \\[anti-D614G\\]; for MV(B.1.351), 1.96 (1.54; 2.50) \\[anti-B.1.351\\]; and for BiV, 2.34 (1.84; 2.96) \\[anti-D614G\\] and 1.39 (1.09; 1.77) \\[anti-B.1.351\\]. All booster formulations elicited cross-neutralizing antibodies against Omicron BA.2 (across priming vaccine subgroups), Omicron BA.1 (BNT162b2-primed participants) and Omicron BA.4/5 (BNT162b2-primed participants and MV D614-primed participants). Similar patterns in antibody responses were observed for participants aged ≥56 years. Reactogenicity tended to be transient and mild-to-moderate severity in all booster groups. No safety concerns were identified.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 boosters demonstrated acceptable safety and elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against multiple variants, regardless of priming vaccine.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】Sanofi and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).\n\n【11】Keywords\n--------\n\n【12】*   AS03 adjuvant\n*   Beta\n*   Booster\n*   B.1.351\n*   COVID-19\n*   CoV2 preS dTM-AS03\n*   Immunogenicity\n*   Omicron\n*   Recombinant protein vaccine\n*   Safety\n*   SARS-CoV-2\n\n【13】Research in context\n\n【14】### Evidence before this study\n\n【15】Given the constant threat of newly emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants or subvariants, COVID-19 vaccines that include strains that provide broad cross-protection against emergent variants may offer improved protection. We searched PubMed from database inception up to 05 January 2022, with no language restrictions, for studies reporting the safety and immunogenicity of protein-based vaccine candidates used as boosters against SARS-CoV-2 using the search terms ‘COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2’, ‘vaccine AND protein’, ‘adjuvant’ and ‘booster’, limiting the results to clinical trial data. Among the published trials retrieved, booster doses of recombinant S protein vaccines NVXCoV2373 (Novavax; phase 2 study), COVAX-19 (Cinnagen; phase 3 study) and MVC-COV1901 (phase 1 study), all of which are based on the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 S protein, were shown to elicit antibody responses against ancestral vaccine strain and SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1 and/or BA.2).\n\n【16】The current phase 3 study ( ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04762680) evaluated neutralizing antibody responses elicited by three booster formulations of a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine with AS03 adjuvant (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03) containing the ancestral D614 or variant B.1.351 S protein (monovalent \\[MV\\] D614 or MV B.1.351) or both (bivalent \\[BiV\\] D614 + B.1.351) in adults who were previously primed with mRNA (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273), adenovirus-vectored (Ad26.CoV2.S, ChAdOx1nCoV-19) or protein (MV D614) vaccines.\n\n【17】### Added value of this study\n\n【18】In our study, all three CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 booster formulations demonstrated acceptable safety and elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against multiple variants, in young and older adults previously primed with mRNA and adenovirus-vectored vaccines. The cross-neutralization of Omicron subvariants with a Beta-variant containing vaccine, with greater neutralizing antibody responses against both BA.2 and BA.4/5 after boosting with MV B.1.351 than after the BiV or MV D614 formulations, is consistent with initial findings from the independently conducted COVIBOOST phase 3 trial, in which the MV B.1.351 booster achieved higher neutralizing antibody titers against evaluated variants than either MV D614 or a third dose of BNT162b2, when administered to adults previously vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2.\n\n【19】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【20】These data support the use of Beta-containing CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 boosters in individuals primed with globally deployed vaccines to provide broad immunogenicity against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron BA.4/5 subvariant, which was circulating at time of study conduct.\n\n【21】Introduction\n------------\n\n【22】The continued emergence of new variants of concern (VoC) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), together with waning antibody-mediated immunity and protection against mild and moderately symptomatic infection, underscore the need for new and updated booster vaccines to enhance and broaden protection. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> Bivalent boosters, targeting the prototype virus and Omicron BA.1 or BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants have recently been authorized for use in the EU, USA and the UK. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> However, while these were designed to include the predominant circulating strain at the time, new subvariants have continued to emerge and to replace the predominant strain. Thus an alternative approach is to include strains that provide broad cross-protection against emergent variants.\n\n【23】Sanofi and GSK have developed a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine with AS03 adjuvant (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03) using a baculovirus vector system to express stabilized SARS-CoV-2 pre-fusion S protein. In parallel with development of a D614 strain containing booster and primary series vaccine, <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> we developed a CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 booster formulation containing 5 μg of B.1.351 variant S protein (monovalent \\[MV\\] B.1.351) and a formulation containing 2.5 μg of D614 plus 2.5 μg of B.1.351 variants (bivalent \\[BiV\\] D614 + B.1.351). Here, we present interim safety and immunogenicity data for MV D614, MV B.1.351 and BiV D614 + B.1.351 in participants who were previously primed with authorized COVID-19 mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccines, or with MV D614 (5, 10 or 15 μg of D614 antigen).\n\n【24】Based on data from the current study and an independently conducted phase 3 trial showing higher neutralizing antibody titers induced by MV B.1.351 booster than either MV D614 or a third dose of BNT162b2 in adults previously vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2, the MV B.1.351 formulation has been authorized for booster vaccination by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). <sup>,</sup>\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Study design and participants\n\n【27】In an amendment to a phase 2 randomized, dose-finding study (NCT04762680), we added two supplemental cohorts (cohorts 1 and 2), to be enrolled independently and sequentially, for phase 3 evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of MV D614, MV B.1.351 and BiV D614 + B.1.351 booster formulations ( Fig. 1 ). We firstly enrolled adults (≥18 years) who were previously vaccinated with approved mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccines into cohort 1 (between 29 July 2021 and 22 October 2021) to evaluate the MV D614 booster candidate, which was available at that time. The variant-containing vaccine candidates became available later and were evaluated in cohort 2, with enrolment between 15 November 2021 and 22 February 2022. In cohort 2, we evaluated: (i) MV B.1.351 or BiV D614 + B.1.351 as a booster following primary vaccination with an approved mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccine and (ii) MV D614 or MV B.1.351 as boosters following primary vaccination 4–10 months earlier with two doses of MV D614 in the original phase 2 study ( Fig. 1 ). For both booster cohorts, adults from France, the USA, the UK, Australia and Spain, who had completed a primary series of an authorized or approved D614 mRNA vaccine (2 injections of BNT162b2 \\[30 μg; Pfizer/BioNTech\\] or mRNA-1273 \\[100 μg; Moderna\\]) or adenovirus-vectored vaccine (2 injections of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 \\[5 × 10 <sup>10 </sup> vp; Oxford University/AstraZeneca\\] or 1 injection of Ad26.CoV2.S \\[5 × 10 <sup>10 </sup> vp; J&J/Janssen\\]) at least 4 months and no longer than 10 months prior to enrolment, were included. Cohort 2 additionally included a subgroup of adults from the USA and Honduras who were primed 4–10 months earlier with two injections of MV D614 in the original phase 2 study. Unvaccinated adults, with a target age range of 18–55 years, who tested negative for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 with a rapid diagnostic test (COVID-19 IgG and IgM Rapid Test Cassette; Healgen Scientific, Houston, TX, USA), were enrolled from the USA and Australia into a parallel, non-randomized control group. Enrolment into the control group was contemporaneous with cohort 1 (29 July–22 October 2021). Participants were stratified by priming vaccine (booster groups only) and by age category (18–55 years; ≥56 years). Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, those who were immunocompromised (except those with organ transplant in the past 180 days, chemotherapy in the past 90 days or with HIV and CD4 counts <200/mm <sup>3 </sup> ) and those with a potentially increased risk for severe COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria for both cohorts and controls are described in full in the Appendix . Vaccine administration was open-label in cohort 1 booster and control groups and was modified double-blind (observer-blinded) in cohort 2.\n\n【28】Fig. 1 Study design. Footnote: ∗Naïve or non-naïve status (control group) was determined based on serological detection of anti-S antibodies on study day 1 and detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs on days 1 and 22.

The protocol and amendments were approved by applicable Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards (listed in the Appendix ) and regulatory agencies as per local regulations; ethical approval was received for each site involved in the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before any study procedures were performed.\n\n【33】### Procedures\n\n【34】In cohort 1, all participants primed with an mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccine were offered a dose of MV D614. In cohort 2, participants primed with an mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccine were randomized 1:1, using interactive response technology, to receive MV B.1.351 or BiV D614 + B.1.351. Those in cohort 2 who were previously primed with MV D614 were randomized 9:1 (18–55-year-olds) or 1:1 (≥56-year-olds) to receive MV D614 or MV B.1.351, respectively. Participants in the control group received two injections, 21 days apart (D1 and D22), of MV D614 containing 10 μg of D614 antigen ( Fig. 1 ).\n\n【35】MV D614 was described previously. <sup>, </sup> Preparation of the booster formulations and intramuscular administration are described in the Appendix .\n\n【36】### Immunogenicity\n\n【37】SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were measured using a lentivirus-based pseudovirus neutralization (PsVN) assay expressing the full-length S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G, Beta (B.1.351) or Omicron BA.1, BA.2 or BA.4/5 variants (Monogram Biosciences LabCorp, South San Francisco, CA, USA; Appendix ). The assay lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was a PSVN titer of 40. For values less than the LLOQ, the computed value LLOQ/2 (20) was used. Primary immunogenicity endpoints were PsVN titers pre- (D1) and post-booster (D15) in BNT162b2-primed adults (18–55 years) in each booster group: anti-D614G titers for MV D614 booster, anti-B.1.351 titers for MV B.1.351 and both anti-D614G and anti-B.1.351 titers for the bivalent booster were measured. PsVN titers against D614G were measured at D36 for the control group. Secondary immunogenicity endpoints included the measurement of D614G and/or B.1.351 titers pre- and post-booster for participants who previously received primary vaccination with mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccines, or MV D614, in all booster groups. Other secondary endpoints included seroresponse rates at D15 (a four-fold or greater rise in PsVN titers relative to D1) and individual PsVN titer fold-rise at D15 (relative to D1) in all study groups. The study endpoints are detailed in full in the study protocol.\n\n【38】### Safety\n\n【39】Safety was assessed for each treatment group and by age (18–55 or ≥56 years). Safety endpoints were described in the original phase 2 study, with the list of adverse events (AEs) of special interest (AESIs) revised per the Safety Platform for Emergency Vaccines updates. <sup>, </sup> AEs were graded from grade 1 (mild) to 3 (severe; prevents normal daily activities) and assessed by the site principal investigator as related or unrelated to the study vaccine. Safety is being monitored for up to 12 months following last vaccination.\n\n【40】### Statistics\n\n【41】Results are presented by booster vaccine candidate, overall and by priming vaccine group. Co-primary immunogenicity objectives were to demonstrate, for BNT162b2-primed participants 18–55 years of age: i) the non-inferiority of post-booster D614G PsVN responses following MVD614, post-booster B.1.351 PsVN responses following MV B.1.351 or both responses following BiV, compared to the D614G PsVN response elicited by primary vaccination in the control group; and ii) the superiority of the post-booster relative to pre-booster PsVN response. Statistical inference was based on the use of two-sided 98.3% CIs. Non-inferiority in terms of neutralizing antibody titers was concluded if the lower bound of the 98.3% CI for the between-group (booster versus control) GMT ratio was >0.67. Superiority in terms of neutralizing antibody titers was concluded if the lower limit of the 2-sided 98.3% CI of the geometric mean of the individual titer ratio (GMTR; post-booster versus pre-booster) was >2. Exploratory endpoints included individual serum PsVN titers against Omicron subvariants BA.1, BA.2 for each booster formulation in available samples in BNT162b2-primed participants (BA.1) or across all priming vaccine subgroups (BA.2). Individual serum PsVN titers against BA.4/5 were assessed for MV B.1.351 and BiV D614 + B.1.351 in available samples from BNT162b2-primed participants and for MV D614 and MV B.1351 in MV D614-primed participants. The study objectives assessed here are described in more detail in the Appendix , together with the sequential testing strategy and statistical analyses performed. A full list of all objectives for this study is available in the study protocol ( link ).\n\n【42】Immunogenicity was assessed in the per-protocol analysis set (PPAS) and safety in the safety analysis set (SafAS). In the control group, immunogenicity analyses were performed on SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants from the PPAS. Naïve or non-naïve status was determined based on serological detection of anti-S antibodies on D1 and detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs on D1 and D22 ( Appendix ).\n\n【43】For full details on statistical considerations, including planned sample sizes, see the Appendix .\n\n【44】### Role of the funding source\n\n【45】Funding was provided by Sanofi and by federal funds from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, part of the office of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under Contract # HHSO100201600005I, and in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense under Contract #W15QKN-16-9-1002. The funders were involved in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, writing of the report, and the decision to submit the paper for publication. GSK provided access to, and use of, the AS03 Adjuvant System.\n\n【46】Results\n-------\n\n【47】### Participants and participant disposition\n\n【48】Booster doses were administered to 803 of 806 participants in the MV D614 group, 705 of 707 participants in the MV B.1.351 group and 621 of 625 in the BiV group. In the control group, 473 of 479 enrolled SARS-CoV-2-naïve participants received at least one primary dose of MV D614. A total of 18 MV D614 booster recipients, 34 MV B.1.351 booster recipients, 26 BiV recipients and 43 control group participants discontinued the study before the analysis cut-off ( Figure S1 ). The median interval between last primary and booster doses was slightly shorter for MV D614 recipients (5.75 months) than for MV B.1.351 or BiV recipients (6.96 and 6.50 months, respectively) ( Table S1a ). Across the three booster groups (SafAS), the mean age (standard deviation \\[SD\\]) ranged from 43.7 (14.3) to 50.4 (15.0) years and the proportion of those aged ≥56 years old ranged from 22.2% to 37.5%. Control group participants had a mean age of 37.5 (11.2) years. The majority of participants were white and just over half had at least one high-risk medical condition ( Table S1a ), of which obesity was the most common ( Table S2 ). The subgroup of MV D614-primed participants had a longer median primary to booster vaccination interval (8.2 months, in both the MV D614 and MV B.1.351 booster groups) than the other priming vaccine groups ( Table S1b and S1c ). MV D614-primed participants also tended to be older (mean age \\[SD\\]: 54.9 \\[14.8\\] years for MV D614-primed, MV D614-boosted participants; and 65.9 \\[11.5\\] years for MV D614-primed, MV B.1.351-boosted participants). Among booster groups in the PPAS, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on anti-nucleoprotein seropositivity at baseline was detected for 68/734 (9.3%) of MV D614 recipients, 138/615 (22.4%) of MV B.1.351 recipients and 124/561 (22.1%) of BiV recipients.\n\n【49】### Immunogenicity\n\n【50】#### Monovalent D614 booster\n\n【51】Among participants aged 18–55 years, the D614G PsVN GMTs (95% CI) for BNT162b2-primed participants increased from 339 (285; 402) at D1 to 7894 (6993; 8911) at D15 following MV D614, demonstrating superiority of the PsVN response post-booster compared to pre-booster (post/pre-booster ratio, 23.37 \\[98.3% CI: 18.58; 29.38\\]) and non-inferiority compared to primary vaccination with MV D614 in the control group (GMT ratio \\[post-booster/control\\]: 2.16 \\[98.3% CI: 1.69; 2.75\\]) to the control group. Thus, the co-primary objectives for the MV D614 group were met ( Table 1 A; see Table S3 for PsVN titers in the control group).\n\n【52】Table 1 Non-inferiority and superiority of PsVN titers against D614G and B.1.351 following monovalent and bivalent boosters compared with MV D614 primary vaccination or compared with pre-booster PsVN titers–PPAS.\n\n| A.

Superiority versus the pre-booster response was also demonstrated for all three vaccine priming groups (lower limit of the 2-sided 98.3% CI of post-booster versus pre-booster GMTR was >2; Table 1 A). The magnitude of D614G PsVN titers at D15 following MV D614 booster in 18–55-year-olds was similar in the mRNA- and adenoviral-vectored priming groups but higher in the group primed with MV D614 ( Fig. 2 A; Table S4 ). Seroresponse rates (95% CI) to D614G ranged from 71.2% (58.7; 81.7) to 93.1% (88.5; 96.3) across priming vaccine subgroups following MV D614 booster and was 99.0% (on D36) in the control group among 18–55-year-olds ( Tables S3 and S4 ).\n\n【61】Fig. 2 Booster pseudovirus neutralizing antibody responses against D614G or B.1.351 strains for (A) monovalent D614 (B) monovalent B.1.351 and (C and D) bivalent D614 + B.1.351 among 18–55-year-olds, by prior priming vaccine – PPAS.

While post-booster GMTs in older adults tended to be of lower magnitude than those in younger adults, they were still numerically higher than D36 GMTs post-primary vaccination in the control group, for all vaccine-primed subgroups ( Table S4 ).\n\n【64】#### Monovalent B.1.351 booster\n\n【65】In BNT162b2-primed participants aged 18–55 years, B.1.351 PsVN GMTs (95% CI) increased from 200 (157; 254) at D1 to 7172 (6363; 8083) at D15 after MV B.1.351 ( Fig. 2 B), demonstrating superiority to pre-booster titers ( Table 1 B). B.1.351 PsVN titers post-booster were non-inferior to D614G PsVN titers post-primary vaccination and superior to B.1.351 PsVN titers post-primary vaccination ( Table 1 B).\n\n【66】.Among participants aged 18–55 years, B.1.351 PsVN GMTs (95% CI) increased post-booster with MV B.1.351, with D15/D1 GMTRs (95% CIs) ranging from 28 to 108 across the four mRNA and adenovirus-vectored priming vaccine subgroups ( Table S5 ). Post-booster D15 GMTs were 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher than D614G PsVN GMTs following primary vaccination in the control group. PsVN GMTs (95% CI) against D614G also increased in the MV B.1.351 booster group (18–55 years) across mRNA or adenovirus-vectored priming vaccine subgroups from between 165 (105; 258) and 1331 (917; 1931) at D1 to between 6817 (5453; 8521) and 13,189 (9836; 17,684) at D15. Seroresponse rates (95% CI) to B.1.351 ranged from 71.4% (47.8; 88.7) to 96.5% (87.9; 99.6) across priming vaccine subgroups ( Table S5 ).\n\n【67】PsVN GMTs against B.1.351 and D614G following MV B.1.351 booster also increased among older adults (≥56 years), with D15 GMTs in all vaccine priming subgroups exceeding those following primary vaccination in the control group ( Figure S2 ; Table S5 ). D15 GMTs in older adults tended to be lower than those in younger participants in all but the mRNA-1273-primed group. Notably, the increase in post-booster PsVN titers following MV B.1.351 booster was particularly marked for MV D614-primed participants (≥56 years; N = 68), with PsVN GMTs (95% CI) rising to 24,407 (17,705; 33,647) (anti-D614G) and 13,180 (9571; 18,151) (anti-B.1.351). This marked increase in titers was also seen in the 18–55 years age category for a small number (n = 4) of participants ( Table S5 ).\n\n【68】#### Bivalent D614 + B.1.351 booster\n\n【69】Among BNT162b2-primed participants aged 18–55 years, PsVN GMTs (95% CI) to D614G increased from 585 (477; 718) at D1 to 8550 (7638; 9571) at D15 and PsVN GMTs to B.1.351 increased from 151 (119; 191) at D1 to 5087 (4511; 5737) at D15 following BiV booster, demonstrating superiority of D614G and B.1.351 booster responses at D15 compared to pre-booster ( Fig. 2 C and D; Table 1 C). The non-inferiority of PsVN titers against D614G and B.1.351 following BiV compared to post-primary D614G PsVN titers in the control group was also demonstrated, as was the superiority of B.1.351 PsVN titers induced by BiV compared with B.1.351 PsVN titers in the control group ( Table 1 C).\n\n【70】Among 18–55-year-olds, D614G and B.1.351 PsVN GMTs following BiV increased substantially across all vaccine priming subgroups, with GMTRs (D15/D1) ranging 9–53 for anti-D614G and 21–107 for anti-B.1.351 ( Fig. 2 C and D). Seroresponse rates (95% CI) to D614G ranged from 61.9% (48.8; 73.9) to 89.1% (77.8; 95.9) and those to B.1.351 ranged from 78.3% (56.3; 92.5) to 96.4% (87.7; 99.6) across subgroups ( Table S6 ).\n\n【71】Increases in neutralizing antibody titers (against B.1.351 and against D614G) following BiV were also seen among older adults (≥56 years) (D15 GMTs: 2025–10035 \\[B.1.351\\]; 4492–22531 \\[D614G\\] across priming vaccine subgroups), with similar or lower PsVN titers compared to younger adults in all but the Ad26.CoV2.S-primed subgroup, in which GMTs were higher in older adults ( Table S6 ).\n\n【72】#### Neutralizing antibody responses to Omicron subvariant strains (exploratory analysis)\n\n【73】In a subset of participants aged 18–55 years from the PPAS (MV D614, N = 132; MV B.1.351, N = 160; BiV, N = 156), baseline BA.2 PsVN titers were higher in the MV B.1.351 and BiV groups than in the MV D614 group, with the highest titers induced by MV B.1.351 (2663 \\[95% CI: 2260; 3137\\]) ( Fig. 3 A). BA.2 PsVN GMTRs (D15/D1) ranged from 19 (for MV B.1.351) to 25 (for MV D614) across the three booster groups. Similar results were obtained for booster responses against the Omicron BA.1 subvariant in BNT162b2-primed participants ( Fig. 3 B).\n\n【74】Fig. 3 Cross-neutralizing titers elicited by monovalent and bivalent CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 formulations against Omicron subvariants (A) BA.2 (B) BA.1 and (C) BA.4/5, by age category.

Similar magnitudes of titers were observed for older adults (aged ≥56 years) following MV B.1.351. Among 18–55-year-old participants primed and boosted with MV D614, anti-BA.4/5 GMTs were slightly higher at baseline (147 \\[33.8; 643\\]) than in the other groups and increased to 1212 (720; 2041) at D15 following booster. MV B.1.351 induced a large increase in anti-BA.4/5 titers, reaching a GMT of 3204 (95% CI not calculated) at D15, albeit for only four available participant samples in the 18–55 years age group. Large increases in BA.4/5 GMTs, with GMTRs of 53 and 97, were also achieved after MV D614 and MV B.1.351 booster, respectively, among older adults ( Fig. 3 C).\n\n【79】### Safety\n\n【80】In each booster group, ≥98.0% of participants completed at least 2 months of safety follow-up by the analysis cut-off dates (median duration of safety follow-up, 144–150 days across booster groups). In the control group, 70.9% completed ≥2 months safety follow-up (median duration, 148 days).\n\n【81】AEs for each booster formulation are summarized in Table S7 . There were no immediate unsolicited AEs reported in any booster group. Within 7 days post-booster, grade 3 solicited injection reactions were reported by 2.5% participants in the MV D614 group, 3.3% in the MV B.1.351 group and 1.9% in the BiV group ( Fig. 4 ); grade 3 solicited systemic reactions were reported by 6.6%, 6.9% and 6.3%, respectively ( Fig. 5 ). Most solicited reactions were transient (lasting 1–3 days) and self-limited; all participants fully recovered. Within 21 days post-booster, 7.1–8.8% participants reported at least one unsolicited adverse reaction. Across priming vaccine subgroups, solicited systemic reactions tended to be more frequently reported for MV D614-primed participants than for other priming vaccines ( Figure S3 ). Solicited and unsolicited events were mostly reactogenicity-type events and generally more common in the 18–55 years than the ≥56 years group, in both booster cohorts ( Table S7 ).\n\n【82】Fig. 4 Solicited injection site reactions up to 7 days following vaccination in CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 booster groups and the control group, by age category – SafAS.

One participant aged ≥56 years, primed with MV D614 and boosted with MV B.1.351, reported an AESI (trigeminal neuralgia), assessed as unrelated to vaccination. Of 356 MAAEs reported by 264 booster recipients, eight (2 in 2 participants in the MV D614 booster group, 5 in 3 participants in the MV B.1.351 group and 1 in 1 participant in the BiV group) were assessed as related. All MAAEs resolved. No deaths and no AEs leading to study discontinuation were reported. No cases of unintentional exposure during pregnancy were reported in any booster group.\n\n【87】The safety profile of the control group is described in the **Appendix** and summarized in Table S8 . Solicited injection site and systemic reactions are shown in Fig. 4 , Fig. 5 , respectively.\n\n【88】Discussion\n----------\n\n【89】In this study, boosters containing the prototype D614 and/or Beta (B.1.351) variants MV D614, MV B.1.351 and BiV were well tolerated and elicited robust neutralizing antibody responses against variants including Omicron in younger and older adults, regardless of the vaccine platform used for primary vaccination.\n\n【90】The cross-neutralization of Omicron subvariants with the monovalent B.1.351- containing vaccine, whereby neutralizing antibody levels against BA.2 and BA.4/5 tended to be higher than after either of the D614-containing formulations, is consistent with initial findings from an independently conducted phase 3 trial in adults previously vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2, in which the monovalent B.1.351-containing booster achieved higher neutralizing antibody titers against Beta, Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants than the monovalent D614 booster or a third dose of BNT162b2 in. Notably, data from that previous study, together with those from the current study, led to authorization of the monovalent B.1.351 formulation for use as a booster in Europe and the UK.\n\n【91】Although rare, higher than expected frequencies of myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following receipt of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines or the protein-based vaccine NVX-CoV2373, <sup>, </sup> and an increased risk of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following receipt of adenovirus-vectored vaccines. While we did not identify any safety concerns in the current study, this will continue to be monitored in larger sample sizes. Reactogenicity in all booster groups tended to be transient and mild-to-moderate in severity. The frequency of reactogenicity events (any grade or grade 3) in all booster groups appeared to be similar to or lower than after licensed COVID-19 boosters (BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, NVX-CoV2373). <sup>, </sup> <sup>,</sup>\n\n【92】This study benefits from a large global study population, inclusive of high-risk groups, closely representing the potential target populations. The inclusion of participants previously primed with different vaccine platforms (mRNA, adenovirus-vectored and adjuvant recombinant protein vaccines), including globally deployed vaccines, allowed a comprehensive analysis of prime-boosting options and make our findings applicable to a broad population. While our immunogenicity results are promising, further evaluation on the durability of the responses observed in this study will be needed, along with effectiveness against disease outcomes. Some limitations should also be noted. The later enrolment of cohort 2 will have increased the likelihood of the exposure of participants to prior infection in this cohort compared to cohort 1. Given the separation of cohort enrolment in time, comparisons between the cohorts need to be done with caution. Additionally, due to the limited number of participants anticipated to be available from the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03-primed arms and the need to support the then-current regulatory strategy, it was decided not to randomise the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 D614-primed group to the bivalent booster to focus on the evaluation of the MV D614 and MV B.1.351 vaccines. The inclusion of participants who were immunocompromised in this study may have affected the observed responses. The variability in the interval between last primary vaccine dose and booster may also have affected the antibody responses to booster vaccination. Indeed, recent BNT162b2 booster vaccination data suggest that a longer interval (35 weeks or more) may increase vaccine effectiveness, and previous data have suggested that extended intervals between doses in a primary series of COVID-19 vaccination result in higher neutralizing antibody titers. Additionally, while the control group was age-matched for the 18–55 years age category, they were not age-matched for older participants. We also acknowledge that our data could be extended to assess the more recent circulating BQ.1.1, BA.2.75 and XBB Omicron subvariants.\n\n【93】In summary, B.1.351-containing CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 boosters in individuals primed with globally deployed vaccines elicited strong cross-neutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron subvariants BA.2 and BA.4/5, and had acceptable safety profiles. Further humoral and cellular analysis may support the deployment of MV B.1.351 as a universal booster against COVID-19.\n\n【94】Contributors\n------------\n\n【95】GdB, MAC, FTDS, BF, MHG, OH, MK, NLM, RMC, NR, LS, SG, SSa and SSr contributed to the concept or design of the study and data analysis and interpretation; MIB and RM contributed to the conception or design of the study and data acquisition; MSR, HA, SA, DB, AB, RC, SD, DD, AF, RF, JG, PG, DH, OL, JAH, FMT, JP, DMRM, CR, LDS and AW contributed to data acquisition; AP and JW were involved in the analysis and interpretation of the data.

He also problematised UHC on two counts: first, by arguing that, although UHC might sound like a finite achievable goal, it is not so in practice, and second, by underlining that UHC is not sufficient by itself, but must be coupled to targeted political actions, including legislation and programmes that address specific national health problems, such as diabetes and safer water.\n\n【1】Experiences with UHC in Denmark prompt yet another problematisation. In the WHO campaign on UHC and in existing understanding, UHC is described as a means of promoting health equity. <sup>, </sup> However, although Denmark's health-care system is an exemplification of UHC, Denmark has one of the steepest gradients in health inequality across socioeconomic groups among European countries, and social inequalities in life expectancy are increasing, particularly for men of lower socioeconomic status. These disparities provoke uneasy questions about the coexistence of UHC and health inequity.\n\n【2】At the very least, the case of Denmark reveals the importance of problematising the accepted associations between UHC and health equity, as well as the relationship between access and health outcomes. It also suggests that, if WHO's UHC campaign were combined with national attempts to understand and address the socioeconomic and sociocultural determinants of health, the campaign would be better placed to meet its aim of securing health for all.\n\n【3】*   View Large Image\n\n【4】Copyright © 2018 Francis Dean/GettyImages\n\n【5】I declare no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "01539663-691a-4f37-83c1-2c2f5a8e4c7e", "title": "Offline: Defending the left hand of the state", "text": "【0】On Jan 14, 1992, _Le Monde_ published an interview with the French social scientist, Pierre Bourdieu (1930–2002). Bourdieu drew a distinction between what he called the two hands of the state. The left hand represented those ministries that “are the trace…of the social struggles of the past”—notably, health and education. The right hand was symbolised by “the technocrats of the Ministry of Finance”. Bourdieu had lived through a decade of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, and the influence their policies had had on politicians in France. He concluded that he was seeing one of the greatest reversals of human civilisation—“the failure of the state as the guardian of the public interest”. When asked how the public might respond, he cited ancient Egypt. When Egypt passed through a crisis in its state, the country's rulers, losing respect for the public interest, embraced corruption. The public, in despair, turned to religion. Bourdieu argued that after a decade of “neoliberalism”, the public had rejected the state, “treating it as an alien power to be used so far as they can to serve their own interests”. Bourdieu dedicated the final years of his life to uncovering the malign absurdities of neoliberalism on human wellbeing. He showed how neoliberalism undermined the state and the state's responsibilities to its citizens, including the state's responsibility to provide health care. Yet, in mainstream medicine and public health today, few people talk about the connections between neoliberalism and health. Even the most radical public health document of this generation—the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (2008)—held back.\n\n【1】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【2】Neoliberalism is not a synonym for capitalism. It is a specific form of capitalism, an intensification of capitalism, a political project to reinvent the state and deliver ever greater power to economic elites. As with all forms of capitalism, the market is judged the superior mechanism for the allocation of resources. Neoliberalism then takes a unique turn. It does not endorse a small laissez-faire state. Instead, it demands an interventionist state, one that clears away all obstacles to the market. If markets don't exist, the state creates them (carbon trading). The state will create new spaces for markets to flourish, supranationally (the European Union's single market) and subnationally (decentralisation of power to cities). Neoliberalism is typified by the deification of individual responsibility, privatisation, deregulation, and reregulation—management of the public sector according to private sector principles. For 40 years, neoliberalism has become deeply embedded in our political, economic, and social institutions. Most insidiously, the neoliberal perspective has infiltrated Bourdieu's left hand of the state. Medical and scientific institutions have warmly adopted the neoliberal project. Their Presidents and Provosts, Rectors and Deans, have become its advocates, deploying arguments of realpolitik, economic necessity, and material instrumentality to justify their policies and actions. The rewards—financial and honorific—buy their collusion.\n\n【3】*   View Large Image\n\n【4】Copyright © 2018 Hulton Archive/Stringer/Getty Images\n\n【5】*   View Large Image\n\n【6】Copyright © 2018 ullstein bild/Getty Images\n\n【7】Yet one can find examples across the entire scope of medicine and public health to illustrate the harms of neoliberalism to human health. What can be done? First, consider Bourdieu's evidence and arguments. Ask, do they have resonance today? At a moment when we observe the importance of race, gender, class, and power in shaping health, the answer is surely affirmative. Second, conduct empirical studies of the effects of neoliberalism on health and the determinants of health. Too few of such studies are being done, at least partly because funders are indifferent. Finally, when evidence shows harm, construct critiques to resist, counter, and provide alternatives. Our modern times of austerity, precarity, and insecurity make Bourdieu's analysis of immediate importance. In October, the 40th anniversary of the Declaration of Alma-Ata will be celebrated at a conference in Kazakhstan. A new declaration will be launched to resituate the principles of Alma-Ata in an era of sustainable development and universal health coverage. The original declaration claimed health as a social goal demanding the full commitment of political and economic sectors. Alma-Ata was a manifesto defending health equity and issuing a warning against the dawn of a neoliberal epoch. Bourdieu argued that neoliberalism was not inevitable. A renewed Alma-Ata declaration offers the opportunity to stand against neoliberalism and to insist on the strengthening of the left hand of the state.\n\n【8】*   View Large Image\n\n【9】Copyright © 2018 Alain Nogues/Getty Images\n\n【10】Article info\n------------\n\n【11】### Publication history\n\n【12】Published: 23 June 2018\n\n【13】### Identification\n\n【14】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)31433-8\n\n【15】### Copyright\n\n【16】© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

{"seq_id": "dd35f7b8-67b1-486a-93cc-f5abc921af59", "title": "Vaccine apartheid: global cooperation and equity", "text": "【0】Vaccine apartheid: global cooperation and equity\nWidening gaps in global vaccine equity have led to a two-track pandemic with booster COVID-19 vaccinations proliferating in high-income countries (HICs) and first doses not yet reaching all populations in low-income countries (LICs). Early in the pandemic, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX) promised equitable vaccine supplies for all countries. However, with insufficient funds and donations, COVAX has faltered, failing to meet even half of its 2021 target of delivering 2 billion doses. An open letter to G20 leaders in October, 2021 highlighted how 133 doses per 100 people have been given in HICs compared with four doses per 100 people in LICs. The WHO Director-General has called the divide a “vaccine apartheid”, speaking beyond the phrase “vaccine inequity” to emphasise the scope of this moral failure and make explicit comparisons to the South African system of institutionalised racial segregation. Unabated SARS-CoV-2 transmission in LICs offers fertile soil for new variants to emerge, and WHO has argued that deracinating the roots of the pandemic will require us to vaccinate the world. But how do we achieve global vaccination?\n\n【1】The present challenge is the zero-sum nature of vaccination where, given limited supply, every booster shot HICs purchase is a lost first or second dose for LICs. Under the institutional duty to rescue, states hold obligations to specific populations, setting defined scope and force (ie, the breadth of cases to which a duty applies and the requisite demands). The first obligation of all countries is to their own population, so HICs have understandably prioritised booster shots to citizens over vaccine donation to non-citizens. Despite this zero-sum thinking, some vaccine philanthropy has emerged, with the USA pledging to donate 1·2 billion doses, although only 400 million have been delivered as of Feb 18, 2022. Similarly, the UK pledged to donate 100 million doses to COVAX but has only donated half of that amount to date. WHO membership, international treaties, such as the Doha Declaration and Food Assistance Convention, and other diplomatic agreements can extend HICs' duty to rescue but typically only in a constrained way. Tina Rulli and Joseph Millum have highlighted that “despite the great amount of need in the world, institutions have primary responsibility to address the needs of their own constituents”. As such, it is perhaps unrealistic that vaccine philanthropy alone will meet the WHO plan to vaccinate 70% of the world by mid-2022. <sup>,</sup>\n\n【2】In _The Fallacy of Philanthropy_ , Paul Gomberg argues that traditional approaches like “feed the hungry” distract from actionable solutions to address the unique challenges of chronic social problems such as poverty. If the underlying forces that create hunger are not prevented, then addressing only the downstream effects is, Gomberg suggests, “like trying to bail the boat without fixing the leak”. HICs donating COVID-19 vaccine doses to LICs is commendable, but represent an inefficient, short-term amelioration rather than a sustainable long-term solution. Addressing the root causes of vaccine inequity will require more systemic changes because alternatives such as philanthropy leave the forces enforcing such inequities intact and deflect attention away from them. Gomberg details how capitalism has sustained hunger and suggests a revolutionary political response to end poverty. While anti-capitalism might not be wholly desirable given the impressive investment that produced COVID-19 vaccines, a more structural approach than vaccine philanthropy would help achieve greater global cooperation and equity.\n\n【3】We suggest that an effective and sustainable approach must include passage of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver by the World Trade Organization (WTO) so that mRNA vaccine production in particular can be intensified in LICs. First proposed in October, 2020, the TRIPS agreement waiver proposal would waive intellectual property protections for COVID-19 prevention, containment, and treatment technologies. The proposal, however, has stalled because of opposition from the EU, the UK, and other HICs, even with a renewed push by India at a January, 2022 WTO ministerial meeting. <sup>, </sup> The common threat of the omicron (B.1.1.529) variant and likely future SARS-CoV-2 variants reaffirm the importance of applying pressure on resistant HICs and negotiating towards an agreement. The public funding for research on COVID-19 vaccines bolsters the case for a temporary patent waiver. And the establishment of an mRNA technology transfer hub in South Africa in July, 2021, with the first six African countries chosen to receive this technology in February, 2022, shows that countries are ready, equipped, and willing to proceed with local vaccine production once intellectual property rights are liberated. <sup>, </sup> Although pharmaceutical companies have claimed a patent waiver would destroy their economic model, the TRIPS waiver applies only internationally and is time-limited. Furthermore, regulatory tools allow HICs to block generic vaccines from entering their markets. The HIV pandemic also provides one template for how markets for HICs and LICs can operate simultaneously to ensure both sufficient pharmaceutical enrichment and greater global equity. Unlike one-directional philanthropy, adoption of the TRIPS waiver would allow for active cooperation to sustainably expand COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing capacity in LICs.\n\n【4】*   View Large Image\n\n【5】Copyright © 2022 Andriy Onufriyenko/Getty Images\n\n【6】In a time of increasing nationalism in many countries, global cooperation on the scale the pandemic demands might seem unfeasible, but the world can come together to meet the challenge, as previous global agreements demonstrate. The Montreal Protocol saw every country ban the use of chlorofluorocarbons to protect the ozone layer. Similarly, the polio eradication effort demonstrated how global cooperation could successfully tame a deadly infectious disease. These triumphs are rooted in multilateral solidarity, public–private partnerships, and adequate funding, all of which are similarly crucial for global COVID-19 vaccine equity and recovery. Vaccine apartheid is a “catastrophic moral failure”, yet we believe the path forward lies not in moral exhortations and inadequate philanthropy but in sustainable cooperation with LICs. The world cannot abandon LICs; the stakes to global health and our collective futures are too high.\n\n【7】We declare no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Focusing on core based statical areas (CBSAs) surrounding small and large urban centers, we accordingly tested whether gestational exposure to fatal police violence decreased the number of live births, which is reflective of a rise in lost pregnancies.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Our observational study linked microdata for all births ( _N_ \\= 7,709,300) in 520 CBSAs with at least one incident of fatal police violence in 2013–2015 to Fatal Encounters, a database that prospectively identified 2594 police-related fatalities using online media reports and public records.

In addition to ongoing epidemiologic efforts to accurately monitor, map and describe the distribution of these fatalities in the U.S., research has also sought to identify contextual or “spillover” effects for additional health outcomes. As of March 12, 2021, a PubMed search of the terms “police” AND (“fatality” OR “violence” OR “killing” OR “use of force” OR “brutality” OR “legal intervention”) AND (“birth” OR “pregnancy” OR “fetal loss”) retrieved 99 results, of which less than a handful have described the relationship between violence by police and birth outcomes and none have examined pregnancy loss. Birth outcomes have been shown to be adversely impacted by contextual stressors during pregnancy, particularly when they occur earlier in gestation.\n\n【16】### Added value of this study\n\n【17】This study provides national estimates of the association between U.S. fatal police violence and pregnancy loss, overall and across maternal race/ethnicity using comprehensive birth certificate microdata. We found that for each additional police-related fatality that occurred in the first through sixth months of gestation, there was a 0.14% decrease (95% CI: 0.05%, 0.23%) in the total number of live births within those areas, indicative of a rise in lost pregnancies. Among Black women, we found a 0.29% decrease in births (95% CI: 0.11%, 0.48%), but the association was null for births to White women.\n\n【18】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【19】Fatal police violence is a determinant of population health and birth outcomes specifically. Public health researchers and practitioners have a role both in advocating for accurate data monitoring for these deaths and in continuing to document consequences for population health to inform preventative policy and advocacy efforts.\n\n【20】1\\. Introduction\n----------------\n\n【21】Black, Hispanic, and Native American people are disproportionately stopped, surveilled, and killed by police \\[ , \\]. The Movement for Black Lives and other activist efforts have brought national attention to fatal police violence as a devaluing of Black personhood and the large-scale harms brought about by structural racism \\[ \\], defined here as explicit and nonexplicit laws, policies, and institutional legacies that perpetuate racial hierarchy and have consequences for racial/ethnic health inequities \\[ \\]. Public health researchers and practitioners have increasingly recognized fatal police violence as a public health problem because of the physical and mental health consequences for those directly affected as well as their families and communities \\[ , \\].\n\n【22】Given historical and contemporary patterns of racialized police surveillance and violence \\[ \\], Black, Hispanic, and Native American people may experience fatal police violence as threatening and distressing actions by the state \\[ \\]. Fatal police violence can therefore be understood as a population-level stressor \\[ \\] with potential psychosocial and physiologic implications \\[ \\]. Scholars have hypothesized that police violence may prompt groups that are routinely targeted by police actions to recall previous negative experiences with police \\[ \\], provoke heightened vigilance and disrupted sleep \\[ \\], increase antenatal depressive symptoms \\[ \\], and inequities in preterm birth \\[ , , , \\]. Public discourse and interpersonal conflict over whether racism underlies police violence can themselves be stressors. Media coverage of fatal police violence in local news outlets, as well as video documentation and discussion on social media contribute to the spatial proliferation of this stressor \\[ \\].\n\n【23】To understand the potential implications of fatal police violence for the health of surrounding communities, we apply ecosocial theory, which urges attention to how structural racism may become biologically embodied and potentially contribute to racial/ethnic health inequities during sensitive periods in lifecourse development \\[ \\]. Stressful contextual exposures _in utero_ , particularly in early pregnancy \\[ \\], have been shown to negatively affect birth outcomes, including pregnancy loss \\[ \\]. Moreover, previous research suggests stressful exposures may be more harmful to male births given greater hypothesized sensitivity to elevated maternal corticosteroids \\[ \\]. Yet, no published studies have examined potential adverse consequences of fatal police violence for pregnancy loss, overall or across race/ethnicity, which is necessary for a full accounting of the impact of lethal actions by police as they may extend beyond those who are directly physically harmed and contribute to racial/ethnic health inequities \\[ , \\].\n\n【24】Our analysis brings together national data on police-related fatalities and birth certificate records to examine whether month-to-month increases in fatal police violence are associated with decreases in the number of live births in that area, which is reflective of a rise in lost pregnancies. We hypothesized that, (1) in addition to an overall association between fatal police violence and fewer births, the association will be stronger among male births and for exposures early in gestation (within the first trimester), and (2) there will be larger decreases in births to Black and Hispanic women as compared to decreases among births to White women.\n\n【25】2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\n【26】### 2.1 Data and study population\n\n【27】We used individual-level birth certificate microdata for all live births in the U.S. from 2013 to 2015 from National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), which provided data on month and year of birth and maternal race/ethnicity. If birth certificates were missing maternal race/ethnicity or month of birth, these were imputed by NCHS \\[ \\]. We used the following maternal racial/ethnic classifications from NCHS: non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander (hereafter referred to as “Black”, “White”, “American Indian & Alaska Native” and “Asian” for brevity) and Hispanic \\[ \\]. To ensure accurate exposure classification over the gestational period, we restricted the analysis to births not missing gestational age (99.92% of births). Date of conception was estimated from month of birth and gestational age (in weeks), since exact day of birth was not provided; we accordingly calculated conception dates by subtracting gestational age from the fifteenth of the month for all births.\n\n【28】Data on police-related fatalities for 2013–2015 were from Fatal Encounters \\[ \\] an, open-access real-time database that identifies deaths that involve law enforcement officers systematically using media reports and public records (data downloaded May 1, 2019). We use “police” to describe all law enforcement officers at any jurisdictional level. Incidents were verified by paid researchers to ensure consistent information across multiple data sources \\[ \\]. Victim's race/ethnicity was provided for 90% of the deaths. The resulting dataset was more comprehensive than official vital statistics and other federal data sources, which have been shown to substantially underestimate the number of police-related fatalities during these years \\[ \\]. Fatal Encounters also provided latitudes and longitudes for each incident, which we geocoded using ArcGIS version 10.6.1 to assign each death a county.\n\n【29】We linked birth certificate data to Fatal Encounters using mother's county of residence; when this was not available (<1% of births), we used county of birth occurrence. Counties are nested within core-based statistical areas (CBSAs), which are Census-defined metropolitan and micropolitan areas that, respectively, either contain an urbanized areas with >50,000 people or have at least one urban center of >10,000 and <50,000 people \\[ \\]. Given that we observed 94% of incidents of fatal police violence occurred in or near urban areas, and that urban residents may live, work, and spend most of their time across county lines, the main results we present use CBSAs ( _n_ \\= 520, including 316 metropolitan and 204 micropolitan statistical areas). Moreover, although we had access to county-level data, increasing the unit of analysis from counties to CBSAs limited the number of months with zero police-related fatalities. Our analysis is therefore restricted to 7,902,956 births from CBSAs where at least one incident of fatal police violence occurred over the study period (56% of all CBSAs in the US), and we excluded births with estimated conception dates before the Fatal Encounters data were available (1/1/2013) and for which incomplete exposure data were available (births conceived after 3/1/2015).\n\n【30】Our primary analyses also excluded law-enforcement related fatalities classified as “accidental,” consistent with the definition used by Edwards et al. \\[ \\], because these may have received less media attention and therefore have less of a contextual health impact. This removed deaths reported to be accidents (including drug overdoses \\[ _n_ \\= 27; 0.7%\\], other medical emergencies \\[ _n_ \\= 62; 1.7%\\], drowning \\[ _n_ \\= 15; 0.4%\\], falling from a height \\[ _n_ \\= 7, 0.2%\\], or vehicular collisions \\[ _n_ \\= 902; 25.0%\\]), leaving 2594 fatalities for study inclusion. The Harvard Office of Human Research Administration approved all study protocols and the NCHS approved use of birth microdata. Per the data use agreement with NCHS: (1) we do not report results from cell sizes with fewer than 10 observations, and (2) authors JJ and NK had access to restricted birth microdata, although code and results were shared with the rest of the study team.\n\n【31】### 2.2 Study design\n\n【32】By identifying month of conception as described above, we considered the number of conceptions in a given month that eventually resulted in live births, which we refer to as live birth identified conceptions. We then use this as the outcome in a distributed lag model to estimate associations between lagged month-to-month changes in fatal police violence and changes in live birth identified conceptions, similar to what has been previously described \\[ \\]. By implementing a monthly forward lag of the exposure starting at the estimated month of conception for each CBSA, the models are able to evaluate how a change in fatal police violence after conception might affect the number of pregnancies in a CBSA that result in a live birth, and therefore also its complement, those that do not result in a live birth. Put differently, the number of live births in a CBSA in a given month reflects the total number of conceptions that happened 9 months prior minus any pregnancies that were lost. Because we examine incidents of fatal police violence that occur after conception, we believe the observed changes in live births reflect lost pregnancies and not changes in conception patterns.\n\n【33】The advantage of this modeling framework is that, when used with CBSA fixed effects, it is robust to confounders that do not change on a month to month timescale. For example, maternal-level determinants of adverse birth outcomes such as access to prenatal care or smoking are unlikely to act as confounders because they cannot cause month to month changes in the CBSA's number of live births. Similarly, area-level demographic attributes (e.g., percentages of residents living in poverty) are unlikely to confound the association because (1) our fixed effects models estimate a within-CBSA association, and (2) within CBSAs, these are not time varying at the month level such that they co-occur with changes in fatal police violence independent of seasonality. Furthermore, although the number of live births can fluctuate with the number of conceptions, this would not introduce confounding because it is independent of fatalities that occur _after_ conception \\[ \\]. However, we do adjust for seasonality using a sine-cosine pair for each calendar year to account for long-term seasonal trends in births and conceptions \\[ \\] that we observed overlapped with the temporal trend in police-related fatalities.\n\n【34】### 2.3 Statistical analysis\n\n【35】We estimated distributed lag Poisson models with a quasi-likelihood to account for overdispersion of the outcome given covariates using the dlnm package in _R_ version 3.6.1 \\[ \\]. These models assume that there is a linear association between the month-to-month change in live births in a CBSA and the number of police-related fatalities and that this association is a smooth function over time. Visual inspections of the data suggested that these assumptions hold. The distributed lag models estimate the association between changes in the total number of live births and fatal police violence using natural splines, with degrees of freedom selected based on the quasi-Akaike Information Criterion. Our primary analyses present distributed lag models over the first two trimesters of pregnancy, motivated by prior literature identifying this window as a sensitive period \\[ \\].\n\n【36】Given that an incident of fatal police violence may have a different impact in areas where these events are more frequent compared with areas where they are rare, we stratified across CBSAs that experienced ≤ 3 fatalities over the three year study period (an average of one fatality per year; 75% of CBSAs experienced ≤ 3 fatalities) and those that lived in CBSAs with ≥ 4 fatalities. We additionally present models stratified by maternal race/ethnicity, given our conceptualization of fatal police violence as a racialized stressor. However, due to smaller numbers of births and therefore more imprecise estimates for American Indian & Alaska Native women relative to the other racial/ethnic categories, these results are not presented.\n\n【37】We also fit models among Black and White women with race-concordant exposures, in 149 CBSAs with ≥ 1 Black and ≥ 1 White fatalities over the study period. There were too few CBSAs for which fatalities of other racial/ethnic groups met these criteria to provide meaningfully precise estimates. We then evaluate the opposite in this subset of CBSAs: fatal police violence against White people with births to Black women and vice versa. Lastly, we examined models stratified by sex of the birth (male/female) to test hypotheses related to sex-specific vulnerability to stressful contextual exposures.\n\n【38】### 2.4 Sensitivity analyses\n\n【39】We conducted several sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. First, we examined associations using a nine-month forward lag to determine whether results are consistent with our primary analyses that used a six-month forward lag. Our second sensitivity analysis repeated our main models using counties as the unit of analysis using _n_ \\= 1060 counties with at least one police-related fatality. Our third sensitivity analysis did not exclude police-related fatalities classified as “accidental” to address potential error in the classification of cause of death.\n\n【40】Our fourth sensitivity analysis adjusted for crime because it has been shown to increase risk of adverse birth outcomes \\[ \\] and because incidents of crime are reported by law enforcement agencies and are therefore also indicative of greater police presence, which could increase the likelihood of a police-related fatality, independent of seasonality. To do so, we linked our dataset to one we constructed from agency-level reports of crimes from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting Program Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest files 2013–2015 \\[ \\], following a previously used methodology for county-level aggregation \\[ \\]. We summed counts of crimes law enforcement identified as “actual” and not “unfounded,” including murder, manslaughter, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, and larceny across multiple agencies for each month in every county and aggregated these to CBSAs. We excluded agencies with no associated FIPS code (0.01%) or underlying population (e.g. state parks, state-level agencies, 25%), those that did not report a full year of data (28.47%), and those whose jurisdiction spanned multiple counties (3%). Thus, our linked dataset is smaller than that of the main analysis ( _n_ \\= 989 versus 1060 counties), although at least one county in each included CBSA had adequate crime data.\n\n【41】### 2.5 Role of the funding source\n\n【42】NIH grant P30ES00002 to MGW supported conceptualization of the study.\n\n【43】3\\. Results\n-----------\n\n【44】### 3.1 Descriptive findings\n\n【45】Among our primary analytic sample, there were a total of 7,709,300 live births in 520 included CBSAs with at least one fatality over the study period ( Table 1 ). The highest number of police-related fatalities in one month was 11 in Los Angeles- Long Beach-Anaheim, California, which also had the most deaths over the study period (138 deaths) followed by Houston-Baytown-Sugar Land, TX (80 deaths), and Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale, AZ (77 deaths). Nearly 40% of CBSAs had only one incident of fatal police violence over the study period, and most months in most CBSAs had no fatalities. Of the births in our study, 50.5% lived in a CBSA with at least one incident of fatal police violence during the estimated month of conception. Our primary analysis included 2594 police-related fatalities, most of which (93.8%) were caused by gunshot.\n\n【46】Table 1 Characteristics of births and police killings in the 520 US Core-Based Statistical Areas \\[CBSAs\\] with at least one incident of fatal police violence during the study time period (2013–2015), overall and by number of police killing **s** .\n\n|  | Total | ≤ 3 Police Killings | ≥ 4 Police Killings |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Births | Births | Births | Births |\n| Total births_N_ births_N_ CBSAs | 7,709,300520 | 1,168,664336 | 6,540,636184 |\n| Non-Hispanic White Women_N_ births_N_ CBSAs | 3,885,565520 | 763,832336 | 3,121,733184 |\n| Hispanic Women_N_ births_N_ CBSAs | 1,935,529520 | 208,721336 | 1,726,808184 |\n| Non-Hispanic Black Women_N_ births_N_ CBSAs | 1,198,707520 | 134,238336 | 1,064,469184 |\n| Asian & Pacific Islander Women_N_ births_N_ CBSAs | 573,339520 | 38,130336 | 535,209184 |\n| American Indian & Alaska Native Women_N_ births_N_ CBSAs | 52,628496 | 19,659314 | 32,969182 |\n| Police Killings | Police Killings | Police Killings | Police Killings |\n| Total included deaths | 2594 | 379 | 2215 |\n| Included causes of deathGunshotTaseredBeaten/BludgeonedAsphyxiated/RestrainedStabbedChemical agentBurnedOtherUndetermined | 2432942016544415 | 346251220102 | 2086691914343413 |\n| Race/ethnicityWhiteHispanicBlackAsian & Pacific IslanderMiddle EasternNative AmericanMissing | 111942770045321279 | 221356450747 | 89839263640314232 |\n\n【48】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【49】### 3.2 Overall associations between fatal police violence and pregnancy loss\n\n【50】We find that each additional police-related fatality that occurred during the first month of gestation was associated with 0.14% fewer live births (Risk Ratio (RR): 0.9986; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.9977, 0.9995), and that this association was strongest at the first estimated month of conception and moved gradually towards the null during the first through sixth gestational months ( Fig. 1 ; numeric values in Supplementary Table 1). This association and pattern looked similar for CBSAs with high (≥4) numbers of fatalities over the study period, but confidence intervals included the null among CBSAs with low (≤3) fatalities (Supplementary Fig. 1). Only 15% of the births over the study period occurred in CBSAs with ≤3 police-related fatalities ( Table 1 ), contributing to wider confidence intervals for these estimates compared to those in CBSAs with ≥4 fatalities. We estimated that exposure to 11 incidents of fatal police violence in the first month of pregnancy, as had occurred in the Los Angeles area, was associated with a 1.73% reduction in live births (95% CI: 0.85%, 2.61%).\n\n【51】Fig. 1 Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between each additional incident of fatal police violence in a month for the first six months of gestation and changes in live births in 520 U.S. core-based statistical areas 2013–2015.\n\n【52】Show full caption\n\n【53】Note: Model adjusted seasonality and the distributed lag was modeled using a natural spline with two degrees of freedom.

For Black women, the association was strongest at sixth gestational month, each additional police-related fatality was associated with a 0.29% (95% CI: 0.11%, 0.48%) decrease in live births. Comparing race/ethnicity-stratified models that also stratified by ≥4 and ≤3 incidents of fatal police violence, results among CBSAs with ≤3 fatalities had wide confidence intervals that included the null across each racial/ethnic category except births to Hispanic women decreased by 2.26% for each additional police-related fatality in the first gestational month (95% CI: 0.52%, 3.97%) (Supplementary Fig. 2). In models among CBSAs with ≥4 fatalities, results were nearly identical to the maternal race/ethnicity-stratified models presented in Fig. 2 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Models that stratified by infant sex did not show meaningful differences across male and female births (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\n【57】Fig. 2 Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between each additional incident of fatal police violence in a month for the first six months of gestation and changes in live births in 520 U.S. core-based statistical areas 2013–2015, stratified by maternal race/ethnicity.\n\n【58】Show full caption\n\n【59】Note: Models adjusted seasonality and the distributed lag was modeled using a natural spline with two degrees of freedom.

The race-concordant association among White women, similar to the race stratified results, found no significant association between fatal police violence against White people and births to White women. Among Black women, the confidence intervals for the race-concordant association included the null. However, fatal police violence against Black people in the first through fourth month of gestation was associated with 0.34% fewer births to White women (Supplemental Fig. 3, 95% CI: 0.12–0.56%). Fatal police violence against White people was not associated with births to Black women (Supplementary Fig. 3).\n\n【63】Fig. 3 Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between each additional race concordant incident of fatal police violence in a month for the first six months of gestation and changes in live births to Black and White women in 520 U.S. core-based statistical areas 2013–2015, stratified by maternal race/ethnicity.\n\n【64】Show full caption\n\n【65】Note: Race concordant models estimate the association between fatal police violence against Black people with births to Black women, and police violence against White people and births to White women.

We found that our findings were consistent in models that included a 9-month lag (Supplementary Fig. 5) and when we set the unit of analysis from CBSAs to counties (Supplementary Fig. 6). Associations were similar before and after adjustment for month-level crime across all models presented in the main analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7). Moreover, when we did not remove police-related deaths classified as “accidental”, the results were very similar to the main models (Supplementary Fig. 8).\n\n【69】4\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\n【70】Our analysis is the first to show a decrease in the number of live births, interpretable as pregnancy loss, associated with incidents of fatal police violence in both CBSAs and, in sensitivity analyses, counties. These results suggest fatal police violence has broad, population-level health consequences. Our conclusions are strengthened by our study design's control of time-invariant confounding and sensitivity analyses determining that results were robust to adjustment for month-level crime. Moreover, our national dataset of birth certificate records uniquely allowed for stratification across nearly all NCHS categories of race/ethnicity, which is important given distinct patterns of police surveillance across these racial/ethnic groups and that the data provided adequate sample sizes within most groups. An additional strength of our analysis is that findings were unchanged across different classifications of police violence (i.e. “accidental” versus “non-accidental”) \\[ \\]. These contributions help illuminate the intergenerational effects of fatal police violence on communities.\n\n【71】Our finding that the negative association between fatal police and pregnancy loss occurred during the first two trimesters is consistent with previous research that suggests the early months of pregnancy may be particularly sensitive to psychosocial exposures \\[ \\]. Although many women may not know they are pregnant during these early gestational months, those aware of their pregnancy may experience psychologic distress related to pregnancy loss in addition to distress related to fatal police violence. That said, very little research has examined the adverse birth consequences of exposure to fatal police violence, and additional study of the mechanisms of biologic embodiment is needed.\n\n【72】Fatal police violence occurs within broader context of gendered racism that exposes Black, Hispanic and Native American women, their families, and communities, to disproportionate law enforcement surveillance. Our race-stratified analyses supported our hypotheses that fatal police violence acts as a racialized stressor for these groups, and aligns with prior research that has identified negative mental and physical health consequences of police violence \\[ , , \\]. We also found a negative association between fatal police violence against Black people and births to White women, as well as a negative association among Asian women, which indicates that population health impacts of fatal police violence may not be limited to racial/ethnic groups that are disproportionately affected. Our analysis was limited by available birth certificate data on ethnicity, language, and socioeconomic status, which prevented examination of important variation within the NCHS racial/ethnic classifications, given how these factors relate to police surveillance and perceptions of police \\[ \\]. Lastly, contrary to previous literature on fetal loss—which largely examined one-time, acutely stressful events and not repeated exposures <sup>19 </sup> —we did not find a significant difference between male and female births. Previous research on antenatal depressive symptoms among Black women suggests the presence of young male children already in the household is an important factor in the psychosocial effects of anticipated police violence \\[ \\]. Our study was unable to examine potential effect modification by gender of other children in the household.\n\n【73】Our strongest association was among Hispanic women in CBSAs with ≤ 3 fatalities, which suggests fatal police violence in areas where these events are relatively rare have a particularly negative effect on the health of Latina women. Prior research that has identified negative health consequences of fatal police violence has focused on Black-White inequities given that the largest racial inequities in fatal police violence are between these groups \\[ \\]; our results suggest analyses for other racial/ethnic populations of color are warranted.\n\n【74】It should be noted too, that our estimated magnitude of effect is smaller than studies that have used a distributed lag modeling framework to estimate a decrease in live births for a 10 ppb increase in air pollution \\[ \\] ,although the units of exposure are difficult to compare and no previous analyses that implemented distributed lag modeling of pregnancy loss have examined continuous psychosocial exposures. CBSA fixed effects, although critical for confounding control, offer a very narrow definition for identifying an effect (i.e. changes within CBSAs). Thus, if incidents of fatal police violence occurred elsewhere in the state or across the nation \\[ \\], our models do not account for these additional exposures and would thus be biased towards the null. Similarly, our exposure data did not include information on court proceedings of cases involving police officers involved in fatal police violence, which may be similarly stressful as incidents of fatal police violence. Moreover, the available data only permitted month-level analysis, and a stronger association might exist at the week-level or at smaller geographic levels (e.g. census tract). We also had to assign day of birth, which contributed to non-differential misclassification of the exposure, particularly in the first and final gestational months. Lastly, our source of data on fatal police violence is sourced from media reports and public records. Although it is the most comprehensive dataset available, it is likely still missing deaths, which would bias our results towards the null. On the other hand, this bias is not likely to be strong given the hypothesized psychosocial pathways involved in pregnancy loss, women would more likely be affected by incidents of fatal police violence that they see through local news and social media.\n\n【75】Fatal police violence is an urgent area of public health attention, and public health researchers and practitioners have a role both in advocating for accurate data monitoring for these deaths and in continuing to document consequences for population health to inform policy and advocacy efforts. Fatal police violence and population health consequences are, in principle, preventable. The American Public Health Association put forward a policy statement in 2018 that suggests a primary prevention strategy that includes ending policing practices that criminalize marginalized experiences (e.g., immigration, homelessness, drug use and possession particularly among Black and Hispanic people) and investment in social determinants of health, including housing, education, employment, and mental health \\[ \\]. These changes require policy intervention at multiple levels and will require action by public health practitioners, researchers, activists and advocates, lawmakers, and law enforcement agencies.\n\n【76】Authors’ contributions\n----------------------\n\n【77】JLJ: conceptualization, data curation, formal analysis, investigation, project administration, visualization, writing.\n\n【78】NK: investigation, methodology, resources, supervision, writing— review & editing.\n\n【79】MA: investigation, supervision, writing— review & editing.\n\n【80】ML: formal analysis, investigation, methodology, writing— review & editing.\n\n【81】BAD: conceptualization, investigation, methodology, writing— review & editing.\n\n【82】MGW: conceptualization, investigation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology, supervision, writing— review & editing.\n\n【83】JTC: conceptualization, investigation, funding acquisition, investigation, methodology supervision, writing— review & editing.\n\n【84】Data sharing statement\n----------------------\n\n【85】The restricted birth certificate microdata used in this study is available from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

Regarding cancer burden, the population demographics, health policies, health-data recording, access to health care, and affordability have all improved substantially during the period between 1990 and 2016, as reported by The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Cancer Collaborators in their Global Burden of Disease paper in _The Lancet Oncology_ . In addition to the heterogeneity in cancer incidence and outcomes between states, significant differences exist within each state, most prominently between urban and rural populations. Health data availability, access to health care, and affordability are poor and have remained almost static over the entire period in rural areas, while they have improved substantially in urban areas. The issues of access to health care and affordability are a direct result of zero health insurance coverage in more than 95% of the population in India. The federal government of India is currently rolling out in a phased manner the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS, also known as Modicare). If properly implemented, this programme is likely to improve health-care access for the majority of the rural Indian population in the next decade.\n\n【1】The India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative Cancer Collaborators have used the best possible data-sourcing methods available so far for India. The first population-based cancer registry, based in Mumbai (previously named Bombay), started in June 1963, and the first rural population-based cancer registry, based in Barshi, Maharashtra, was established in 1987. Cancer data collection has improved over the years and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) now has a fully fledged National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR). However, verbal autopsy with poorly trained data collectors and coders could make the process challenging. The federal government of India has made it mandatory for all citizens to possess a unique national identification number (Aadhaar Act 2016) that is currently linked to all financial transactions. This number will eventually also be linked to all social security benefits, including Modicare, making it an excellent database for future health-services planning in the country.\n\n【2】It is heartening to note that the age-standardised incidence of the most common cancers (except breast cancer) has remained static over the past two and half decades, despite the assumption of under-reporting in the earlier part of this period. The incidence of cancer (except for cervical cancer, and except for the north-eastern state of Mizoram) is much lower than that in countries that can be said to be in a similar epidemiological transition as India (BRCS—Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa), and substantially lower than in some developed countries with established prevention, screening, and early detection programmes. However, the increased incidence of breast cancer in India is worrying and requires serious attention. The decrease in cervical cancer incidence despite the absence of population-based screening is interesting and calls for planned epidemiological investigation. The uniformly high cancer mortality might reflect the poor access to early detection and curative services, and lack of affordability. In this context, a comparison between urban and rural populations within states would have been interesting.\n\n【3】The federal government of India has taken important policy decisions towards controlling cancer and other non-communicable diseases—eg, COTPA 2003 (Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products \\[Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution\\] Act); however, except for a few successful Smokefree City programmes, and graphic package warnings, mechanisms to enforce the act are scarce since enforcement is the responsibility of each state. Although abundant data exist for tobacco use and its association with a number of diseases, there is a paucity of similar information about alcohol in India. Just like tobacco use in India and most of south Asia is different from the rest of the world, mainly due to the high prevalence of smokeless tobacco use, alcohol use (patterns and disease causation) are also worthy of countrywide epidemiological studies—a large proportion of the alcohol consumed by poor people in India is spuriously manufactured, and contaminated with various industrial chemicals.\n\n【4】India has also embarked upon a population-based screening programme for cervical cancer, breast cancer, and oral cancer. However, the techniques chosen for these screening programmes are not optimal; although there is evidence for visual inspection with acetic acid for cervical cancer, it might be useful to switch to HPV screening as soon as it becomes financially feasible, and evidence for implemented clinical breast examination schedules for breast cancer and oral examinations for oral cancer is weak. Population-based screening for breast cancer starting at age 35 years will probably be a logistical nightmare, waste of resources, and even cause outright harm to patients. Although several studies showing the benefits of HPV vaccines have been published, strangely there is no consensus in India regarding the introduction of the HPV vaccine.\n\n【5】*   View Large Image\n\n【6】Copyright © 2018 Planetobserver/Science Photo Library\n\n【7】I declare no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Highly effective therapies are available; asthma morbidity and mortality have vastly improved in the past 15 years, and most patients can attain good asthma control. However, undertreatment is still common, and improving patient and health-care provider understanding of when and how to adjust treatment is crucial. Asthma management consists of a cycle of assessment of asthma control and risk factors and adjustment of medications accordingly. With the introduction of biological therapies, management of severe asthma has entered the precision medicine era—a shift that is driving clinical ambitions towards disease remission. Patients with severe asthma often have co-existing conditions contributing to their symptoms, mandating a multidimensional management approach. In this Seminar, we provide a clinically focused overview of asthma; epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management in children and adults.\n\n【2】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【8】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【9】### Subscribe:\n\n【10】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【11】Already a print subscriber?

Last month, 20 tonnes of cadmium were discharged into a river in southern China, potentially threatening the water supply of millions of people. The source was local industrial waste, and eight executives from two suspected companies have been detained by the police. The local government was also blamed for not disclosing the contamination for at least 2 weeks, and several local government officials were dismissed.\n\n【1】Environmental risk factors, especially air and water pollution, are major causes of morbidity and mortality in China. Environmental risks lead to 2·4 million premature deaths every year in China, according to WHO. In terms of air quality, the 2012 Environmental Performance Index from the environmental research centres at Yale and Columbia Universities in the USA, rank China, which has the highest carbon dioxide emissions in the world, 128th out of 132 countries.\n\n【2】However, China has set an ambitious goal to reduce its major pollutant emissions by more than 30–40% by 2015 in its latest 5-year plan for environmental protection. Improvements in environmental performance indicators, expansion of air quality monitoring, implementation of stricter rules on industrial pollution, and an investment of 3·4 trillion yuan (US$539 billion) have been proposed to curb emissions. Notably, it is stated that local governments should shoulder most of the responsibilities for finance and implementation and that their environmental protection performances would be taken into account in assessments of their overall work. Economic growth is the top priority for local authorities, thus “factories and enterprises owned by the local government might be the largest polluters in some places” in China, as Junfeng Zhang and colleagues pointed out in _The Lancet_ 2010 China special issue .\n\n【3】In addition to better-enforced regulations, China needs more innovations in technology and energy for tackling environmental challenges. China can and should assume a leading role for other middle-income countries to prove that economic development need not come at the expense of damage to the environment and human health.\n\n【4】For **Junfeng Zhang and colleagues's publication** see **Review** _Lancet_ 2010; **375:** 1110–19\n\n【5】*   View Large Image\n\n【6】Copyright © 2012 AFP/Getty Images\n\n【7】Article info\n------------\n\n【8】### Publication history\n\n【9】Published: 11 February 2012\n\n【10】### Identification\n\n【11】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60213-X\n\n【12】### Copyright\n\n【13】© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A further recommendation is that all commercial air travel should be prohibited until the person has two consecutive negative sputum smears for drug-susceptible tuberculosis or two consecutive cultures for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. In this Review I examine the evidence put forward to support these recommendations and assess whether such an approach is justifiable. A systematic review identified 39 studies of which 13 were included. The majority of studies found no evidence of transmission. Only two studies reported reliable evidence of transmission. The analysis suggests that there is reason to doubt the value of actively screening air passengers for infection with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and that the resources used might be better spent addressing other priorities for the control of tuberculosis.\n\n【2】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【8】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【9】### Subscribe:\n\n【10】Subscribe to _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_\n\n【11】Already a print subscriber?

(Chimpanzee, which the makers say they did not use for manufacturing the vaccine, is thought to have been the source of the virus.) No doubt, like the manufacturers, Horton was encouraged by the fact that the 60 or more urine and faecal samples collected last year by my brother, William Hamilton, and his companions, from wild chimpanzees in the forests near Kisangani where the vaccine was developed, did not contain SIV. Bill did not, however, necessarily expect them to. As an evolutionary biologist who had made a unique study of the interaction of hosts and parasites, he was more concerned with testing a worrying hypothesis about the use of animal tissues for treating human beings, which, until that time, everyone seemed to dismiss. Since Bill was unable to interest anyone else in instigating the necessary studies in the Congo, he thought he should do so himself. He hoped to provide, if only on a small scale, facts rather than conjectures, and to show how strongly he felt that the theory should be tested. As is well known, he paid for this effort with his life.\n\n【3】It is odd that Horton, a medical editor, says nothing about viral transfer between species causing epidemics, which was discussed more fully on day 2 of the conference. If AIDS was not caused by the polio vaccine, it could have been, and, as was shown by one speaker, could also have been caused iatrogenically in other ways, such as by repeated use of nonsterilisable needles. Many participants agreed that transfer of SIV to human beings was probably connected with unprecedented medical activity in Africa in the 20th century. This danger was that which the organisers of the conference sought to explore, as Robin Weiss emphasised in his summing up when he warned about xenotransplantation, but which was overshadowed, once again, by politics.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "2b9d8714-d520-4dc5-b772-c5c63539a077", "title": "What is it to grow old?", "text": "【0】“It is to spend long days/ And not once feel that we were ever young./ It is to add, immured/ In the hot prison of the present, month/ To month with weary pain.” These words, written by the British poet Matthew Arnold in his 1867 poem _Growing Old_ , portrays a rather morose image of ageing as debilitation and the losing of self. How do Arnold's words relate to older citizens in modern society, particularly in a world with an unprecedented rapidly growing ageing population?\n\n【1】A new report — _Old Americans 2012: Key Indicators of Well-Being_ —released by the US Federal Interagency Forum on Aging Related Statistics, provides an updated picture of the wellbeing of Americans aged 65 years or older. This report not only tracks the trends in an ageing population domestically, but also compares the ageing demographic and US life expectancy with other countries. Among developed countries, the USA is relatively young—about 13% of the US population was aged 65 years or older in 2010, compared with 23% in Japan and more than 15% in most European countries. However, the percentage of US population aged 65 years or older is predicted to climb to nearly 20% in 2030. Population ageing is the result of increasing longevity and declining fertility. The life expectancy of Americans who survive to age 65 years was 20·3 years for women and 17·6 years for men in 2009, which lags behind that of many other developed countries such as the UK and Australia.\n\n【2】In terms of health status, 76% of Americans aged 65 years or older reported their health as good, very good, or excellent during 2008–10. Additionally, many of the health risks and behaviours, such as air quality and physical activities, have shown long-term improvements. As for end-of-life support, hospice care use in the last month of life escalated substantially from 19% of decedents in 1999 to 43% in 2009, and the percentage of decedents aged 65 years or older who died at home increased from 15% in 1989 to 24% in 2009.\n\n【3】The increasing life expectancy can be regarded as a successful story for medical sciences and socioeconomic development, but it also challenges health and social systems to adapt to the dynamic changes in an ageing world. Indeed, the ageing population already has a different outlook on the world, different behaviours, and different health risks to any that have lived before. As highlighted in the report, death rates for chronic lower respiratory disease increased by 57% between 1981 and 2009 in the USA. The prevalence of obesity has risen in American men aged 65 years or older during the past 12 years. Furthermore, older Americans in the poor or near poor income category continue to spend a high proportion of their household income on health-care services through 2009.\n\n【4】Worryingly, several emerging problems for ageing populations, in particular sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are entirely ignored in the report and often disregarded in elderly health care as well. As estimated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around 11% of new HIV infections in the USA occur in people aged 50 years or older, and 33% of all people living with HIV infection are in this age group. HIV may be just the tip of the iceberg. Several risk factors, such as an ageing immune system and a lack of screening, might put older people at greater risk of being infected with STDs than their younger counterparts.\n\n【5】More disturbingly, older people are not only overlooked in sexual health studies, but also seriously under-represented in many other clinical research areas, especially clinical trials. A study published in the _Journal of General Internal Medicine_ in February, 2011, pointed out that of 109 clinical trials published in high profile journals (including _The Lancet_ ) in 2007, about 20% excluded patients older than a specific age, while nearly 46% of the remaining trials employed eligibility criteria that could disproportionately exclude older adults. Normally, older adults account for the major share of health-care utilisation and expenditures. But without robust evidence, how can the physician ensure proper and effective health care for their older patients?\n\n【6】Aside from the challenges in providing and funding health care for older people, an even tougher task might be reinventing the way health workers and the wider public think of ageing itself. Ageing should not be the inevitable progression of sickness and seclusion, but, as defined by WHO, “the process of optimizing opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age”.\n\n【7】*   View Large Image\n\n【8】Copyright © 2012 Corbis\n\n【9】Article info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 01 September 2012\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61431-7\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

With a huge and densely distributed population, China developed a national SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing strategy that has had a pivotal role in containing COVID-19. This strategy involved border entry screening, inpatient screening, rapid screening in fever clinics, and mass screening of the population in an epidemic area.\n\n【1】China began developing SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection kits soon after the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan at the end of 2019. By Jan 31, 2020, the National Medical Products Administration urgently approved six nucleic acid detection kits, and post-market evaluation with a multicentre clinical trial was completed by professional institutions by the end of February, 2020. The sensitivity of these kits was 55·3–95·7%, the specificity above 98% (unpublished).\n\n【2】• View related content for this article\n\n【3】A national nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) laboratory network was also quickly established. NAAT laboratories have been in development across China for decades; thousands of NAAT laboratories for detecting infectious agents such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV are established in large hospitals, blood centres, and in the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Feb 14, 2022, 12 777 NAAT laboratories (four times more than at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic) provide strong support for infectious diseases diagnosis, treatment, and prevention ( appendix ). For every 1 million permanent urban residents, hospitals are equipped with at least one routine testing laboratory with capacity to analyse 10 000 samples per day.\n\n【4】Professional education and technical training opportunities are also continuously provided to the laboratory staff by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories. Nationwide external quality assessment programmes are organised regularly for all testing laboratories ( appendix ).\n\n【5】To detect COVID-19 outbreaks early and protect patients from getting infected in hospitals, all secondary and tertiary hospitals across China have fever clinics that provide services 24 h per day, 7 days a week. Fever clinics have been encouraged to acquire rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing tools that deliver results within 4–6 h and enable the timely identification of infections.\n\n【6】China continues its population-based mass screening strategy to support the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy. To implement such large-magnitude screening within epidemic areas in a short timeframe, routine testing laboratories in hospitals and public testing laboratories (including mobile laboratories and technical staff from surrounding neighbourhoods) can be mobilised urgently by the government. By the end of 2020, 100 mobile laboratories with a capacity to analyse 10 000 samples had been built, enabling a flexible testing reserve capacity of 1 million samples per day nationwide. Other large-scale and qualified independent clinical laboratories also participate in this mass screening strategy to accelerate sample testing turnover in every local epidemic area.\n\n【7】To improve the efficiency of mass screening, China has adopted the sample pooling strategy in three patterns (five, ten, or 20 pooled samples) on the basis of different epidemic periods. <sup>, </sup> With the optimisation of sample pooling methodology and development of an electronic information system, this sample pooling strategy ensures both high sensitivity and efficiency.\n\n【8】The cost of routine SARS-COV-2 testing during hospitalisation and in fever clinics, as well as the mass screening during an epidemic, are covered by basic medical insurance or by the government. These measures enable large cities with a population of 10 million people or more to complete SARS-CoV-2 testing within 24–48 h, without substantially affecting routine clinical services.\n\n【9】The SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy has not only improved the containment of COVID-19 but also contributes to the control of other infectious diseases, such as HIV and human papillomavirus, and non-communicable diseases. China's COVID-19 response has accelerated its diagnostics agenda and testing capacity. To further optimise the COVID-19 detection strategy, China recently decided to supplement the existing strategy with antigen detection, and we will continue to accelerate technological innovation and develop the testing reagents for communities and remote areas. Ensuring universal access to diagnostics via effective and rapid testing is essential for the preparations for future pandemics.\n\n【10】**This online publication has been corrected.

HIV tests would also be mandatory under the Conservative policy, but visas would not necessarily be withheld. This plan, says Howard, is a strategy to minimise the public-health threats posed by immigrants. But the intense debate these proposals have generated—mainly because of their similarity to current government policies—has unfortunately obscured a more important point: that disease must not be a basis for discrimination.\n\n【1】Infections imported by immigrants do not have a significant impact on public health. In the UK, for example, migration has been blamed for a steady increase in newly diagnosed HIV infections, but absolute numbers remain small. Percentage calculations, such as those cited in Howard's publicity material, exaggerate the relative burden of immigration-related illness. According to the Health Protection Agency's most recent report, the number of newly diagnosed HIV infections thought to have been contracted outside the UK in 2003 number only around 3000.\n\n【2】Reacting to public fears over perceived threats, countries including Canada, USA, Australia, and New Zealand, have adopted stringent policies for compulsory screening of new entrants for TB and HIV. But the only UK public inquiry into the issue came out firmly against the idea, concluding that “there is no evidence to suggest that such a policy would be effective at protecting public health”. The All Party Parliamentary Group on AIDS, which set up the inquiry, expressed grave concerns that the government was seeking ways to “exclude vulnerable individuals on the basis of poor health”.\n\n【3】Policies that discriminate against visa applicants on the basis of disease risk stigmatising entire sections of society. But technical weaknesses in health-check policies also preclude achievement of their alleged protective purpose. By selecting just two diseases for scrutiny, and specifying that only arrivals from non-EU countries will be tested, the UK policies ignore some of the most immediate risks. The former communist states of eastern Europe have some of the highest rates of TB in the world. But visitors from these countries will be under no obligation to undergo testing before entering the UK.\n\n【4】To base any decisions on the presence or absence of illness is appallingly discriminatory and emphasises the stigmatising nature of political debate. This is politics that undermines the peaceful and civilised values of society. And our politicians are shamelessly exploiting these now brittle principles.\n\n【5】Article info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: 26 February 2005\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17995-1\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Last month, in the plenary meeting of the State Council AIDS Working Committee, Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang vowed that China would substantially expand HIV/AIDS prevention and control coverage in the next 5 years, which means that free voluntary counselling and testing would be available in all hospitals at county level and above, as well as at grassroots clinics in regions with high HIV/AIDS prevalence. Additionally, access to effective interventions including condom use and methadone maintenance treatment is to be increased to at least 90% of people at high risk of HIV infection (such as sex workers and injecting drug users) by 2015.\n\n【1】China's present HIV prevalence rate of 0·06% might seem low, but the absolute size of the population means large numbers of people are infected with HIV. China's Ministry of Health and UNAIDS estimate that by the end of 2011 there will be 780 000 people living with HIV/AIDS and 48 000 new infections in mainland China. “The epidemic is still on the rise in China…but at a slower rate than before”, said Wu Zunyou, director of the National Centre for AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control and Prevention. In 2008, HIV/AIDS overtook tuberculosis as the leading cause of death from an infectious disease in China. A national free antiretroviral treatment programme, as well as the first legislation directly aimed at controlling HIV/AIDS—the AIDS Prevention and Control Regulations—has been initiated by the Chinese Government. A recent study showed that overall HIV-related mortality decreased from 39·3 per 100 person-years in 2002 to 14·2 per 100 person-years in 2009, with increasing coverage of antiretroviral treatment.\n\n【2】The time has come for China to take a leadership role against HIV/AIDS within Asia. Strong and consistent political will from the highest level in HIV/AIDS control can not only benefit China, but also serve as a good model to neighbouring regions, such as central Asia. Eastern Europe and central Asia have had a staggering 250% increase in the number of people living with HIV/AIDS during the past decade. This urgent health crisis must be addressed.\n\n【3】For more on **Eastern Europe and central Asia's HIV epidemic** see http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/JC2216\\_WorldAIDSday\\_report\\_2011\\_en.pdf\n\n【4】*   View Large Image\n\n【5】Copyright © 2011 Corbis\n\n【6】Article info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 03 December 2011\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61827-8\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Born on July 6, 1933, in Manhattan, NY, USA, he died of heart failure on June 2, 2019, in Scarborough, NY, USA, aged 85 years.\n\n【3】Kenneth Forde spent a career persevering. As an African American, he was denied advancement opportunities early in his career. He was the only African American student in his graduating class at the then Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, USA, and while studying there he was blocked from accessing the same housing as white students. After completing his medical studies in 1959, he was denied an internship at an elite hospital and advised to apply at lower-ranked facilities. “That was a great put down that I remember to this day”, he recalled in a video tribute by the American College of Surgeons (ACS).\n\n【4】“He was able to forgive all that, to beget compassion to those who sought to exclude him and then win them over so that they respected, revered, and embraced him”, said Spencer Amory, the Jose M Ferrer Professor of Surgery at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. Forde would take that approach to the challenges he faced in his career, including his early advocacy of endoscopy and its importance in the identification of gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer. “Ken Forde persevered”, said José Guillem, a surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. “And not just in the manner that he got what he wanted and beyond, but that he was able to help so many patients, so many students, to help so many people in so many ways.”\n\n【5】Forde was born in New York City to immigrant parents from Barbados who sent him there for his education. He would be known throughout his career for his formality. In a letter to Guillem congratulating him on an accomplishment, Forde signed off, “Do let us congregate socially soon.” He returned to the USA to attend the City College of New York, where he obtained a bachelor of science degree, before being accepted to Columbia's medical school. Except for a 2-year stint in the US Army, he would spend the rest of his career with Columbia's network of affiliated hospitals, including an early posting as an attending at Harlem Hospital. He was not particularly happy there and one of his mentors, the vascular surgeon Arthur Voorhees, approached Forde and suggested he look into emerging endoscopy technology. “Immediately, I was fortunate enough to be struck with the vision that this would be an opportunity, not just for me as an individual, but for the discipline of surgery”, Forde recalled in the ACS video. He would use the technology to make advances in surgery. He led research into the removal of polyps with an endoscope rather than by surgical removal and became an authority on the use of colonoscopy to identify the source of lower gastrointestinal bleeding and then manage and treat it. “He had a vision about where things were going”, Amory said.\n\n【6】From his position on Columbia's medical college faculty, which he joined in 1966, he also pushed students to study endoscopy, even as he advocated for its use within the broader medical community. That included a key role in the 1981 founding of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES). Gerald Marks, SAGES' co-founder, said Forde's diplomatic skills were crucial to securing SAGES' acceptance and growth. SAGES would go on to have an important role in setting standards and formalising training around minimally invasive procedures. “He had a way of connecting with people because of his sincerity and his warmth, and his organised mind and intellect”, Marks said. Forde succeeded Marks to become the second President of SAGES. At the same time, he was helping his students at Columbia advance in their careers. Guillem said Forde was always happy to help place students and to offer them advice grounded in his own experiences. “He told me, ‘You will face challenges when you're starting out. But stay the course. People will come around, just do the hard work.’”\n\n【7】Forde's dedication to endoscopy and a career spent building allegiances and winning friends was highlighted when he was selected to perform a colonoscopy on Katie Couric for a 2000 special on colon cancer she produced for the US television network NBC News. Amory said Forde was chosen to conduct the procedure because “this is the person that will get the message out in the most forceful manner possible”. Alongside his positions at SAGES, Forde was the first African American President of the New York Surgical Society. In 1983, he became a full Professor of Clinical Surgery and in 1996 Columbia established the Kenneth A Forde Professorship in Surgery. After retiring in 2006, he became a trustee of both Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital. His wife, Kareitha Ollivierre Forde, died in 2017, and he is survived by his son, Trevor, two grandchildren, and a sister.\n\n【8】Article info\n------------\n\n【9】### Publication history\n\n【10】Published: 27 July 2019\n\n【11】### Identification\n\n【12】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(19)31617-4\n\n【13】### Copyright\n\n【14】© 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

{"seq_id": "e15be8cb-c829-4efa-abcb-219de452acbd", "title": "Understanding the HIV care continuum", "text": "【0】Understanding the HIV care continuum\nThe HIV care continuum is a method of examining the sequential stages of medical care that people with HIV should go through between diagnosis and achieving sustained viral suppression. The care continuum, which was made popular by Gardener and colleagues, is an important public health tool that can provide crucial insights into the cascades of care within and across countries. However, this approach is limited by comparability issues and the inability to incorporate different care trajectories, which do not always have a linear distribution. Furthermore, most continuums are cross-sectional and do not allow the assessment of changes over time. To date, approaches have been inconsistent, restricting the use of this important public health tool.\n\n【1】In _The Lancet HIV_ , Sophie Jose and colleagues offer an important solution to the problems associated with traditional HIV care continuums. The authors suggest that a longitudinal population-based continuum should be used, which incorporates loss to follow-up and mortality. Jose and colleagues argue that this approach is superior to those used previously because it enables the use of time-updated factors to account for changes in viral suppression and engagement in care over time, and describes loss to care and mortality in graphical form.\n\n【2】Jose and colleagues are not the first to have linked in-depth clinical data from a large observational dataset to a national cohort and mortality data. Danish, British Columbian, and Georgian longitudinal care cascades have been investigated previously <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> using central clinical care registries or linked clinical care databases. These approaches enabled the direct measurement of care indicators for patients in these national and provincial jurisdictions. The further value of Jose and colleagues analytical approach is that their care continuum is able to describe the proportion of person-time spent in suboptimum care categories over specific time periods. We are getting closer to alleviating Mugavero and colleague's concern that continuums are often not linear.\n\n【3】Jose and colleagues' cohort study might lead to the development of additional modelling tools to link the social determinants of health to treatment trajectories and outcomes. However, the interrelationship between social determinants, disease, and treatment throughout the life course requires further investigation. Previous research has shown that health outcomes of early biological insults can depend on the subsequent social and biological environment and therefore the effect of a person's life course on HIV does not necessarily start at diagnosis and can only be understood when one takes into account the combined effects of social and biological risk occurring in early life.\n\n【4】Jose and colleagues have made a valiant attempt to overcome the limitations of traditional models of the care continuum and provide some techniques to assess the HIV continuum of care longitudinally using linked population-based clinical data. Further studies using these methods will improve comparability across studies and populations. HIV is just one part of a person's life and treatment is more than a medication. Martin, a gay man living in London diagnosed with HIV in 2014, notes, “It's strange sometimes because you look at this pill and you think between you and this little pill lies—it's keeping you alive. And I have never had a pill to take like that before. So, it's very strange. It's my friend and foe at the same time”. Future studies are needed to better understand this conflict, and hopefully the development of methodological tools will allow us to take a life course approach.\n\n【5】I have received a Foundation Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (grant number 143342).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The deletion (D), rather than the insertion (I), ACE gene variant is associated with increased ACE activity and kinin degradation, and the absence (-) rather than the presence (+) of a 9 bp deletion in the gene encoding the bradykinin 2 receptor (B2BKR) is associated with greater gene expression. We determined the ACE and B2BKR genotype of 109 male army recruits, and measured their physiological left-ventricular growth response to a 10-week physical training programme. Mean left-ventricular growth was 15.7 g (SE 3.5) in those with ACE genotype D/D and B2BKR genotype +9/+9, but -1.37 g (4.1) in those with ACE genotype I/I and B2BKR genotype -9/-9 (p=0.003 for trend across genotypes). These results suggest that kinins regulate left-ventricular growth, mediating some of the effects of ACE in this regard.\n\n【2】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【8】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【9】### Subscribe:\n\n【10】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【11】Already a print subscriber?

Born in West Malling, UK, on May 20, 1922, he died of metastatic colorectal cancer on Nov 21, 2006, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, aged 84 years.\n\n【2】David Bates was a young doctor working in the UK at St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1952 when a cold fog descended on London for 4 days in December, followed by a thick sulphurous smoky fog. Unbeknown to him at the time, a coroner noted that the morgues were full. But in a city that had been subject to deadly bombings and attendant smoke, and was used to fogs, no one bothered to connect the cold fog—and resultant increase in the burning of coal—with the full morgues. “When I arrived at Bart's Hospital on 10 December 1952, everything was normal for that time of year. Our wards at that time of year always had a number of cases of advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, many in outright heart failure”, Bates would later write in _Environmental Health Perspectives_ . London was, however, also full of cigarette smokers breathing air polluted by low-quality, high-sulphur coal. During the next 2 months 12 000 people died as a result of this fog.\n\n【3】The incident led to new laws on clean air, and it sparked Bates' interest in respiratory physiology. In 1956, he moved to McGill University, Montreal, Canada, where he studied the effects of ozone on the lung. He and his colleagues published seminal papers on ventilation and lung physiology, and on what happened in the lung when it was damaged by environmental pollutants. Jon Samet, professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, met him in the late 1970s. By then, Bates had shifted his focus to the epidemiology linking pollution and lung disease. “David was a key figure in beginning to understand how the lung was damaged by environmental agents like tobacco and air pollution and what the physiological effects are”, Samet said. “Then what made him intrigued was how populations are affected, so he moved onto epidemiology.”\n\n【4】Bates joined the University of British Columbia in Vancouver as dean in 1972. He held that post until 1977. In the 1980s, he and Ronnie Sizto published two highly cited papers on air pollution and hospital admissions in southern Ontario, which they called “the acid summer haze effect”. A 1992 paper in _Environmental Research_ on health indices of the adverse effects of air pollution and the question of coherence was also quite popular, Samet said, and influenced the US Environmental Protection Agency's standards.\n\n【5】In 1991, Bates helped plan the University of Southern California Children's Health Study, a study of air pollution in southern California that he advised for 15 years. “He knew more about more aspects of the health effects of air pollution than anyone I knew”, said John Peters, who worked with him at the University of Southern California and is director of the university's division of environmental health. Bates was also a well-respected mentor. “He could tell you that you were wrong without making you feel bad”, Peters said. Bates was a “forceful advocate for environmental protection”, said Frank Speizer, professor of environmental science at Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA. He would urge others to go beyond the pure scientific papers and synthesise so that they could campaign for change. In 2003, he and Peters, along with colleagues, published one such paper in the _American Journal of Public Health_ titled “Breathless in Los Angeles”. It concluded: “Our children deserve a visionary public health regulatory policy that addresses these challenges and protects them from sources of air pollution.” In the past few years, Bates co-edited a newsletter for the California Air Resources Board meant for the general public.\n\n【6】Bates was known for the poetry he wrote and as a raconteur, including one anecdote, recalled Spezier, about how, when penicillin was being tested, Bates had the job of administering the shot, then collecting the participants' urine and carrying it back to the laboratory on his bicycle for analysis. He “kept an open and inquisitive mind both in science and in non-science”, Peters said. Bates is survived by his children, Andrew, Elizabeth, and Joanna, a senior associate dean in medical education at the University of British Columbia. His wife, Margaret Sutton, predeceased him.\n\n【7】Article info\n------------\n\n【8】### Publication history\n\n【9】Published: 20 January 2007\n\n【10】### Identification\n\n【11】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60095-6\n\n【12】### Copyright\n\n【13】© 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

{"seq_id": "b7ce19a9-8863-4102-aa6f-8af79a2fa483", "title": "Neonatal early-onset infections: Comparing the sensitivity of the neonatal early-onset sepsis calculator to the Dutch and the updated NICE guidelines in an observational cohort of culture-positive cases", "text": "【0】Neonatal early-onset infections: Comparing the sensitivity of the neonatal early-onset sepsis calculator to the Dutch and the updated NICE guidelines in an observational cohort of culture-positive cases\nSummary\n-------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】The early-onset sepsis calculator (EOSC) reduces unnecessary antibiotic treatment in newborns. However, its performance in identifying cases with early-onset disease (EOD) is unclear. We compared the sensitivity of the EOSC to the current Dutch and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines when applied to a cohort of newborns with culture-positive early-onset sepsis and meningitis.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Culture-positive _Streptococcus agalactiae_ (GBS) and _Escherichia coli_ ( _E. coli_ ) sepsis and meningitis patients ≤3 days old with a gestational age ≥34 weeks, identified between 1/1/2018 and 31/1/2021 in a Dutch prospective nationwide cohort study were included. Cases were identified by treating physicians and microbiological surveillance. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients that would have been treated according to the EOSC, the Dutch, and the NICE EOD prevention guidelines. Differences between proportions were analysed using McNemar's test.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We included 81 GBS and 7 _E. coli_ EOD cases. At 4 h after birth, the EOSC would have recommended antibiotic treatment in 32 (36%) patients, compared to 44 (50%) by the Dutch ( _p_ <0·01) and 48 (55%) by the NICE guideline ( _p_ <0·01). The EOSC would have initially recommended routine care for 52% of patients compared to 31% and 30% for the Dutch and NICE guidelines ( _p_ <0·01). At 24 h after birth, the EOSC would have recommended antibiotic treatment in 54 (61%) infants compared to 64 (73%) by the Dutch ( _p_ \\= 0·02) and 63 (72%) by the NICE guidelines ( _p_ \\= 0·06).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The sensitivity of the EOSC in identifying cases of EOD is lower compared to both Dutch and NICE guidelines, especially directly after birth. The EOSC relies more on clinical symptoms and results in less overtreatment of healthy newborns at the cost of later antibiotic treatment in initially well-appearing EOD patients.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】This work was supported by grants received from Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw; NWO-Vidi-Grant (grant number 917·17·308 ); NWO-Vici-Grant (grant number 918·19·627 )), the Academic Medical Centre (AMC Innovative Impulse Grant) and Steun Emma Foundation Grant.\n\n【11】Key words\n---------\n\n【12】*   early-onset disease (EOD)\n*   sepsis\n*   meningitis\n*   sepsis calculator\n*   EOS calculator\n*   newborns\n*   neonates\n*   cohort study\n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】### Evidence before this study\n\n【15】We searched PubMed for studies published from 2011 (introduction of the neonatal early-onset sepsis calculator \\[EOSC\\]) onwards by searching all fields for (“early-onset sepsis calculator” OR “EOS risk calculator” OR “sepsis risk calculator” or “Kaiser sepsis calculator”) and title and abstract fields for (”early onset sepsis” or ”neonatal sepsis”), with no language restrictions.\n\n【16】A limited number of studies of which most were retrospective, have shown that both the EOSC and the former National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline have poor sensitivity in identifying early-onset disease (EOD) cases. No studies have compared the EOSC to the current Dutch (2017) and NICE (2021) guidelines.\n\n【17】### Added value of this study\n\n【18】To our knowledge, our study used the largest prospective cohort of culture-positive EOD cases to compare the sensitivity of the EOSC to the Dutch and the NICE guidelines. It is also the first study comparing the sensitivity of the EOSC to the new (2021) NICE guideline. In our cohort of 88 culture-positive EOD cases, the EOSC would have recommended antibiotic treatment in 36% directly after birth, which was lower than the sensitivity of the Dutch (50%, _p_ <0·01) and NICE guideline (55%, _p_ <0·01). In 52% of EOD cases, the EOSC would have recommended routine care directly after birth, compared to 31% and 30% for the Dutch ( _p_ <0.01) and NICE guidelines ( _p_ <0·01), respectively.\n\n【19】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【20】Our results show that neither the EOSC nor current national guidelines are able to predict EOD with high sensitivity. Although current guidelines result in more antibiotic overtreatment, the EOSC would likely result in later recognition and treatment of EOD patients that initially are asymptomatic. Therefore, better EOD risk stratification methods are needed.\n\n【21】Introduction\n------------\n\n【22】Neonatal early-onset sepsis and meningitis (early-onset disease; EOD) are important causes of neonatal death. <sup>, </sup> The predominant pathogen is Group B _Streptococcus_ (GBS; _Streptococcus agalactiae_ ), causing one-third to half of all EOD cases. <sup>, </sup> Survivors of invasive GBS disease are at increased risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. In the United Kingdom (UK), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, intended for the management of EOD, was updated (NG195) in 2021. It provides recommendations for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) and for empiric antibiotic treatment of newborns with clinical signs or maternal risk factors. In the Netherlands, the NICE guideline was adapted with the last update in 2017.\n\n【23】These national EOD prevention guidelines come with two important limitations. First, the incidence of early-onset GBS disease in both countries is increasing. <sup>, </sup> In 46% of culture-positive EOD cases, maternal risk factors are absent, making it difficult to identify these patients when clinical signs are not (yet) present. Second, the non-specific clinical and biochemical manifestations of EOD cause substantial antibiotic overtreatment in healthy newborns. In the UK, 13–20% of infants on the postnatal wards receive empiric antibiotic treatment for suspected EOD and in the Netherlands a percentage of 5% has been reported. <sup>, </sup> Antibiotic use in newborns results in separation of parents and child and is associated with various adverse outcomes, such as disruption of the infant gut microbiome and asthma and obesity in later life. <sup>,</sup>\n\n【24】The Kaiser Permanente neonatal early-onset sepsis risk calculator (EOSC) is an online tool for EOD risk assessment in newborns ≥34 weeks of gestation. Treatment recommendations are based on the evaluation of maternal risk factors and neonatal clinical findings. The new NICE guideline endorses the use of the EOSC as an alternative framework for antibiotic management decisions, under the condition that it is part of a prospective audit. A meta-analysis showed that implementation of the EOSC reduces the use of empirical antibiotic treatment with a relative risk of 56% compared to conventional strategies. A recent meta-analysis on 234 EOD cases showed that the EOSC did not recommend immediate initiation of antibiotic treatment, but close clinical observation or routine care, in 59% of newborns with culture-confirmed EOD. Although it was not a primary outcome for these meta-analyses, there were no short-term adverse consequences when using the EOSC. However, little is known about the sensitivity of the EOSC to detect early-onset sepsis.\n\n【25】The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity of the EOSC to the Dutch and NICE guidelines, using culture-positive EOD patients from a Dutch nationwide prospective cohort study.\n\n【26】Methods\n-------\n\n【27】### Study design\n\n【28】All patients with a positive blood- or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture <72 h of life and a gestational age of ≥34 weeks from “ _the Netherlands observational study on GBS disease, bacterial virulence and protective serology (NOGBS)_ ” that were included between 1/1/2018 and 31/1/2021 were used for the present study. The NOGBS study was approved by the medical ethical committee of the Amsterdam University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands (protocol no. NL-63,123·018·17, approved on October 12th, 2017). Written, informed consent was provided by the patient's caregivers. The NOGBS study is an ongoing Dutch multicentre prospective cohort study that includes infants aged 0–3 months with culture-positive GBS or _Escherichia coli_ ( _E. coli_ ) sepsis or meningitis. Patients were prospectively identified through the surveillance system of the Netherlands Reference Laboratory for Bacterial meningitis (NRLBM). The NRLBM receives approximately 90% of all CSF isolates of patients with a bacterial meningitis in the Netherlands. Additionally, the NRLBM receives blood isolates of infants under the age of 1 year with GBS or _E. coli_ sepsis and/or meningitis. Based on these microbiological surveillance data and approximately 170,000 yearly live births in the Netherlands, approximately 130 cases of culture-positive GBS and _E. coli_ infections (<1 week of life) would be expected during the study period. <sup>, </sup> Physicians could also contact the investigators at any time to include a patient. This study adheres to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.\n\n【29】### Data collection and definitions\n\n【30】EOD was defined as a positive blood or CSF culture obtained <72 h of life. The Dutch and the NICE guidelines recommend clinical observation when one maternal or neonatal non-red flag is present and antibiotic treatment when two or more non-red flags or one or more red flags are present (Supplementary Table 1). <sup>, </sup> The majority of risk factors were collected prospectively. For the NICE guideline, three additional risk factors were obtained retrospectively: the presence or absence of oliguria, unexplained excessive bleeding or thrombocytopenia and altered muscle tone. For the EOSC, GBS status was considered positive if the result of the rectovaginal swab or urine culture was positive for GBS and available at the day of birth. In the Netherlands, intravenous penicillin is the first choice for IAP. Two additional risk factors were collected retrospectively for the EOSC: highest maternal intrapartum temperature and duration of rupture of membranes in hours. Highest maternal temperature was missing for 30 (34%) of 88 patients. Each infant was retrospectively scored as well appearing, equivocal, or clinically ill at 4, 12 and 24 h after birth ( Table 1 ). Regarding the clinical course and outcome, we defined severe disease as any of the following: meningitis, seizures, brain lesions at hospital discharge, need for catecholamine support, mechanical ventilation or death.\n\n【31】Table 1 .

The prior estimated EOD risk at birth is based on overall EOD incidence and five maternal risk factors (gestational age, highest intrapartum temperature, duration of rupture of membranes, GBS status and IAP). Although the EOSC offers the possibility to specify the baseline incidence for the target population, a recent article has argued that the EOSC performs best when the incidence from the developmental set is used, independent of the true EOD incidence in a particular population. Following this advice, we used an incidence of 0·6 per 1000 live births. The prior odds were multiplied by the likelihood ratio of the newborn's clinical examination to calculate the posterior odds. The posterior odds were converted to the posterior risk per 1000 live births. Following the decision diagram for the EOSC, different treatment recommendations were defined: routine care (posterior risk <1/1000 live births), monitoring vital signs every four hours (posterior risk <1/1000 live births, but prior risk >1/1000 live births), monitoring vital signs every four hours and blood culture assessment (posterior risk 1–3/1000 live births) and antibiotic treatment (posterior risk >3/1000 live births or clinical signs of illness).\n\n【36】For each patient, treatment advice was determined retrospectively at 4, 12 and 24 h after birth. These time points were chosen based on previously described and recommended timeframes for EOSC use. <sup>, </sup> In addition, 12 and 24 h are commonly used observation periods in clinical practice for newborns at risk of EOD. Treatment advice was classified into three groups: routine care, clinical observation (vitals every 4 h) and antibiotic treatment. Sensitivity was based on the proportion of newborns with antibiotic treatment recommendation. We compared the sensitivities of both guidelines to the EOSC.\n\n【37】### Statistical analyses\n\n【38】The proportion of patients with antibiotic treatment advice by the EOSC was compared to that of the Dutch and NICE guidelines using the McNemar's test. Differences were considered statistically significant at a p-value of 0·05 or less. Continuous data were reported as median with interquartile range (IQR). Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 26·0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In cases where the highest maternal temperature was missing, we used multiple linear regression to estimate the highest maternal temperature as suggested by Puopolo et al. This study was the basis for the development of the EOSC and provides a linear regression model that uses duration of rupture of membranes, administration of IAP and the presence of epidural anaesthesia as predictors of highest maternal temperature. As a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the hypothetical situation of universal GBS screening, assuming all mothers of GBS patients would have been identified as GBS carriers. Based on this situation, recommendations concerning IAP for the mother and antibiotic treatment for the infants were determined based on the Dutch and NICE guideline.\n\n【39】### Role of the funding source\n\n【40】The funding source did not have any involvement in study design; data collection, data analysis or interpretation, or in the writing of the article.\n\n【41】Results\n-------\n\n【42】We identified 88 EOD patients born at a gestational age ≥34 weeks from the NOGBS study ( Figure 1 ). All patients had a positive blood culture and 11 (13%) also had a positive CSF culture ( Table 2 ). GBS was the causative pathogen in 81 (92%) patients. Median gestational age was 39 3 + 7 weeks (IQR 37+3–40+4 weeks, range 34+1–41+6). Sixty-one (69%) patients developed symptoms within 12 h after birth. In 67 (76%) patients symptoms were present at 24 h after birth, of whom 24 (36%) were classified as clinically ill directly after birth. Three (3%) of 88 patients did not develop any symptoms. However, early antibiotic treatment might have prevented the development of symptoms, as these patients were treated directly after birth based on the presence of maternal risk factors incorporated in the Dutch guideline.

Of the 32 patients with treatment recommendation according to the EOSC, 24 (75%) were scored as clinically ill. Only one (3%) patient was scored as well-appearing and would have been treated based on the presence of maternal risk factors only. In 46 (52%) of 88 patients, the EOSC would have recommended routine care, compared to 27 (31%) by the Dutch guideline ( _p_ <0·01) and 26 (30%) by the NICE guideline ( _p_ <0·01).\n\n【51】Figure 2 **Treatment advice at different ages by the EOSC, the Dutch and the NICE guidelines** .\n\n【52】Show full caption\n\n【53】_N_ \\= 88.

At 12 h after birth, the EOSC would have recommended antibiotic treatment in 48 (55%) patients, compared to 61 (69%) by the Dutch guideline ( _p_ <0·01) and 60 (68%) by the NICE guideline ( _p_ \\= 0·02). At 24 h after birth, 54 (61%) patients would have been treated according to the EOSC, compared to 64 (73%) by the Dutch guideline ( _p_ \\= 0·02) and 63 (72%) by the NICE guideline ( _p_ \\= 0·06).\n\n【56】In 17 (19%) of 88 patients, antibiotic treatment recommendation by the EOSC differed from both guidelines ( Figure 3 ). In 15 (88%) of these patients, both guidelines would have recommended antibiotic treatment directly after birth, while the EOSC would not. However, following EOSC guidance, these 15 patients would have initially been scored as “well appearing” or “equivocal”, resulting in routine care (7 \\[47%\\]) or close clinical observation (8 \\[53%\\]). At 24 h after birth, 3 (38%) of 8 patients with a clinical observation recommendation had developed symptoms that would initiate antibiotic treatment according to the EOSC. In 2 (12%) of 17 patients, EOSC application would result in antibiotic treatment directly after birth, contrary to both guidelines. Both patients had no maternal risk factors and were scored as clinically ill due to respiratory problems. These symptoms accounted for one non-red flag in both guidelines, resulting in clinical observation only.\n\n【57】Figure 3 Patients with a discrepancy between the EOSC and guideline recommendations to start antibiotic treatment shortly after birth.\n\n【58】Show full caption\n\n【59】_N_ \\=number of cases.

In 10 (40%) of these patients, the EOSC would have recommended antibiotic treatment directly after birth, compared to 11 (44%) by the Dutch guideline ( _p_ \\= 0·50) and 12 (48%) by the NICE guideline ( _p_ \\= 0·25). When comparing the group of patients where antibiotics were started within 24 h to patients where antibiotics were started after 24 h, the proportion of meningitis cases in the latter group was higher: 1 (2%) of 65 and 10 (43%) of 23 ( _p_ <0.01), respectively. However, Lumbar puncture was performed more than 24 h after start of antibiotic treatment in 38 (83%) in the 46 patients who were treated early, compared to 5 (26%) of the 19 patients who were started on antibiotic after 24 h of life ( _p_ <0.01, Supplementary Table 3).\n\n【62】### Sensitivity of the updated nice guideline compared to the previous nice guideline\n\n【63】Compared to the former guideline, the sensitivity of the new NICE guideline increased with an absolute 1% at 4 h after birth and decreased with an absolute 2% at 12 and 24 h after birth. For one patient, the advice changed from clinical observation to antibiotic treatment, due to the need for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This was a non-red flag in the former guideline and a red flag in the new guideline. On the other hand, the former guideline would have recommended antibiotic treatment in three patients, while the new guideline would have recommended clinical observation. All three patients had respiratory distress with an onset >4 h after birth, which accounted for a red flag in the old guideline and a non-red flag in the new guideline. The other changes in risk factors did not affect antibiotic treatment advice.\n\n【64】### Sensitivity analysis\n\n【65】We assessed the hypothetical situation of universal GBS screening, assuming that all 81 mothers of GBS patients would have been identified as GBS carriers. In this scenario, 33 (41%) of 81 mothers would have received IAP according to the Dutch guideline due to additional risk factors, and IAP would have been considered in the remaining 48 (59%). In the real situation, only 11 (14%) of 81 mothers of GBS patients in our cohort received IAP, and in 2 (18%) prophylaxis was considered adequate (at least two doses of intravenous antibiotics prior to delivery). The NICE guideline would have offered IAP to all pregnant women with GBS colonization. Concerning the newborns, the Dutch guideline would have recommended antibiotic treatment in 53 (65%) of 81 patients and the NICE guideline in 54 (67%) patients, compared to 41 (51%) and 45 (56%) in the current situation ( _p_ <0·01 and _p_ <0·01, respectively).\n\n【66】Discussion\n----------\n\n【67】The primary aim of the present study was to compare the sensitivity of the EOSC to the current Dutch and NICE guidelines. In our cohort of 88 culture-positive EOD patients, both national risk-based guidelines and the EOSC had poor sensitivity directly after birth. However, the EOSC performed significantly worse, especially in identifying EOD patients without signs of clinical illness. During the first day of life, differences between the guidelines and the EOSC became smaller due to clinical deterioration of newborns.\n\n【68】Our findings are in line with the retrospective study by Morris et al., who found a sensitivity of 39% for the EOSC compared to 56% for the former NICE guideline in the first hours after birth. Our results also correspond to those of a recent meta-analysis on 234 EOD patients, which reported that the EOSC recommends antibiotics in 41% of EOD patients shortly after birth.\n\n【69】The EOSC relies more heavily on signs of clinical illness, resulting in a more specific approach and a substantial reduction in unnecessary EOD treatments. This comes at the expense of sensitivity, as can be expected. However, with the EOSC, more initially well-appearing patients will receive delayed treatment. Previous studies showed no short-term adverse consequences when waiting for clinical signs to develop before starting antibiotic treatment. <sup>, </sup> However, studies on long-term outcomes are lacking.\n\n【70】The benefits of the EOSC in reducing antibiotic overexposure are well-established. Future studies should focus on improving the sensitivity of the EOSC while minimizing additional overtreatment. Current Dutch and UK prevention guidelines and the EOSC are based on decades of research into clinical risk factors for EOD. It seems unlikely that new clinical risk factors will be found that will both increase sensitivity and specificity. This presumption is exemplified by our finding that the new NICE guideline has similar poor sensitivity compared to the old version.\n\n【71】Implementation of screening for rectovaginal GBS colonization will likely improve sensitivity, but has been shown to increase antibiotic overtreatment even more. However, there also studies that do not show an increase in antibiotic treatment when using screening instead of risk based strategies. Furthermore, not all EOD cases are due to GBS and in countries with universal GBS screening, 61–73% of GBS EOD patients are born to mothers who tested GBS negative. <sup>,</sup>\n\n【72】Potential strategies to improve EOD identification in well-appearing newborns are the evaluation of acute phase reactant biomarkers like C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin, and the molecular detection of EOD-specific pathogens in cord blood. <sup>, </sup> Although many potential biomarkers have been identified, there is currently no diagnostic test for the detection of neonatal EOD with an acceptable sensitivity and specificity. However, some studies have shown that adding blood biomarkers, like CRP and procalcitonin, to the EOSC improves diagnostic accuracy.\n\n【73】In half of newborns ultimately diagnosed with EOD, the EOSC would have initially recommended ‘routine care’. This indicates that clinical observation might be required for all newborns. A recent approach to manage newborns at risk for early-onset sepsis is based on serial physical examinations. Two studies from Italy and Norway showed that serial examination, performed by midwives, bedside nursing staff and physicians, may reduce antibiotic overexposure even more than the EOSC, with no evidence of worse short-term outcomes. <sup>, </sup> However, as with the EOSC, studies on long term outcomes are lacking. Due to the observational nature of this study, our finding that meningitis was more common in patients that were started on antibiotics >24 h after birth, cannot be interpreted as proof for a causal relationship between later initiation of antibiotics and development of meningitis. The Dutch guideline does not recommend routine lumbar puncture in newborns that qualify for antibiotic treatment due to maternal risk factors only. Fewer lumbar punctures were performed in this subgroup that received early antibiotic treatment, and most lumbar punctures were done more than 24 h after starting antibiotic treatment (Supplementary Table 3). This has likely resulted in some false negative culture results in these patients. Also, many studies have shown that late-onset GBS disease is strongly associated with meningitis. It might be that the children who became clinically ill after 24 h resemble the late-onset population more than children who were started on antibiotics within 24 h.\n\n【74】This is the first study that directly compares the sensitivity of the Dutch guideline for the prevention of neonatal early-onset infections with the EOSC. It is also the first study determining the sensitivity of the new NICE guideline and comparing it to the EOSC. Another strength is the prospective character of the cohort study and the relatively high number of culture-positive EOD cases. Our study has several limitations. First, we retrospectively determined the clinical condition of each newborn. It was occasionally difficult to determine the exact duration of symptoms that is required for the ‘equivocal’ category of infant's clinical condition for the EOSC. Second, in some patients, antibiotics were started shortly after birth. This early treatment could have influenced the clinical condition of the newborn at 24 h of age, leading to a lower sensitivity of both guidelines, but especially the EOSC at that time point. Third, the prediction model that the EOSC is based on, has not been validated in the Dutch population with a lower incidence of EOD. <sup>,</sup>\n\n【75】In conclusion, the current Dutch guideline, the current NICE guideline, and the EOSC all suffer from poor sensitivity. These differences become smaller during the first day of life, as the EOSC depends heavily on signs of clinical illness. Other reports have found that the higher sensitivity of both guidelines comes at the cost of more antibiotic overtreatment of healthy newborns. <sup>, </sup> Vice versa, the more specific approach of the EOSC results in less antibiotic overtreatment at the cost of later treatment of actual EOD patients. Better EOD risk stratification is needed.\n\n【76】Contributors\n------------\n\n【77】LS, MNvK, FBP, NBA and MWB designed the study.

Gag clauses, for example, provide industrial sponsors of clinical research, usually clinical trials, with complete control over what an investigator can publish. From 2001, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, which represents many leading journals, required that the responsible author of a study provides a written statement that he or she accepts full responsibility for its conduct, has full access to the data, and controls the decision to publish. But many of these requirements are still not being met in most clinical-trial agreements between medical schools and industrial sponsors. A notable exception is the University of Toronto, Canada; since 2001, this institution has demanded comprehensive standards for all industry-sponsored clinical research. Its Dean is quoted as saying that some contracts are being lost as a result of these policies; “you are left with the sound of one hand clapping when you do this on your own, even in the country's largest medical school”.\n\n【3】One of the main reasons that Toronto put its house in order was its poor showing in the case of Nancy Olivieri, an expert on thalassaemia. In 1987, Olivieri began a study of the oral iron-chelator, deferiprone (L1), to find out if it might be effective in the control of iron loading in patients with severe thalassaemia who have regular transfusions. At first, the results were encouraging and she therefore initiated a company-sponsored trial to compare the efficacy of deferiprone with deferoxamine (desferrioxamine), a drug that was known to be effective in the control of iron loading but which has to be delivered by subcutaneous infusion. During the trial Olivieri noticed that a significant proportion of her patients seemed to be accumulating iron and that there might also be an unexpected side-effect. Hence she felt that her patients and the research community should be made aware of her findings. Despite threats of lawsuits by the company, she published her observations.\n\n【4】The University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children, which at the time were in the process of negotiating a large donation from the same company, did not support Olivieri in her controversy with the company and, later, referred her to the Canadian College of Physicians and Surgeons for research misconduct. They also tried to dismiss her from her post, although, mainly owing to the efforts of her colleagues, she was ultimately reinstated. During this unsavoury episode, which lasted for many years, Olivieri and the small group of clinical scientists in Toronto who supported her were subjected to continuous stress, including anonymous hatemail. In the end, she was completely vindicated by an independent 500-page report, and by the College of Physicians and Surgeons that found her conduct “exemplary”.\n\n【5】These reports apart, this case has been the subject of fully documented accounts in at least three books that deal with problems at the academia/industrial interface: Jerome Kassirer's _On the Take_ , Sheldon Krimsky's _Science in the Private Interest_ , and Marcia Angell's _The Truth About Drug Companies_ . At first sight, therefore, it is difficult to see why there should be a place for yet another book on this topic, particularly so long after these unfortunate events; surely, all concerned should be left in peace to get on with their professional lives.\n\n【6】Miriam Shuchman's _The Drug Trial_ takes a different, and to this reviewer inexplicable, approach to anything that has gone before. First, it gives a blow-by-blow description of the scientific disagreements and intrigues that bedevilled the development of deferiprone from its early beginnings in the UK, and which have raged unabated during the past 10 years. But there is nothing new in this; in any field of research there are controversies, personality clashes, and persistent doubters. This is how science evolves; it may take many years before the truth emerges, as it will in determining the role of deferiprone. The only difference in this case is that many of these disagreements were aired at scientific meetings that were attended by patients' parents and heavily influenced by commerce.\n\n【7】But the really puzzling and disturbing feature of Shuchman's book is that, in retelling this story, she presents it in the form of a biography—or rather a pathobiography—of Olivieri and those who supported her. She includes anecdotal accounts, some of them hurtful, of her relationships with her parents, friends, staff, scientific colleagues, patients, and, apparently, anybody else who was willing to voice an opinion. In her “Note on Sources”, Shuchman admits that her book makes extensive use of off-the-record material. She writes, “many of the doctors and scientists who witnessed the events described here feared for their reputations if they were quoted, and some worried that they would be fired from their jobs or sued for libel”. Things have come to a sorry pass if scientists who tell the truth run the risk of professional dissolution; clearly, the current biographer's lot is not a happy one.\n\n【8】In summing up, Shuchman suggests that Olivieri's concerns about deferiprone may have heavily influenced the drug-licensing bodies in the USA and Canada such that many patients have been excluded from its benefits. But if one person's views can really influence these bodies to this extent, it is they that are at fault. Could it be that they have taken a more critical look at the literature than their counterparts elsewhere when assessing current research on deferiprone?\n\n【9】Unfortunately, by ignoring Alexander Pope's advice to critics, Shuchman completely submerges the central message of this unfortunate affair. When a scientist had concerns about the efficacy of a drug, attempts were made by a company to prevent her disseminating this information. At the time, her university and teaching hospital did not have adequate processes in place, or the leadership required, to deal with this problem; a long and destructive controversy followed. But at least the outcome was a successful effort on the part of the University of Toronto to regulate clinical-research funding by companies, dissemination of the associated dangers to the scientific community, and a start, albeit not yet completely successful, at trying to regulate these potentially dangerous liaisons more effectively.\n\n【10】The current problems at the interface between clinical research and commerce are too important to be treated in a personalised, anecdotal, or inaccurate way. Those who wish to explore this worrying problem, and we all should, would be better advised to consult the several less emotive, better-documented, and broader-based accounts by Kassirer, Krimsky, and Angell. But at least Shuchman's retrospective is a warning to others who are contemplating taking a stand against commerce; if you do, those that you cross along the way may try to ensure that your lives are never quite the same again.\n\n【11】**Conflict of interest statement**\n\n【12】I am a research collaborator of Nancy Olivieri and supported the scientists in Toronto who helped her during the events covered by this book.\n\n【13】Article info\n------------\n\n【14】### Publication history\n\n【15】Published: 06 August 2005\n\n【16】### Identification\n\n【17】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67043-2\n\n【18】### Copyright\n\n【19】© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Teenage HIV and an expanding population of homeless children have inflamed the debate about health services for young people. But instead of investment, the government is urging paediatricians to retrain as GPs. Tom Parfitt reports.\n\n【1】Masha Karilina's skin is yellow, her bones are weak and she looks no bigger than a child half her 10 years of age.\n\n【2】“When I walk a lot my legs hurt”, she says. “But after the operation I'll be able to go swimming and do a lot of other things. I'll only have to take some tablets.”\n\n【3】Masha is one of the few children with chronic renal failure that make it to the kidney transplantation centre of the Russian Children's Clinical Hospital in southern Moscow. Once a suitable donor organ has been found, Masha will undergo a transplant operation. She will then no longer have to stop six times a day to hook up her catheter to a portable dialysis machine. Her skin will regain its youthful flush and the osteoporosis that gives her a sweeping gait will slowly ease.\n\n【4】Masha's mother, Tatyana, brought her daughter here from Saratov, 500 miles away on the banks of the Volga. Local hospitals could not help but the regional health ministry sent Masha to the Moscow hospital, the only one in Russia with a specialised kidney transplant centre for children.\n\n【5】Thousands of others never get that far. Aleksei Valov, the transplant specialist who will operate on Masha, says only 15–20% of children in Russia with serious kidney problems get access to the necessary dialysis equipment. What happens to the rest? “They die”, he says.\n\n【6】It's a sharp reminder of the fact that children's health in Russia is approaching a crisis point. Across the country, state clinics and hospitals are crying out for new equipment, while constantly losing staff to private institutions and other professions. In remote areas, health care is thinly spread or unavailable to those who cannot afford bribes.\n\n【7】The Russian Children's Clinical Hospital—where treatment is free—is blessed with an excellent fundraising team that rakes in charitable support; a rare exception.\n\n【8】15 years after the Soviet collapse, figures released this year by a senior health ministry official painted a shocking picture of the state of children's health.\n\n【9】Olga Sharapova, director of the ministry's department for medical and social problems of the family, mothers, and children, announced at a conference in Moscow that only about 30% of newborn children are healthy and 50 of them die per day, mostly because of poor equipment and training in maternity hospitals.\n\n【10】“Nearly half of pupils enrolled in primary school suffer from a major gastro-intestinal or cardiovascular disorder and a majority of secondary school leavers have a chronic illness”, she adds.\n\n【11】During the past 10 years, the number of disabled children has doubled, while the number of paediatricians to treat them has shrunk by 10 000, Sharapova told the conference in April.\n\n【12】The gloomy report tallied with equally depressing statistics from WHO, showing that despite efforts to curtail Russia's under-5 child mortality rate, it has held steady at 21 per 1000 livebirths since 1990 (compared with current figures of 7/1000 in the UK and 9/1000 in Poland).\n\n【13】While there are some signs of improvement since the turbulent years of the early 1990s, the general picture remains depressing.\n\n【14】Around 25% of Russians live below the poverty line while family breakdown, divorce, and drugs are putting more and more children at risk. Russia's population of homeless children is growing, causing a surge in problems such as alcoholism and solvent abuse, affecting children as young as 6 years.\n\n【15】In recent months, the increasingly worrying situation has ignited fresh debate about funding and the future of children's health care.\n\n【16】The health-care system maintains a heavy emphasis on treatment rather than preventive care and, in theory, has an extensive network of services for children.\n\n【17】Children's hospitals in towns are supported by “polyclinics”, which each have a range of specialist paediatricians, mirroring the system for adults. Mothers give birth at a chain of maternity hospitals. In rural areas, services for adults and children are often amalgamated in one clinic, but even in the remotest Siberian village the inhabitants should have access to ambulatory care at a local medic station.\n\n【18】“The structure of medical services for children in Russia is one of the best in the world”, argues Leonid Roshal, the country's most famous paediatrician.\n\n【19】Roshal, 72, won international acclaim when he acted as a negotiator with Chechen militants during the hostage crises in Moscow in 2002 and Beslan in 2004. A member of the presidential human rights commission, he is a stubborn defender of the Soviet health care model, which maintained a vast army of paediatricians and other specialists.\n\n【20】In recent months, Roshal has launched a series of withering attacks on a health-ministry initiative to reform the old system by retraining paediatricians as general practitioners, rewarding them with increased wage packages.\n\n【21】Announcing the plan earlier this year, health minister Mikhail Zurabov said: “The introduction of the general-practitioner system will allow increases in doctors' salaries and, of course, will greatly help us place doctors in rural areas.”\n\n【22】Roshal disagrees. “It is awful”, he fumes in his office at the Moscow Institute of Emergency Children's Surgery and Traumatology. “We lack 30–40% of paediatricians at the primary level and the ministry wants to tempt away \\[those that remain\\], using these salaries like chocolate.”\n\n【23】Yet even Roshal admits the status quo is failing Russia's children. 80–90% of equipment in clinics is outdated, he says, the result of a chronic lack of state funding. And polyclinics are haemorrhaging staff who cannot survive on monthly salary of US$130.\n\n【24】Low pay is a bane of the profession and fuels corruption on a giant scale. While the majority of state medical care should be free, doctors often charge for medicines or consultations because they can't survive on their meagre salaries.\n\n【25】“We even know of cases where mothers with HIV are asked to pay for milk formula for their babies”, says Julie Dixon, regional director of AIDS Foundation East West, which is running two programmes to curb mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n\n【26】The result is that mothers, many of them sex workers and drug users with unstable incomes, cannot afford the formula and are forced to endanger their child by breastfeeding.\n\n【27】Ministry of health officials announced in April that the number of HIV-infected children has topped 13 000, up from just six cases in 1996.\n\n【28】One reason for the spurt is that between 25% and 40% of women with HIV do not seek prenatal care, meaning they are not prescribed antiretroviral drugs that could prevent transmission of the infection to their child.\n\n【29】Recent research shows that young people, and in particular 15–18 year-olds girls, are at ever increasing risk of contracting HIV through sexual contact.\n\n【30】Experts place much of the blame on limited family planning advice and reproductive counselling; state funding for the former was slashed in 1999 amid mounting concern about the population crisis.\n\n【31】Another concern is the absence of sex education in schools and the lack of public campaigns to raise awareness about AIDS and other social issues.\n\n【32】Oganes Sarukhanyan, a children's surgeon in Moscow, says he is treating more and more victims of traffic accidents; in part a global trend linked to urbanisation, but also a particular problem in Russia.\n\n【33】“We need more prophylactics to stop these accidents happening in the first place”, he says. “More work with traffic police and drivers to limit drink-driving, more television advertising.”\n\n【34】Poisoning, accidents, and alcohol-related and violent crime are a major cause of death and injury, according to WHO. Russia has about ten times the number of traffic accidents in the UK each year, with less than three times the population.\n\n【35】“Rehabilitation is another important issue”, says Sarukhanyan. “We are saving a lot of children now who would have died in the past. But when they become invalids there aren't enough services to help them.”\n\n【36】Roshal is convinced that, overall, only a huge funding injection will help, but doubts the political will exists to provide it. “No matter how much we talk \\[to the government\\], they don't understand anything”, he says, banging his desk for emphasis. “And I don't see them being willing to allocate a large amount of money.”\n\n【37】However, the venerable paediatrician is sure the Soviet system can be revived, if only reformers stop tinkering. “For a decade the World Bank has been paying out hundreds of millions of dollars to reform the health system, but it's just destroying it”, he says.\n\n【38】“Western specialists come here, they analyse the system, get money for it, they give recommendations, then they conduct seminars—more money—they live on this money for Russia, and then Russia has to pay for them.”\n\n【39】“If they had just given all that money we could have equipped every maternity hospital in the country, built some new labs, bought new ambulances. Instead that cash has just run into the sand.”\n\n【40】Article info\n------------\n\n【41】### Publication history\n\n【42】Published: 30 July 2005\n\n【43】### Identification\n\n【44】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67007-9\n\n【45】### Copyright\n\n【46】© 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Patients were enrolled at 25 sites in the USA, Canada, and Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1, and morphological disease in the bone marrow (>5% blasts). After leukapheresis and conditioning chemotherapy, patients received a single KTE-X19 infusion (1 × 10 <sup>6 </sup> CAR T cells per kg bodyweight). The primary endpoint was the rate of overall complete remission or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery by central assessment. Duration of remission and relapse-free survival, overall survival, minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate, and allo-SCT rate were assessed as secondary endpoints. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in the treated population (all patients who received a dose of KTE-X19). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02614066.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between Oct 1, 2018, and Oct 9, 2019, 71 patients were enrolled and underwent leukapheresis. KTE-X19 was successfully manufactured for 65 (92%) patients and administered to 55 (77%). The median age of treated patients was 40 years (IQR 28–52). At the median follow-up of 16·4 months (13·8–19·6), 39 patients (71%; 95% CI 57–82, p<0·0001) had complete remission or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery, with 31 (56%) patients reaching complete remission. Median duration of remission was 12·8 months (95% CI 8·7–not estimable), median relapse-free survival was 11·6 months (2·7–15·5), and median overall survival was 18·2 months (15·9–not estimable). Among responders, the median overall survival was not reached, and 38 (97%) patients had MRD negativity. Ten (18%) patients received allo-SCT consolidation after KTE-X19 infusion. The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were anaemia (27 \\[49%\\] patients) and pyrexia (20 \\[36%\\] patients). 14 (25%) patients had infections of grade 3 or higher. Two grade 5 KTE-X19-related events occurred (brain herniation and septic shock). Cytokine release syndrome of grade 3 or higher occurred in 13 (24%) patients and neurological events of grade 3 or higher occurred in 14 (25%) patients.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】KTE-X19 showed a high rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete haematological recovery in adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, with the median overall survival not reached in responding patients, and a manageable safety profile. These findings indicate that KTE-X19 has the potential to confer long-term clinical benefit to these patients.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】Kite, a Gilead Company.\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【17】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【18】### Subscribe:\n\n【19】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【20】Already a print subscriber?

{"seq_id": "23090f1c-cd16-4e40-a755-19ffaa9ad786", "title": "Dragonology", "text": "【0】Fairy tales teem with strange encounters and paradoxical creatures, but they are also prodigiously outlandish literary beasts themselves. What other genre could become a byword for gorgeous gossamer weightlessness, but also encompass the flinty paradoxes of Lewis Carroll and Angela Carter's tableaux of abjection, desire, and body horror? In _Science in Wonderland_ , her delightful first book, Melanie Keene adds yet another dimension, anatomising the Victorian taste for fairy tales in which science trumped magic as a source of wonder.\n\n【1】Scholars have been writing histories of science for a century and more, but studies of popular science are only about as old as the modern discipline of science communication. Over the past couple of decades historians such as Bernard Lightman and Charlotte Sleigh have begun to unpick the complex relationships between scientists, writers, and their various publics. In her research Keene—a historian of science at the University of Cambridge—uses games, toys, and songs, along with more traditional texts, to illuminate the encounters between Victorian children and a new kind of “familiar science”.\n\n【2】_Science in Wonderland_ is built around a small but intriguing set of stories that directly invoke fairy-tale tropes—dragons, fairies, talking animals, supernatural powers—and a longer shelf of books that use the more general techniques of imaginative fiction to bring science to life for younger readers. Keene writes against an argument common in scholarship and literature since the early 19th century: that _Grimms' Fairy Tales_ and other collections were edged out of Victorian nurseries by sternly didactic textbooks on botany, geology, and anatomy. She shows that although some writers may have hauled the stars down to earth for solemn study, many others continued to carry their readers into the heavens “on wings of imagination”.\n\n【3】One of the most popular paths into this scientific wonderland was the invisible life to be found in drops of water. Cheap achromatic microscopes gave middle-class children a chance to encounter the marvellous in something as quotidian as rainwater. In _Alice Down the Microscope_ , written by Cambridge biochemists, the heroine drinks too much “audit ale” at lunch in Trinity and tumbles down a lens barrel. She hears a microbe lecturing on “Housing Conditions in the Human Body” and is invited to dance the “Bacterial Charleston”, but after being charged with treason against the “Bacterial State” she suffers the grimmest torture a germ might imagine: “she was stained and counter-stained and decolourised”.\n\n【4】_Science in Wonderland_ is based loosely on Keene's PhD thesis, and it is greatly to her credit as a writer that this shows only in one or two passages of heavy-footed exposition. Her warm and lively prose conveys the sheer pleasure she finds in these texts—as a reader she must have a punitive tolerance for puns—but, like her subjects, she is not content merely to entertain. Her Victorians were not the first to engage in rational study of the natural world, but they did invent science, in the sense of a professionalised, specialised, and culturally potent discipline. At the heart of her argument are a series of connections between the themes of these stories and the broader challenges facing this new discipline. Nearly every writer she studies insisted that modern scientific fairy tales were imaginatively superior to their credulous medieval predecessors. This might be nothing more than the usual Victorian preoccupation with cultural progress, but the writers laboured this point so much that Keene can't help suspecting a touch of anxiety.\n\n【5】And anxiety was scarcely an inappropriate response to the revolutions—intellectual, political, economic, social—of the period. The extraordinary panoply of microscopic life took on a sinister aspect in an age of cholera, public health reform, and germ theory. For some writers, the bloodthirsty (or rather protoplasm-thirsty) character of life under the microscope could serve to naturalise a competitive and brutal social order. Hans Christian Andersen, in his story _A Drop of Water_ , discerned revolution in the “Bacterial State”: It looked like a great town reflected in there, in which all the people were running about without clothes. It was terrible!…Those at the top were being pulled down, and those at the bottom were struggling upwards.\n\n【6】Beyond these anxieties lay larger questions. How should we read the Book of Nature, and what lessons did it hold for humanity? What was the relation between history and myth? Most troublingly, was science itself a kind of fairy tale, albeit a uniquely powerful one? In seeking to combine theatrical delight with the demystification of a backstage tour, these writers were trying to pull off a difficult trick (and one familiar to any modern science communicator). What is so striking, even after a century or more, is how often they succeeded in turning the scientific present, rather than the mythical past, into fairyland.\n\n【7】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【8】Article info\n------------\n\n【9】### Publication history\n\n【10】Published: 06 June 2015\n\n【11】### Identification\n\n【12】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)61052-2\n\n【13】### Copyright\n\n【14】© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Earlier this year, the multicenter randomised NORSTENT elective percutaneous coronary intervention trial showed no significant differences between participants receiving drug-eluting stents and those receiving bare-metal stents in the composite outcome of death from any cause and non-fatal myocardial infarctions. The results of these two studies <sup>, </sup> clearly show that the stent revolution, which started in 1987, has come full circle ( appendix ). Over 30 years, several technologies or drugs have come and gone. The bare-metal stent technology has evolved into the drug-eluting stent technology that has produced a marked reduction in restenosis, at a cost of longer term dual antiplatelet therapy. Clinicians are trying to achieve the utopian 0% restenosis with more expensive technologies that present new problems such as thrombosis, neoatherosclerosis, stent recoil, and much stronger medications for longer durations. The ABSORB II and NORSTENT studies <sup>, </sup> challenge the typical trend of showing the new thing to be shinier and the old thing dustier than they really are. Clinicians should reflect and use cost-effective technologies that have stood the test of time before adopting newer technologies on a large scale. Researchers should consider whether the peak for this type of technology has already been reached, and whether the utopian goal of 0% restenosis with a disappearing stent that proves less safe than other available technology is still worth pursuing.\n\n【1】We declare no competing interests.\n\n【2】Supplementary Material\n----------------------\n\n【3】*   Download .pdf (.26 MB)\n    \n    Help with pdf files\n    \n    Supplementary appendix", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

In a country such as India, where HIV infection is relatively low, 20% of patients with smear-positive tuberculosis can also have diabetes. Therefore, screening of tuberculosis patients for the presence of diabetes, and vice versa, will have implications for control and treatment of both diseases in developing countries.\n\n【2】In terms of treatment, diabetes and tuberculosis also interact. Rifampicin increases metabolism of most oral antidiabetic drugs, complicating glycaemic control during tuberculosis treatment. Conversely, diabetes can also have a negative effect on tuberculosis treatment. Among 737 Indonesian patients with tuberculosis, diabetes (diagnosed in 14·8%), was associated with positive sputum cultures after 6 months' treatment, which was not accounted for by disease severity, adherence, or drug-resistance (adjusted odds ratio 7·65, 95% CI 1·89–30·95; p=0·004). In the same setting, the bioavailability of rifampicin was 50% lower among patients with diabetes than among those without diabetes. More profound hyperglycaemia correlated negatively with rifampicin bioavailability.

Margaret Harris Cheng reports.\n\n【1】To the surprise and delight of tobacco-control campaigners, a plan to operationalise the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was passed with barely a murmur of dissent at the WHO's Western Pacific regional meeting held in Hong Kong last month.\n\n【2】Although representatives of three of the world's biggest tobacco producers—China, the USA, and Japan—were present when the plan came up for discussion, only China voiced any misgivings about the plan. “The action plan should offer guidance—it should not be a mandatory requirement for member states”, China's representative told the meeting.\n\n【3】The ease with which the plan was accepted was a surprise because it is considered a radical departure from its predecessors (this is the fifth such plan for the WHO's Western Pacific region). For the first time, the plan sets out objectives for member states and a timeframe (2010–14) in which those objectives should ideally be reached. All member states are expected to attend a progress review in 2012, and be ready and willing to explain what stage they are at with tobacco control and why they have, or have not, achieved their objectives.\n\n【4】It was this, the setting of very specific objectives, that made China somewhat uncomfortable. But the USA (which attends such meetings on behalf of its Pacific territories and protectorates) and Japan fully endorsed the plan. “Japan has been strengthening tobacco control based on the national health promotion policy…but the male rate is still higher in Japan compared to other countries”, said Japan's representative.\n\n【5】The Americans simply stated support for tobacco control without commenting on specific problems in their Pacific territories. Their representative Mark Abdoo said, “the US is committed to tracking morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco use. We also remain dedicated to preventing death and disease from tobacco use. The tobacco surveillance system is evidence of our commitment”.\n\n【6】Although the ease with which the plan was accepted surprised observers, all agreed that the region has been ahead of the rest of the world in terms of accepting the need for controlling tobacco use. The Western Pacific region was the first, and so far, only WHO region to get all member states to ratify the FCTC—something achieved in 2006.\n\n【7】“WPRO \\[the Western Pacific region\\] has been ahead of the race for a very long time but this \\[plan\\] is a step further because it has all sorts of measurables, deliverables. We've really pushed the envelope out—it's very, very specific. And by 2014 those things will be evaluated”, said Judith Longstaff Mackay, senior adviser to the World Lung Foundation and a member of the Hong Kong delegation to the meeting. “Recognising that this \\[the FCTC\\] is on wheels now, this is what all the neighbours are doing. It's united us all, really stiffened the backbone of many countries”, said Mackay.\n\n【8】What the plan does not do, though, is offer any sanctions for states that pay little more than lip service to tobacco control.\n\n【9】While agreeing that the plan was “more carrot than stick”, Susan Mercado, Western Pacific regional adviser for the WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative, pointed out that the significance of the plan was that it was the first to introduce ways to measure real progress in tobacco control. “This is the first time the region has come up with regional targets and indicators…we are moving forward in terms of accountability, measuring progress, and identifying gaps in capability…Some people won't be comfortable with it, but if people are comfortable with tobacco control, it's not working.”\n\n【10】The plan is ambitious, setting targets like achievement of clear guidance on how to avoid conflicts of interest with the tobacco industry in 100% of countries. These targets are likely to be difficult to meet for a member state like China where the trade and agriculture ministries are responsible for tobacco growth and production and there is strong political pressure to maintain the status quo to avoid loss of livelihoods and social chaos.\n\n【11】However, Douglas Bettcher, director of the Tobacco Free Initiative, said Thailand, which also has a state tobacco monopoly, had achieved this very thing by “creating a firewall between the policy makers for tobacco control and the state tobacco monopoly…it really represents the gold standard, how best to operate. Thailand's a government we'd like to see other governments following.”\n\n【12】Some nations in WHO's Western Pacific region have already banned indoor smoking\n\n【13】*   View Large Image\n\n【14】Copyright © 2009 Getty Images\n\n【15】China has the world's largest state-owned tobacco industry and number of smokers\n\n【16】*   View Large Image\n\n【17】Copyright © 2009 Getty Images\n\n【18】A package of policies developed by the WHO in 2008 and given the acronym MPOWER (Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies; Protect people from tobacco smoke; Offer help to stop tobacco use; Warn about the dangers of tobacco; Enforce bans on tobacco advertising; Raise taxes on tobacco) is underpinning the new action plan.\n\n【19】Member states are expected to develop legislation and policy for protection from second-hand smoke that “are compliant with the definition of 100% indoor smoke-free settings (eg, workplaces, public transport, indoor public places)”, regulate tobacco product labelling in compliance with the FCTC (using pictorial warnings), and put comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising in place.\n\n【20】By 2014, all countries in the WPRO region are expected to “have developed action plans, or equivalents, and established or strengthened national coordinating mechanisms, as appropriate”, ratified all FCTC protocols, and gathered reliable data about tobacco use in adults and young people.\n\n【21】Some Western Pacific nations are already leading the way in terms of data gathering. Member states with advanced economies and health systems like Hong Kong and Singapore have been tracking their smoking prevalence rates for decades and both can now point to substantial reductions in prevalence.\n\n【22】Hong Kong, which has implemented most of the policies outlined in the MPOWER package already, can point to an impressive drop in prevalence since the early 1990s. In 1992, Hong Kong had a 23% prevalence of tobacco use but by 2005 this had dropped to 14% and has fallen further to 12% in 2008. During that time, Hong Kong progressively banned tobacco advertising, sports sponsorship by cigarette companies (in the late 1990s), smoking in the workplace, then in public spaces like shopping malls and parks and, most recently, in clubs and bars. Some bars and parts of clubs still have permits for smoking areas but indoor tobacco smoke has all but disappeared in Hong Kong. “This shows that tobacco control is not the prerogative of western countries and that Asian countries can implement effective tobacco control… We now know what works”, said Mackay.\n\n【23】Although Hong Kong has been part of China since 1997 when it was handed over by Britain, the territory has very different tobacco laws and practices from the rest of China. China has the largest state-owned tobacco industry and also the greatest number of smokers—an estimated 350 million—in the world. Each year, about 1 million people from mainland China die of tobacco-related illness.\n\n【24】The vast number of Chinese smokers makes the Western Pacific, despite its early ratification of the FCTC, the region with the world's heaviest burden of tobacco-related illness. One in three of the world's smokers lives in the Western Pacific region. It has the greatest number of smokers, the highest rates of male smoking prevalence, and the fastest increase in tobacco use by women and young people compared with the other five WHO regions.\n\n【25】Although China is the main contributor to the absolute numbers, some of the world's highest rates are found in the tiny Pacific islands where tobacco use has become culturally ingrained. Chewing tobacco with the areca nut is common in the Pacific and is linked to a high incidence of, and excessively high mortality rates from, oral cancer. Worldwide, oral cancer has a 50% mortality rate, but some countries in the Western Pacific region have oral cancer mortality rates that are between 67% and 80%.\n\n【26】Revite Kerition, acting director of public health for Kiribati, a tiny coral island state more often associated with the struggle to survive the effects of global warming, told the meeting “tobacco is a major problem for us. 75% of men who responded to a survey were current smokers and 50% of women responders were current smokers.\n\n【27】“Tobacco use has gained great significance in our society. If any of you visit a village you are expected to bring a gift of tobacco to the old men of the village—also as a gift to the gods.\n\n【28】“The Government of Kiribati has been very careful about how it approaches the tobacco bill. Our minister of health is fighting a battle against our local gods and the highly influential old men. I'm sure you'll agree, fighting the gods is not an easy battle.”\n\n【29】Tuvalu has a serious problem as well. A recent survey done there showed that tobacco is used widely, with 33% of young people saying that they use tobacco regularly.\n\n【30】Political change has blocked tobacco control in other nations. “The tobacco control bill has been finalised—it wasn't passed in 2007 because I was voted out”, the Solomon Islands' health minister, Clay Forau Soalaoi told the meeting.\n\n【31】Article info\n------------\n\n【32】### Publication history\n\n【33】Published: 10 October 2009\n\n【34】### Identification\n\n【35】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61769-4\n\n【36】### Copyright\n\n【37】© 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Field and colleagues report the results of the UKLS trial \\[ \\]—the last of the European lung cancer CT screening trials to report outcomes. The purpose of this randomized study with a LDCT (low-dose computed tomography) arm and a control arm (usual care) was to demonstrate the usefulness of lung cancer screening among high-risk population (determined by the LLPv2 score). They found that this single-screen program results in a non-significant impact on lung cancer mortality (RR 0.65 \\[95% CI 0.41-1.02\\]). Some would consider these results as an additional argument against lung cancer screening. However, we should interpret them by looking beyond their negative components.\n\n【3】The trial was unfortunately underpowered for its main outcome—lung cancer mortality—since it was prematurely stopped at its pilot step. Thus, only 3,968 participants on the 16,000 planned were included in this analysis. Similarly, many other trials on lung cancer screening were also not powered enough to evaluate mortality outcome ( Fig. 1 ). This is why the meta-analysis approach – added in this paper - is particularly interesting, to put these results into perspective. Taking together, all these trials (except DEPISCAN which did not publish mortality data) showed an improvement in lung cancer mortality (0.84 \\[0.76-0.92\\]) as well as in overall mortality (0.97 \\[0.94-1.00\\]).\n\n【4】Fig. 1 Randomized controlled trials on lung cancer screening: design, eligibility and results.

First, while it is a single-screening strategy, the UKLS trial suggests an extended benefit, regarding lung cancer mortality, when performing a long-term follow-up (median 7.2 years). Although this strategy is not the recommended one in Europe \\[ \\], it could provide some interesting data for designing future screening programs. It also underlines the “power” of screening in this very-high risk population. Indeed, according to the existing trials, we know that new screen-detected lung cancers are discovered at each screening round. The COSMOS cohort demonstrated this phenomenon, with new lung cancers found each year between the baseline (N=12) and the 10 <sup>th </sup> year (N=5) \\[ \\]. Therefore, lung cancer screening was mainly assessed with several round in randomized trials (see Fig. 1 ). No consensus exists, yet, for the optimal screening interval but it is clearly between one and two years. Indeed, we know from the optional 4 <sup>th </sup> round of the NELSON trial that overpassing two years leads to a shift toward later stages of lung cancer \\[ \\]. By contrast, the MILD trial showed us that biennial screening are acceptable as compared to an annual strategy \\[ \\]. Finally, post-hoc analysis from the NLST trial found that interval should be individually adapted depending on personal medical history of chronic bronchitis or presence of emphysema at CT \\[ \\].\n\n【7】The UKLS trial is the first randomized trial with inclusion criteria based on a risk-score: the LLPv2 score. Optimized screening outcomes by enriching the population with high-risk individuals, is a key point \\[ \\]. Several scores are available but only two were prospectively tested: PLCO <sub>m2012 </sub> \\[ \\] and LLPv2. Currently, we do not know if this approach using score leads to a better mortality outcome, since no trials, comparing, using score versus not, have been done. However, we do know that using score results in a highest proportion of eligible individuals with a screen-detected lung cancer \\[ \\]; in a decrease of the number needed to screen to avoid one death \\[ \\]; and, in a highest proportion of early stage screen-detected lung cancer \\[ \\]. By contrast, the use of score to assess eligibility may be problematic in the overall-population, particularly among individuals with the lowest socio-economic status. Indeed, self-assessing eligibility to screening of breast or colon cancer is less challenging because it depends only of age (and gender). Despite this simple process, participation rates are sometimes lower than expected, especially in population with lower socio-economic status. However, those individuals have a higher risk of cancer, and namely of lung cancer \\[ \\]. The use of NELSON eligibility criteria might be difficult in an overall population, because it necessitates some basic knowledge in mathematic (to conceptualize a mean or to calculate a duration). Using a score represents also some difficulties, as it requires reaching an internet page, and fulfilling a questionnaire. All these steps represent obstacles for many individuals, and particularly for the ones with the lowest socio-economic status.\n\n【8】Bypassing socio-economic barriers is a big challenge. There are many ways to do this. In another UK program, investigators have assessed the impact of using mobile CT-scan. While using the PLCOm2012 score as entry criteria, a very high proportion of participants were from lowest deprivation quintiles \\[ \\]. This result highlights that dedicated programs, such as those including mobile CT, are a way to lift inequalities in screening, to overtake difficulties related to complex entry criteria and, thus, to optimize individuals selection and finally improve screening outcomes.\n\n【9】Author contributions\n--------------------\n\n【10】EG, JD, MD and SC all contributed to literature search and writing.\n\n【11】Declaration of Interests\n------------------------\n\n【12】All authors declare no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

To understand why, it is helpful to know how the 5-year survival statistic is calculated: the number of patients diagnosed with cancer still alive 5 years after diagnosis divided by the number of all patients diagnosed with cancer. The key term to notice in the calculation is diagnosed, which appears in the numerator and denominator of the survival statistic. By definition, screening detects cancer at a microscopic state, long before it causes symptoms. Because of this property, screening inflates the survival statistic in two ways: firstly, by prolonging the period in which a patient is known to have cancer (lead-time bias), and secondly, by including people with non-progressive cancer (overdiagnosis bias). However, for the 20 most common solid tumours in the USA, the inflation in 5-year survival rates has no correlation with a decrease in mortality rates —a fact unknown to most medical professionals offering screening. Because of lead-time and overdiagnosis bias, differences in 5-year survival rates between health systems differing in screening uptake can rather be an artifact of the extent of screening than a valid proof of improved cancer control. Such a proof can only come from a reduction of cancer-specific mortality rates, the denominator of which includes all (not just diagnosed) people in the investigated screening and non-screening groups, resulting in the rates not being dependent on country-specific diagnostic procedures.\n\n【2】*   View Large Image\n\n【3】Copyright © 2015 Thomas Fredberg/Science Photo Library\n\n【4】**This online publication has been corrected.

The CPI <sub>40 </sub> , main pulmonary artery diameter to ascending aorta diameter ratio (MPAD/AAD), and an extent of fibrosis threshold of 20% were combined to form a staging algorithm. When assessed in the validation cohort (n=252), this staging system was strikingly more predictive of mortality than any individual variable alone (HR 5·89, 2·68–10·08, p<0·0001). The staging system was successfully applied to the test and validation cohorts combined, by two radiologists and two physicians.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】A clear prognostic separation of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis is provided by a simple staging system integrating the CPI and two HRCT variables.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】National Institute of Health Research Respiratory Disease Biomedical Unit at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust and Imperial College London.\n\n【11】Introduction\n------------\n\n【12】For most patients, pulmonary sarcoidosis is a somewhat benign and self-limiting disorder. Clinically occult disease and spontaneous remission occur in the majority of patients. <sup>, </sup> However, for some, pulmonary sarcoidosis can be a chronic and debilitating disease associated with significant mortality. <sup>, </sup> Although several studies have reported on factors that might predict prognosis in pulmonary sarcoidosis such as reduced forced vital capacity, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and the radiographic presence of pulmonary fibrosis, attempts to devise a reliable prognostic algorithm for pulmonary sarcoidosis have been largely unsuccessful, <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> and this has impeded the development of consensus management and treatment recommendations. A major barrier to this specific research effort is that mortality due to pulmonary sarcoidosis in unselected populations is too low for the empowerment of survival analyses. Referral centre populations have a higher than expected mortality than that in unselected populations of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. <sup>, </sup> Therefore, referral centres provide an enriched population ideal for deriving prognostic methods, using mortality as an appropriate primary endpoint.\n\n【13】Pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension are two important causes of death in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a substantial issue regardless of whether there is fibrosis —more than 70% of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis awaiting lung transplantation have substantial pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is present in almost half of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis with dyspnoea (out of proportion to their pulmonary function abnormalities).\n\n【14】In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Wells and colleagues devised the composite physiological index (CPI), which is a weighted index of pulmonary function variables that correlates with extent of interstitial disease on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). CPI was a stronger predictor of mortality than any individual lung function variable. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a frequent complication in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and an important cause of mortality in these patients. The prognostic strength of the CPI in the setting of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis might be explained by its incorporation of diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), which might confer increased sensitivity to concurrent pulmonary arterial hypertension, while at the same time capturing the prognostic effect of interstitial disease. Following from this finding, the CPI could be postulated to also be useful in pulmonary sarcoidosis for the identification of patients with a poor prognosis.\n\n【15】The CPI has not been studied in sarcoidosis, thus the aim of our study was to assess the prognostic strength of the CPI in a large cohort of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Additionally, we explored whether the CPI and HRCT variables could be integrated to form a clinical staging system for identifying patients at high and low risk of mortality.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Patients and study design\n\n【18】In this case-cohort study, we clinically defined and did all pulmonary function tests and HRCTs in accordance with local protocols. For the purposes of a retrospective examination of these data, the institutional ethics review board waived informed patient consent.\n\n【19】We identified consecutive outpatients referred to the Sarcoidosis clinic at the Royal Brompton Hospital. We only included patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis, synthesised from clinical, radiological, and pathological data and an HRCT within 90 days of baseline pulmonary function tests in the study population. Exclusion criteria were: diagnosis not confirmed at multidisciplinary review; no HRCT available within 90 days of baseline pulmonary function tests; and no HRCT or pulmonary function test evidence of pulmonary involvement. To exclude patients for whom a diagnosis of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis might have been possible, all patients with HRCT features compatible with pulmonary sarcoidosis and a lymphocytosis on bronchoalveolar lavage were required to meet at least one of the other two criteria to be included in the study ( appendix ). In patients for whom none of these criteria were available, the HRCT imaging was reviewed by a thoracic radiologist of 25 years' experience in the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases.\n\n【20】### Procedures\n\n【21】We documented age, sex, smoking status, treatment at the time of baseline pulmonary function tests, follow-up time, baseline pulmonary function tests, and presence of extrapulmonary symptoms. We recorded smoking status as “current smoker”, “ever smoker”, and “never smoker”. “Ever smokers” had smoked more than one cigarette a day for more than 1 year. Treatment was recorded at the time of baseline pulmonary function testing and at 4 months follow-up (to capture patients for whom treatment was not instigated at first visit, but was begun soon after their first consultation) and consisted of one or a combination of corticosteroid (prednisolone) and immunosuppressant therapy (hydroxychloroquine, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine and methotrexate). These data provided two separate groups for analysis based on the management strategy chosen—those who underwent observation only (intention to observe) and those who received treatment (intention to treat).\n\n【22】We measured the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) and DLCO according to established protocols. The CPI, originally derived in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is a weighted index of pulmonary function that captures physiological impairment due to interstitial disease but excludes impairment due to emphysema. We calculated this index with the following formula: 91·0 – (0·65×percent predicted DLCO) – (0·53×percent predicted FVC) + (0·34×percent predicted FEV <sub>1 </sub> ) for every patient.\n\n【23】The appendix shows a detailed discussion of HRCT scoring methods. In brief, all images were anonymised and two thoracic radiologists (DMH with 24 years' experience and NS with 11 years' experience) reviewed them independently. The entire lungs were assessed for the presence and extent of fibrosis (defined as criss-crossing linear opacities \\[reticulation\\] with or without honeycombing \\[air-filled cystic spaces with irregular walls deemed not to be distracted airways\\]), ground glass opacification, and other (defined as patterns of disease not covered by fibrosis or ground glass opacification). Observers also assessed the presence or absence of traction bronchiectasis and the presence or absence of emphysema. A single observer (SLFW with 8 years' experience) assessed the main pulmonary artery diameter (MPAD) and ascending aorta diameter (AAD) ratio in all 503 patients ( appendix ).\n\n【24】### Outcome\n\n【25】The primary outcome was mortality. We calculated the survival period starting from the date of the baseline pulmonary function tests to the date of death, or in the case of survivors the last known point of contact. Vital status was known for all patients at the end of the study period.\n\n【26】### Statistical analysis\n\n【27】Data are given as means (SD), medians (range) or as proportions stated as percentages where appropriate. We did the statistical analyses using STATA (version 12, StataCorp, College Station, Texas). We made group comparisons using the Student's _t_ test, Wilcoxon rank sum, χ <sup>2 </sup> statistics, and Fisher's exact test where appropriate. We used the single determination standard deviation to assess interobserver agreement for continuous variables. We assessed interobserver agreement for the presence or absence of traction bronchiectasis and emphysema using the weighted kappa coefficient (κ <sub>w </sub> ) as follows: poor (κ <sub>w </sub> \\=0–0·20), fair (κ <sub>w </sub> \\=0·21–0·40), moderate (κ <sub>w </sub> \\=0·41–0·60), good (κ <sub>w </sub> \\=0·61–0·80), and excellent (κ <sub>w </sub> \\=0·81–1·00).\n\n【28】The appendix shows a detailed discussion of statistical methods used to derive the staging system. In brief, we randomly split the total patient cohort into two groups—A (test cohort) and B (validation cohort). We assessed potential predictors of mortality, including HRCT patterns and the CPI, in group A. We obtained optimum thresholds, derived against mortality, for the strongest predictors and combined them to form a simple staging system. We externally validated the staging system in group B. Finally, four test observers (two radiologists and two respiratory physicians) assessed the staging system in groups A and B combined to test the models clinical applicability.\n\n【29】### Role of the funding source\n\n【30】The sponsors of the study did not have any role in the design, data collection, analysis and interpretation, nor in the writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all of the data and the final responsibility to submit for publication.\n\n【31】Results\n-------\n\n【32】We identified 660 consecutive outpatients referred to the Sarcoidosis clinic at the Royal Brompton Hospital between Jan 1, 2000, and June 30, 2010. 59 patients were excluded because the diagnosis was not confirmed at multidisciplinary review, 89 because of no HRCT available within 90 days of baseline pulmonary function tests, and nine because of no HRCT or pulmonary function test evidence of pulmonary involvement. The remaining 503 patients made up the final study population. Of these, 302 had a biopsy confirmation of the presence of non-necrotising granulomas with no alternative causes of granulomatous inflammation (177 with transbronchial and endobronchial biopsy, 12 with surgical lung biopsy, 89 with peripheral lymph node biopsy, 20 with skin biopsy, and four with liver biopsy). All but three of the remaining 201 patients without biopsy confirmation had a clinical presentation consistent with pulmonary sarcoidosis, an HRCT, which was compatible with pulmonary sarcoidosis, and met at least one of the following criteria: lymphocytosis (>15%) on bronchoalveolar lavage (n=45), elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) level (n=157), demonstrable extrapulmonary features consistent with systemic sarcoidosis (n=57). In the three patients for whom none of these criteria were available, the HRCT appearances were deemed typical.\n\n【33】Table 1 shows patient demographics with group comparisons for group A and group B. Frequencies of extrapulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis, when present, are shown in the appendix . Mean follow-up time was 50·1 (SD 30·6) months (range 0·5–122·1, median 49·8, 95% CI 38·8–58·3). Patients excluded from the final study population on the basis of no HRCT being available (n=89) did not differ significantly from the study population in terms of pulmonary function, follow-up time, or survival. The appendix shows comparisons between survivors and non-survivors. Four patients were being considered for lung transplantation at the end of the follow-up period. One patient died during the study while on a transplant list and another was on a transplant list at the end of the follow-up period.

We only did a threshold analysis after all continuous variables had been fully explored. We identified an optimum CPI threshold of 40 units in group A (HR 4·24, p<0·0001, 95% CI 2·84–6·33, _c_ \\-statistic=0·72, bootstrap corrected 95% CI 0·69–0·82; appendix ).\n\n【47】We then did a multivariate analysis of HRCT patterns in these two subgroups (ie, CPI≤40 and CPI>40) to see whether HRCT data could be used to improve the prognostic separation provided by the CPI <sub>40 </sub> . Again, we used a bootstrap procedure to internally validate model selection (ie, drawing 1000 random samples with replacement and selecting the model most frequently obtained among the 1000 samples).\n\n【48】First, in patients with CPI higher than 40, no HRCT variable was predictive of mortality. Therefore, a CPI>40 was taken as indicative of a poor prognosis for staging purposes ( figure 1 ). Second, in patients with CPI equal or lower than 40, the MPAD/AAD category and extent of fibrosis were strongly predictive of mortality on univariate analysis (HR 2·27, 95% CI 1·57–8·96, p<0·0001 for the MPAD/AAD category; HR 1·05, 1·02–1·08, p<0·0001 for extent of fibrosis). These variables were retained in 78·9% of the samples. We identified an optimum threshold of 20% for extent of fibrosis in this group using the same methods of identification and discrimination used in the primary threshold analysis (HR 3·43, 1·94–6·06, p<0·0001, c-index 0·63, bootstrap corrected 95% CI 0·57–0·72). In this patient group, an adverse prognosis was assigned on the basis of MPAD/AAD category of 1 or higher (ie, MPAD>AAD), or extent of fibrosis on HRCT higher than 20% ( figure 1 ).\n\n【49】Figure 1 Clinical staging algorithm for stratification of clinical risk in pulmonary sarcoidosis\n\n【50】Show full caption\n\n【51】CPI=composite physiological index.

The staging system was derived and rigorously tested in a large cohort of patients with confirmed pulmonary sarcoidosis before being externally validated in a new patient population. Additionally, two radiologists and two respiratory physicians subsequently verified the clinical applicability of the staging system by applying it to the combined cohorts. Further, we have shown that the staging system retained its prognostic strength in patient subgroups including: treated and untreated patients, smokers and non-smokers, patients with and without HRCT evidence of emphysema, and patients with and without histological confirmation of the diagnosis of sarcoidosis ( panel ).\n\n【69】Panel\n\n【70】**Research in context**\n\n【71】**Systematic review**\n\n【72】We did a PubMed search on Oct 1, 2013, using the search terms “pulmonary sarcoidosis and prognosis” for the period between Jan 1, 1990, and Oct 1, 2013. Our search was restricted to publications that were written in English. We identified 12 key publications <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> that were pertinent to our study. All of these studies investigated different methods for predicting prognosis in pulmonary sarcoidosis and their efficacy. Additionally, several reported on the prevalence and prognostic significance of pulmonary arterial hypertension in the setting of pulmonary sarcoidosis. We could not find any study that reported on staging of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis with integrated clinical and radiological data.\n\n【73】**Interpretation**\n\n【74】Attempts to devise a reliable prognostic method for sarcoidosis, until now, have been largely unsuccessful and this has represented a substantial obstacle to the development of consensus management and treatment recommendations for this disease. Our study describes an easily applied and powerful staging system that identifies patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis who are at high clinical risk. This staging system was constructed with the composite physiological index and two HRCT variables in a large cohort of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Two radiologists and two respiratory physicians found the system easy to use. Although this staging system was derived in a tertiary referral centre population of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, it was constructed with tests that are routinely done in most patients and can therefore, in principle, be applied to patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis in less selected populations. Ideally, this staging system should undergo further assessment in patients with less severe disease or at other less specialised centres.\n\n【75】Our sarcoidosis clinic is a regional and national referral centre for patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. A unifying feature of our population is that patients referred to our centre are not straightforward—either the referrer perceives a difficulty managing the disease, or the patient has had a significant loss of quality of life despite standard therapies. Additionally, because of increased patient involvement in management decisions, in some cases, the referral is driven by the patient. For this reason it is difficult to standardise and document the referral criteria. Recent prognostic assessment in pulmonary sarcoidosis has been largely confined to transplantation populations, which are inherently biased towards endstage disease. <sup>, </sup> In unselected patients with sarcoidosis, mortality is arguably too low for survival analyses to be powered. By contrast, the higher mortality expected in referral centre populations, allows the derivation and testing of a prognostic algorithm that is anchored to survival, as in the present study. Our findings apply to the important subset of patients in whom pulmonary disease is more severe and often difficult to manage; in these patients, assessment of prognosis is especially valuable. The development of a staging system against mortality in a more general population with sarcoidosis with prolonged follow-up, although ideal in principle, is likely to be an unrealistic goal, requiring the recruitment of a huge population of patients with sarcoidosis outside of referral centres. Importantly, our prognostic algorithm was constructed from tests that are appropriate in the investigation of pulmonary involvement in general and can, thus, be readily applied to patients with overt pulmonary sarcoidosis in less selected populations.\n\n【76】Outcome in pulmonary sarcoidosis is largely influenced by two separate pathological processes—interstitial fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The latter is increasingly being recognised as relatively frequent in sarcoidosis. <sup>, </sup> In unselected cohorts about 5–6% of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis have pulmonary arterial hypertension at rest <sup>, </sup> and as many as 43% of patients with normal resting pulmonary artery pressures develop pulmonary arterial hypertension during exercise. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> Moreover, pulmonary arterial hypertension is found in up to 47% of patients with sarcoidosis with dyspnoea out of proportion to their pulmonary function deficit. Importantly, pulmonary arterial hypertension is not confined to those with advanced fibrotic disease—about half of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension have no radiographic evidence of fibrosis. <sup>, </sup> In some cases of pulmonary hypertension, increases in the capillary blood pool might result in a normal or elevated DLCO. However, as pulmonary hypertension in patients with sarcoidosis is, in most cases, a precapillary phenomenon, engorgement of the pulmonary microvasculature does not usually occur, making elevations of the DLCO unlikely. As an example, it is known that in patients with systemic sclerosis related pulmonary hypertension (which is also a precapillary phenomenon), pulmonary capillary blood volume does not increase and consequently no increase in DLCO is noted. As the CPI incorporates pulmonary function indices that capture the physiological effect of vasculopathy (DLCO) as well as those that reflect restrictive interstitial physiology (FEV <sub>1 </sub> and FVC), we formed an a priori hypothesis that the CPI would be a strong predictor of outcome in these patients. This hypothesis was tested and validated and reinforced by two findings. First, a composite of lung function derived against mortality and the CPI were collinear and, second, the CPI remained a strong predictor of mortality in various patient subgroups.\n\n【77】In view of the importance of pulmonary arterial hypertension in determining mortality in sarcoidosis, the vascular measurement used in our study warrants examination. CT signs of pulmonary arterial hypertension have been investigated extensively in the setting of various diffuse lung diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> but less is known about the accuracy of these signs in pulmonary sarcoidosis. The ratio of MPAD/AAD has been shown to predict pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with interstitial lung disease more reliably than the MPAD alone. This finding has been extended to include patients with fibrotic lung disease. In our study, the MPAD/AAD category was predictive of mortality independently of all other HRCT patterns, suggesting that in sarcoidosis, the MPAD/AAD ratio might capture the prognostic effect of an underlying vasculopathy. Furthermore, visual estimates of the MPAD/AAD ratio correlate closely with electronic calliper measurements enhancing the clinical use of this finding. Although it might be, that other investigations could be included in the staging system, such as echocardiography or right heart catheterisation, a central aim of this model was to provide clinicians with a prognostic method that can be applied easily to most patients; only a few patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis undergo right heart catheterisation.\n\n【78】Management decisions in diffuse lung disease are often dichotomous, such as the decision to treat when disease is likely to be responsive versus the decision not to treat in inexorably progressive disease. Clinicoradiological and physiological scores and multivariate systems previously described in other diffuse lung diseases <sup>, </sup> are usually continuous and for this reason might not be easily applied to these decisions. This provides the rationale for staging patients by classifying them into one of two prognostically distinct groups and is an approach already used in the setting of systemic sclerosis related interstitial lung disease. By integrating the CPI with CT data, we have devised a staging system, which captured the most deaths when tested prospectively in a large cohort of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. To our knowledge, no other prognostic index in pulmonary sarcoidosis provides such a sharp separation of patients into groups with a low and high risk of mortality respectively.\n\n【79】The effectiveness of HRCT lies in its ability to capture patients initially classified as having a good prognosis using the CPI <sub>40 </sub> threshold, and reclassifying them based on either a large main pulmonary artery (vascular disease), or presence of fibrosis (interstitial disease). It is conceivable that the CPI might be a less sensitive predictor of mortality in patients with a low DLCO (due to pulmonary arterial hypertension) but quite preserved spirometry, which explains why some patients with a poor prognosis have a low CPI. This notion highlights the important complimentary role of HRCT in the assessment of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.\n\n【80】Our study used a relatively simple approach to HRCT pattern evaluation. The choice of patterns was based on three criteria: (1) the pattern had to be frequently present and extensive enough to identify with confidence, (2) the pattern had to be readily recognisable for both non-experts and experts, and (3) the pattern had to be a plausible prognostic determinant. The prognostic effect of so-called difficult to assess patterns, is unlikely to be useful in clinical practice. For these reasons, the readily recognised patterns of ground glass opacification and fibrosis, as well as traction bronchiectasis were selected. The relatively high levels of interobserver agreement seen in the current study for these patterns vindicated these choices. It should be pointed out, that a characteristic feature of pulmonary sarcoidosis is that its HRCT presentation is very variable making it difficult to standardise its quantification on HRCT.\n\n【81】Patient treatment was documented at baseline and at 4 months' follow-up and therapeutic status was analysed according to whether or not treatment was deemed warranted at presentation. This coarse distinction was necessary as the choice, timing, and duration of treatment varied widely during follow-up, and could not realistically be accounted for in the analysis. We therefore provided separate statements for two patient subgroups: intention to treat (when treatment was introduced or continued at presentation) and intention to observe, an approach, also used in the development of prognostic staging systems in the setting of systemic sclerosis. In this analysis, the staging system provided equal prognostic information regardless of whether patients were treated or observed ( table 4 ).\n\n【82】Not all cases included in the study had confirmation of diagnosis by biopsy. When patients are involved in decisions on whether to biopsy, or where pulmonary impairment is too severe, the number of cases with a histological confirmation of diagnosis will necessarily be less. Furthermore, it has been argued that there is no diagnostic gold standard in sarcoidosis. The diagnosis is often made after assimilation of all data available and possible alternatives have been excluded. A strength of our study is the rigorous approach taken to patient selection when confirmation by biopsy was not available. At the outset, cases with or without a confirmed diagnosis by biopsy presented with clinical and HRCT features compatible with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Those without confirmation by biopsy were required to meet at least one more diagnostic criterion. Additionally, steps were taken to eliminate possible contamination of the population with cases of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis by ensuring that those with a lymphocytosis on bronchoalveolar lavage also met one of the other diagnostic criteria. We noted no survival difference between patients with confirmation by biopsy of their diagnosis and those for whom the diagnosis was based on the diagnostic criteria described above.\n\n【83】We used an all-cause mortality endpoint rather than attempting to analyse only patients who died directly as a result of their primary pulmonary disease. Just as intention to treat is considered the gold standard study design in treatment trials, we used the intention to prognosticate approach in the present study to maintain clinical applicability. When a staging system is applied in clinical practice, it is never known whether an individual patient might eventually die from an unrelated cause. Thus, the utility of a prognostic system in separating survivors from non-survivors must be tested against all-cause mortality. This approach has also been recommended in the setting of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis for which all-cause mortality is regarded the most easily interpreted mortality-related endpoint in phase 3 clinical trials. Furthermore, there are inherent difficulties separating respiratory and non-respiratory deaths. A cardiac event for example, might ultimately result in death, but might be triggered by hypoxia caused by pulmonary disease. Lastly, our study was retrospective in design and drew its study population from one centre. Although we used a split sample method to validate the system, ideally it should be tested in a separate large cohort of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, garnered from another centre.\n\n【84】In conclusion, by integrating the CPI with HRCT measures of the pulmonary vasculature and interstitial disease, we propose an easily applied staging system that identifies patients at high clinical risk. This system has been rigorously assessed using internal and external validation and subsequent testing for clinical applicability by two radiologists and two physicians. In principle, this model might be used by the clinician as a simple but powerful prognostic method for risk stratification of patients in routine clinical practice and the enrolment of patients in clinical trials.\n\n【85】**Contributors**\n\n【86】SLFW contributed to the study design, data collection and review, and statistical analysis, and was responsible for writing, editing, and revising the report.

They start, however, from the incorrect premise that “a systematic review has shown that epidural anaesthesia reduced mortality after major surgery”. In fact, the meta-analysis by Rodgers and colleagues did not demonstrate this, but showed decreased mortality associated with central neuraxial block in general. It is of course the very heterogeneity of the trials included in this meta-analysis that casts doubt over the validity of its conclusions, and necessitated the cohort study by Wijeysundera and colleagues.\n\n【1】This group is to be congratulated on showing the benefits of epidural anaesthesia, analgesia, or both on 30-day mortality. However, this study also suffers from heterogeneity: the investigators were unable to distinguish between patients who received epidural anaesthesia or analgesia, or both. The benefits of postoperative epidural analgesia might be expected to exceed those of a single-shot technique: it is thus possible that the effect on mortality would be greater if the study could have been confined to patients who benefited from postoperative analgesia, and thus that the number needed to treat for postoperative epidural analgesia might be lower.\n\n【2】We declare that we have no conflict of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Greed and short-termism win out, and support for the doctor evaporates; so-called liberals metamorphose into oppressors and censors, and the Mayor, along with the local newspaper editor, Hovstad, are instrumental in ensuring that the town brands Stockmann “an enemy to society”.\n\n【3】*   View Large Image\n\n【4】Copyright © 2012 2012 Joan Marcus\n\n【5】The portrayal of the newspaper editor's craven failure to publish what is in the public interest hits its target. Hovstad's chameleonic switches of allegiance are cleverly enacted by John Procaccino, who strikes an avuncular note of a man sorely overworked, radical only among friends, and who feels obliged to give his readers what they want. His betrayal of Stockmann is all the more horrible because Procaccino has made us like him, and he seems so reasonable. Courage to go to print with the report would alter the course of events entirely, but Hovstad doesn't want to put himself at risk. During the public renunciation of Stockmann—an electric scene—the director, Doug Hughes, has Hovstad shout him down louder than anyone.\n\n【6】Stones are thrown through the doctor's windows, and he, his wife, and children are ostracised. Stockmann, however, refuses to be hounded out by the “wolves” who have all but destroyed him, and vows that he will continue to speak out. Desperate but dignified at the end, Stockmann stands by his broken study window, the golden daylight streaming in, and delivers the famous line to his wife and daughter: “the strongest man is always alone”. It is a wrenching moment in this production and expertly played by Gaines.\n\n【7】Ibsen based the play on events in Teplitz in the 1830s, when the medical officer of the spa town made a public announcement about an outbreak of cholera, and was forced into exile. In our own times narratives of corporate greed and dereliction of public duty resonate profoundly. Richard Thomas plays the Mayor as a man who is as ruthless in his self-promotion as he is in his exploitation of the powerless. The way that Thomas adopts a series of stiff, mechanical manoeuvres and gestures to impress his authority on others is highly effective. We are initially invited to laugh at him, and the director sweeps us along by having the other characters laugh at him too. But as the audience sees how he is willing to threaten and destroy, our laughter dies slowly over the five acts and is replaced by horror and revulsion with the realisation that the town has been condemned by political ego and blind, economic self-interest. This is an extraordinarily astute and contemporary production. The tragic narrative of the hero who battles against the odds, at tremendous personal cost, to persuade those in power that there is such a thing as an ethics of responsibility and welfare towards others, is strikingly familiar.\n\n【8】An Enemy of the People\n\n【9】Show full caption\n\n【10】Henrik Ibsen.

{"seq_id": "babaff76-2fb9-4bb0-af85-edcd302b68d7", "title": "Compassion in a time of COVID-19", "text": "【0】Compassion in a time of COVID-19\nThe verdict on the success of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be written, but the consequences of the disease are indisputable and rapidly coming into focus. In many countries, efforts to contain COVID-19 have resulted in an economic recession, pushing millions out of their jobs, and creating previously unprecedented unemployment in many countries worldwide. In addition to the millions of people infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hundreds of thousands have died—and will die—from COVID-19. An anticipated wave of mental and behavioural problems is beginning to be documented—compounded by social and economic stressors and uncertainties—that will likely present a population health burden for months and years to come.\n\n【1】COVID-19 has also triggered enormous displays of pro-social behaviour with neighbours coming to the aid of those isolated by the containment efforts and of support for front-line workers, including doctors, nurses, and other health-care personnel, whose responsibilities keep them at risk of infection. In the public conversation about this pandemic, an admirable empathy has been evident for those who have been affected and for those who have died from COVID-19. In some ways, the pandemic has brought populations together, generating an understanding that our health is interlinked and that we could all be at risk. That understanding made it possible, perhaps in an unprecedented way, to empathise with those with the disease and to wish them well out of a clear sense that they could also be us.\n\n【2】Infectious diseases have always been the paradigmatic example of diseases that show how our health is interlinked. We take vaccinations and make sure our children are vaccinated both to protect ourselves and as a social good. This impulse is laudable and, indeed, useful. It has helped, for example, ensure that during this pandemic an enormous number of people worldwide have followed guidance and orders to physically distance with relatively little demonstrable social disturbance. In fact, the opposite quickly became true: in many countries social norms shifted to encourage physical distancing, casting opprobrium on those who may have flaunted physical distancing norms and expectations. Public apologies by prominent figures who were found to be flaunting these guidelines became a feature of national media coverage.\n\n【3】And yet, it is worth reflecting on the extent to which our response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been informed by an understanding that we are all in this together, that the virus does not discriminate, and that as a result it benefits us all to comply with physical distancing guidelines to protect others and ourselves. Our empathy, our capacity to envision that we too could be affected, has been a powerful tool in the public health arsenal. But, in large part, it is hard not to notice that our empathy is informed here, as it often is, by an appreciation of our own personal risk. We feel regret and feel terrible about those who are suffering, in no small part because we can imagine that suffering being our own.\n\n【4】But is it true that this suffering is our own? Is it true that COVID-19 does not discriminate? Evidence is emerging that the effects of COVID-19, far from being indiscriminate, follow deeply entrenched patterns of health inequities, mirroring burdens of disease that are near universal. Those with resources, money, and power, often majority racial or ethnic groups, are better able to physically distance, work from home, and retain their employment. Those same groups then have lower risks of becoming infected or dying from COVID-19, probably reflecting a combination of factors, including better access to health care and a lower underlying burden of morbidity that predisposes to worse COVID-19 outcomes. It turns out that COVID-19 does discriminate, and that those who are already vulnerable—for example, the unstably housed, people on low income, those with poorer education, and individuals with less access to reliable nutritious food—are more likely to both become infected with the virus and die from COVID-19.\n\n【5】And this is where empathy fails. Empathy in the context of health is largely predicated on our appreciating the risks of a disease because we can imagine getting the disease ourselves. When we imagine we can also be infected, we are then willing to take the steps necessary to protect ourselves—and others—from the disease. And that force has been powerful and contributed to the dramatic change in how we live and in a shutdown of large parts of the world's economy, informed by fear of a novel disease and the need to protect ourselves and others around us.\n\n【6】*   View Large Image\n\n【7】Copyright © 2020 Hossein Fatemi/Panos Pictures\n\n【8】But what if those efforts contribute to health divides? What if those efforts also result in economic consequences that are inevitably going to be borne principally by those who are vulnerable and marginalised to begin with? What if those efforts are therefore going to result in the long-term widening of health inequities, consigning many people to worse mental and physical health for years to come? How do we account for this eventuality and how do we factor this into our thinking?\n\n【9】This calls ultimately for compassion as the animating force behind our thinking about health, and our thinking about how we go about informing the decisions we make to contain a novel threat like COVID-19. Compassion extends beyond empathy. It does not motivate our action because we too may be harmed. Compassion motivates action because the phenomena we observe are unjust, not worthy of the world we would like to live in. Martin Luther King Jr spoke often of compassion, enjoining us to see that compassion ultimately motivates not to “\\[fling\\] a coin to a beggar” but to “see that the edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring”. Compassion pushes us to understand how we have structured the world, and to ask how we can structure it better, not because we may suffer but because others are suffering and that is not how the world should be.\n\n【10】What would such a world look like? It would be one that is grounded in the principles of justice and the equitable distribution of resources. An approach to health that is rooted in compassion would help us see beyond ourselves, and place the good of others first. A world rooted in compassion would embrace health as a public good. This means treating health the way we do parks, education, the post office, fire stations, or our environment—in essence, as a crucial piece of the global commons supported by our collective investment for the benefit of all.\n\n【11】I recognise that this might seem theoretical, but such an approach would have concrete implications for our approach to health that can shape all our actions, be they in times of crisis, or in other times. In some respects, the current overwhelming investment in doctors and medicine has pushed a vision of health as a private commodity, something we can buy and sell, particularly in countries like the USA that do not have access to universal health care.\n\n【12】But what we can buy—health care—can only help us after we have become sick. And what we have been buying in the time of COVID-19 is largely an approach to bludgeon an epidemic into submission, informed by strict prioritisation of the biological imperatives of viral transmission. But our focus should always have been, and more importantly should now be, on building a world that is resilient to these challenges. Our focus should be on health as a state of not being sick to begin with, grounded in an approach that balances the health of all in all our actions. We must recognise that unless we invest in the preventive conditions of health—like safe housing, good schools, liveable wages, gender equity, clean air, drinkable water, and a more equal economy—any action we take during this and any future pandemic is likely to widen entrenched health gaps. And that situation should be unacceptable to all of us.\n\n【13】Would our approach to COVID-19 have been different were we accustomed to seeing health through the lens of compassion? I would argue yes. First, we would have long invested in the conditions that make people healthy, aiming to remove the underlying disproportionate burden of preventable illness that accrues to vulnerable populations worldwide. Second, our response to COVID-19 would be informed in equal parts by efforts to contain the spread and to mitigate how the consequences of our efforts to do so can bring about disproportionate harm to those who are removed from the decision making around this pandemic. Third, our response would recognise the global differences that characterise a world that puts the burden of disease squarely on countries with fewer resources, often driven to that condition by centuries of cross-national injustice, and would push us to redouble our efforts to do everything in our power to help those countries, perhaps before our own.\n\n【14】Surely this moment calls for careful reflection and a reinvestment in compassion as a foundational approach to health. Calling attention to compassion in this way is not sentimental. It is pointing out a tangible good, without which health for all is impossible. In a sense, COVID-19 has shown us that a healthy person and a healthy world are the same. And healthy people and a healthy world are both strengthened immeasurably by having compassion at the heart of health.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

Last month, _The Economist_ gave a clear prescription—”Instead of doing the job of governments, \\[WHO\\] should focus on the things they cannot manage alone, such as helping poor countries set up health systems, disseminating the best medical research and policies, and combating global epidemics. Politicians must be stopped from using regional offices as a parking-place for friends and relations of their allies. Dr Chan should be able to direct her own organisation: that means being able to hire and fire. And if the world wants an outfit capable of dealing with emergencies such as Ebola, it needs to pay for it. That means increasing dues—and not leaving it to scrabble for handouts.” Sensible advice, but sadly utterly wasted. It has been given before by many others on many occasions. Yet nobody has listened. Why? Because the assumption behind the advice to member states is that WHO is fundamentally sound. Unfortunately, many influential partners take a different view.\n\n【1】*   View Large Image\n\n【2】Copyright © 2015 Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images\n\n【3】Here is what some member states say. I don't accept all of these criticisms myself. But to strengthen WHO one must address what its severest detractors allege. The challenges facing WHO are multiple, serious, longstanding, and part of the complex political dynamics of its outdated and inefficient governance structure. Autonomous regional offices led by independently elected Regional Directors undermine the central leadership of WHO and create competing power bases within the WHO system. As global health institutions have diversified since WHO's creation in 1948, the agency is increasingly unable to exercise leadership within four key areas: the health sector (the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, GAVI, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have all encroached on WHO's traditional role); non-governmental organisations (WHO governance mechanisms include only health ministries); the multilateral system (thanks to expanding roles for UNAIDS, and, under Jim Kim's leadership, the World Bank); and in non-health sectors that directly affect health (where WHO has little leverage in trade, climate, or finance). Unlike most multilateral organisations, WHO is expected to fulfil a broad mix of functions: giving normative and technical guidance to member states and other health actors; assisting countries with health and development policies; and responding to global health emergencies, from disease outbreaks to humanitarian disasters. These vastly different functions are not easily reconciled within a single organisation. For financing, technical work is likely to be paid for on a project basis, development assistance will demand more predictable long-term support, and urgent health security responses will require a flexible emergency fund. The challenge is even more complex for human resources: technical work needs experts, development assistance requires fieldworkers, and emergency responses demand surge capacity.\n\n【4】*   View Large Image\n\n【5】Copyright © 2015 PAHO/WHO\n\n【6】Some also say the election process for Director-General is tainted by corruption, diminishing the reputation and authority of the role (and WHO itself). The evolving expectations of the Director-General's office demand the kind of political experience that can challenge even the best of public health leaders. Some idealists might like to rewrite WHO's Constitution from scratch. This isn't going to happen. Regional Directors are not going to disappear quietly. And nor should they. The best Regional Directors today provide leadership that is essential for progress. So what is to be done? A more practical approach might be to begin with the immediate problem—threats to global health security. What if we accepted that financing arrangements for WHO hampered its ability to fulfil this core mandate? Perhaps one option would be to create a fully and independently funded body, still under the leadership of WHO but separated financially and administratively from its existing structure. This new organisation would be tasked with preparing for, detecting, and responding to global health emergencies. It would be led by WHO, but governed by a diverse board of partners. Critics might oppose the idea of dividing a core function from the main body of WHO. But if we agree that the status quo is not an option (and surely we do), and if we also agree that radical reshaping of WHO is improbable, a substantive but still practicable reform, building on WHO's strengths, ought to be taken seriously.\n\n【7】*   View Large Image\n\n【8】Copyright © 2015 Universal Images Group via Getty Images\n\n【9】Article info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 17 January 2015\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60034-4\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

{"seq_id": "a5491aab-8278-4e2a-a697-8aaf685c0b2e", "title": "Limiting multiple births", "text": "【0】Limiting multiple births\nSir\n\n【1】On Jan 20 the UK Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) presented Evidence-Based Clinical Guideline No 6, which concerns the management of infertility in tertiary care. Recommendation No 10 states “A maximum of two embryos should be transferred in women of 40 years and less undergoing assisted reproduction. This will reduce the multiple pregnancy rates without diminishing the expected chance of a birth. Even for women aged over 40 there is a significant chance of a triplet pregnancy if three embryos are transferred.”\n\n【2】We share the concern of the RCOG over the incidence and sequelae of multiple births, particularly of triplets resulting from in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) because some may be preventable. However, it is open to debate how best to effectively achieve this objective without putting some patients at a disadvantage. Certainly it is difficult to believe the above recommendation is evidence based and that a couple can expect the same chance of a birth by transferring two, rather than three, embryos since the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) 1999 Patient Guide quotes very different live birth rates for patients aged 37 years and younger for centres having a high incidence of two embryo transfers, compared to that of our centre, which had a much lower incidence ( table ).\n\n【3】Table Analysis of HFEA 1999 patient guide data including live birth rates\n\n| **Centre** | **Total cycles** | **Abandoned cycles** | **Two-embryo transfer** | **Frozen embryo rate** | **IVF/ICSI <38 years** | **Births resulting per embryo transfer** | **Singleton % of total births** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  | Overall | Singleton | Multiple |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aberdeen | 602 | 14% | 63% | 18·3% | 21·2% | 14·4% | 11·1% | 3·3% | 77·0% |\n| Hammersmith Hospital | 1740 | 21% | 52% | 4·7% | 17·7% | 12·5% | 9·9% | 2·5% | 79·7% |\n| London Fertility Centre | 800 | 16% | 12% | 9·0% | 33·8% | 19·5% | 13·3% | 6·3% | 67·9% |\n\n【5】IVF=in-vitro fertilisation;\n\n【6】ICSI=intracytoplasmic sperm injection.\n\n【7】\\* Relative to total number of embryo-transfer cycles.\n\n【8】† Includes all treatment cycles irrespective of age including frozen embryo replacement cycles.\n\n【9】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【10】These differences are not simply because of a higher incidence of multiple births, since relatively more singletons occurred even when all patients were considered—ie, 13·2% compared with 11·1% and 9·9%. In addition, the HFEA data does not confirm a significant chance of triplets with three embryos in those over 40 years since there was only one set of triplets out of 808 embryo transfers (0·1%), so why is this gross overstatement included in the recommendation? It must be for a medical political reason—ie, trying to coerce clinicians to adhere to a particular policy.\n\n【11】Our aim should be to reduce multiple pregnancies in those having this risk, and not to recommend a rigid policy which will reduce the prospect of a singleton birth in those with reduced fertility potential who are at low risk of multiple pregnancy. To imply that the expected chance of a birth will not be reduced in all patients is incorrect. We believe that reduction of the total number of embryos transferred is too crude and imprecise an approach to do justice to the aspirations of individual couples since the HFEA database clearly shows a negative effect of increasing female age, duration of infertility, number of previous failed attempts, and so on. We believe critical analysis of the HFEA database should be made to assess the multiple pregnancy risk factors before clinicians decide whether to follow the RCOG Guideline 10, or not. The database is soon to be on the internet.\n\n【12】We commend calculation of a fertility score at the time of embryo transfer when deciding how many embryos to transfer for every individual couple. This should be based upon their risk of multiple pregnancy and not just on the total number of embryos available. We now score the factors associated with this risk—ie, age, number of eggs recovered and fertilised, embryo cleavage stage and regularity at the time of transfer, whether frozen embryos exist, and the dose of folliclestimulating hormone per egg collected, as well as others (eg, endometrial thickness, previous failed attempts, previous pregnancy). We believe one or two embryos should be transferred in those at high risk of multiple pregnancy, and three, or even more, in those at low risk, particularly for women over 40 years, or having poor reproductive potential with their own eggs. We are surprised that the RCOG should adopt any other approach. We believe the basis of all clinical medicine is to do the best for all patients seeking advice including those needing assisted conception.\n\n【13】Article info\n------------\n\n【14】### Publication history\n\n【15】Published: 25 March 2000\n\n【16】### Identification\n\n【17】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)72229-7\n\n【18】### Copyright\n\n【19】© 2000 Elsevier Ltd.

The guidance, which will apply from September, advises on identifying children and young people at risk of abuse and neglect, and on issues such as balancing parental freedoms, consent, communication with families, and giving evidence in court.\n\n【2】Circumcision concern\n--------------------\n\n【3】European Jewish and Muslim groups have joined forces to defend circumcision after Germany's Cologne court ruled that it constitutes bodily harm. The ruling followed a case in which a circumcision led to complications. The groups' statement says that circumcision is fundamental to their faiths and that the ruling is an affront to basic religious and human rights.\n\n【4】Cholera increase\n----------------\n\n【5】An upsurge in cholera in west Africa's Sahel region has made 2800 people ill and killed more than 60 this year, according to WHO and UNICEF. Malnutrition, displacement, and the start of the rainy season have created an ideal environment for cholera, the agencies say, putting many children in the region at risk of death.\n\n【6】Doctors on strike\n-----------------\n\n【7】Portuguese doctors went on strike last week, taking to the streets of Lisbon wearing black armbands of mourning. The government's austerity measures mean an €800 million cut to the health budget. With increases in prescription fees and the axing of many services, Portuguese medics feel the system will exclude the poor from essential health care.\n\n【8】*   View Large Image\n\n【9】Copyright © 2012 AFP/Getty Images\n\n【10】Breaking the cycle\n------------------\n\n【11】The Peruvian Government is setting up a scheme to reduce child labour, assisted by US funding. Currently, around 28% of Peru's children work for a living, preventing school attendance. The government has pledged financial assistance for impoverished families, plus education for children in three of the country's poorest regions.\n\n【12】*   View Large Image\n\n【13】Copyright © 2012 AFP/Getty Images\n\n【14】Aussie flu\n----------\n\n【15】This year's winter is predicted to be a bad influenza season in Australia, with 8000 people already diagnosed. The predominant strain is H3N2, which has been associated with increased mortality in previous years. Doctors are advising people to get vaccinated, to avoid people who have influenza, and to visit their doctor if symptoms develop.\n\n【16】AIDS progress\n-------------\n\n【17】July 18 saw the launch of a new UNAIDS report ahead of the International AIDS Conference in Washington, DC, USA. Among other facts and figures, Together we will end AIDS reveals that there were 20% fewer new HIV infections worldwide in 2011 than in 2001, and that the year between 2010 and 2011 saw a 20% increase in access to antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【18】Last clinic still open\n----------------------\n\n【19】The only clinic to do abortions in the state of Mississippi, USA, is to stay open after a federal judge granted it an extended period in which to comply with a new state law. The new law, which some see as prohibitive, requires abortion clinics in the state to employ certified obstetricians or gynaecologists who are licensed to practise at local hospitals.\n\n【20】Tajik torture\n-------------\n\n【21】Amnesty International has released a report claiming that torture is rife in prisons in Tajikistan. The report shows that groups believed to be a threat to national security or who are members of Islamic movements are at particular risk. Amnesty is calling on the Tajikistani authorities to stamp out torture, which only recently became illegal in the country.\n\n【22】Selling kidneys\n---------------\n\n【23】An Israeli man living in New York, NY, USA, has been sentenced to 2·5 years in prison for brokering kidney transplantations between living donors and recipients. The man, who reportedly made up to US$160 000 profit on each deal, is the first to be convicted of illegal organ trafficking in the USA under a 1984 law.\n\n【24】Freezing in Chile\n-----------------\n\n【25】Freezing temperatures in central and southern Chile have caused the deaths of 16 homeless people so far this year. Two deaths were reported in early July in the capital, Santiago, where temperatures had dropped to −8°C. Chile's 12 000 homeless people have been advised to seek shelter, although the cold weather is set to ease soon.\n\n【26】Social care reform\n------------------\n\n【27】The UK Government has announced a “radical reform” of care for older or disabled adults in the shape of a draft bill now open for public consultation. The Draft Care and Support Bill aims to provide support earlier, before crises are reached; clarify the support options open to people; personalise care; and focus on dignity and respect.\n\n【28】*   View Large Image\n\n【29】Copyright © 2012 Science Photo Library\n\n【30】Article info\n------------\n\n【31】### Publication history\n\n【32】Published: 21 July 2012\n\n【33】### Identification\n\n【34】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)61195-7\n\n【35】### Copyright\n\n【36】© 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Interleukin 4 (IL4) has pleiotropic effects on a network of cells directing repair, regeneration, and fibrosis. Pretreatment with subcutaneous IL4 complexed with anti-IL4 antibody (IL4c) promotes repair of carbon tetrachloride-mediated murine liver injury by stimulating hepatocyte proliferation. We hypothesised that IL4c could be administered therapeutically and act by a variety of mechanisms beyond engagement of hepatocytes.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】C57Bl/6 mice were given carbon tetrachloride intraperitoneally to induce acute liver injury. Preinjury and postinjury dosing regimens of IL4c were compared. The role of IL4 receptor α-chain (IL4Rα) signalling in bone-marrow-derived cells was investigated using tissue-protected chimeras generated with wild type or IL4Rα <sup>−/– </sup> donor bone marrow. Liver was analysed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】When compared with vehicle, administration of IL4c after injury produced a significant reduction in mean alanine aminotransferase (242 U/L \\[61·9\\] _vs_ 131 \\[30·8\\], p<0·0001) and necrotic cell area (11·6% \\[7·04\\] _vs_ 0·36 \\[0·6\\], p<0·0001). Although necrosis was reduced, the necrotic area in IL4c-treated liver was not replaced with hepatocytes but with a cellular infiltrate characterised by high F4/80 expression. FACs analysis showed a reduced proportion and number of Ly6c <sup>hi </sup> MHCII <sup>lo </sup> monocytes and a concomitant increase in the number of Ly6c <sup>lo </sup> MHCII <sup>hi </sup> F4/80 <sup>hi </sup> macrophages in injured livers treated with IL4c. This phenotypic change was dependent on IL4c signalling to Ly6c <sup>hi </sup> MHCII <sup>lo </sup> monocytes, since these cells exhibited developmental arrest when derived from IL4Rα-deficient bone marrow in chimeric mice.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】We demonstrate that IL4c can be administered therapeutically after carbon tetrachloride injury to improve indices of hepatic injury. Furthermore, IL4c treatment mediates a change in the monocyte–macrophage compartment which is consistent with a switch from a proinflammatory (Ly6c <sup>hi </sup> ) to a proreparative (Ly6c <sup>lo </sup> ) macrophage phenotype. We postulate that these Ly6c <sup>lo </sup> macrophages mediate clearance of necrotic debris and facilitate hepatic regeneration.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】Wellcome Trust.\n\n【11】Poster 80\n\n【12】**Contributors**\n\n【13】RL, CH, and CB conducted investigations.

These genes encode sarcolemmal, extracellular matrix, sarcomeric, and nuclear envelope proteins. Although the post-translational processing of muscle proteins has a significant role in their correct assembly and function, these processes have not been shown to be primarily involved in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies until recently. In the past 18 months, four different forms of inherited muscular dystrophy in human beings have been associated with mutations in genes encoding for putative glycosyltransferases. Aberrant glycosylation of α-dystroglycan, an external membrane protein expressed in muscle, brain, and other tissues, is a common feature in these disorders. α-dystroglycan is highly glycosylated, its sugar components varying in different tissues and controlling its interaction with extracellular matrix partners. Disrupted glycosylation of α-dystroglycan results in a loss of these interactions, giving rise to both progressive muscle degeneration and abnormal neuronal migration in the brain.\n\n【1】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

Opioid overdose death rates have increased steadily for more than a decade and doubled in 2013–17, as the highly potent synthetic opioid fentanyl entered the drug supply. Demographics of new HIV diagnoses among people who inject drugs are also changing, with more new HIV diagnoses occurring among White people, young people (aged 13–34 years), and people who reside outside large central metropolitan areas. Racial differences also exist in syringe sharing, which decreased among Black people and Hispanic people but remained unchanged among White people in 2005–15. Recent HIV outbreaks have occurred in rural areas of the USA, as well as among marginalised people in urban areas with robust HIV prevention and treatment services (eg, Seattle, WA). Multiple evidence-based interventions can effectively treat opioid use disorder and prevent HIV acquisition. However, considerable barriers exist precluding delivery of these solutions to many people who inject drugs. If the USA is serious about HIV prevention among this group, stigma must be eliminated, discriminatory policies must change, and comprehensive health care must be accessible to all.

The aim of this analysis from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2016 is to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date estimates of the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We estimated prevalence, incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; the sum of years of life lost \\[YLLs\\] and years lived with disability \\[YLDs\\]) by age and sex for 15 neurological disorder categories (tetanus, meningitis, encephalitis, stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category for other less common neurological disorders) in 195 countries from 1990 to 2016. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, was the main method of estimation of prevalence and incidence, and the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) was used for mortality estimation. We quantified the contribution of 84 risks and combinations of risk to the disease estimates for the 15 neurological disorder categories using the GBD comparative risk assessment approach.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Globally, in 2016, neurological disorders were the leading cause of DALYs (276 million \\[95% UI 247–308\\]) and second leading cause of deaths (9·0 million \\[8·8–9·4\\]). The absolute number of deaths and DALYs from all neurological disorders combined increased (deaths by 39% \\[34–44\\] and DALYs by 15% \\[9–21\\]) whereas their age-standardised rates decreased (deaths by 28% \\[26–30\\] and DALYs by 27% \\[24–31\\]) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis. The four largest contributors of neurological DALYs were stroke (42·2% \\[38·6–46·1\\]), migraine (16·3% \\[11·7–20·8\\]), Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% \\[9·0–12·1\\]), and meningitis (7·9% \\[6·6–10·4\\]). For the combined neurological disorders, age-standardised DALY rates were significantly higher in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 1·12 \\[1·05–1·20\\]), but migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache were more common and caused more burden in females, with male-to-female ratios of less than 0·7. The 84 risks quantified in GBD explain less than 10% of neurological disorder DALY burdens, except stroke, for which 88·8% (86·5–90·9) of DALYs are attributable to risk factors, and to a lesser extent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (22·3% \\[11·8–35·1\\] of DALYs are risk attributable) and idiopathic epilepsy (14·1% \\[10·8–17·5\\] of DALYs are risk attributable).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Globally, the burden of neurological disorders, as measured by the absolute number of DALYs, continues to increase. As populations are growing and ageing, and the prevalence of major disabling neurological disorders steeply increases with age, governments will face increasing demand for treatment, rehabilitation, and support services for neurological disorders. The scarcity of established modifiable risks for most of the neurological burden demonstrates that new knowledge is required to develop effective prevention and treatment strategies.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n【11】• View related content for this article\n\n【12】Introduction\n------------\n\n【13】The UN General Assembly report of December, 2017, underscored that progress in reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases, including neurological disorders, has been insufficient to meet the UN Sustainable Development Goal targets by 2030. Neurological disorders are the leading cause of disability and the second leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, strategies and programmes that reduce the burden from neurological disorders would potentially help to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goal targets.\n\n【14】Although age-standardised incidence, mortality, and prevalence rates of many neurological disorders declined for many countries from 1990 to 2015, the absolute number of people affected by, dying, or remaining disabled from neurological disorders over the past 25 years has been increasing globally. Regular assessments of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and disability associated with neurological disorders by cause and over time are important for evidence-based health-care planning, priority setting, and resource allocation. On a global scale, this type of information has facilitated between-country and between-region comparisons of the burden from neurological disorders and their trends. The information can also be used for hypothesis generation on causal relationships and effects of sociodemographic and health care factors on the burden from neurological disorders.\n\n【15】**Research in context**\n\n【16】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【17】Findings from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2015, showed that neurological disorders are the world's largest cause of disability. However, some disabling neurological disorders, specifically traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, were not included, thus underestimating the global burden of this group of disabilities. No other relevant efforts, beyond GBD, have been made to quantify the global burden of neurological disorders as a whole. The data sources identified after the GBD 2015 study are detailed in the other GBD papers in the series of the neurological disorders overvieved in this paper.\n\n【18】**Added value of this study**\n\n【19】This study improves upon GBD 2015 by including four significant considerations. First, compared with a previous analysis based on GBD 2015, we were able to add the non-fatal outcomes of traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury. Thus, in this analysis, we have aggregated results from GBD 2016 for 15 disease and injury outcomes that are generally cared for by neurological services, such as CNS infectious conditions (tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis), stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category of other less common neurological disorders. Second, we incorporated new data from sources identified after GBD 2015, including peer-reviewed publications, reports from statistical agencies or ministries of health, surveys, and administrative and hospital data. Third, in the individual papers of the burden of neurological disorders analysed, we extended our analysis of GBD results by Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate, with new ways of presenting and visualising changes over time and the relationship with SDI. Fourth, we extended the terminal age group used in our analysis from 80 years and older to 80–84 years, 85–89 year, 90–94 year, and 95 years and older.\n\n【20】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【21】Neurological disorders continue to be the leading cause of disability worldwide, and their contribution to the overall burden from all health conditions is increasing. The bulk of the burden from neurological disorders continues to be in low-income and middle-income countries. Ageing of the population, population growth, and ongoing epidemiological transition across all countries require regular updates on the global, regional, and national burden from neurological disorders to allow evidence-based health-care planning and resource allocation for these disorders.\n\n【22】In 2017, we published aggregated estimates of the burden from neurological disorders (as measured by prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years \\[DALYs\\], and years lived with disability \\[YLDs\\]), based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2015 data. However, neurological disorders analysed did not include traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury, which are significant sources of global disability. Additionally, newly available publications and other data sources were added to the GBD 2016 estimates.\n\n【23】In the 2018–19 series of publications in _The Lancet Neurology_ , <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> we presented global, regional, and national estimates of the burden of individual neurological disorders as measured by prevalence, mortality, DALYs, YLDs, years of life lost (YLLs), and, for selected disorders, also incidence, and their trends from 1990 to 2016 according to Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. Here, we present updated aggregated estimates (compared with aggregated estimates presented in the GBD 2015 study) of neurological disorders and their trends from 1990 to 2016 by SDI, age, and sex.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Overview\n\n【26】The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation produces annual updates of the GBD study and includes a growing collaboration of scientists. Reported estimates span the period from 1990 to 2016. Annual updates allow incorporation of new data and methodological improvements to ensure that the most up-to-date information is available to policy makers to help make resource allocation decisions. In this analysis, we have aggregated results from GBD 2016 for 15 disease and injury outcomes that are generally cared for by neurological services. These include infectious conditions (tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis), stroke, brain and other CNS cancers, TBI, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, migraine, tension-type headache, and a residual category of other less common neurological disorders. Compared to a previous analysis based on GBD 2015, we added non-fatal outcomes of TBI and spinal cord injury. Medication overuse headache is no longer included as a separate cause but quantified as a consequence of the underlying headache types. For all neurological disorders combined we report here estimates of deaths and DALYs because aggregate incidence and prevalence estimates of combined neurological disorders are not useful for policy making.\n\n【27】In the methods section of this overview paper, we present a summary of the general methods of the GBD as they apply to neurological disorders. In the ten accompanying disease-specific papers, we have concentrated on methods that are specific to each disorder. Details on the methods of estimates for tetanus, encephalitis, and the residual category of other neurological disorders are provided in the appendix . The guiding principle of GBD is to assess health loss due to mortality and disability comprehensively, defining disability as any departure from full health. In GBD 2016, estimates were made for 195 countries and territories and 579 subnational locations, for 27 years starting from 1990, for 23 age groups, and for both sexes. Deaths were estimated for 264 diseases and injuries, whereas prevalence and incidence were estimated for 328 diseases and injuries. To allow meaningful comparisons between deaths and non-fatal disease outcomes as well as between diseases, data for deaths from and prevalence of neurological disorders are summarised in a single indicator, the DALY. DALYs are the sum of YLLs and YLDs. YLLs are estimated as the product of counts of deaths and a standard ideal remaining life expectancy at the age of death. The standard life expectancy is derived from the lowest observed mortality rates by age in any population in the world larger than 5 million people. YLDs are estimated as the product of prevalence of individual consequences of disease (or sequelae) multiplied by their corresponding disability weights, which quantify the relative severity of sequelae as a number between 0 (representing full health) and 1 (representing death). Disability weights have been estimated in nine population surveys and an open-access internet survey in which respondents were asked to choose the healthier option between random pairs of health states that were presented with short descriptions of their main features.\n\n【28】### Mortality estimates\n\n【29】All-cause mortality rates are estimated from vital registration data in countries with complete coverage as analysed by demographic growth balance methods comparing successive census population counts. For other countries, the probabilities of death before age 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are estimated from censuses and surveys asking mothers to provide a history of children ever born and those still alive, and surveys asking adults about siblings who are alive or have died. Using model life tables, these probabilities of death are transformed into age-specific death rates by location, year, and sex. GBD has collated a large database of cause-of-death data from vital registrations and verbal autopsy surveys in which relatives are asked a standard set of questions to ascertain the likely cause of death, supplemented with police and mortuary data for injury deaths in countries with no other data. Cause-of-death information is provided in a large number of different classification systems based on versions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) or bespoke classifications in some countries. All data are mapped into the disease and injury categories of GBD. All classification systems contain codes that are less informative than ICD because they do not have a specific diagnosis (eg, unspecified cancer) or refer to codes that cannot be the underlying cause of death (eg, low back pain or senility) or are intermediate causes (eg, heart failure or sepsis). Such deaths are redistributed to more precise underlying causes of death. After these redistributions and corrections for under-registration, the data are analysed with the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm), a highly systematised tool that runs many different models on the same data and chooses an ensemble of models that best reflects all the available input data. The statistical performance of all models is tested by withholding 30% of the data and checking how well a model covers the data that were held out. To enforce consistency from CODEm, the sum of all-cause specific mortality rates is scaled to that of the all-cause mortality rates in each age, sex, location, and year category. All our estimates of causes of death are categorical: each death is assigned to a single underlying cause. This means that all estimates add to 100%.\n\n【30】### Non-fatal estimates\n\n【31】Non-fatal estimates are based on systematic reviews of published papers and unpublished documents, survey microdata, administrative records of health encounters, registries, and disease surveillance systems. These data sources are catalogued in our Global Health Data Exchange ( GHDx ), the largest repository of health data globally. We first set a reference case definition or study method, or both, that best quantifies each disease or injury or consequence thereof. If there is evidence of a systematic bias in data that used different case definitions or methods compared to reference data, we adjust those datapoints to reflect what their value would have been if measured as the reference. DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, is our main method of analysing non-fatal data. It is designed as a geographical cascade where a first model is run on data from all countries, which produces an initial global fit and estimates coefficients for predictor variables and the adjustments for alternative study characteristics. The global fit adjusted by the values of random effects for each of seven GBD super-regions ( appendix ), the coefficients on sex, and country predictors, is passed down as data to a model for each super-region together with the input data for that geography. The same steps are repeated going from super-regions to 21 regions and then to 195 countries and, where applicable, a further level down to subnational units. Below the global level, all models are run separately by sex and for six time periods (1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2016). During each analysis, all data for prevalence, incidence, remission (ie, cure rate), and mortality are forced to be internally consistent. For most diseases, the bulk of data for prevalence or incidence are at the disease level, with even fewer studies providing data on the proportions of cases of disease in each of the sequelae defined for the disease. The proportions in each sequela are pooled using DisMod-MR 2.1 or meta-analysis, or are derived from analyses of patient-level datasets. The multiplication of prevalent cases for each disease sequela and the appropriate disability weight produces YLD estimates that do not yet take into account comorbidity. To correct for comorbidity, these data are used in a simulation to create hypothetical individuals in each age, sex, location, and year combination who have none, one, or multiple sequelae simultaneously. We assume that disability weights are multiplicative rather than additive because this avoids assigning a combined disability weight value in any individual exceeding 1—ie, worse off than a year lost due to death.\n\n【32】### Risk factors\n\n【33】For risks, we use a different, counterfactual approach—ie, answering the question “what would the burden have been if the population had been exposed to a theoretical minimum level of exposure to a risk?” Thus, we need to define what level of exposure to a risk factor leads to the lowest amount of disease. We then analyse data on the prevalence of exposure to a risk and derive relative risks for any risk–outcome pair for which we find sufficient evidence of a causal relationship. Prevalence of exposure is estimated in DisMod-MR 2.1 using spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, or from satellite imagery in the case of ambient air pollution. Relative risk data are pooled using meta-analysis of cohort, case-control, and intervention studies. From the prevalence and relative risk results, population attributable fractions are estimated relative to the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). Criteria for inclusion of risks into GBD were the availability of sufficient evidence for a causal relationship between a risk and one or more disease or injury outcomes; evidence to support generalisability of an effect size beyond the populations included in epidemiological studies; availability of sufficient data and methods to enable estimation of exposure levels by country; and the likely importance of a risk factor to disease burden or policy considerations.\n\n【34】### Uncertainty intervals (UIs)\n\n【35】Uncertainty is propagated throughout all these calculations by creating 1000 values for each prevalence, death, YLL, YLD, or DALY estimate and performing aggregations across causes and locations at the level of each of the 1000 values for all intermediate steps in the calculation. The lower and upper bounds of the 95% UI are the 25th and 975th values of the ordered 1000 values. Significance of differences was established if 975 or more of the ordered 1000 values of difference were on either side of zero.\n\n【36】### SDI\n\n【37】GBD uses a composite indicator of sociodemographic development, SDI, which reflects the geometric mean of normalised values of a location's income per capita, the average years of schooling in the population aged 15 years and older, and the total fertility rate. Countries and territories are grouped into quintiles of high, high-middle, middle, low-middle, and low SDI based on their 2016 values.\n\n【38】### Role of the funding source\n\n【39】The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or the writing of the report. All authors had full access to the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n【40】Results\n-------\n\n【41】In 2016, the neurological disorders included in this analysis were responsible for 276 million (95% UI 247–308) DALYs, comprising 11·6% (10·7–12·4) of global DALYs for all diseases. Combined, these disorders were the underlying cause in 9·0 million (8·8–9·4) deaths or 16·5% (16·1–17·0) of total global deaths in 2016. Incidence and prevalence estimates for each neurological disorder can be found in the GBD online results tool . Results and findings mentioned can also be viewed interactively through an online data visualisation tool . Neurological disorders were the leading cause group of global DALYs in 2016, followed by cardiovascular diseases (excluding stroke). In terms of deaths, these combined neurological disorders ranked second after cardiovascular diseases. Since 1990, the number of deaths from neurological disorders increased by 39% (34–44) and DALYs for neurological disorders increased by 15% (9–21). However, age-standardised mortality rates decreased by 28% (26–30) over the same time, indicating that population increase and ageing are driving global numbers higher, even though the global population is exposed to a lower risk of death from these causes, as indicated by the lower age-standardised rates. Similarly, the age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 27% (24–31) between 1990 and 2016. The only neurological disorders that had a decrease in rates and absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs were tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis.\n\n【42】Stroke was the largest contributor to global neurological DALYs, responsible for 42·2% (95% UI 38·6–46·1) of these DALYs in 2016 ( table 1 ). Migraine was the second largest contributor (16·3% \\[11·7–20·8\\]), followed by Alzheimer's and other dementias (10·4% \\[9·0–12·1\\]) and meningitis (7·9% \\[6·6–10·4\\]). Stroke ranked first among neurological disorders in terms of age-standardised DALY rates in 19 of 21 world regions ( figure 1 ). In Australasia and western Europe, migraine ranked first. Migraine and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were ranked among the top four contributing neurological conditions in all 21 GBD world regions. Large variations in ranking were found for meningitis (ranked second in central, eastern, and western sub-Saharan Africa and 14th in high-income Asia Pacific), epilepsy (ranked second in southern sub-Saharan Africa and third in central Asia and eighth in eastern Europe), and encephalitis (ranked fifth in south Asia and 14th in Australasia, western Europe, and high-income North America). Other high rankings of note are for spinal cord injury (ranked fourth in all five high-income regions), TBI (ranked fourth in central and eastern Europe), and tetanus (ranked sixth in eastern sub-Saharan Africa; figure 1 ).\n\n【43】Table 1 Global deaths, DALYs, incidence, and prevalence per 100 000 people and age-standardised rates by neurological disorder category, 1990–2016\n\n|  |

DALYs for traumatic brain injuries and spinal cord injuries include years lived with disability only (not years of life lost), because International Classification of Disease rules for cause of death reporting require that injury deaths are assigned to causes rather than consequences. We report incidence or prevalence depending on what is the most commonly used or relevant measure of frequency. Prevalence estimates of other neurological disorders and all neurological disorders were not computed because aggregates of prevalence among disparate disease entities are not very informative to policy.

When examining individual disorders, a significantly higher burden (as measured by age-standardised DALY rates) in males than females was observed for TBI, Parkinson's disease, tetanus, motor neuron diseases, and stroke, with male-to-female ratios of at least 1·5. By contrast, migraine, multiple sclerosis, and tension-type headache had male-to-female ratios of less than 0·7 ( table 1 ). In children younger than 5 years, infectious neurological conditions (ie, tetanus, meningitis, and encephalitis), particularly meningitis, were the main causes of neurological DALYs in both sexes ( figure 2 ). DALYs from epilepsy were highest in people aged 5 years to 29 years. Migraine and tension-type headache were large contributors in young and middle-aged adults, with much higher numbers in females than males. Stroke burden rapidly increased up to the age of about 80 years, and was the dominant cause of neurological burden between ages 60 and 84 years, more so in males than females. Although Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were the dominant cause of neurological burden from age 90 years, the global number of DALYs from dementias was greatest between ages 80 and 89 years ( figure 2 ).\n\n【52】Figure 2 Global DALYs for neurological disorders by sex and age, 2016\n\n【53】Show full caption\n\n【54】Early neonatal is 0–7 days; late neonatal is 7–28 days; and post-neonatal is 28 days to 1 year.

Deaths, and by extension YLLs, were the dominant feature of infectious causes, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and brain and other CNS cancer, whereas the burden estimated for headaches, TBI, and spinal cord injury were all YLDs, because headaches are not considered an underlying cause of death and the ICD attributes injury deaths to the cause and not the nature of injury. Epilepsy, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias were other substantial contributors to YLDs of neurological disorders ( figure 3 ).\n\n【57】Figure 3 Global YLLs and YLDs for neurological disorders by age, 2016\n\n【58】Show full caption\n\n【59】YLLs (A) and YLDs (B).

All of these countries have scarce general health data, and no data for any of the neurological conditions included in this analysis. Thus, estimates depended heavily on predictive covariate values and geographical proximity and, hence, are rather uncertain. 11 countries had age-standardised DALY rates less than 2500 DALYs per 100 000 population: Singapore, Peru, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Canada, and Bermuda ( table 2 ). The reasons for the low rates in these countries were varied. For example, Taiwan and Japan have low rates of migraine, whereas Costa Rica's stroke rates were low. High stroke rates were common among the five countries with the highest neurological DALY rates, whereas, meningitis rates were also high in Somalia, Central African Republic, and Afghanistan and tetanus rates were much higher in Somalia than in any of the other four countries. The age-standardised rates of neurological DALYs decreased significantly in 171 of 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2016. In 23 countries, the change did not reach statistical significance, and only in North Korea was there a significant increase, which was 20% (95% UI 7–34).\n\n【62】Table 2 DALYs and age-standardised

DALY=disability-adjusted life-year.\n\n【65】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【66】Only three of the 15 neurological disorder categories had more than 10% of DALYs attributable to the 84 risks quantified in GBD 2016: risk-attributable DALYs accounted for 88·8% (86·5–90·9) of all stroke DALYs, 22·3% (11·8–35·1) of DALYs for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and 14·1% (10·8–17·5) of idiopathic epilepsy DALYs. For the other neurological disorders, the proportion of DALYs that were risk attributable was either very small (meningitis, encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis) or zero (tetanus, brain and other CNS cancer, migraine and tension-type headache, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron diseases).\n\n【67】Discussion\n----------\n\n【68】Contributing 11·6% of global DALYs and 16·5% of deaths from all causes, neurological disorders remain the leading group cause of DALYs and the second leading group cause of deaths in the world. These estimates are close to those reported in GBD 2015 estimates on the global burden of neurological disorders. Furthermore, our findings reported in the individual neurological disorder papers of the significant geographic and sex variations and the effects of SDI on the patterns of the burden of neurological disorders were consistent with our previous observations. Although the age-standardised rates of deaths and DALYs from 1990 to 2016 have decreased significantly, the absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs have significantly increased over the same period. The only neurological disorders that had significant decreases in age-standardised incidence, prevalence, mortality, and DALY rates were infectious neurological disorders (meningitis, encephalitis, and tetanus). These diverging trends in communicable and non-communicable neurological disorders are in line with our previous estimates and consistent with the observed overall global burden shift from communicable to non-communicable disorders. The decline of age-standardised rates with concomitant increase in absolute numbers was observed in most countries. The increase in absolute numbers of non-communicable neurological disorders juxtaposed with a significant decrease in their age-standardised rates is consistent with the major role of population ageing and growth as the main drivers of this increase; it also suggests that intervention strategies to reduce non-communicable neurological disorders are not sufficiently deployed or effective. With continuing ageing of populations, the prevalence of non-communicable neurological disorders is likely to continue increasing, placing pressure on already overstretched health-care services. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> Therefore, development of new strategies to treat or prevent the major neurological disorders and the implementation of already proven effective prevention strategies for stroke and infectious neurological disorders are of paramount importance to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goal targets.\n\n【69】The relationship between SDI and age-standardised DALY rates has been discussed in each of the neurological disorder-specific GBD 2016 papers. <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> <sup>, </sup> For stroke, epilepsy, and meningitis we showed that age-standardised DALY rates by GBD regions over the period 1990–2016 follow a downward trajectory aligned with the predicted direction of decreasing burden of these conditions with socioeconomic development. Four other categories, brain and other CNS cancer, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and motor neuron diseases, appear to follow a pattern of increasing DALY rates with increasing SDI. However, for all four of these conditions there were large variations in rates from the expected pattern according to SDI, and high-income Asia Pacific has much lower rates for all four conditions than other high-income regions. This suggests that the observed relationship with SDI is spurious, with SDI being a proxy for other factors (eg, genetic) explaining variations in disease rates. For Alzheimer's disease and other dementias and migraine and tension-type headache, the variation in age-standardised DALY rates and SDI between world regions and within regions over time suggests that socioeconomic development does not determine the extent of DALYs from these diseases.\n\n【70】Our study findings have important health service implications. The increase in number of people affected by non-communicable neurological disorders implies a need for substantially increased resources for their management. Our detailed estimates for 195 countries and a growing number of subnational locations provides a basis for locality-specific priority setting and financing of health services, including workforce development. For example, by knowing the absolute numbers of new and existing cases of major disabling neurological disorders from the GBD study, one can estimate annual requirements for first specialist neurologist assessments (total number of incident cases of these disorders) and for follow-up neurological assessments (assuming an average number \\[eg, two\\] of follow-up visits per year), and from these, the number of neurologists required in a country for outpatient management. For example, in New Zealand in 2016, there were 23 132 incident and 152 210 prevalent cases of stroke, dementias, refractory migraines (perhaps 5% of all migraine cases), epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, and brain and other CNS cancers combined. Thus, the total time for required first specialist assessments (23 132 × 0·75 h for a new clinic patient as reported in New Zealand is 17 349 h) and neurology follow-ups (152 210 \\[number of prevalent cases\\] × two \\[average number of follow-ups per year\\] × 0·5 h for a follow-up is 152 210 h) was 169 559 h. By dividing 169 559 h by the average estimate of physicians' working hours per year (40 h per week × 48 weeks is 1920 h), one can estimate that approximately 88 full-time equivalent (FTE) neurologists are required (compared with the 36 that are available) to provide specialist neurological care for the most common disabling neurological disorders in New Zealand. This result is close to previous estimates of FTE neurologist requirements in New Zealand using a pragmatic analysis.\n\n【71】This study was not free of the general limitations shared by all GBD estimates. First, to bring as much information as possible into the estimation of disease and death rates for GBD, an extensive effort is dedicated to making data sources comparable—eg, by mapping cause-of-death data across various iterations of ICD classification systems and the local idiosyncrasies in how these are applied; the redistribution of less informative codes for an underlying cause of death to specified causes in the GBD list; and adjustments of non-fatal and risk factor data to account for biases introduced by different case definitions or study methods. However, we cannot guarantee that we are aware of and can accurately correct for all sources of measurement bias, particularly for diseases like dementia, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, and Parkinson's disease, which require more complex survey procedures to establish a diagnosis. Additionally, diagnosis of headaches is entirely based on patient report and thus, prone to various sources of reporting bias. Second, despite extensive efforts to identify data sources for GBD, many countries have sparse data and missing information. In those countries, we rely heavily on predictive covariates and assume similarity through geographical proximity. However, many of the neurological disorders do not have strong predictors. The exception is stroke, for which the combination of all risks included in GBD predicts 88·8% of the total burden. The absence of strong predictors in the models of the other disorders makes it much harder to predict disease levels in countries with sparse or no data. It also makes it more essential to conduct good-quality epidemiological studies in those countries that are currently poorly represented in the disease models. Third, we were able to add spinal cord injury and TBI estimates to this analysis but only in terms of incidence and YLDs. The dominant tradition in cause-of-death attribution is to assign injury deaths to the cause of the injury rather than the consequent nature of injury. In future iterations of GBD we plan to analyse data sources with multiple causes listed for each death to approximate deaths from nature of injury categories like TBI and spinal cord injury. Fourth, in GBD, the correction for comorbidity is made on the basis of the independent probability that an individual will have combinations of disabling sequelae. Although we would like also to take into account the more commonly known comorbidities, computationally this has remained intractable for the large number of diseases and their sequelae estimated in GBD. For the neurological disorders that are highly prevalent in older people with known comorbidities such as stroke and diabetes, we are overestimating the non-fatal burden. Finally, the residual category of other neurological disorders tries to capture deaths and DALYs for neurological disorders that are not explicitly being estimated. For deaths, where vital registration systems provide data on all causes, this can be estimated with greater precision. For the non-fatal estimates, we approximate YLDs by assuming the same ratio of YLDs and YLLs estimated for the main fatal neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron diseases, and idiopathic epilepsy) and apply this ratio to the YLLs calculated for residual causes like Huntington's disease and muscular dystrophy. Although as a placeholder estimate this method has at least some validity for residual neurological disorders that lead to death, it does not capture the burden of any residual neurological disorders that are not a cause of death, such as peripheral neuropathies, neuropathic pain, or restless legs syndrome. Thus, our estimates of the burden of neurological disorders, although already large and increasing, are still an underestimate of the true burden of neurological disorders and will be until resources are found to explicitly estimate the burden of these residual disorders.\n\n【72】In summary, the burden of neurological disorders (especially non-communicable disorders) is large and increasing, posing a challenge to the sustainability of health systems. Although a wealth of knowledge is available on how best to reduce the burden of stroke and infectious neurological diseases, intervention and reduction of the burden of other non-communicable neurological disorders is much more complex and requires the development of new evidence to design more effective treatments and prevention measures. Further epidemiological studies on neurological disorders in various populations are required to fill the gaps in the knowledge of distribution, frequency, outcomes, and determinants of major neurological disorders. We call on a wide range of clinicians, surgeons, and other health-care professionals with neurological expertise caring for individuals with neurological disorders to work collaboratively with the GBD to strengthen the accuracy of future GBD estimates by enhancing epidemiological research of neurological disorders.\n\n【73】**GBD 2016 Neurology Collaborators**\n\n【74】Valery L Feigin, Emma Nichols,

But one of the perverse effects of the war on terrorism has been the revival of the idea that torture can be legitimate in so-called exceptional cases, such as a calibrated infliction of pain to interrogate suspected terrorists. And now, as in the past, it is impossible to discuss torture without addressing the role and obligations of physicians who might be asked to measure the imposition of pain, examine the health status of the victim, or who might learn of torture when examining detainees. The revived discussion raises anew whether the medical community's condemnation of torture, though worthy, has been an adequate response.\n\n【1】This article is available free of charge.\n\n【2】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【3】Already registered?\n\n【4】Log in to existing account\n\n【5】Forgot password?\n\n【6】One-time access price info\n\n【7】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【8】Not yet registered?\n\n【9】Register for free", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "f3a8b4ed-0fc5-4f44-9535-16f65b7aacd5", "title": "Women's choice is key to reduce maternal deaths", "text": "【0】When Savita Halappanavar died in Galway University Hospital, Ireland, last month from sepsis after having been denied a termination of pregnancy during a threatened miscarriage, an outcry went through the developed world. Ireland's restrictive abortion laws have caused public anger before, for example in 1992, when a 14-year-old rape victim was prevented from travelling to England for an abortion but was eventually given the right to abortion on the grounds of suicide risk. Maternal deaths are thankfully now rare in developed countries. But any such death is avoidable and makes it all the more important to critically examine laws and guidelines. The Irish Government should thoroughly review and reassess its ambiguous abortion law.\n\n【1】The story is a different one in the developing world. According to global estimates for 2008, of about 350 000 maternal deaths all but about a 1000 happened in developing countries, the majority in Africa. The leading causes are post-partum haemorrhage, hypertensive disorders, sepsis, obstructed labour, and complications from unsafe abortions. Access to safe abortion remains the neglected taboo in discussions about reproductive health and family planning. Every year, of an estimated 43·8 million abortions, 49% are classified as unsafe and nearly all (97%) in Africa are unsafe. The percentage of unsafe abortions has increased from 44% in 1995 according to Gilda Sedgh and colleagues' paper on global abortion rates published at the beginning of this year. And while maternal mortality overall has declined, mortality from unsafe abortions has remained the same at an estimated 47 000 women each year. An additional 5 million women suffer disabilities related to unsafe abortions. Without access to legal and safe abortions, many women will continue to die needlessly. WHO's new guidelines on safe abortions, published in July this year, should form an essential part of each country's plan to reduce maternal deaths.\n\n【2】No woman wants to go through an abortion. And while there will always be circumstances when a woman sees abortion as the only solution, the best way to reduce the number of abortions is to give women choice over when and how to plan their families and avoid unwanted pregnancies in the first place. Almost 300 000 maternal deaths were averted in 2008, according to estimates by Saifuddin Ahmed and colleagues, through access to contraceptives. Yet, there are still about 222 million adolescent girls and women worldwide who lack access to family planning. At the London Summit on Family Planning in July, US$2·6 billion in new donor money was pledged to give an additional 120 million adolescent girls and women access to contraceptives by 2020. This is a welcome boost to assert women's rights and choices on how and when to plan a family. However, an extra $4·1 billion would be required to reach everyone who has unmet needs.\n\n【3】The new _State of World Population 2012_ report , entitled _By Choice, Not By Chance_ and published by the United Nations Population Fund on Nov 14, estimates that making voluntary family planning available to everyone in developing countries would reduce costs of health care for women and newborn babies by $11·3 billion annually. So, there would be a substantial net saving regarding costs alone. But immediate health-care cost savings is only one side of the equation. The more pertinent and humane argument is one that links intrinsically with sustainable development. The report makes a strong case that family planning delivers immeasurable rewards to women, families, and communities. Women must be allowed to take part in society beyond reproduction. Adolescent girls' lives should not be restricted by early childbirth, lack of education, and poverty. Deaths and disability from childbirth and unsafe abortions should become a scourge of the past.\n\n【4】In 2014, the 20 year anniversary of the milestone Cairo International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) is the moment in time when we need to take stock. The ICPD Beyond 2014 secretariat was created to deliver a comprehensive review and a special report with recommendations for further action. Together with the 2015 post-Millennium Development Goals discussions, we need to make the strongest effort possible to give every woman in every country the right and choice to decide when and how to plan a family. Not only will there be fewer maternal and child deaths, but also families will lead healthier lives, will be better educated, and will be economically better off. Sustainable development requires the full participation of women in society worldwide.\n\n【5】*   View Large Image\n\n【6】Copyright © 2012 Panos/Peter Barker\n\n【7】Article info\n------------\n\n【8】### Publication history\n\n【9】Published: 24 November 2012\n\n【10】### Identification\n\n【11】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62009-1\n\n【12】### Copyright\n\n【13】© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, hypertension is not a typical sign of hypothyroidism. This misconception is more than 80 years old with Owen Thompson and colleagues reporting a high incidence of hypertension in myxoedema. Since then, many uncontrolled observational studies have shown that elevated blood pressure in patients with hypothyroidism returns to within normal range after thyroid hormone substitution. In a meta-analysis of 50 147 patients with subclinical hypothyroidism, systolic blood pressure was marginally elevated (1·47 mm Hg, 95% CI 0·54–2·39, p=0·002) compared with euthyroid individuals; however, diastolic blood pressure was not significantly different. This variance can be attributed to an age difference between patients with hypothyroidism and euthyroid individuals. Even in patients with severe hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation, withdrawal of levothyroxine caused only a modest increase in blood pressure (5·1/8·2 mm Hg, measured by 24 h ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring).\n\n【1】In subclinical hypothyroidism, thyroid hormone substitution does not lower blood pressure, which was thoroughly documented by David J Stott and colleagues in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial involving 737 patients. Therefore, clinicians should treat hypertension in patients with firmly established hypertension, regardless of whether hypothyroidism is present.\n\n【2】*   View Large Image\n\n【3】Copyright © 2018 Alice S/BSIP/Science Photo Library\n\n【4】FHM is a consultant or has advisory relationships with Pfizer, Abbott, Servier, Medtronic, WebMD, Menarini, Ipca, American College of Cardiology, and Hikma.

Large-scale neuroimaging studies in depression implicate robust structural brain differences in the disorder. However, most studies have been conducted in adults and therefore, the temporal origins of depression-related imaging features remain largely unknown. This has important implications for understanding aetiology and informing timings of potential intervention.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Here, we examine associations between brain structure (cortical metrics and white matter microstructural integrity) and depression ratings (from caregiver and child), in a large sample ( _N_ \\= 8634) of early adolescents (9 to 11 years old) from the US-based, Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study **®** . Data was collected from 2016 to 2018.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We report significantly decreased global cortical and white matter metrics, and regionally in frontal, limbic and temporal areas in adolescent depression (Cohen's _d_ \\= -0⋅018 to -0⋅041, β = -0·019 to -0⋅057). Further, we report consistently stronger imaging associations for caregiver-reported compared to child-reported depression ratings. Divergences between reports (caregiver vs child) were found to significantly relate to negative socio-environmental factors (e.g., family conflict, absolute β = 0⋅048 to 0⋅169).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Depression ratings in early adolescence were associated with similar imaging findings to those seen in adult depression samples, suggesting neuroanatomical abnormalities may be present early in the disease course, arguing for the importance of early intervention. Associations between socio-environmental factors and reporter discrepancy warrant further consideration, both in the wider context of the assessment of adolescent psychopathology, and in relation to their role in aetiology.\n\n【9】### Funding\n\n【10】Wellcome Trust (References: 104036/Z/14/Z and 220857/Z/20/Z) and the Medical Research Council (MRC, Reference: MC\\_PC\\_17209).\n\n【11】Keywords\n--------\n\n【12】*   Big data\n*   Adolescent depression\n*   Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study\n*   Brain structure\n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】### Evidence before this study\n\n【15】While disruptions in brain structure have been associated with depression in adult samples, less is known about the temporal origin and development of these depression-related imaging features. We searched Google Scholar for studies published in English from inception to 2021, using search terms “MDD OR major depression OR major depressive disorder OR depression OR depress(ive/ion) symptoms” “AND adolescent OR adolescence” “AND brain structure OR cortical OR subcortical OR white matter OR MRI”. We did not find any studies that used multi-modal imaging data from large, population samples to investigate brain structural associations with depression in adolescence.\n\n【16】### Added value of this study\n\n【17】To our knowledge, this is the first study to use the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study® to examine cortical and white matter microstructural associations with adolescent depression. We report shared depression-related imaging features between adolescent and adult literature, such as reduced white matter integrity in frontal-limbic circuits. Our findings also demonstrate surface area differences in this sample, which may represent an adolescent-specific vulnerability.\n\n【18】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【19】Our findings suggest that cortical and white matter microstructural abnormalities exist early in the disease course of depression. Tracing the roots of depression in the developing brain provides opportunity to better our understanding of the factors associated with its emergence during this period of neurodevelopmental sensitivity. However, longitudinal data, which will soon be available through the ABCD Study, is needed to chart intra- and inter-personal neurodevelopmental trajectories to identify modifiable risk factors that could inform future intervention approaches.\n\n【20】1\\. Introduction\n----------------\n\n【21】Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chief cause of disability \\[ \\] with a heritability of approximately 37% \\[ \\]. This burden falls heavily on adolescents, as over 50% of depression cases emerge before the age of 25 \\[ \\]. Adolescent depression is notably associated with a more severe illness course and can lead to the propagation of difficulties across the lifespan \\[ \\]. MDD is associated with disruptions in brain structure \\[ , , , \\]. However, due to a lack of large-scale neuroimaging samples for adolescents, the origin and development of depression-related imaging features remains largely unknown.\n\n【22】Large population-based neuroimaging studies in adults have allowed unparalleled insight into the neurobiological underpinnings of depression \\[ , \\]. For example, recent evidence from the ENIGMA (Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis) consortium demonstrated widespread structural abnormalities in MDD from large adult samples, including reduced hippocampal volume, decreased frontal cortical thickness \\[ \\] ( _N_ \\= 10,105) and altered fronto-limbic and fronto-thalamic tract microstructure \\[ \\] ( _N_ \\= 2907). Since these highly powered studies have largely been conducted in adults, they preclude investigation of the neurobiology underlying the emergence and development of depression earlier in life. Given adolescence is the period of greatest risk for the development of depression \\[ \\], as well as a time of immense neurodevelopmental change \\[ , \\], it is a key period in which to investigate evidence for emergence of these imaging features.\n\n【23】Findings from earlier studies on brain structural alterations in adolescent MDD have been highly heterogeneous \\[ , , , , , \\]. A recent meta-analysis of imaging studies of MDD from ENIGMA, which included a relatively large adolescent population ( _N_ \\= 507, age range 12–21 years), indicated lower global surface area and regional reductions in frontal areas in this younger sample of depressed cases \\[ \\]. However, this subsample comprised primarily of participants from older adolescence to young adulthood, where 90% of the sample were aged ≥ 16 years, meaning earlier origins of depression related brain imaging features remain under explored. There have also been recent efforts to investigate whether white matter integrity disruptions seen in adult cases are present in adolescent depression. Although some studies report reduced white matter microstructural integrity in adolescents with depression, findings have lacked consistency in terms of regions \\[ , , \\] and effects sizes \\[ , \\], likely due to small sample sizes \\[ , , \\]. Moreover, symptom heterogeneity may contribute to these disparate findings as reduced white matter integrity has been found to relate to depression sub-types \\[ \\] as well as subthreshold depression \\[ \\]. It therefore remains unclear whether reduced white matter integrity is a hallmark of early depression pathophysiology during adolescence.\n\n【24】There is a significant degree of individual difference in symptom presentation and impairment in adolescents experiencing depressive symptoms, especially regarding the social context in which these difficulties manifest (e.g., home, school). Discordance between child and parent reports of psychopathology has been well documented \\[ , \\] with some research suggesting that parents may under-report youth depressive symptoms compared to youth self-report \\[ \\]. However, given inconsistent findings in the literature \\[ \\], a multiple-informant approach, which usually includes the young person and their caregiver, remains “best-practice” \\[ , \\]. Notably, the associated implications of reporter discrepancy in youth psychopathology \\[ \\] has been understudied in the context of underlying neurobiological associations. We extend this existing work by looking at both caregiver and child reported symptoms and how these differentially associate with imaging features.\n\n【25】The current study therefore examines early associations between multi-modal structural imaging features and the emergence of MDD and depressive symptoms (DS) from the population-based, demographically diverse, Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study **®** , using both caregiver and child reported symptoms \\[ \\]. The ABCD Study® is a population-based longitudinal project that encompasses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and lifetime assessments of psychiatric disorders in 9–11-year-old US children ( _N_ \\= 8634, mean age = 9⋅91 years).\n\n【26】2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\n【27】### 2.1 Participants\n\n【28】Data from the curated annual release 2.0.1 of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study® were used. Participants were recruited from 21 sites across the United States \\[ \\]. A total of _N_ \\= ~11,800  children (9–11 years) participated in the baseline assessment, which took place between September 1st 2016 and August 31st 2018. The unrelated participants with quality-controlled brain imaging measures (cortical measures or white matter measures) were included in the analysis ( _N_ \\= 8634, mean age = 9⋅91, standard deviation = 0⋅62, 52⋅3% were male). The study was approved by the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive, United States (NIMH). Written consent was obtained from all participants. Data was accessed through the NDA data base ( https://nda.nih.gov/general-query.html?q=query=featured-datasets:Adolescent%20Brain%20Cognitive%20Development%20Study%20(ABCD) ; Federal-Wide Assurance: FWA00018101).

A 3-T Siemens Prisma, General Electric 750 or Phillips scanner was used for data acquisition. A unified protocol for the scanning was used to harmonise between sites and scanners. Protocols used for data acquisition and processing were described elsewhere \\[ \\]. Standard preprocessing and quality check (QC) procedures were conducted according to the ABCD protocol. Participants with excessive head motion or poor data quality were excluded from the curated data release.\n\n【34】Two types of brain structural measures were used in the present study: grey matter cortical and white matter microstructural measures.\n\n【35】Cortical measures were generated using Freesurfer 5.3.0 ( https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurferWiki ). Four types of cortical measures were used: surface area, thickness, volume and sulcal depth. First, global measures were generated for each cortical measure over the whole brain (see Fig. S1). The Desikan-Killiany atlas was then used for parcellation of 34 bilateral regional cortical structures.\n\n【36】White matter microstructural measures included fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Global measures of FA and MD were generated over the whole brain. The TractAtlas was used to map boundaries of the 14 bilateral and 3 unilateral major tracts \\[ \\]. FA/MD values were then derived for each of the region.\n\n【37】Data with poor-quality raw T1/DTI scans and low post-processing QC scores were removed. As there were outlying values for white matter microstructural measures, we removed those with global FA and MD values 5 standard deviations from mean \\[ \\]. Further details can be found in Supplementary Information.\n\n【38】### 2.3 Measures for major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms in adolescents\n\n【39】Life-time Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and depressive symptoms (DS) for children were assessed using a computerised version of the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (KSADS) \\[ \\]. The scale included 28 binary items on current and past DS that reached clinical significance \\[ \\] (Table S2). Questions were completed by parents and children separately and self-administered. A previous study of the computerised version for scales showed good to high reliability, with AUC = 0.89–1.00 comparing against clinician administered, computerised KSADS diagnoses \\[ \\]. Lifetime measures of MDD and DS were generated by combining reports on current and past symptoms (a positive answer for either current or past were grouped as positive for lifetime depression, and negative answers on both were grouped as negative, see Supplementary Methods). Questionnaires were completed by both children and by a caregiver independently. A diagnosis of MDD was generated by the ABCD team for both child and caregiver reported symptoms separately \\[ \\]. We additionally created a measure of DS based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria for the severity scale of depression \\[ \\]. Levels of DS included: ‘severe’, ‘moderate’, ‘mild’ and ‘none of the above’ (encoded as 3–0, respectively, see Tables S2 and 3, Fig. S4 and Supplementary Methods). DS assessed using the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL, a Likert-scale measure) based on reports by caregivers were also used to validate these measures \\[ \\] (see Supplementary Information). MDD and DS for unrelated children were included in the analysis. Sample sizes for these variables can be found in Table 1 .\n\n【40】In addition to the DS reported by caregivers and children separately, we looked at the average reports and discrepancies of DS. Average DS was obtained by calculating the mean of DS reported by each caregiver-child pair. Discrepancy was generated by obtaining the absolute values of subtracting caregiver and child reports.\n\n【41】We also sought to control for potential biases introduced by the current mood of caregivers which could confound associations between their rating of depression in the adolescents with the brain structural measures. We used a subscale of DSM-V-oriented items for depressive problems from the Adult Self-Report (ASR) in the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment \\[ \\] (Supplementary Methods).\n\n【42】### 2.4 Measures of socio-environmental factors\n\n【43】As exploratory analyses to further understand potential socio-environmental factors relating to differences in caregiver and child report, we also examined absolute discrepancies in these reports with variables from the ABCD sample including cultural, social, family and school environment of children reported by both caregivers and children themselves, see Supplementary Methods and Table S4.\n\n【44】### 2.5 Statistical models\n\n【45】Statistical analyses were performed in Scientific Linux 2.6.32, using R 3.6.1.\n\n【46】Firstly, associations between MDD diagnosis (binary) and number of depressive items reported DS (ordinal) in adolescents and brain structural measures were tested using a General Linear Model (GLM, ‘glm’ function) or Linear Mixed-effect model (LME, ‘lme’ function) \\[ \\] in R. For unilateral brain measures, a GLM was used. For bilateral brain measures, an LME model was used with hemisphere set as a repeated measure \\[ \\]. Covariates included age, age <sup>2 </sup> , sex, ethnicity, study site, recent social deprivation and additional imaging covariates: head motion (data field: ‘fsqc\\_qu\\_motion’) and hemisphere for the LME models (see Table S5). To further test if current caregivers’ mood confounded associations between depression in adolescents and brain structural measures, we added ASR scores of caregivers as a covariate and compared the results with the main model.\n\n【47】The analyses of associations with brain structural measures followed a hierarchical order from global measures at the whole-brain level to individual structures. For cortical measures, this included whole brain cortical volume, mean thickness, total surface area, mean sulcal depth, followed by individual brain regions. For white matter microstructural measures (FA/MD), the global ‘g’ measures were first tested, followed by individual tracts. The _p_ values were corrected using family-wise error correction with the FDR (false discovery rate) method \\[ \\], using the ‘p.adjust’ function in _R_ . This was applied for each brain measure category and each reporter separately.\n\n【48】In addition to the main models, we conducted analyses on the mean and discrepancy of DS reported by caregivers and children. Average reports and discrepancies for DS was generated for each child-caregiver pair. Results for the associations between the average severity and general/regional brain measures are shown in the Supplementary Information.\n\n【49】We conducted sensitivity analyses to test potential confounding effects of MRI sites, scanner manufacturers and anti-depressant use in the adolescents (methods and results reported in the Supplementary Information).\n\n【50】To examine origins of the discrepancy of report, we tested which socio-environmental factors were associated with the discrepancy. _R_ function ‘kappa2’ from package ‘irr’ was used to estimate Cohen's Kappa for testing agreement between caregiver and child reports ( https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/irr/versions/0.84.1 ). GLM models were used and covariates kept consistent with models above with the exception of removing imaging covariates (methods reported in Supplementary Information). As these measures were more likely to be independent tests rather than correlated (e.g. brain structural measures), we applied Bonferroni-correction \\[ \\].\n\n【51】The current study adheres to the STROBE reporting guidelines.

Results\n-----------\n\n【55】### 3.1 Major depressive disorder (MDD), depressive symptoms (DS) and brain measures\n\n【56】Description of individuals meeting criteria for MDD and reporting DS at mild level and above by both parent (MDD: _N_ \\= 194 (2.82%), DS: _N_ \\= 654 (7.57%) and child (MDD: _N_ \\= 180 (2.60%), DS: _N_ \\= 687 (7.98%)) are reported in Table 1 . For caregiver report, youth who had DS of mild, moderate and severe type were 0.69% ( _N_ \\= 60), 4.47% ( _N_ \\= 386), and 2.41% ( _N_ \\= 208), respectively. For child self-report, individuals reporting mild, moderate and severe DS were 0.69% ( _N_ \\= 59), 4.91% _(N_ \\= 423), and 2.38% ( _N_ \\= 205), respectively.\n\n【57】### 3.2 Global imaging metrics\n\n【58】_Caregiver report:_ Global results are shown in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1. MDD diagnosis for the child as reported by caregivers was associated with significantly lower total cortical volume (Cohen's _d_ \\= −0⋅022, _p_ \\= 0⋅013) and global FA (Cohen's _d_ \\= −0⋅027, _p_ \\= 7⋅96 × 10 <sup>−4 </sup> ). Increasing summary measures of DS reported by caregivers were associated with decreased total cortical volume (β = −0⋅037, _p_ \\= 5⋅18 × 10 <sup>−5 </sup> ), total surface area (β = −0⋅034, _p_ \\= 1⋅41 × 10 <sup>−4 </sup> ) and global FA (β = −0⋅023, _p_ \\= 4⋅06 × 10 <sup>−3 </sup> ).\n\n【59】Fig. 1 Associations between Major depressive disorder (MDD), depressive symptoms (DS) and general measures of cortical and white-matter structures.

In general, the associations were weaker than the above reports by caregivers, with fewer significant associations (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). MDD diagnosis based on child report was significantly associated with increased cortical sulcal depth (Cohen's _d_ \\= 0⋅020, _p_ \\= 0⋅040) and lower global FA (Cohen's _d_ \\= −0⋅018, _p_ \\= 0⋅022), and DS were associated with lower total cortical volume (β = −0⋅027, _p_ \\= 2⋅93 × 10 <sup>−3 </sup> ), smaller total surface area (β = −0⋅020, _p_ \\= 0⋅022) and greater sulcal depth (β = 0⋅023, _p_ \\= 0⋅023).\n\n【62】### 3.3 Regional brain metrics\n\n【63】_Caregiver report:_ Regional results are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 and Supplementary Data 2–5. For cortical measures, MDD diagnosis-based reports by caregivers was associated with reduced volumes of the caudal middle frontal lobe, entorhinal cortex, superior frontal lobe, superior temporal lobe, and temporal pole (Cohen's d range: −0⋅019 to −0⋅029, p <sub>FDR </sub> range: 0⋅043 to 0⋅012). Volumes in caudal middle frontal lobe and superior frontal lobe were also associated with DS, along with volumes in other regions that include inferior parietal lobe, middle temporal lobe and precentral gyrus (β range: −0⋅019 to −0⋅024, p <sub>FDR </sub> range: 0⋅041 to 0⋅012). Smaller surface area of similar regions was associated with higher DS, which include caudal middle frontal lobe, inferior parietal lobe, middle temporal lobe and superior frontal lobe (β range: −0⋅020 to −0⋅024, p <sub>FDR </sub> range: 0⋅049 to 0⋅013). Sulcal depth of rostral anterior cingulate was also associated with higher DS (β = 0⋅029, p <sub>FDR </sub> \\= 0⋅004).\n\n【64】Fig. 2 _P_ \\-value plots for associations between depressive symptoms and measures for regional brain regions.

Increased DS were associated with reductions of white matter microstructural integrity in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, superior longitudinal fasciculus, parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus, superior cortico-striate tract (β range: −0⋅021 to −0⋅026, p <sub>FDR </sub> range: 0⋅045 to 0⋅021).\n\n【73】_Child report:_ The only significant association between reports by children and individual brain regions was for surface area of transverse temporal and MDD diagnosis (Cohen's _d_ \\= 0⋅027, p <sub>FDR </sub> \\= 0⋅019). No significant association was found for white matter microstructural measures (p <sub>FDR </sub> \\> 0⋅116).\n\n【74】### 3.4 The association between adolescent MDD, DS and brain measures controlling for mood of caregivers\n\n【75】We conducted an additional sensitivity analysis to test if associations between caregiver reports of MDD/DS in the children remained significant after controlling for measures of current depression in the caregivers. All associations remained significant for global brain measures (Fig. S5). Results for single brain regions can be found in Figs. S6–7. Overall results with and without controlling for ratings on depressive scale in caregivers showed high correlation (across all association tests between individual brain measures and MDD/depression symptoms reported by children and caregivers, _r_ \\= 0.996 for standardised effect sizes, _r_ \\= 0.984 for _p_ \\-values, see Fig. S8). For those associations that were significant without controlling for mood of caregivers, all remained in the same direction and 90.3% remained significant after FDR-correction.\n\n【76】Additional sensitivity analyses indicated results remained significant after controlling for medication (in child) and were consistent across sites/scanner (see Supplementary Information, Figs. S9–16). Findings also remained robust (in terms of comparison to the other caregiver report results) after controlling for the magnitude of reporter discrepancy (see Figs. S17–19).\n\n【77】### 3.5 Discrepancy between caregiver and child report of depressive symptoms and associations with socio-environmental factors\n\n【78】A significant but low agreement of DS was observed between child and caregiver reports of depression in the child (unweighted Cohen's Kappa = 0.06, _p_ \\= 5⋅29 × 10 <sup>−12 </sup> ). See Fig. S4. Among the caregiver-child pairs, 92 pairs showed large discrepancy (one reported severe DS and the other none), 705 showed moderate discrepancy (discrepancy = two levels) and 7802 pairs showed low or no discrepancy (discrepancy <= one level, contains 7408 pairs that both reported DS lower than mild). Additional analyses that examined reporter discrepancy across different KSADS items indicated a heterogenous pattern of reporter discrepancy across the entire range of diagnostic items. See Fig. S20.\n\n【79】Greater discrepancy in caregiver and child report of DS was positively associated with sleep disturbance and family conflict reported by caregivers on children, and family conflict and school disengagement reported by children (β range: 0⋅060 to 0⋅169, p <sub>Bonferroni </sub> range: 2⋅31 × 10 <sup>−5 </sup> to 5⋅26 × 10 <sup>−18 </sup> ). Greater agreement, reflected by negative associations, was found with increased neighbourhood safety and prosocial behaviour of children reported by caregivers, as well as acceptance by caregiver/parent and secondary caregiver, school environment, school involvement and caregiver/parent monitoring reported by children (β range: −0⋅048 to −0⋅096, p <sub>Bonferroni </sub> range: 3⋅86 × 10 <sup>−7 </sup> to 9⋅15 × 10 <sup>−56 </sup> ). See Fig. 4 .\n\n【80】Fig. 4 Associations between socio-environmental factors and absolute discrepancies of caregiver and child reports on DS.

Discussion\n--------------\n\n【83】The current study leverages the largest available sample to report brain structural differences and their association with caregiver and child reports of depression in early adolescence. We demonstrated that MDD and DS (as reported by caregivers) were associated with similar imaging findings as seen in adult samples, including reduced global cortical volume and global fractional anisotropy (FA) (MDD: Cohen's d range: −0⋅022 to −0⋅027, DS: β range: −0⋅029 to −0⋅057). Our findings also suggest that surface area differences, which have been less consistently reported in adult studies, may be a feature of depressive symptoms in adolescents. Reports of depression in children given by caregivers consistently demonstrated stronger associations with cortical structure and white matter microstructure compared to child report. Finally, reporter discrepancy was positively associated with family conflict and school disengagement (β range: 0⋅060 to 0⋅169). Higher levels of prosocial behaviour in both school and family environments were linked to lower reporter discordance (β range: −0⋅048 to −0⋅096). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that our results were not related to potential confounders such as anti-depressant medication use (child and caregiver) and scanner and site differences.\n\n【84】Along with the global cortical and white matter differences described above, we also report regionally reduced white matter microstructural integrity in fronto-limbic circuits such as the superior longitudinal fasciculus and cortico-striate tract. This is consistent with previous large scale, population-based studies in adult MDD suggesting that aberrant patterns of white-matter microstructure are present at the early stages of the disease \\[ \\]. Reduced microstructural integrity in these association fibres has been previously found to be related to compromised cognitive control, which may underpin clinical features of depression \\[ , , \\].\n\n【85】The present investigation also found reduced cortical surface area in adolescents with depression, globally and regionally, including a diffuse pattern of localised surface area deficits (MDD: Cohen's _d_ \\= −0⋅021, DS: β = −0⋅066), but not in cortical thickness. Notably, unlike the overall pattern of results, surface area reductions are less commonly reported in adult depression compared to cortical thickness reductions \\[ \\]. This therefore implies that surface area reductions may be specifically related to onset and risk factors of depression in early life stages. Similar findings were also shown in another cohort study looking at older adolescents by Schmaal et al. \\[ \\]. While not as commonly reported in adult populations as cortical thickness, surface area reductions have shown to be genetically correlated with MDD \\[ \\] and are associated with early risk factors of MDD, such as early life trauma and low birth weight \\[ , \\]. Regions that demonstrate cortical surface area abnormalities, such as the precentral gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus, and the superior frontal gyrus may be more vulnerable to the effects of delayed maturation in adolescent depression due to reduced synaptic pruning and dendritic growth over this period \\[ , \\]. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the origin and development of depression-related, surface area brain features during adolescence and across the life course.\n\n【86】Similarities were observed in the association between depression and brain measures across caregiver and child reports. For example, DS from both reports was significantly associated with global cortical volume (caregiver: β = −0⋅037; child: β = −0⋅027) and surface area (caregiver: β = −0⋅034; child: β = −0⋅020), while MDD status was associated with decreased whole brain FA (caregiver: β = −0⋅030; child: Cohen's _d_ \\= −0⋅021). The effect sizes were similar to those found in adults \\[ \\]. However, the current study also revealed that reports of depression by caregivers on adolescents demonstrated stronger and more numerous associations with brain structural measures than by adolescent self-report. These were not biased by medication or by current mood of the caregivers themselves. A difficulty in the diagnosis of depression in adolescents is the integration of reports from both caregivers and adolescents \\[ , \\]. Although we found agreement between caregiver and child reports across individual depressive items, there were indications of important differences. In line with previous work \\[ , , \\], internalising and somatic type symptoms (e.g., self-esteem, guilt) were more commonly reported by child than caregiver, while decreased concentration and functional impairments were reported more by caregiver than child. Given the stronger neuroimaging associations found for caregiver report of depression, we consider that cognitive and functional impairments may be more strongly connected with these early neurobiological changes — these hypotheses should be tested in future work.\n\n【87】Depressive symptoms reported by caregivers and children showed significant but low correlation, and caregiver's report showed greater associations with brain structural measures. Our findings demonstrate that divergences in origins of reporting relate to environmental and societal factors such as family conflict and social cohesion \\[ \\]. These findings reveal the importance of a supportive environment in defining caregiver-child reporter differences; factors such as child-perceived parental support and acceptance also imply secure attachment styles \\[ \\]. It is possible that contextual associations between environmental factors and reporter discrepancy may be associated with developmental processes specific to adolescents. Therefore, whilst we cannot completely exclude possible contributions of broader socio-environmental factors, we consider it unlikely that current socio-economic status was driving our main neuroimaging findings, as we have controlled for these in our main analysis. Future longitudinal work should examine the neurobiological consequences of these external societal factors to better understand their role in the origins of the disorder, as well as the potential for environmental intervention.\n\n【88】Although this study benefits from the large imaging sample size, there are limitations. The ABCD cohort is currently a cross-sectional sample. Longitudinal research is needed to facilitate investigating causal effects in these relationships and to inform case-control differences in developmental courses. Further, MDD diagnosis was unavailable in the current data release (2.0.1) for ∼20% of participants due to the inclusion of subclinical participants that did not reach criteria for case or control categorisation (as conducted by ABCD study team). Additional analysis however suggests minimal bias between individuals with and without this missing data (see Table S1 in the Supplementary Information for further detail). Missing data will remain a challenge for community-based population cohorts like ABCD and its treatment will warrant important consideration going forward. While the current study uses both a binary and continuous measure of depression, depressive symptoms are notably highly heterogeneous \\[ \\]. This heterogeneity can have pronounced research and clinical implications; for example, individual symptoms may differentially impact impairment of psychosocial functioning \\[ \\], and distinctive patterns for longitudinal trajectory of individual symptoms may have heterogeneous underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Future work should examine depressive symptom heterogeneity in the context of brain structure especially during adolescence when subclinical symptoms may manifest, and uncertainties exist around subsequent formal diagnoses.\n\n【89】Although we appreciate the above determinants of heterogeneity for depression, it is important to focus on the neurobiological associations directly linked with the overall diagnosis and severity as a first step, given that disease prediction using neuroimaging phenotypes are predominantly trained and investigated in adult samples \\[ , , \\]. The present findings on the early origins of depression showed distinctive patterns compared to results from adults, which provides strong rationale for separating investigations on diagnosis for adolescence depression, as well as its prediction and treatment. Further, the current findings were generally robust against influence from comorbidity. However, some associations, for example, those found in general cortical grey matter measures, attenuated after controlling for comorbidity. Reasons for this may include shared genetic and environmental risk factors between major psychiatric disorders \\[ \\]. Future studies using genetic and epigenetic data may be able to interrogate cross-disorder associations more directly.\n\n【90】Small effect sizes found for the associations in the present study are likely to be contributed by the heterogeneity of disease manifestations and presentation of subtypes. Small effect sizes are a challenge in large neuroimaging research due to the small amount of variance explained by each individual variable \\[ , \\]. However, big data research also allows for the identification of subtle effects, and neurobiological associations with depression are indeed consistently small in large-sample studies \\[ , , , , \\]. These subtle effects may not be statistically detectable in small-scale studies, which also have the caveat of potentially inflated effect sizes due to sample selection bias \\[ \\]. However, the advent of machine learning techniques that examine multiple neuroimaging variables simultaneously in large multi-site studies holds promise of a move towards the identification of clinically relevant neuroimaging disease markers \\[ \\]. A further limitation is the young age of the adolescents in the current sample (aged 9–11). It is likely that the cascade of neurobiological changes associated with the onset of puberty may have a further significant impact on the neural circuits implicated in depression \\[ , \\]. Future research is needed to explore any interaction effects between pubertal development, brain measures, and depression in adolescents.\n\n【91】Our findings demonstrate similarities between adult and adolescent imaging features of depression which collectively suggest that cortical and white matter microstructural abnormalities are present early in the disease course of depression and that some of these may extend throughout the lifespan \\[ \\]. We demonstrate that these depression-related imaging features are not related to medication in this early adolescent sample. Our results also show evidence of decreased surface area, which may imply adolescent-specific vulnerability. Investigating the origins of these differences may further the understanding of the aetiology of depression over this highly sensitive neurodevelopmental period and thus, help identify at-risk youth. Future longitudinal studies may further inform causal relationships between depression during adolescence and brain structural development.\n\n【92】Contributors\n------------\n\n【93】XS, NM, LR and HCW were responsible for the project conceptualisation, methodology and validation.

Expert patients are those who take responsibility for the day-to-day decisions about their health, and who work with health-care providers as collaborators and partners to produce the best possible health given the resources at hand. Expert patients, especially those with chronic disorders, have been said to be not only consumers of health care but also producers of health. To be producers of health, patients ought to be provided with the education for this new role. At the same time health-care professionals must adjust their worldview as they become true health-care partners. With the publication of _The Expert Patient_ , England became the first country to undertake and fund a national initiative aimed at this fundamental change in the health care system.\n\n【1】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

The findings were consistent with those of their patient with hysterical paralysis. Although hypnosis and hysteria shared partially similar findings for motor paralysis, we cannot agree with their suggestion that the psychological mechanism underlying hypnotic phenomena provide a model for understanding and treating conversion hysteria symptoms. This model is insufficient for the following reasons.\n\n【2】First, the suggestions that produce hypnotic phenomena are usually administered by another individual, whereas the source of suggestions in hysteria lies primarily within the internal dynamics of the individual or in implicit societal and interinidividual processes. Moreover, hypnotic phenomena are conventionally short-lived and are contained within hypnotic context, whereas conversion symptoms are usually of much longer duration. These differences suggest that conversion symptoms, but not hypnotic phenomena, may result from the primary lesions which continuously and automatically enhances (or cannot suppress) the production of symptoms.\n\n【3】Second, Spence and colleagues have reported that left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex hypofunction was common to all patients with hysteria when they moved an affected limb, irrespective of symptom lateralisation, and that right prefrontal hypofunction characterised feigned disorder of either side. Although we acknowledge that the tasks of the two studies <sup>, </sup> differed somewhat, Halligan and colleagues' findings of activation in the right orbito-frontal and anterior cingulate cortex are not consistent with those of hysterical patients. Rather, from the viewpoint of laterality, their findings (abnormality in right cortex) are most consistent with those of feigners.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}

The aim of DUET-2 is to examine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of TMC125 in treatment-experienced patients.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In this continuing randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial, HIV-1-infected patients on failing antiretroviral therapy with evidence of resistance to currently available NNRTIs and at least three primary protease inhibitor mutations were eligible for enrolment if on stable (8 weeks unchanged) antiretroviral therapy with plasma HIV-1 RNA greater than 5000 copies per mL. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either TMC125 (200 mg) or placebo, each given twice daily with darunavir-ritonavir, investigator-selected nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and optional enfuvirtide. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with confirmed viral load below 50 copies per mL at week 24 (FDA time-to-loss of virological response algorithm). Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00255099.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】591 patients were randomised and treated (295 patients in the TMC125 group and 296 in the placebo group). By week 24, 51 (17%) patients in the TMC125 group and 73 (25%) in the placebo group had discontinued, mainly because of virological failure. 183 (62%) patients in the TMC125 group and 129 (44%) in the placebo group achieved confirmed viral load below 50 copies per mL at week 24 (difference 18%, 95% CI 11–26; p=0·0003). The type and frequency of adverse events were much the same in the two groups.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In treatment-experienced patients, treatment with TMC125 led to better virological suppression at week 24 than did placebo. The safety and tolerability profile of TMC125 was generally comparable with placebo.\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【15】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?
