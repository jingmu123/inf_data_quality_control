This conclusion is based on their analysis of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or cardiac arrest. Because there were only 17 cardiac arrests, this combined endpoint was dominated by death or myocardial infarction. Although the avoidance of myocardial infarction is undoubtedly laudable, precise estimation of the magnitude of this benefit, especially in the era of micro-infarctions characterised only by slight troponin rises, is nevertheless difficult.\n\n【2】Examination of the harder endpoint of cardiovascular death shows a nonsignificant benefit of 4·1% in the perindopril group compared with 3·5% in the placebo group. The number needed to treat to save one life is 167 patients for 4 years. The data are even compatible with one excess cardiovascular death for every 800 patients treated. Notwithstanding this slender benefit, there is a tsunami of publicity, at least in and around our institution, to encourage the widespread prescription of this medication. I believe it would be more appropriate to explain to patients, in clear absolute terms, the potential benefits of this treatment so that they can make their own informed choices. I suspect that more than a few would decline this treatment, reasoning that it represents overmedicalisation.\n\n【3】In Canada, perindopril costs about $60 (US$45) per month, or more than $450 000 (US$340 000) per life saved.

Concerns regarding the implications of long-term combination therapy provided the rationale for a formal clinical trial of treatment de-escalation. Our aim was to compare the relapse rate and the time spent in remission over 2 years between patients continuing combination therapy and those stopping infliximab or immunosuppressant therapy.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was performed in 64 hospitals in seven countries in Europe and Australia. Adult patients with Crohn's disease in steroid-free clinical remission for more than 6 months, on combination therapy of infliximab and immunosuppressant therapy for at least 8 months were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either continue combination therapy (combination group), discontinue infliximab (infliximab withdrawal group), or discontinue immunosuppressant therapy (immunosuppressant withdrawal group). Randomisation was stratified according to disease duration before start of first anti-TNF treatment (≤2 or >2 years), failure of immunosuppressant therapy before start of infliximab, and presence of ulcers at baseline endoscopy. The patient number and group of each stratum were assigned by a central online randomisation website. Treatment was optimised or resumed in case of relapse in all groups. Participants, those assessing outcomes, and those analysing the data were not masked to group assignment. The coprimary endpoints were the relapse rate (superiority analysis) and time in remission over 2 years (non-inferiority analysis, non-inferiority margin 35 days). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis.删除1-2:<u> This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02177071, and with EU Clinical Trials Register, EUDRACT 2014-002311-41.</u> The trial was completed in April, 2021.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between Nov 2, 2015, and April 24, 2019, 254 patients were screened. Of these, 211 were randomised and 207 were included in the final analysis (n=67 in the combination group, n=71 in the infliximab withdrawal group, and n=69 in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group). 39 patients had a relapse (eight \\[12%\\] of 67 in the combination group, 25 \\[35%\\] of 71 in the infliximab withdrawal group, six \\[9%\\] of 69 in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group). 2-year relapse rates were 14% (95% CI 4–23) in the combination group, 36% (24–47) in the infliximab withdrawal group, and 10% (2–18) in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group (hazard ratio \\[HR\\] 3·45 \\[95% CI 1·56–7·69\\], p=0·003, for infliximab withdrawal _vs_ combination, and 4·76 \\[1·92–11·11\\], p=0·0004, for infliximab withdrawal _vs_ immunosuppressant withdrawal). Of 28 patients who had a relapse and were retreated or optimised according to protocol, remission was achieved in 25 patients (one of two in the combination group, 22 of 23 in the infliximab withdrawal group, and two of three in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group). The mean time spent in remission over 2 years was 698 days (95% CI 668–727) in the combination group, 684 days (651–717) in the infliximab withdrawal group, and 706 days (682–730) in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group. The difference in restricted mean survival time in remission was –14 days (95% CI –56 to 27) between the infliximab withdrawal group and the combination group and –22 days (–62 to 16) between the infliximab withdrawal group and the immunosuppressant withdrawal group. The 95% CIs contained the non-inferiority threshold (–35 days). We recorded 31 serious adverse events, in 20 patients, with no difference in frequency between groups. The most frequent serious adverse events were infections (four in the combination group, two in the infliximab withdrawal group, and one in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group) and Crohn's disease exacerbation (three in the combination group, four in the infliximab withdrawal group, and one in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group). No death nor malignancy was recorded.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In patients with Crohn's disease in sustained steroid-free remission under combination therapy with infliximab and immunosuppressant therapy, withdrawal of infliximab should only be considered after careful assessment of risks and benefits for each patient, whereas withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy could generally represent a preferable strategy when considering treatment de-escalation.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】European Union's Horizon 2020.\n\n【10】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【11】Therapeutic strategies for Crohn's disease have evolved over the past decade with mounting evidence that achieving deep remission (defined as clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic remission) is associated with better long-term outcomes. Combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine has been shown to be superior to either infliximab or azathioprine monotherapy in achieving clinical remission and endoscopic healing in azathioprine-naive patients, thus supporting the paradigm of early disease management and the use of treatment combinations to increase treatment success. However, once remission is achieved, physicians and patients must weigh up the risks and benefits of continuing combination therapy with infliximab and an immunosuppressant (thiopurines or methotrexate). The risk of opportunistic or serious infections and of lymphoproliferative disorders is of particular concern, with consensus emerging that patients on combination therapy are at greater risk than those on monotherapy. Registry data suggest that de-escalation of drug therapy might reduce the risk of serious drug-related adverse events and might also provide cost savings. By contrast, the risk of disease relapse when discontinuing one or both drugs, or the risk of immunogenicity when discontinuing immunosuppressant therapy and continuing infliximab, is unclear. A randomised trial comparing continuation of combination therapy versus immunosuppressant therapy withdrawal, did not show a higher rate of treatment failure in patients stopping the immunosuppressant therapy. In the prospective STORI cohort study the risk of relapse was 43·9% at 12 months after infliximab withdrawal in patients treated with combined maintenance therapy. However, limitations included the absence of a control group and, although infliximab retreatment was allowed, overall time spent in clinical remission over the study period was not assessed. A recent placebo-controlled trial comparing infliximab withdrawal with infliximab continuation in patients in full endoscopic remission confirmed a higher relapse rate in the infliximab withdrawal group (50% _vs_ 0). The role of concomitant immunosuppressant therapy was not specifically examined in that study.\n\n【12】We report the results of a randomised controlled trial comparing the relapse rate and time spent in remission over 2 years in patients with Crohn's disease in clinical remission under combination therapy who were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: continuation of combination therapy of infliximab and immunosuppressant therapy, or withdrawal of infliximab, or withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy.\n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】**Evidence before the study**\n\n【15】A treat-to-target strategy and tight disease control have been shown to improve outcomes in Crohn's disease. However, this approach might necessitate long-term use of both biological drugs and immunosuppressant therapy. Combination therapy of anti-TNFα with either thiopurines or methotrexate is well established in this context but is associated with long-term risks and health-care costs. It is not well established whether treatment de-escalation from combination therapy, once sustained steroid-free remission has been achieved, is feasible, nor whether this approach could improve safety and reduce costs without jeopardising disease control. Infliximab withdrawal in patients with Crohn's disease in sustained steroid-free remission has been associated with an increased risk of relapse approximating 50% over 2 years in uncontrolled studies. These studies also provided evidence that remission can be recaptured in most patients by resuming treatment with infliximab, in particular when immunosuppressant therapy had been continued. Other uncontrolled data have concluded that withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy in patients who had achieved durable remission on combination therapy might not alter relapse rates.\n\n【16】**Added value of the study**\n\n【17】In this randomised controlled study, we confirmed and quantified the increased risk of relapse and loss of time in remission in patients on combination therapy who were randomly assigned to discontinue infliximab, compared with those randomly assigned to continue infliximab in the context of either monotherapy or combination therapy. We demonstrated that immunosuppressant therapy withdrawal was not associated with an increased risk of relapse, nor of drug immunogenicity. We defined risk factors for relapse and for failure of therapy if patients were de-escalated from combination therapy. We also demonstrated that most patients experiencing relapse after infliximab withdrawal rapidly responded to re-treatment and maintained remission over 2 years.\n\n【18】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【19】In patients with Crohn's disease receiving combination infliximab and concomitant immunosuppressant therapy, strategies for treatment de-escalation can be considered in sustained steroid-free clinical remission after assessment of the risk of relapse and potential for effective re-treatment in each individual. Withdrawal of concomitant immunosuppressant therapy does not increase rates of disease relapse or anti-drug antibody formation in those continuing infliximab monotherapy. Withdrawal of infliximab is associated with an increased risk of relapse, but the effects of relapse can be effectively and rapidly treated in most patients. Treatment decisions should be tailored to each patient's circumstances to optimise the balance of potential benefit and harm.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Study design\n\n【22】SPARE was a multicentre, international, open-label, randomised controlled trial involving 64 hospitals in seven countries (Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, UK, Sweden). The aim of the trial was to compare three treatment strategies in patients with Crohn's disease who had achieved steroid-free clinical remission on combination therapy with infliximab and immunosuppressant therapy (thiopurine or methotrexate): continuing combination therapy; stopping infliximab and continuing immunosuppressant therapy as monotherapy; or stopping immunosuppressant therapy and continuing infliximab monotherapy. The study protocol was approved by the relevant ethics committees or institutional review boards of each country and was executed in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and applicable local regulations. Protocol deviations (eg, violations of inclusion or exclusion criteria or incorrect treatment or dose) were monitored at study entry and throughout the study. All protocol deviations were assessed in real time for their effect on data integrity and patient safety to determine whether the patient should continue in the study. The study duration was 104 weeks. Major changes in the protocol are explained in the appendix 删除2:<u>(p 1)</u> . Of these, a recalculation of the required sample size was made in November, 2018, following publication of the results of a Crohn's disease patient survey performed in France and in the USA, which provided new information on the acceptability to the patients of time spent with active disease to allow treatment de-escalation, in particular withdrawal of biologics or anti-metabolites, or both.\n\n【23】### Participants\n\n【24】To be eligible, all of the following criteria had to be met at recruitment: an established diagnosis of Crohn's disease, age 18 years or older, treatment with combination therapy with scheduled infliximab (5 mg/kg every 8 weeks over the past 4 months at least) and immunosuppressant therapy (stable dose for the past 3 months) for at least 8 months for luminal Crohn's disease, steroid-free clinical remission for at least 6 months according to retrospective assessment of the patients' medical files, Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) of less than 150 at baseline, and use of contraceptive during the whole study for female patients with childbearing potential. Patients gave written informed consent for the study.\n\n【25】Patients were eligible provided that immunosuppressant therapy doses were stable for the past 3 months or more at at least 1 mg/kg for mercaptopurine or 2 mg/kg for azathioprine, or the highest tolerated dose if intolerance to these standard doses; lower doses were also allowed if 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN) were higher than 235 pmol per 8 × 10 8 red blood cells. The minimum dose of methotrexate for eligibility was 15 mg per week subcutaneously.\n\n【26】Key exclusion criteria included previous severe acute or delayed infusion reaction to infliximab, perianal fistulae as the main indication for infliximab treatment, active perianal or intra-abdominal fistulae at inclusion defined by active drainage, steroid use within 6 months before screening, and ongoing treatment with steroids, immunosuppressive drugs (other than thiopurines or methotrexate), biologics (other than infliximab), or thalidomide.\n\n【27】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【28】Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to either continue combination therapy (combination group), discontinue infliximab and continue immunosuppressant therapy as monotherapy (infliximab withdrawal group), or discontinue immunosuppressant therapy and continue infliximab therapy as monotherapy (immunosuppressant withdrawal group). Randomisation was stratified according to disease duration before start of the first anti-TNF administration (≤2 years or >2 years), failure of immunosuppressant therapy before the start of infliximab, and presence of ulcers at baseline endoscopy. The patient number and group of each stratum were assigned by a central online randomisation website (Cleanweb). An independent statistician from the Biostatistics Unit of Saint-Louis Hospital (Paris, France) provided computer-generated assignment blocked randomisation lists with the use of a block size of six, unknown to the investigators. Information about allocation was given on the eCRF and confirmed by email. Participants, those assessing outcomes, and those analysing the data were not masked to group assignment.\n\n【29】### Procedures\n\n【30】The study design is shown in figure 1 . In the combination group, patients continued scheduled infliximab treatment and immunosuppressant therapy at the same dose as at inclusion. In case of relapse, infliximab dose was increased to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks. If remission was not achieved 4 weeks after the first 10 mg/kg infliximab infusion (CDAI <150), or if a new relapse occurred after starting the regimen of infliximab 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks, it was classified as treatment failure and the patient was discontinued from the study and treated according to the investigator's discretion. Patients randomly assigned to the infliximab withdrawal group discontinued infliximab and continued immunosuppressant therapy alone at the same dose as at inclusion. In case of relapse, the patient was retreated with an infusion of infliximab 5 mg/kg. If remission was not achieved 4 weeks later (CDAI <150), a second infusion of 10 mg/kg infliximab was administered. If remission was not achieved in an additional 4 weeks, it was considered as a treatment failure, and alternative treatment was instituted according to investigator's discretion. If remission was reached 4 weeks after the first or second reinfusion, infliximab was continued at 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks on a scheduled basis. If a new relapse occurred, the same protocol as in the combination group was applied. In the immunosuppressant withdrawal group, patients discontinued immunosuppressant therapy and continued infliximab alone at the same dose as at inclusion. If a relapse occurred, treatment was intensified as in the combination group. If remission was not recaptured 4 weeks after an infusion of infliximab 10 mg/kg (CDAI <150) or if the patient experienced further relapse under infliximab 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks, immunosuppressant therapy was restarted at the same dose as before inclusion in the trial. If remission was not recaptured 16 weeks later (or earlier in case of disease worsening defined by a further increase of the CDAI of at least 70 points—as compared with the latest relapse visit—or CDAI >300), it was considered as a treatment failure and the treatment was instituted according to investigator's discretion. Infliximab drug levels and anti-drug antibodies (antibodies to infliximab) were determined for secondary endpoints but were not used for treatment optimisation, given the variability in available assays and absence of well-defined thresholds to direct treatment at the time the study was designed.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Study design</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【31】\\*Indicates that colonoscopy was done at that timepoint.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【32】Study visits were planned every 8 weeks for 104 weeks (end of study visit). The end of study visit took place earlier in case of early study termination. In case of relapse, the end of study visit occurred between week 100 and week 108, at the date closest to week 104. At each visit, patients underwent clinical examination; recording of adverse events; CDAI calculation; quality-of-life assessment by EQ-5D, Short Health Scale, and disability index; and routine blood tests. At baseline and at each study visit, blood samples were obtained for central measurement of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), infliximab levels, and anti-infliximab antibodies, and a stool sample was collected for faecal calprotectin measurement. An ileo-colonoscopy was performed at baseline and end of study visit with assessment by the local investigator of ulcers and measurement of Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS), and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD). In addition, magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) was also performed at baseline and end of study visit. A pelvic MRI was performed in patients with previous history of perianal fistulising disease.\n\n【33】Infliximab levels and anti-infliximab antibodies were determined by TNF-coated ELISA and by the anti-lambda drug-tolerant ELISA, respectively, as previously described. All samples were centrally analysed in the Gastro-immunology Laboratory of Sheba Medical Center, Israel. Faecal calprotectin was centrally measured by a particle enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay (Bühlmann fCAL turbo test, Bühlmann, Switzerland); hsCRP was centrally measured by immunoturbidimetric assay (Alinity C, Abbott, USA).\n\n【34】### Outcomes\n\n【35】There were two coprimary endpoints. The first was relapse rate over 2 years, analysed for superiority. Relapse was defined by a CDAI of 250 or higher at any visit or a CDAI between 150 and 250 with an increase of at least 70 points, over two consecutive visits 1 week apart, and a CRP higher than 5 mg/L or a faecal calprotectin higher than 250 μg/g. A new or reopened perianal or entero-cutaneous fistula, an intra-abdominal abscess (size ≥3 cm) or a perianal abscess (size ≥2 cm), and an episode of intestinal obstruction confirmed by imaging and requiring hospital admission were also considered as relapse.\n\n【36】The second coprimary endpoint was the mean restricted time spent in remission during the 104 study weeks, analysed for non-inferiority. For patients who relapsed, this time was computed from the day of randomisation until relapse, and added to the time spent in first and subsequent regained remissions (CDAI <150). Patients failing to recapture remission or fulfilling other definitions of treatment failure terminated the trial and were considered not to be in remission for the remaining weeks of the study (except for the failures linked to treatment side-effects who were censored at the time of failure).\n\n【37】Treatment failure was defined as not achieving remission after treatment escalation for relapse according to the protocol, or any major treatment side-effect leading to treatment cessation, or occurrence of an intra-abdominal abscess (size ≥3 cm) or a perianal abscess (size ≥2 cm), or occurrence of intestinal obstruction requiring surgical resection or endoscopic dilatation.\n\n【38】The main secondary endpoints were: time to relapse from date of randomisation, factors associated with time to relapse, treatment failure rate, time to treatment failure from date of randomisation and factors associated with time to treatment failure, sustained steroid-free remission (defined as CDAI <150 for all trial visits and no steroid use; patients discontinuing the trial for any reason before week 104 were not considered in sustained steroid-free remission), changes between baseline and end of study visit in hsCRP, faecal calprotectin, CDEIS, SES-CD, infliximab trough levels, and anti-infliximab antibodies. The following additional secondary endpoints are not presented in the present manuscript because they are still being analysed: progression of bowel damage, time to relapse according to CRP and calprotectin value, change in the disability score, health-related quality of life, direct and indirect costs, change in blood hsCRP and faecal calprotectin, change in infliximab trough levels and anti-infliximab antibodies, and correlations between a series of biomarkers (proteomics, glycomics, DNA methylation, miRNA, metagenomics), in the three groups of the study.\n\n【39】Adverse events were monitored in all randomised patients during the whole study. Serious adverse events (death, life-threatening hospitalisation and prolongation of hospitalisation, congenital anomaly, spontaneous or elective abortion, significant disability, medical event requiring medical or surgical intervention to prevent serious outcome) were recorded. Adverse events were tabulated by system organ class and preferred term, using the MedDRA dictionary (version 19.0). Incidence and severity of acute or delayed infliximab infusion reactions were assessed according to the Ring and Messmer classification.\n\n【40】### Statistical analysis\n\n【41】The working hypotheses for the two coprimary endpoints were: the relapse rate would be higher in the infliximab withdrawal group as compared with the combination group and the immunosuppressant withdrawal group, but the mean restricted time spent in remission would not be inferior in the infliximab withdrawal group as compared with the combination group and the immunosuppressant withdrawal group. The sample size computation was based on hypotheses around the coprimary endpoints, thus a Bonferroni correction of size 2 was considered to control a global alpha risk of 0·05. We assumed a 2-year relapse rate of 10% in the combination group _vs_ 50% in the infliximab withdrawal group, and 20% in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group on the basis of published results. Given a nominal type I error rate of 0·05 with a statistical power of 0·90, it was computed that 67 patients had to be recruited in each group. Concerning the mean restricted time spent in remission within the first 2 years, a simulation study was conducted under the following assumptions: in the combination group, the first relapse would occur within 2 years in 10% of the patients; the time to relapse would be exponentially distributed (that is, relapse occurs similarly whatever the time spent since randomisation), using the assumed 2-year relapse rate as stated above; 50% of relapses would achieve secondary remission and a second relapse would occur in 50% of these secondary remitters over the rest of the follow-up. Based on these simulated data, the mean time spent in remission restricted at the first 2 years was expected to be 694 days with a standard deviation of 37 days in the combination group. When we designed the trial, the hypothesis was that a threshold of 3% of time over 2 years would be clinically meaningful and that a treatment strategy could be considered as non-inferior below this threshold. According to the results of a patients' survey, performed after the start of the SPARE trial, the majority of the patients (>50%) would accept a difference in restricted mean time spent in remission of 35 days over 2 years (that is, 5% of the mean observed in the combination group). Hence, in an amendment to the protocol, we chose a 35 days threshold as a maximal margin to demonstrate non-inferiority in mean difference. For this, based on one-sided 97·5% CI, a sample size of 30 patients in each group was necessary, smaller than that calculated for the relapse rate endpoint. Thus, considering 10% of lost to follow up or drop out (not reaching protocol judgement criteria), we planned to enrol 225 patients in the trial.\n\n【42】Continuous variables are summarised as median (IQRs) and categorical variables as counts (%).\n\n【43】Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. All the patients who had undergone randomisation were analysed in the group they were allocated to. For the primary endpoints, the patients leaving the trial for other reasons than a relapse were censored at the time of drop out, as usually performed in time-to-event analyses. For the secondary endpoint concerning the proportion of patients in steroid-free sustained remission, patients leaving the trial early were considered as not being in sustained steroid-free remission.\n\n【44】Comparisons between groups were performed only to compare the combination group versus the infliximab withdrawal group, and the infliximab withdrawal group versus the immunosuppressant withdrawal group. Failure-free survival and relapse-free survival were estimated by Kaplan–Meier estimators with 95% CIs. Survival curves were tested using log-rank tests. Factors associated with failure-free survival and relapse-free survival were assessed using Cox models. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs were computed. Multivariable analyses were performed including all factors significantly associated with failure-free survival and relapse-free survival. Mean restricted event times in remission were estimated and compared using the survRM2 R-package. Differences were computed with 95% CIs using bootstrapping with 1000 replications. For secondary outcomes, differences between groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test for quantitative variables and Fisher exact test for qualitative variables. No correction for multiple testing for secondary outcomes was applied.

Four patients in the combination group withdrew consent immediately after randomisation and were not included in the analysis. Patient characteristics in the three groups were similar at baseline 删除2:<u>( table 1 )</u>. There were 45 patients classified as early terminations within the study. The reasons were: treatment failure as defined per protocol before week 100 and without subsequent follow-up (n=22; six in the combination group, five in the infliximab withdrawal group, and 11 in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group), patient's decision (n=10; five in the combination therapy group, four in the infliximab withdrawal group, and one in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group), physician's decision (n=4; two in the combination therapy group, one in each of the other groups), pregnancy (n=2; both in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group), loss of follow-up (n=2; both in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group); and one visit was missing and the latest visit was performed between 90 and 99 weeks (n=5; one in the combination therapy group, three in the infliximab withdrawal group, and one in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group). There were 11 major protocol deviations. Seven occurred in patients who did not have a relapse: infliximab optimisation to 10 mg/kg every 8 weeks despite absence of confirmed relapse (four in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group and one in the combination group); and restarting infliximab despite absence of confirmed relapse (two in the infliximab withdrawal group). Four occurred in patients who relapsed but were not retreated according to protocol (one in the combination therapy group, two in the infliximab withdrawal group and one in the immunosuppressant withdrawal group).\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 Trial profile</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【49】Reasons for a follow-up duration shorter than 2 years (<100 weeks, per protocol) in the trial were: Combination group: treatment failure (n=6), patient's decision (n=5), physician's decision (n=2), and last follow-up visit performed too early (n=1); infliximab withdrawal group: treatment failure (n=5), physician decision (n=1), patient's decision (n=4), and last follow-up visit performed too early (n=3); immunosuppressant withdrawal group: treatment failure (n=11), physician's decision (n=1), patient's decision (n=1), last follow-up visit performed too early (n=1), lost to follow-up (n=2), and pregnancy (n=2).\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【50】Table 1 Baseline characteristics\n\n|  |  | **Combination group (n=67)** | **Infliximab withdrawal group (n=71)** | **Immunosuppressant withdrawal group (n=69)** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age at randomisation (years) | Age at randomisation (years) | 36 (27–45·5) | 32 (25–42·5) | 31 (26–44) |\n| Gender | Gender | Gender | Gender | Gender |\n|  | Male | 37 (55%) | 43 (61%) | 38 (55%) |\n|  | Female | 30 (45%) | 28 (39%) | 31 (45%) |\n| Disease duration (years) | Disease duration (years) | 6·4 (3·2–12·7) | 6·7 (3·3–10·7) | 6·8 (2·9–12·6) |\n| Smoking status | Smoking status | Smoking status | Smoking status | Smoking status |\n|  | Never smoker | 36 (54%) | 45 (63%) | 39 (57%);

Conversely, discontinuing the immunosuppressant therapy did not affect the relapse rate. Retreatment with infliximab allowed rapid recapture and maintenance of remission in patients who relapsed, and treatment failure rates were similar across treatment groups. Despite this result, the non-inferiority hypothesis for the time spent in remission over 2 years after infliximab withdrawal was rejected. Alongside infliximab withdrawal, other predictors of relapse were young age at onset, and evidence of ongoing inflammation at baseline assessment.\n\n【78】A higher relapse rate after stopping infliximab in patients on combination therapy was expected in light of published data. The relapse rate in patients in the infliximab withdrawal group was slightly lower than in the STORI cohort, and also lower than that reported in a recent placebo-controlled Scandinavian study. This difference could be explained, at least in part, by the definition of relapse in the present study, which was based not only on CDAI but also on objective inflammatory markers (ie, hsCRP or faecal calprotectin). It is also worth noting that in the Scandinavian study, not all patients were on immunosuppressant therapy when stopping infliximab treatment.\n\n【79】Our working hypothesis upon study design was that, despite this increased risk of relapse, the time spent in remission over 2 years would not be inferior in patients discontinuing infliximab, anticipating a rapid recapture of remission when retreating them and no greater numbers of treatment failure. In patients discontinuing infliximab, retreatment was well tolerated and successful in almost all patients. The treatment failure rate over 2 years was similar and low (around 10%) in the three groups and the difference in the time spent in remission was only around 14 days over 2 years between patients stopping or continuing infliximab. However, the 95% CIs of the differences between study groups in time spent in remission included the non-inferiority threshold, and the non-inferiority hypothesis was thus rejected.\n\n【80】A series of other factors were also associated with relapse in multivariable analysis and should be mentioned: higher hsCRP, faecal calprotectin greater than 300 μg/g, and young age at onset (<17 years). Predictors such as higher CDEIS and SES-CD scores and elevated hsCRP and faecal calprotein levels have been reported in previous studies, notably in the STORI cohort. In the group of patients stopping infliximab, only a 6-TGN over 300 pmol per 8 × 10 8 red blood cells at baseline (which had not been studied in STORI) was a significant negative predictor for relapse, highlighting the key role of immunosuppressant therapy optimisation when withdrawing infliximab. Interestingly, the factors associated with treatment failure were different. They did not include infliximab withdrawal, or faecal calprotectin, but rather active smoking, stricturing behaviour, and elevated hsCRP. In patients randomly assigned to infliximab withdrawal, smoking was the only predictor of failure in the multivariable analysis. If confirmed, these predictors could be important as, in this setting, predicting failure might be more relevant than predicting a simple relapse.\n\n【81】Sustained clinical remission without steroids over 2 years was not significantly different between the three groups. The main reasons for not achieving sustained clinical remission without steroids were early withdrawal and fluctuating CDAI of 150 or higher, which were not systematically associated with a confirmed relapse.\n\n【82】There was no significant difference in change in endoscopic scores of activity, hsCRP, or faecal calprotectin between baseline and end of study visit across groups, suggesting no signal for any subclinical disease escape during these 2 years of treatment de-escalation. Infliximab trough levels at the end of the trial in the retreated patients were very similar to those observed at baseline. The relative stability of infliximab trough levels and low levels of anti-infliximab antibodies in this group might look surprising considering previous concerns regarding the risk of anti-infliximab antibody development and pharmacokinetic loss of response after episodic monotherapy therapy with infliximab. However, patients who discontinued infliximab were in long-term remission and maintained on immunosuppressant therapy after infliximab withdrawal, which are two parameters that have been previously associated with a low risk of immunogenicity. \n\n【83】The lack of a difference in relapse rate (and in changes between baseline and end of study in endoscopic scores, markers of inflammation, infliximab trough levels, and anti-infliximab antibodies) between patients continuing and those stopping immunosuppressant therapy when being on infliximab confirms the lack of clinical benefit of continuing immunosuppressant therapy in patients treated with infliximab for a median of more than 2 years. The clinical outcome is in agreement with a previous controlled study, but the data for changes in inflammatory markers and infliximab trough levels differs, and we point out that these results might not be extrapolatable to all patients treated with combination therapy of infliximab and immunosuppressant therapy for shorter periods of time.\n\n【84】Our study was not powered to identify differences in safety profiles accurately across the treatment groups, but no new safety signals were observed in any group. Interestingly, no acute infusion reaction was observed in the group of patients discontinuing infliximab and being retreated after a drug holiday period. This observation is consistent with the absence of development of anti-infliximab antibodies in that group and also with previous findings.\n\n【85】We acknowledge that our trial was limited by the absence of blinding. This limitation might have impacted the assessment of the primary endpoint based on CDAI variations. Indeed, subjective measures are included in CDAI, which could have been influenced by the knowledge of the administered treatment. Subjectivity of the endpoint was limited by the mandatory confirmation of relapse with one objective marker of inflammation (hsCRP or faecal calprotectin). Another limitation is the relatively low number of events, reducing accuracy in determining risk factors associated with either relapse or treatment failure. We also acknowledge some missing data for biomarkers, particularly faecal calprotectin at baseline and end of study, and endoscopy at end of study. Finally, although infliximab trough levels and anti-infliximab antibodies were measured for secondary endpoints in the trial, they were not used for treatment optimisation.\n\n【86】In conclusion, the results of the SPARE trial show that discontinuation of infliximab in patients on combination therapy is associated with an increase in the risk of relapse compared with patients continuing combination therapy and also with those switching to infliximab monotherapy. We were able to identify clinical characteristics of patients with high risk of relapse and failure. In the group of patients experiencing relapse, the large majority responded promptly to infliximab retreatment, so that the loss of time spent in remission was only 2–3 weeks over 2 years. These results provide information to help guide treatment decisions for clinicians and for patients on sustained remission under combination therapy with infliximab and immunosuppressant therapy. An informed decision on treatment de-escalation by withdrawing either infliximab or immunosuppressant therapy might be agreed, taking into account these findings together with patient preferences, clinical characteristics, and other factors including national health policy guidelines and economic considerations.\n\n【87】删除1-1:<u>For the **Cleanweb** see https://cleanweb.tentelemed.com/Ctms-cleanweb/portal/login?page\\_target=com.tentelemed.portal.pages.JumpBoardPage</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【88】EL, SA, J-FC, and EH conceived the trial and wrote the protocol.

To our knowledge, no systemic therapies for primary Sjögren's syndrome have shown efficacy. CD40–CD154-mediated T cell–B cell interactions in primary Sjögren's syndrome contribute to aberrant lymphocyte activation in inflamed tissue, leading to sialadenitis and other tissue injury. Therefore, we investigated the safety and preliminary efficacy of iscalimab (CFZ533), a novel anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody, in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept study took place at ten investigational sites across Europe (UK, n=4; Germany, Switzerland, and Hungary, n=1 each) and the USA (n=3). Eligible patients were aged 18–75 years and fulfilled the 2002 American European consensus group diagnostic classification criteria for primary Sjögren's syndrome. In the double-blind phase of the trial, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) via computer-generated unique randomisation numbers to receive subcutaneous iscalimab (3 mg/kg) or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8 (cohort 1) or intravenous iscalimab (10 mg/kg) or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8 (cohort 2). Randomisation was stratified according to baseline intake of oral corticosteroids. At week 12, patients in both cohorts received open-label iscalimab (same dose and route) for 12 weeks. The primary objectives of the study were to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of multiple doses of iscalimab in the two sequential dose cohorts. Safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse events and efficacy of iscalimab versus placebo was assessed by clinical disease activity, as measured by the change in European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's syndrome disease activity index (ESSDAI) score after 12 weeks of treatment. Analyses were done on a per-protocol basis.删除1-2:<u> The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT02291029.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between Oct 22, 2014, and June 28, 2016, we assessed 82 patients for eligibility (25 for cohort 1 and 57 for cohort 2). 38 patients were excluded because of ineligibility. In cohort 1, 12 patients were randomly assigned to receive either 3 mg/kg doses of iscalimab (n=8) or placebo (n=4), and in cohort 2, 32 patients were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous 10 mg/kg doses of iscalimab (n=21) or placebo (n=11). Adverse events were similar between iscalimab treatment groups and placebo groups, with adverse events occurring in all patients in cohort 1, and in 52% and 64% of the iscalimab and placebo groups, respectively, in cohort 2. Two serious adverse events were reported (one case of bacterial conjunctivitis in cohort 1 and one case of atrial fibrillation in cohort 2), which were unrelated to treatment with iscalimab. Intravenous treatment with iscalimab resulted in a mean reduction of 5·21 points (95% CI 0·96–9·46; one-sided p=0·0090) in ESSDAI score compared with placebo. There was no signficiant difference in ESSDAI score between subcutaneous iscalimab and placebo.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】To our knowledge, this is the first randomised, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept study of a new investigational drug for primary Sjögren's syndrome that indicates preliminary efficacy. Our data suggest a role of CD40–CD154 interactions in primary Sjögren's syndrome pathology and the therapeutic potential for CD40 blockade in this disease should be investigated further.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Novartis Pharma.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【11】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【12】Already registered?\n\n【13】Log in to existing account\n\n【14】Forgot password?\n\n【15】One-time access price info\n\n【16】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【17】Not yet registered?\n\n【18】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:27:52", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:28:55", "cost": 62.6}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:55", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:28:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:27:51"}

Search terms included but were not limited to “physical activity”, “exercise”, “aerobic exercise”, “blood pressure” and “hypertension”. Our first published meta-analysis suggested scarce evidence on the effects of exercise on blood pressure in younger adults and the observed pooled intervention effect on blood pressure reduction was short-term (6 months) and dominated by studies with complex interventions including exercise, dietary and weight loss components. Our second published meta-review indicated variation in blood pressure response to type of exercise and level of blood pressure and that the young adult age group remained under-investigated.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial to exclusively investigate effectiveness of aerobic exercise intervention to lower blood pressure in young adults. The study design removes the confounding of dietary and weight loss intervention observed in previous studies and provides resting and ambulatory blood pressure measures up to 1 year following exercise intervention in young adults.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】Aerobic exercise may not be a reliable first line intervention to target blood pressure reduction in young adults. The available evidence suggests need for personalisation of intervention with short-term tracking and refinement of lifestyle intervention dependent on blood pressure response. Overall, further research is required to improve understanding of how best to lower blood pressure in young adults.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Based on current guidelines, up to 40% of young adults may have elevated blood pressure and seek medical advice to optimise their health. Young adult blood pressure predicts future risk of cardiovascular events and, if untreated, up to 50% of those with elevated blood pressure may transition to hypertensive levels in as little as 5 years. The benefits of antihypertensive medications in young adults with elevated blood pressure are unclear and therefore first-line management is typically lifestyle intervention with advice to increase aerobic exercise. However, surprisingly, no trials have investigated whether aerobic exercise training is effective at lowering elevated blood pressure levels in young adults and recent expert meta-reviews have identified aerobic exercise may not be as effective for blood pressure control in early stages of hypertension. Our systematic review of exercise interventions for blood pressure identified a bias in recruitment towards adults over 40 years of age with an intervention effect dominated by complex behavioural trials that included weight loss and nutritional strategies. Young adult hypertension may have a distinct pathophysiology and risk factor profile to older adult hypertension and aerobic exercise training has been shown to increase vascular and sympathetic tone in younger people, which, paradoxically, might increase blood pressure. Furthermore, up to a third of young adults with elevated blood pressure report a distinct _in utero_ developmental history including preterm birth or pregnancy hypertension, which have been related to unique cardiovascular phenotypes. The Trial of Exercise to Prevent HypeRtension in young Adults (TEPHRA) randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted to determine whether moderate to high intensity aerobic exercise, supported by physical activity self-monitoring and motivational coaching, significantly lowers blood pressure in physically inactive young adults with elevated blood pressures and a range of birth histories compared with a control group signposted to hypertension and lifestyle education materials.\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Study design\n\n【23】The study was a single-centre, open, two-arm, parallel superiority randomized (1:1) controlled trial with open community-based recruitment. The study took place in the Cardiovascular Clinical Research Facility, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. The trial protocol and any subsequent amendments were approved by the University of Oxford as host institution and study Sponsor and the South Central Research Ethics Committee (REC) for the National Health Service Health Research Authority (NHS HRA) (Reference 16/SC/0016).\n\n【24】### Participants\n\n【25】Persons were eligible for inclusion if they were: 18 to 35 years old; had 24 h awake ambulatory systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure >115/75 mmHg, but <159/99 mmHg; had a body mass index <35 kg/m 2 ; were not on, and had not previously been prescribed, hypertension medications; had a verifiable birth history of preterm birth (<37 weeks) or full-term birth (≥37 weeks); and had the ability to access and use a computer and the internet. Participants could not take part: if they were pregnant; if they participated in structured exercise more than once per week or maintained high cardiovascular fitness; if they were unable to provide consent; had any contra-indications to exercise; were unable to walk briskly on the flat for 15 min; had any evidence of cardiomyopathy, inherited cardiac abnormalities or other significant cardiovascular disease. Participants were recruited through invitation from hospital birth registers, GP records, open recruitment, targeted online advertising via Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and invitation following participation in previous studies. Participants gave written informed consent. Enrolment occurred between June 30, 2016, and October 26, 2018; final follow-up January 9, 2020.\n\n【26】### Randomization and masking\n\n【27】Following completion of baseline study measures, participants were randomly assigned through minimisation with a probabilistic element using an online randomization program (Sealed Envelope™) to one of two groups in a 1:1 ratio – a control group or an aerobic training and physical activity intervention. Minimisation factors were sex, age (<24, 24–29, 30–35 years) and gestational age at birth (<32, 32–37, >37 weeks). Due to the nature of the intervention, participants and those delivering the intervention were not masked. The outcome assessors were not involved in randomisation or intervention delivery and remained blinded until after completion of final analysis.\n\n【28】### Procedures\n\n【29】Participants were asked to complete three aerobic training sessions per week, aiming for 60 min exercise at 60–80% peak heart rate measured at baseline. Participants were encouraged to attend supervised sessions offered by the study team. The intervention replicates strategies identified during systematic review of exercise intervention that reduced blood pressure in older age groups. The intervention team included physiologists, physiotherapists, clinical nurse specialists and a physician, all trained in motivational coaching. Participants were gifted a wrist-worn heart rate and activity monitor (Fitbit Charge HR) and encouraged to wear daily with a goal of 10,000 steps per day. Activity monitors support self-monitoring, goal setting and regular feedback, which have been identified as effective physical activity behaviour change strategies. On completion of 16 weeks of training, participants received a 60 min motivational coaching session. Participants were asked to reflect on their experience of physical activity and the aerobic exercise intervention and encouraged to set long-term physical activity goals. The coaching session explored confidence and motivation to maintain regular physical activity and encouraged participants to identify personalised strategies to achieve their goals and maintain cardiovascular fitness until 52-week follow-up. To track physical activity in the intervention group, records were kept of sessions attended and activity from the wrist-worn activity monitor tracked using the Fitabase data management platform (Fitabase, San Diego, USA). Participants in the control group were sign-posted to educational materials produced by the British Heart Foundation explaining hypertension, hypertension prevention and recommended lifestyle behaviours to maintain heart health. The target intervention exposure was 3 aerobic sessions per week, completed on separate days, for 16 weeks, with a compliance threshold set at 80%; equivalent to ≥ 39 independent aerobic exposures with no greater than 2 weeks between exposures. Before recruitment commenced a compliant session was defined as a supervised exercise session, but during the course of the trial this definition was relaxed to include unsupervised sessions captured using the activity monitor. At baseline, at 16 weeks and 52 weeks post randomisation, participants completed lifestyle and physical activity questionnaires and underwent physical examinations, vascular measures, microvascular assessment, retinal vessel imaging, echocardiogram, blood sampling, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), 24 h ambulatory blood pressure, and seven day accelerometer. A subgroup underwent MRI at the baseline and 16 week visits.\n\n【30】### Outcomes\n\n【31】The primary outcome was change in 24 h ambulatory awake blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) from baseline to 16 weeks. Secondary outcomes included change in nocturnal and resting clinic blood pressure, change in peak cardiorespiratory fitness, peak exercise wattage, submaximal ventilatory anaerobic threshold, insulin resistance, cholesterol HDL ratio, glucose and vascular stiffness at 16 and 52 weeks. Additional secondary outcomes reported in the trial protocol will be presented in future manuscripts and include additional blood pressure, CPET and blood sample measures, as well as cardiac echocardiographic outcomes, cell culture data, wrist-worn accelerometery activity and walking speed, retinal imaging and in a subgroup of participants, dermal capillary measures, molecular and vascular cell function and heart, brain and liver MRI outcomes. Full details of the study objectives, outcomes and measurement procedures are detailed in the published study protocol. There were no changes to the study outcomes after publication of the study protocol. Participants were asked to report adverse events.\n\n【32】### Statistical analysis\n\n【33】To observe a treatment effect on systolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg powered to 80% ( _p_ \\= 0.05) required a total sample of 164 participants and to observe a similar effect on diastolic blood pressure required a sample of 114 participants, based on pooled SD from previous systematic review of 11 mmHg for systolic and 8 mmHg for diastolic pressures. Sample size was therefore set at 200 participants (100 in each group) to allow for 18% attrition. We did not adjust for multiple testing because the intervention was to be considered superior to the control (or vice versa) only if both systolic and diastolic blood pressure showed a significant difference. Participants were included in the analysis if they had data available for all relevant timepoints on an intention-to-treat basis. On completion of the study a total of 160 participants were included in the final analysis for the primary outcome. A priori significance levels of 0·05 and 95% confidence intervals are reported on two-sided hypothesis tests. All analysis was conducted in R Version 3.6.1.\n\n【34】Blood pressure measured at 16 and 52 weeks was analysed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) within a multivariate mixed effects model to estimate the primary outcome of change in blood pressure at 16 weeks. This model accounted for person as a random effect, and time (16 or 52 weeks), treatment, and the minimisation factors (sex, age, gestational age at birth) as covariates. Baseline blood pressure was included as a continuous variable. A treatment by time interaction was also included in the model to allow 16-week specific treatment effects to be calculated. This estimate of the 16-week treatment effect is the primary outcome estimate. The primary analysis was intention-to-treat (participants were analysed according to the group they were assigned irrespective of compliance) and the mixed model used all available data at each time point.\n\n【35】Secondary continuous outcomes analysed at 16 and 52 weeks were analysed using the same ANCOVA mixed effects model as the primary analysis but adjusting for their corresponding baseline variables.\n\n【36】Exploratory subgroup analyses according to gestational age, sex and BMI were performed using an interaction term to define the subgroups in an ANCOVA model with blood pressure measured at 16 weeks as the outcome (adjusted for baseline, minimisation factors, and treatment). These analyses were restricted to participants with non-missing subgroup data.\n\n【37】A sensitivity analysis was carried out using the per-protocol population including only those considered compliant as per the definition given in the intervention section. Post-hoc exploratory sub-group analysis was also performed to understand whether there was difference in effect related to volume of supervised or unsupervised exercise sessions completed. Two missing data sensitivity analyses on the primary analysis were performed. Details and results of these analyses are given in the supplementary material.\n\n【38】The trial statistician completed all primary, pre-specified 16-week and 52-week secondary, sensitivity and pre-specified sub-group analyses. Other 52-week secondary and post-hoc exploratory analyses were completed by a study team investigator blinded to participant identifier, with results verified by a second research team member. There was a data and safety monitoring committee.删除1-2:<u> Clinicaltrials.gov registration number NCT02723552, prospectively registered March 30, 2016.</u>\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding sources\n\n【39】The funders had no role in the design and conduct of the study; collection, management, analysis, and interpretation of the data; preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript; and decision to submit the manuscript for publication.

Baseline characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1 . Of the 203 randomized participants, over 70% were white northern European (not shown) and 48% were male. At baseline, participants’ average vector magnitude, which is a proxy of overall activity, recorded during 7-day wear of a wrist-worn accelerometer averaged 29·15 mg (SD 6·52) in the intervention group and 29·48 mg (SD 7·83) in the control group (not shown). Mean baseline physical activity would be classified as sedentary with a projected age trajectory in highest cardiovascular risk group. 178 (88%) participants returned for 16-week follow-up of which the primary outcome was available on 160 (79%) participants. 160 participants returned for 52-week follow-up and 137 (67%) had awake ambulatory blood pressure data at 52 weeks. Reasons for the loss to follow-up at 16 weeks/52 weeks were: health reasons (1/1), lost contact (12/24), failed to contact (0/1) and moved away (2/3). There were 14 withdrawals in the trial (9 aerobic training, 5 control), 10 of these before the 16-week follow-up. Reasons for withdrawal included participant decision (5), pregnancy (5), and health reasons (2).

Activity data over the 52 weeks is not shown but across the 82 exercising participants the median volume of supervised moderate to vigorous exercise per week was 140 min per participant (IQR 110 to 160) at an intensity of 76% (SD 5) of maximum heart rate. Median daily wear of the Fitbit Charge HR was 105 days, with daily wear on 87% of available wear days across 16 weeks of the structured exercise programme. Using the Fitbit, participants registered a median of 337 min (IQR 213 to 462) of bouts of physical activity longer than 7 min at or above moderate intensity per week. The median daily step count in the first 16 weeks was 10,559 steps (IQR 9041 to 13,143). Total daily wear of the Fitbit dropped to less than 62% of available wear days between 16 and 52 weeks. In the last 60 days of the follow up period, total daily wear was 55% of available wear days and daily step count declined to a median of 9651 steps (IQR 7981 to 12,428). On average step count was 1442 steps per day (SD 2458) lower at the end of the 52 week follow up than during the 16 weeks structured exercise.\n\n【46】There was no evidence of a difference in awake systolic ambulatory blood pressure at 16-weeks (aerobic training _n_ \\= 76 mean 126·9 mmHg \\[SD 11·5\\] vs control group _n_ \\= 84 mean 125.8 mmHg \\[SD 10·0\\]; adjusted mean difference 0·0 \\[95% CI, −2.9 to 2·8\\]; _P_ \\= 0·98).

Injuries were self-limiting and activity adapted to allow continued participation in the intervention.\n\n【53】The per protocol analyses on awake systolic and diastolic blood pressure found no difference between groups at 16-weeks. The two sensitivity analyses completed to examine the robustness of the primary results against missing data showed no change from the main findings, implying the strategy used in the primary analysis was robust. Missing data results are presented in supplemental material.\n\n【54】Discussion\n----------\n\n【55】In this trial involving young adults with elevated blood pressure, aerobic training and physical activity self-monitoring did not reduce ambulatory awake blood pressure compared to lifestyle education alone. The lack of effect was despite achieving an improvement in cardiovascular fitness in the training group. This is not in accordance with our hypothesis, which was based on previous studies that reported short-term benefit of aerobic exercise intervention on blood pressure. However, these training studies have tended to recruit older adults, included additional lifestyle interventions, and used clinic blood pressure readings. Our trial is the first to exclusively recruit younger adults with elevated blood pressure and to use ambulatory monitoring as the primary outcome. The intervention was also exclusively aerobic training. Following a recent meta-analysis, an expert consensus statement identified that the benefit of aerobic exercise appears to vary with stage of hypertension. Whether other modes of exercise such as dynamic or resistance training are more effective to lower blood pressure in younger adults now needs to be studied. Furthermore, the results demonstrate no additional benefit was obtained from currently available activity monitoring devices either during or after the intervention period. Alternative more complex, multicomponent lifestyle or pharmacological interventions require proper validation in younger adult populations.\n\n【56】The observed increase in cardiorespiratory fitness at 16 weeks is comparable to benefits observed in older adult hypertensive populations. The increase in fitness suggests the intervention was effective in terms of promoting cardiovascular adaptation. In comparison to age and sex matched reference data the relative mean increase was equivalent to offsetting a decade of decline in peak oxygen uptake or a shift in population mean from below lowest 20th percentile to a moderate level of fitness These gains would suggest a clinically meaningful increase in cardiorespiratory fitness, which was not evident in the control group who were just signposted to educational material. Therefore, independent of effects on blood pressure, the gain in fitness in the intervention group would be expected to reduce future cardiovascular risk. Secondary imaging outcomes involving the heart, brain and vasculature will be published subsequently to help inform whether exercise has resulted in remodelling likely to be of cardiovascular benefit in this young hypertensive population. However, if benefits are identified, the current results indicate they are not likely to be mediated through changes in blood pressure alone.\n\n【57】The pre-specified exploratory subgroup analysis did indicate a potential heterogeneity in blood pressure response related to gestational age at birth. Those born very preterm had an improvement in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure profile at 16 weeks. By contrast, the intervention was associated with an increase in awake ambulatory diastolic blood pressure in those born at term, in keeping with the higher seated diastolic pressure after intervention in the whole group analysis. These findings would be consistent with cardiovascular differences described in young adults born peterm. Reassuringly, exercise intervention was observed to be safe in the study group, including for young adults born preterm. However, despite incorporation of evidence-based behavioural change strategies and physical activity wearables, benefits in fitness were not sustained at 52 weeks and the effects related to gestational age were no longer evident at this timepoint. Furthermore, due to the small sample sizes this exploratory analysis should be interpreted with caution unless replicated.\n\n【58】There were limitations to this single centre study. The study excluded participants with moderate to severe obesity so results may not be generalised to all young adult clinical populations. The wrist-worn device is commercially available and therefore the investigators did not have control over any additional features or behavioural prompting. The sample size calculation was adjusted for 18% loss to follow-up on 24 h ambulatory blood pressure. On completion of data cleaning ambulatory blood pressure was only available on 79% of participants at 16 weeks. Incomplete data related to lack of participant comfort during recording, disturbed sleep and reduced wear time. Whilst this means we did not reach our intended sample size, the study still had an overall power larger than 80% due to a smaller than expected observed standard deviation. Nevertheless, this study highlights compliance with ambulatory monitoring may limit feasibility and reliability as an outcome measure. Furthermore, the results could be biased in the event that data lost during follow-up were not missing at random but the sensitivity analyses do not suggest this is the case. Reassuringly, clinic blood pressure and cardiopulmonary exercise data was available on 88% of the randomized participants at 16 weeks and 79% of the randomized participants at 52 weeks. Due to the large number of secondary outcomes, there is a high chance of false positive results being discovered. Finally, it was also not possible to mask participants to trial group.\n\n【59】In conclusion, aerobic exercise training had no significant benefit in lowering awake ambulatory blood pressure in physically inactive young adults with elevated blood pressure compared to lifestyle education. Furthermore, benefits of aerobic training on other indicators of cardiovascular risk such as low submaximal and peak oxygen uptake only persisted during the aerobic exercise intervention. Motivational coaching and use of wrist-worn activity monitors had no sustained effects on maintenance of increased cardiovascular fitness achieved during training. Further work is required to understand whether different modes of exercise, alternative lifestyle interventions or pharmacological approaches are effective, safe and sustainable strategies to lower cardiovascular risk in young adults with elevated blood pressure.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【60】WW wrote the first draft of the manuscript with input from all other authors in subsequent drafts.

Yet not everyone appreciates their efforts and contributions. Since the beginning of this pandemic, headlines have also captured stories of health-care personnel facing attacks as they travel to and from health-care facilities. Nurses and doctors have been pelted with eggs and physically assaulted in Mexico. In the Philippines, a nurse was reportedly attacked by men who poured bleach on his face, damaging his vision. Across India, reports describe health-care workers being beaten, stoned, spat on, threatened, and evicted from their homes. These are just a few examples among many across numerous countries, including the USA and Australia.\n\n【1】Sadly, violence against health-care personnel is not a new phenomenon. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, such attacks were increasingly documented in clinics and hospitals worldwide. Attacks on health-care workers and health-care facilities also occur as a deplorable tactic of war that defies international humanitarian and human rights laws. In May, 2020, an armed attack on a hospital maternity ward in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed at least 24 civilians, including two infants. And in the midst of the humanitarian emergency of thousands of people displaced in opposition-held areas of northwest Syria, the Syrian Government has continued to bomb health-care facilities in that region.\n\n【2】Acts of violence in any context must be condemned. What makes the current attacks specifically horrifying is that health-care personnel are responding to a crisis that is deeply affecting all societies. Governmental failures in some countries to adequately provide and manage resources in this pandemic mean that health-care personnel are risking their lives daily by caring for COVID-19 patients without adequate personal protective equipment and other safety measures in their workplaces. As a result, thousands of health-care workers worldwide have contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and have thus been perceived as public health hazards themselves. This situation has generated violence against them in some places, essentially for performing their professional duties. This response is likely to exacerbate already unprecedented COVID-19-related stress and burnout that health-care workers and their families are experiencing in this pandemic.\n\n【3】With the COVID-19 pandemic taxing the health-care systems of almost every country, assaults on health-care workers are assaults against all of us. We depend on their health and wellbeing so that they can continue to provide care to individuals, families, and communities with and without COVID-19.\n\n【4】The reasons people attack and abuse health-care personnel during health emergencies are many, and local contexts vary. In some settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, fear, panic, misinformation about how SARS-CoV-2 can spread, and misplaced anger are likely drivers. A few government leaders have responded by announcing swift and, in some cases, draconian punishment for those who attack health-care workers. Yet threats of retribution do not address the causes of such violence and alone are unlikely to curtail these attacks. Effective responses must address the root causes. We recommend that the following actions be taken immediately.\n\n【5】First, collect data on the incidence and types of attacks on health-care personnel, including in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, in all countries to fully understand the scope of the problem and to design interventions to prevent and respond to the attacks. National and international bodies such as WHO must engage in a coordinated global effort. And this initiative must incorporate lessons learned from previous efforts to document violence against health-care personnel, such as attacks on those leading polio vaccination campaigns or who cared for patients with Ebola virus disease. Data on attacks specific to COVID-19 should be systematically gathered and included in the WHO Surveillance System of Attacks on Healthcare. Global support from all member states and their communities for this effort is essential to achieve a robust surveillance system. National data should be collected by ministries of health or occupational health and safety bodies. Mechanisms to analyse, share, and widely disseminate this information on violence against health-care personnel need to be developed or expanded, following the example of the reports from the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition and data gathered by Insecurity Insight, among others.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2020 Jose Luis Gonzales/Reuters</u>\n\n【6】Second, attacks against health-care personnel must be prevented and condemned. Partnerships for the prevention of violence must be forged. Local and state governments must partner with civil society, community-based groups, and media organisations to highlight the problem of attacks on health-care workers and engage with the community on prevention, bystander intervention, and reporting. The Health Care in Danger team of the International Committee of the Red Cross, for example, recently published a checklist for preventing violence against health-care workers in the COVID-19 response, which includes recommendations for communication and collaboration.\n\n【7】Third, misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19 must be countered. Widespread misinformation and disinformation about COVID-19, including conspiracy theories, have contributed to the demonisation of certain groups such as health-care workers. Governments, international collaborative bodies, and social media companies must further refine and expand effective public information campaigns to keep members of the public informed and educated and to correct misinformation. These should include clear and concise information on how SARS-CoV-2 is and is not spread and the science behind response measures. In the face of high levels of community distrust in many places, active engagement of key trusted community stakeholders and organisations in information campaigns will also be essential for success.\n\n【8】Fourth, accountability is needed. We must demand strong yet responsible enforcement actions against perpetrators of attacks by local and national governments. Violence against health-care personnel should be met with swift responses from law enforcement and legal systems. Local law enforcement authorities must fully investigate each reported incident, with an objective, evidence-based process. Full accountability for these crimes must be ensured and perpetrators must be held accountable.\n\n【9】Fifth, state and local governments should invest in health security measures to protect health-care workers as part of COVID-19 emergency budgets. Funding for the protection of health-care personnel and health facilities is needed now.\n\n【10】Finally, health professional associations, societies, and organisations from all specialties and disciplines should unite in speaking out forcefully against all acts of discrimination, intimidation, and violence against health-care workers. They must immediately condemn violence when it occurs and participate in initiatives aimed at responding to and eliminating violence.\n\n【11】These actions must be taken now. By protecting health-care personnel, we protect our most valuable assets in the fight against COVID-19: doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians, medical and respiratory technicians, laboratory workers, and many others on the front lines.\n\n【12】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.

We investigated the non-inferiority of prasugrel to clopidogrel for prevention of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and death from other vascular causes in Japanese patients with non-cardioembolic stroke.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In this phase 3 randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial, patients aged 20–74 years who had had a non-cardioembolic stroke in the previous 1–26 weeks were recruited from 224 hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive prasugrel (3·75 mg/day) or clopidogrel (75 mg/day) orally for 96–104 weeks. Randomisation was stratified according to stroke subtype. The randomisation schedule was generated by an independent statistician who created a computer-generated random number sequence. Patients, investigators, and the funder were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was combined incidence of ischaemic stroke (fatal and non-fatal), myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal), and death from other vascular causes in the intention-to-treat population. The safety endpoint was incidence of bleeding events, comprising life-threatening bleeding, major bleeding, and clinically relevant bleeding. The safety analysis was done in the population excluding trial patients with serious Good Clinical Practice violations, and those who had not taken the trial drug. The predefined non-inferiority margin was an upper 95% CI limit for the risk ratio (RR) of 1·35. The trial was registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center (JapicCTI-111582).\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Patients were recruited between Sept 1, 2011, and June 12, 2015. 3747 patients (797 \\[21%\\] women) were enrolled, with a mean age of 62·1 (SD 8·5) years. 3753 patients were randomly assigned to treatment and, of these patients, 1885 in the prasugrel group and 1862 in the clopidogrel group were confirmed to have taken the trial drug at least once, and six patients withdrew from the trial before administration of the trial drug. Thus, a total of 3747 patients were included in the full analysis set. 73 (4%) of 1885 patients in the prasugrel group and 69 (4%) of 1862 patients in the clopidogrel group reached the primary endpoint (RR 1·05, 95% CI 0·76–1·44). The incidence of bleeding events was not significantly different between treatment groups; life-threatening bleeding was observed in 18 (1%) patients in the prasugrel group and 23 (1%) patients in the clopidogrel group (RR 0·77, 0·41–1·42).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The non-inferiority of prasugrel to clopidogrel for the prevention of ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and death from other vascular causes was not confirmed in Japanese patients with non-cardioembolic stroke. No safety concerns were identified.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Daiichi Sankyo.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Neurology_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

It has been “another strong performance in 2014”, he added. The Group's revenue continued to grow by 2·8% and its adjusted profit from operations increased by 4·4%. Of the 667 billion cigarettes sold in 2014, 197 billion were sold in the Asia-Pacific and 227 billion were sold in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa—regions known as “high-growth markets”. An increase in market share driven by continued growth of leading brands meant the Group's cigarette volume decline of 1·4% was less than the overall industry decline, estimated at 2·5%.\n\n【1】Contrast this glowing picture with a public health view. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) is often referred to as a landmark treaty in global health, ushering in optimism and hope of turning back the tobacco tide with its raft of tobacco control measures. However, despite considerable, although uneven, progress in reducing the global prevalence of daily smoking in the decade since the FCTC came into being, around 50 million people, mostly men and largely in the poorer countries of the world, have died from using tobacco. FCTC implementation has been challenging in many low-income and middle-income countries, with several countries still yet to ratify it. A yawning gap exists between global health strategies and the way the tobacco industry sees itself and its future. Clearly the FCTC alone will be insufficient to nudge countries to set bold goals and to stop the tobacco industry actively recruiting new smokers, especially women, where they see the real “untapped” growth market. So what is needed to turn the tide on tobacco?\n\n【2】This week, _The Lancet_ launches a campaign for a tobacco-free world by 2040. A three-paper Series marks the 10-year anniversary of the coming into force of the FCTC, and is published to coincide with the 16th World Conference on Tobacco or Health taking place this week in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (March 17–21). In the first paper, Robert Beaglehole and colleagues present the case for an ambitious new global tobacco control goal—a world essentially free of tobacco by 2040—and the steps that need to be taken to achieve it. A world where over the next 25 years the sales of tobacco are phased out (although not prohibited), and in which fewer than 5% of adults use tobacco. As Anna Gilmore and colleagues outline in their paper, the cause of the tobacco pandemic is the tobacco industry—lethal but still lawful—and its predatory efforts to preserve and grow profits by exploiting markets in middle-income and low-income countries. The industry has vast resources and is undermining and distorting tobacco policy in many countries, although its efforts have been rejected in several high-income settings—for example, plain packaging legislation in Australia followed by Ireland's legislation this month. The authors call for monitoring, exposing, and addressing the aggressive tactics of tobacco companies. Achieving a tobacco-free world will need concerted and coordinated action at global, regional, and national levels, especially in large countries such as China, where one in three of the world's smokers lives. According to Gonghuan Yang and colleagues, progress is occurring in China with the country poised to enforce further legislation, including making indoor public places in Beijing smoke free from June 1, 2015. Draft proposals to do the same elsewhere in China and ban all forms of tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship are also being considered. However, the very close relationship between industry and the Chinese Government must be broken if progress is to be upheld.\n\n【3】Further cause for concern exists for tobacco control efforts globally. In an Article, Ver Bilano and colleagues, estimate trends for tobacco use from national smoking prevalence data from up to 178 countries between 1990 and 2010, and then extrapolate these trends to assess how many countries will meet the WHO target of a 30% reduction in prevalence of smoking by 2025. They found that many countries are not on-track to achieve their target, with several low-income and middle-income countries at risk of worsening their tobacco epidemics, notably in Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. If tobacco control efforts are not intensified and accelerated, the authors estimate there will be 1·1 billion tobacco smokers by 2025.\n\n【4】Current global anti-tobacco strategies are failing. We endorse the Series' call for a UN high-level Summit on tobacco use to reinvigorate global and national efforts to achieve a tobacco-free world by 2040. The time has come for not only greater WHO leadership, but also leadership from the UN Secretary-General, because tobacco is not just a threat to health, it is also a threat to sustainable human development.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2015 Imaginechina/Corbis</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【5】### Publication history\n\n【6】Published: 14 March 2015\n\n【7】### Identification\n\n【8】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60512-8</u>\n\n【9】### Copyright\n\n【10】© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Driven by the financial heft of transnational tobacco companies with a combined income higher than most individual countries, 3 built on a business model of peddling an addictive product to children and young people, and sustained by practices that prioritise corporate profit over health, the current global epidemic of smoking represents a triumph of corporate self-interest over human wellbeing.\n\n【21】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n*   Tariana Turia: looking ahead to a tobacco-free New Zealand\n    *   Next week, Dame Tariana Turia will be one of the recipients of the American Cancer Society Luther L Terry Awards, for “exemplary leadership in tobacco control”.

A tobacco-free world by 2040, where less than 5% of the world's adult population use tobacco, is socially desirable, technically feasible, and could become politically practical. Three possible ways forward exist: so-called business-as-usual, with most countries steadily implementing the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) provisions; accelerated implementation of the FCTC by all countries; and a so-called turbo-charged approach that complements FCTC actions with strengthened UN leadership, full engagement of all sectors, and increased investment in tobacco control.\n\n【25】    *   Full-Text\n    *   PDF\n*   The road to effective tobacco control in China\n    *   The non-communicable disease burden in China is enormous, with tobacco use a leading risk factor for the major non-communicable diseases.

However, a durable response to treatment is observed only in a subset of patients (20–30%), and the main biomarkers available, such as PD-L1 and tumour mutational burden, are imperfect. Therefore, the identification of novel predictors of response represents an important and still unmet research need. \n\n【1】In their retrospective study published in _The Lancet Digital Health_ , Maliazurina Saad and colleagues developed a CT-based deep learning signature to predict survival in 976 patients with metastatic, _EGFR/ALK_ wild-type non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with immunotherapy. The obtained model was able to group patients into high-risk and low-risk cohorts for overall survival and progression-free survival and was still predictive when the population was stratified according to relevant clinicopathological factors, including PD-L1 expression, histology, age, gender, and race. Of note, the highest predictive performance was obtained with a model integrating the imaging-based deep learning signature with a benchmark clinical model, which also outperformed PD-L1 tumour proportion score and disease burden.\n\n【2】Radiological images represent a potential source of easily accessible, non-invasive, relatively low-cost, and longitudinal information in patients with cancer. Saad and colleagues' analysis suggests deep learning might be able to identify new disease phenotypes related to prognosis relying on measurable, objective data and other non-visually assessable imaging features. However, one of the main obstacles to the introduction of imaging-based models in clinical practice is the drop in the performance of developed algorithms when tested on external datasets. In their study, Saad and colleagues used an ensemble learning strategy to obtain a deep CT signature from four different three-dimensional convolutional neural network models, combining supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid learning networks. The authors showed that the obtained ensemble model had a superior performance to each deep learning subnetwork, and that all four subnetworks were necessary to obtain the best prediction performance possible. Although an ensemble model requires a more elaborate architecture, the resulting CT signature appeared to be robust. Of note, it was able to stratify a heterogeneous population imaged in different hospitals with variable CT protocols. The deep CT signature maintained its predictive value even after the stratification of patients according to the imaging modality, which included unenhanced CT, contrast-enhanced CT, and PET–CT. The variability of CT protocols represents a common issue for artificial intelligence (AI) models, which can be greatly affected by variations in technical parameters of image acquisition. However, AI algorithms developed on tailored, ideal protocols might be substantially limited in their general applicability. Until a larger-scale consensus on standardised parameters optimised for these analyses is reached, models that can be applied to real-world data are of utmost importance. The validation of the model by Saad and colleagues on an external, although small, cohort for overall survival is promising for its wider applicability. However, as the authors acknowledged, a more robust validation of the model on a larger, prospective, and more homogeneous population will be essential to confirm its predictivity and specificity for immunotherapy and to identify any existing bias.\n\n【3】Another important issue to consider before any AI-based predictive model can be introduced into clinical practice, especially for treatment decisions, is the interpretability of the algorithms. Saad and colleagues correlated their signature with interpretable radiomics features and biological data and used an attention map to show the regions the deep learning signature focused on in the analysis. The attention map can be seen as a visual explanation for deep neural network decisions, resulting in increased model transparency and, consequently, improved interpretability and the possibility to identify potential bias in training datasets. The attention map in the study showed that the developed model weighted more on the tumour regions.\n\n【4】In their study, Saad and colleagues proposed a CT-based deep learning signature that can predict clinical benefit from immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC, trying to provide a solution to an important clinical need. Although the model will need further validation and the introduction in clinical practice might be still far ahead, this study is another step towards the development of multidomain models that could improve the prognostication of patients with lung cancer undergoing immunotherapy.\n\n【5】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:55:27", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:55:34", "cost": 7.202}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:55", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:55:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:55:27"}

This population-based study aimed to describe and compare the incidence of tics in children and young people in primary care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in England.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We used information from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum dataset and included males and females aged 4–11 years and 12–18 years between Jan 1, 2015, and Dec 31, 2021. We grouped the pre-pandemic period (2015–2019) and presented the pandemic years (2020, 2021) separately. We described the characteristics of children and young people with a first record of a motor or vocal tic in each time period. Incidence rates of tics by age-sex groups in 2015–2019, 2020, and 2021 were calculated. Negative binomial regression models were used to calculate incidence rate ratios.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We included 3,867,709 males and females aged 4–18 years. Over 14,734,062 person-years of follow-up, 11,245 people had a first tic record during the whole study period. The characteristics of people with tics differed over time, with the proportion of females aged 12–18 years and the proportion with mental health conditions including anxiety increasing during the pandemic. Tic incidence rates per 10,000 person-years were highest for 4–11-year-old males in all three time periods (13.4 \\[95% confidence interval 13.0–13.8\\] in 2015–2019; 13.2 \\[12.3–14.1\\] in 2020; 15.1 \\[14.1–16.1\\] in 2021) but increased markedly during the pandemic in 12–18-year-old females, from 2.5 (2.3–2.7) in 2015–2019, to 10.3 (9.5–11.3) in 2020 and 13.1 (12.1–14.1) in 2021. There were smaller increases in incidence rates in 12–18-year-old males (4.6 \\[4.4–4.9\\] in 2015–2019; 4.7 \\[4.1–5.3\\] in 2020; 6.2 \\[5.5–6.9\\] in 2021) and 4–11-year-old females (4.9 \\[4.7–5.2\\] in 2015–2019; 5.7 \\[5.1–6.4\\] in 2020; 7.6 \\[6.9–8.3\\] in 2021). Incidence rate ratios comparing 2020 and 2021 with 2015–2019 were highest in the 12–18-year-old female subgroup (4.2 \\[3.6–4.8\\] in 2020; 5.3 \\[4.7–6.0\\] in 2021).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The incidence of tics in children and young people increased across all age and sex groups during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a differentially large effect in teenage girls (a greater than four-fold increase). Furthermore, in those with tic symptoms, proportions with mental health disorders including anxiety increased during the pandemic. Further research is required on the social and contextual factors underpinning this rise in onset of tics in teenage girls.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Institute for Health Research Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre.\n\n【10】</u>\nKeywords\n--------\n\n【11】*   Tourette syndrome\n*   Tics\n*   COVID-19\n\n【12】Research in context\n\n【13】### Evidence before this study\n\n【14】Tics are sudden involuntary movements and sounds which typically occur more commonly in boys, with a peak incidence between age 5 and 7 years. During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, clinicians have described in numerous case reports a phenomenon of sudden onset tics arising predominantly in teenage girls. These atypical presentations have been described as functional tics with a presumed association with pandemic related social stressors. One longitudinal study of the ORBIT trial participants, who all had pre-existing tic disorder diagnoses (chronic tic disorder including Tourette syndrome), found no increase in tic intensity during the pandemic. A search of PubMed using the terms “COVID-19” and (“tics” or “Tourette”) found no population-based studies examining the incidence of tics during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】Our study in a large population-based cohort of people aged 4–18 years found that the incidence of tics increased across all age (4–11, 12–18 years) and sex groups during the pandemic. However, there was a differentially large effect in teenage girls with a greater than four-fold increase in the incidence of tics during the pandemic. In children and young people with new onset tic symptoms, rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm and eating disorders all increased during the pandemic.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】This large population-based cohort study confirms the signal from clinical case reports of a marked rise in new onset tic presentations in teenage girls during the COVID-19 pandemic. The characteristics of these tic presentations suggest that this rise may be driven by the emotional and social impact of the pandemic on teenage girls and that functional tics should be considered as part of the clinical differential diagnosis.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinicians a have noticed a marked increase in presentations of severe sudden and new onset tics and ‘tic-like’ attacks particularly affecting teenage girls. This phenomenon appears to have been recognised globally with case reports from the UK, Europe and the US and widespread media coverage of this phenomenon, often emphasising the role of social media. Tics are defined as sudden, involuntary motor movements and vocal utterances that affect around 1% of children and young people with tics having a peak incidence between the ages of 5–7 years. Tic disorders (including Tourette syndrome) are typically more common in boys. The recent descriptions of sudden first onset tics in teenage girls differs from the typical age/sex onset pattern and characteristic of tics and tic disorders. In case reports and cohort studies, these teenage onset acute tic presentations are often considered to be functional in nature (described as ‘functional tics’ or functional neurological disorder (FND)), typically do not appear to respond to standard treatments for tic disorders and Tourette syndrome, and are thought to be related to increased levels of stress and anxiety experienced during the pandemic. \n\n【21】The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child mental health has become increasingly evident. In March 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) government enforced lockdown restrictions, including limiting social contact and home confinement for all but essential activities. Notwithstanding periodic relaxation of rules, restrictions remained in place until April 2021. Additionally, in the first three months of the pandemic (March–May 2020), school closures were mandated, affecting over 96% of school and college students in England. These social restrictions sparked major concerns about the impact on vulnerable children and young people's mental health as young people turned increasingly online for education, social contact and support. The follow-up of England's Mental Health of Children and Young People survey provided a rare resource on the impact of the pandemic, with pre-pandemic measures in a sample of 3570 children and young people. The study showed an increase in probable mental health problems reported in 5–16 year olds, with the incidence rising from 10.8% in 2017 to 16.0% in July 2020. Although the survey didn't report on tic symptoms, the reported increase in mental health problems and pandemic-related stressors could potentially act as a trigger in vulnerable children and young people either to exacerbate existing tic disorders or develop new onset tics, including functional tics.\n\n【22】To date there has been very little evidence available from large population datasets to confirm and quantify the signal from anecdotal clinical reports of increasing presentations of tics in teenage girls during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey of parents of young people in Italy reported that 67% felt their children's tics had worsened since the pandemic. A large database review conducted in the US by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention compared visits to the emergency department pre- and during the pandemic and revealed an increase in tics during 2020, 2021 and 2022 compared to pre-pandemic referrals, particularly in adolescent girls. In the UK, a chart review of 34 patients presenting with sudden onset tic disorders during the pandemic, found that 94% were female. The largest UK tic study utilising pre- and during pandemic tic scores followed 112 (78% male) children with tics who participated in the active control group of a randomised controlled trial (“ORBIT Trial”). The analysis revealed no difference in tic severity during the pandemic, although the sample was limited to children who were diagnosed with a tic disorder pre-pandemic. Taken together, these findings indicate a mixed, complex picture in which some groups of children and young people may be differentially at greater risk than others of developing tics during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【23】To understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tic incidence, and potential differential effects of age and sex, there is a need to explore the recording of new tic symptoms in a population-based cohort both before and during the pandemic. To this end, this study aimed to describe and compare the incidence of tic symptoms in children and young people by age and sex groups in primary care records before and during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and to describe associated mental health characteristics. We hypothesised that there was a differential increase in the incidence of tics in teenage girls associated with a rise in emotional symptoms during the pandemic.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Study design and participants\n\n【26】This was a cohort study set in England between Jan 1, 2015 and Dec 31, 2021. In England, access to most non-emergency healthcare via the National Health Service (NHS) is centralised through general practitioners (GPs) who are the first point of contact in the healthcare system. If necessary, patients are then referred to secondary care, and additional information from secondary care is sent back to GPs. The study used data provided by the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a database of anonymised primary care electronic health records (EHR) provided by participating general practices. The primary care data contain patient-level information including demographic characteristics and recorded symptoms and diagnoses, coded using a mixture of Read codes, proprietary EMIS® codes, and SNOMED CT codes. Symptom and diagnosis codes are recorded in the EHR by clinicians or other practice staff as part of routine clinical care, during or following consultations or other relevant contact with the healthcare system. For this study we used the CPRD Aurum dataset (March 2022 build), and linked Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) data 删除2:<u>(linkage based on patient and practice postal codes)</u>. Access to CPRD data is governed by their Research Data Governance process and this study was approved in January 2022 (reference 21\\_001650). Individual patient consent is not required for CPRD studies, as only anonymised information is shared with CPRD. However, people can request to opt out of sharing their data for research with CPRD.\n\n【27】The study included children and young people aged 4–18 years between Jan 1, 2015 and Dec 31, 2021. People joined the cohort on the latest date of turning 4 years old, first registration at the general practice plus one year, or Jan 1, 2015. Follow-up ended on the earliest date of turning 19 years old, end of registration with practice, last practice data collection date, or Dec 31, 2021. Person-years were calculated from cohort entry until either their first tic record or end of follow-up. People were excluded if they had a tic record before cohort entry, or if their sex was missing or not classified.\n\n【28】### Outcome\n\n【29】The study outcome was a coded record of tic symptoms (tic record) in the primary care data. To identify relevant records, we defined a list of codes for tics, based on an existing list of Read codes and adapted for use with the CPRD Aurum dataset 删除2:<u>( Supplementary Table S1 )</u>. The code list was reviewed and agreed by a clinical expert (CH, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist) and is available online 删除2:<u>(see data sharing statement)</u>. The first coded record per person during the study window was identified.\n\n【30】### Covariates\n\n【31】For the denominator population we defined age group based on primary school (Years/Grade 1–6) and secondary school (Years/Grade 7–13) ages in the UK (4–11 years, 12–18 years), sex (male, female), deprivation score, and practice region. The patient-level IMD quintile was used to represent deprivation (2015 IMD for England, composite score), substituting the practice-level IMD quintile (2019 IMD for England, composite score) where the patient-level value was unavailable.\n\n【32】The remaining covariates were defined, with respect to the date of the first tic record, for the subset of the study population who had a tic record during the study period. These covariates were ethnicity (Asian/Asian British, Black/Black British, Mixed, Other, White, based on the England and Wales 2001 Census groups), and diagnoses of the following comorbidities: anxiety, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, eating disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder, self-harm (intentional or unspecified), dissociative or somatoform disorder, and stress reaction or adjustment disorder. These comorbidities were defined as present if recorded at any time on or before the date of the tic record. Code lists to define these variables were adapted from existing publications. New code lists were developed for dissociative or somatoform disorder and stress reaction or adjustment disorder by searching code dictionaries for relevant terms based on definitions within the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) categories F43, F44, and F45. The final code lists were reviewed by CH, as above. All code lists are available online 删除2:<u>(see data sharing statement)</u>.\n\n【33】### Statistical analysis\n\n【34】We summarised the characteristics of children and young people with a tic record using descriptive statistics over three time periods: 2015–2019, 2020, and 2021, according to the year when the tic was first recorded. Incidence rates of tics per 10,000 person-years were calculated for these time periods, overall, by month, and in the four age-sex subgroups. The results were plotted as a time series, highlighting periods of government-mandated school closures in England. Negative binomial regression models were used to calculate incidence rate ratios accounting for overdispersion, including terms for time period, age group and sex. Interaction terms were included in the models to assess the interaction between time period and the four age-sex subgroups. A sensitivity analysis also adjusted for deprivation and region.\n\n【35】All data handling and analyses were conducted using Stata MP/17.0. A significance level of 0.05 was used throughout. Small cell counts in tables have been masked. The Stata do-files needed to replicate the data preparation and analysis are available to download 删除2:<u>(see data sharing statement)</u>.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【36】The funder of the study (National Institute for Health Research) had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.\n\n【37】</u>\nResults\n-------\n\n【38】Between Jan 1, 2015 and Dec 31, 2021, 3,869,667 people aged 4–18 years had eligible follow-up within CPRD. After excluding 1788 people who had a tic record before study entry and 170 people with missing or unclassified sex information, the final study population included 3,867,709 people aged 4–18 years. Over a total of 14,734,062 person-years of follow-up, 11,245 people had a first tic recorded during the study period (7113 during 2015–2019, 1861 in 2020 and 2271 in 2021). Overall, 7393 (65.7%) people with a tic record were male and the median age at first tic record was 9 years (interquartile range 7–12 years).\n\n【39】The characteristics of people according to the year of their first tic record are summarised in Table 1 . Among people with an incident tic record, the proportion who were 12–18-year-old females increased from 7.5% of the total in 2015–2019, to 26.3% in 2020 and 27.7% in 2021. There were also increases in the proportion of people with a tic record who also had records of anxiety, depression, self-harm, and eating disorders. The proportion with anxiety recorded increased from 5.7% in 2015–2019 to 12.1% in 2020 and 13.0% in 2021 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. As shown in Supplementary Table S2 , the increase in anxiety was seen in both male age groups and in 12–18-year-old females. The proportion of people with tics who also had ADHD recorded did not change significantly over time, except for in 12–18-year-old females, for whom the proportion with ADHD decreased from 6.2% in 2015–2019 to 2.9% in 2020 and 4.9% in 2021.

The largest increase was in 12–18-year-old females, with the incidence rate increasing from 2.0 per 10,000 person-years in May 2020 to 4.5 per 10,000 person-years in June 2020, and then to 11.5 per 10,000 person-years in July 2020 when the first lockdown restrictions were eased. There was a further increase to around 20 per 10,000 person-years between September and December 2020. Incidence rates for this group reached a peak of 24.7 per 10,000 in March 2021 and then started to decline.

However, there was a markedly larger increase in teenage girls, with a greater than four-fold rise in the incidence of tics during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. The peak incidence in teenage girls occurred towards the end of the third national UK lockdown in March 2021. These population-based data support anecdotal clinical observations and case reports of a rise in the onset of tics in teenage girls during the pandemic. Furthermore, in those children and young people with tic symptoms, the proportions with anxiety, depression, self-harm, and eating disorders all increased during the pandemic, suggesting that the emotional and social impacts of the pandemic may be an important factor in this marked rise of tics in teenage girls.\n\n【54】The main strengths of this study were first, a very large sample (over 3.8 million children and young people) representative of the general population aged 4–18 years. Second, a study design that captured all coded records of incident tic symptoms in the primary care dataset during a pre-pandemic baseline period and during the pandemic. Third, the study included measures of mental health symptoms (e.g. anxiety, depression, and self-harm) and co-occurring conditions (e.g. ADHD, ASD, obsessive compulsive disorder and eating disorders) in the primary care record. Fourth, the size of the sample allowed incidence rate ratio comparisons to be made between age and sex subgroups of children and young people.\n\n【55】Our study has several limitations; first, there is uncertainty about the accuracy and completeness of tic symptoms recorded in primary care. New onset tics in children and young people are typically referred for assessment in secondary care. Furthermore, people may initially present to hospital emergency departments, as seen in the United States, where increased numbers of teenage girls were described presenting with tics to hospital emergency departments during the pandemic. In the UK, information about emergency department and secondary care visits should be fed back to primary care. However, if some events were missing from the primary care record, our definition may have underestimated new tic presentations. While this may reduce the precision of our estimates, we believe systematic bias is unlikely given that the same methods were used for all study participants. Records of new-onset tic symptoms were extracted using a clinical code list which was reviewed and confirmed by one of the co-authors (CH), a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist with expertise in tic disorders. Details of these codes are provided in the Supplementary Table S1 . However, the accuracy of these codes has not been verified by independent clinical assessment. We were unable to categorise tic symptoms as arising from a tic disorder or representing functional tic-like symptoms. In addition, the study did not include data on environmental and contextual factors such as family disruption, adequacy of home-based educational provision during school closures, and pandemic-related changes in online and social media activity. The size of the sample with tic symptoms was not sufficient to allow sub-group analysis for some of the co-occurring mental health symptoms and conditions. Finally, this study is based on an observational study design and so we are unable to infer causal relationships.\n\n【56】This is the first study, to our knowledge, to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of tics in children and young people in a large, representative, population-based sample. Previous studies have focussed on specific clinical populations (e.g. young people presenting to emergency departments) but these include only a sub-sample of all clinical presentations of tics. As we would expect the majority of cases to be captured in general practice records even if the initial presentation was elsewhere, our study is likely to be more representative of all young people with tic symptoms. One study that included measures of tics before and during the pandemic focussed on young people with a tic disorder diagnosis enrolled in the active control arm of a large clinical trial of online behavioural therapy for tics, which spanned the onset of the pandemic in 2020. This study found no increase in tic severity when comparing pre- and during pandemic measures, suggesting that children and young people with existing tic disorders (including Tourette syndrome) experienced, at most, a modest effect of the pandemic on their tics.\n\n【57】The main contribution of our large population-based cohort study is that it provides, for the first time, robust evidence of a marked increase in tic symptoms during the pandemic specifically affecting teenage girls, and an estimate of the number of young people affected. The explanation for this dramatic rise in tics in teenage girls remains unclear and will require further research. Our finding of a significant increase in rates of emotional symptoms (anxiety, depression, self-harm and eating disorders) in those young people with first-onset tics during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period suggests that the increased incidence of tics in teenage girls may be related to emotional and social impacts of the pandemic experienced most acutely in teenage girls. Although we were unable to distinguish between tic symptoms arising from tic disorders and functional tics, the increase in new-onset tics in this population-based cohort mirrors the clinical descriptions in the literature of a rise in functional tic presentations in teenage girls during the pandemic. In contrast, we did not report a rise in tic intensity during the pandemic in children and young people enrolled in a clinical trial control arm with a pre-existing diagnosis of a tic disorder. Although numbers were too low to compare changes in rates of comorbidities between sub-groups, in teenage girls we found that those with new onset tics during the pandemic had higher rates of anxiety and lower rates of ADHD comorbidity compared to those presenting pre-pandemic, which would support reports of an increase in functional tics in teenage girls.\n\n【58】Our study provided estimates of monthly incidence rates which could be related to the timing of national UK lockdowns and school closures 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 )</u>. Interestingly, a rise in tic incidence was not observed at the beginning of the pandemic in the first national lockdown. This may, in part, be explained by a lack of access to health services during this period. The peak incidence of tics in teenage girls was recorded towards the end of the third national lockdown in March 2021. Further research is required into the contextual factors, including social media activity and reduced face to face peer contact, which may have been related to increased tic presentations in vulnerable young people at this time.\n\n【59】In conclusion, this large population-based study provides evidence to support anecdotal clinical observations that there has been a marked increase in the incidence of tics in teenage girls during the COVID-19 pandemic. This rise in sudden onset of tics in teenage girls associated with an increase in coexisting anxiety and emotional symptoms suggests that clinicians should consider functional tics as part of the differential diagnosis of new onset tics in teenage girls. Further research will be required to understand the key contextual and causal processes underpinning this rise in tics in teenage girls during the pandemic and what clinical interventions and approaches are most helpful for these young people.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【60】CH came up with the original research question and secured the funding.

We undertook a phase 1 trial (Stem Cell Infusion in Patients with Ischemic cardiOmyopathy \\[SCIPIO\\]) of autologous CSCs for the treatment of heart failure resulting from ischaemic heart disease.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In stage A of the SCIPIO trial, patients with post-infarction LV dysfunction (ejection fraction \\[EF\\] ≤40%) before coronary artery bypass grafting were consecutively enrolled in the treatment and control groups. In stage B, patients were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group in a 2:3 ratio by use of a computer-generated block randomisation scheme. 1 million autologous CSCs were administered by intracoronary infusion at a mean of 113 days (SE 4) after surgery; controls were not given any treatment. Although the study was open label, the echocardiographic analyses were masked to group assignment. The primary endpoint was short-term safety of CSCs and the secondary endpoint was efficacy. A per-protocol analysis was used.删除1-2:<u> This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00474461.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】This study is still in progress. 16 patients were assigned to the treatment group and seven to the control group; no CSC-related adverse effects were reported. In 14 CSC-treated patients who were analysed, LVEF increased from 30·3% (SE 1·9) before CSC infusion to 38·5% (2·8) at 4 months after infusion (p=0·001). By contrast, in seven control patients, during the corresponding time interval, LVEF did not change (30·1% \\[2·4\\] at 4 months after CABG _vs_ 30·2% \\[2·5\\] at 8 months after CABG). Importantly, the salubrious effects of CSCs were even more pronounced at 1 year in eight patients (eg, LVEF increased by 12·3 ejection fraction units \\[2·1\\] _vs_ baseline, p=0·0007). In the seven treated patients in whom cardiac MRI could be done, infarct size decreased from 32·6 g (6·3) by 7·8 g (1·7; 24%) at 4 months (p=0·004) and 9·8 g (3·5; 30%) at 1 year (p=0·04).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】These initial results in patients are very encouraging. They suggest that intracoronary infusion of autologous CSCs is effective in improving LV systolic function and reducing infarct size in patients with heart failure after myocardial infarction, and warrant further, larger, phase 2 studies.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】University of Louisville Research Foundation and National Institutes of Health.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【11】### Publication history\n\n【12】Published: November 14, 2011\n\n【13】### Identification\n\n【14】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(11)61590-0</u>\n\n【15】### Copyright\n\n【16】© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In these three years of the COVID-19 PHEIC in Europe, almost 250 million infections have been confirmed, and more than 2 million people have died from the disease—this is more than the population of Vienna.\n\n【1】With the PHEIC being over, will COVID-19 become endemic, and what does that imply? As SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and immunity against it wanes, one expects that COVID-19 incidence worldwide will settle to a nonzero level. The precise “endemic equilibrium” is determined by the waning immunity and transmission rate of the predominant variants, vaccination rates, seasonality, and human behaviour (including active mitigation responses). In other words, the endemic equilibrium is a result of an implicit balance between the maximum incidence that societies accept and the maximum feasible extent of mitigation they tolerate. Classically, one expects for endemicity either relatively constant incidence, or seasonal waves 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 a1 )</u>. However, if moderate mitigation responses remain necessary and interact with seasonality, complex and even chaotic dynamics can emerge even in the endemic state 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 a2 and a3)</u>. That means that we might not see the classic steady state or seasonal waves but highly complex and potentially irregular wave patterns. These complex dynamics reduce long-term predictability but have the advantage of reducing the total number of infections 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 b)</u>.\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 1 **The many faces of endemic disease spread. a.** Depending on the maximum mitigation required, vastly different dynamics for the endemic incidence can emerge. **a1.** Classically (without any mitigation), seasonal outbreaks are expected. **a2, a3.** However, complex oscillatory dynamics can arise when mitigation and seasonality are comparable, featuring complex-periodic waves (e.g. 3 waves in 2 years), or chaos. **b.** The average number of infections observed for chaotic dynamics ( **a2.** ) is substantially lower than that for unmitigated seasonal waves ( **a1.** ) and is comparable to when mitigating too strongly ( **a3.** ). This implies that societies might have to trade off predictability for reductions in the average number of infections, and that above a certain point, over-mitigation does not pay off.

On the other hand, ongoing mild exposure to the virus might refresh immunity and protect individuals against a severe course. Given the available information, it is not clear yet how these factors equilibrate. It is thus an ongoing task for societies to weigh the consequences of high COVID-19 incidence against the cost of mitigation.\n删除4:<u>\n• View related content for this article</u>\n\n【3】If some non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are necessary in case of pandemics, what can Europe do to avoid some of their negative consequences?\n\n【4】The COVID-19 pandemic taught us, by example, a lot for future pandemics. From the perspective of dynamics, we here summarize five basic mechanistic principles that can inform the design of interventions. The principles apply if mitigation is considered necessary, e.g. to bridge the time until vaccination is broadly available: (I.) Act early. As disease spread at the early stage is typically exponential, a few days of delay can double the incidence. (II.) To be able to act early, active surveillance for novel outbreaks is critical. (III.) Even under uncertainty, it is often better to act than not to act. (IV.) Act strongly; if the aim is to lower the incidence, then stronger interventions are over-proportionally more effective: To illustrate this, for COVID-19, reducing the incidence by half takes one week if the reproduction number R is lowered to R = 0.7; the same reduction takes one month if only R = 0.9 is achieved. Finally, (V.) low case numbers allow for more freedom, because then test-trace-and-isolate interventions have more capacity and are faster to break infection chains. Thus, overall, the mitigation measures required to equilibrate incidence (i.e. reach R = 1) at low case numbers are milder than those needed to equilibrate an outbreak at high incidence, again at the limit where the overall immunity levels in the population are low.\n\n【5】A key challenge for the future relates to making NPIs equitable across countries and segments of society, making them fair, consistent and effective, and to communicate them clearly. Targeted interventions for those disproportionately impacted by NPIs can substantially reduce the NPIs’ collateral damage. Implementing these flanking measures alongside broader strategies will not only help reduce the overall burden of NPIs but also foster a more inclusive and resilient society during challenging times.\n\n【6】As COVID-19 transitions from epidemic to endemic state, we appreciate the positive aspects of regaining normalcy in our lives. People are finally resuming activities and social interactions that were restricted during the pandemic, enriching their well-being and fostering a sense of community. As scientists also recover from the intense research efforts during COVID-19, we only start to systematically evaluate past actions to be better prepared for the next pandemic. Thus, in terms of research tasks, our work in understanding the COVID-19 pandemic has not concluded.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【7】All authors contributed equally to this comment.\n\n【8】Conceptualization: all.\n\n【9】Writing - Original Draft: all.\n\n【10】Writing - Review & Editing: all.\n\n【11】Declaration of interests\n------------------------\n\n【12】删除9:<u>VP was a member of the ExpertInnenrat of the German federal government on COVID and an advisor for other governmental and non-governmental entities.

In short order came PrP, an abbreviation for pr ion p rotein (or perhaps p roteinase- r esistant p rotein) and PrP 27–30, because the proteinase-treated protein had a molecular weight of about 27–30 KDa.\n\n【1】When it was discovered that this protein was a pathologically misfolded version of a normal cellular protein, the term prion began to be used by different authors to indicate only the normal protein, only the abnormal protein, or both forms of the protein, causing a degree of confusion that continues to the present day. Also, the pairing of PrP c (for normal c ellular) and PrP Sc (for sc rapie-infected) came into widespread use, but it is manifestly inappropriate to so designate the protein in different kinds of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and thus was spawned an alphabet soup of PrPs: PrP CJD , PrP GSS , PrP FFI , PrP BSE , PrP CWD , and PrP TME .\n\n【2】Because the normal protein was proteinase sensitive and the misfolded protein was proteinase-resistant, the generically satisfying PrP sen and PrP res twins were born, which for some time were the most accurate representations of prion terminology (although PrP sen is a contradiction in terms if PrP is understood in the sense of proteinase-resistant protein). However, the discovery of disease-specific protein species with intermediate proteinase sensitivities has led to the birth of two new terms—PrP u (for partially u nfolded intermediate), and the fraternal twins, sPrP Sc and rPrP Sc . PrP u will probably be stillborn because the letter u could also signify urinary, and become immersed in the current confusion that surrounds urinary PrP studies, and the s and r twins may not survive infancy.\n\n【3】In an attempt to achieve some sort of comprehensive simplification of the entire issue, yet another abbreviation has recently appeared in print—PrP d (for disease-specific). Though accurate, it seems almost too generic, lacking the necessary panache to have any real staying power, and for proper balance, it would need a triangulation with PrP n (normal) and PrP dsi (disease-specific intermediate) to accommodate the s and r PrP's. In fact, it has already been subverted by a reinterpretation of PrP sc as di s ease- c ausing isoform by the same group that 20 years ago gave us its original designation as sc rapie prion.\n\n【4】Given the pressure from journals to save space, the ubiquitous use of abbreviations in medical literature has produced setbacks both to ease of reading and comprehension, but if abbreviations must be used, the best pairing would seem to be PrP C for the normal cellular protein, and PrP TSE for any of its disease-specific conformers. One might even revert to plain English and dare to use actual words, like normal cellular protein, transition protein (molten globule), and misfolded protein (or amyloid protein), reducing the prion lexicon to a level that does not intimidate by its arcane and often inaccurate terminology, and could be understood by readers both within and without the specialty.\n\n【5】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:35:33", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:35:44", "cost": 11.356}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:55", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:35:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:35:32"}

Firstly,\"?>\n\n【4】Firstly, CsA might use in those patients in the second stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the pulmonary phase1 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Hypoxemia and bilateral lung infiltrates or ground-glass opacities characterizes this phase. Most hospitals admit patients into wards during this disease phase. The hypoxemia -as mentioned in the manuscript- should be defined as saturation of oxygen below 94% or PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 300 mmHg. Typically, blood tests detect lymphopenia or transaminitis. A rise of inflammatory parameters, such as d-dimer, ferritin, and C-protein reactive, is also identified. Those cases in stage III, systemic hyperinflammation, are, of course, also suitable for CsA therapy. The transition between both phases is rather dynamic, and probable most hospitalized cases share features of both pulmonary and hyperinflammatory stages.\n\n【5】Secondly, in our opinion, CsA therapy should start as soon as possible in hospitalized patients. It also might work as rescue therapy in those cases which do not improve after supportive measures. Nowadays, the best standard of care might include dexamethasone 6 mg q.i.d. intravenously 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u> - and thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.\n\n【6】Thirdly, CsA can have a clear advantage when used as an intravenous formulation in severely ill cases. In our paper, we referenced an effective accumulative therapeutic dose of CsA to the oral administration of 300 mg or more. It is known that a factor of 3 (1:3) should be applied to convert any intravenous to the oral dosage of CsA in the solid-organ transplant recipients. Nevertheless, we used two principles to keep a balance between effective therapy and to avoid side effects. For these purposes, we considered a factor of 2 for the conversion of intravenous to oral CsA formulations 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. A total daily dose of CsA was set on 2·5–3 mg/kg/day, approximately. Thereby, this low-dose of CsA seemed to be safe and successful for COVID-19.\n\n【7】Finally, in our hospital, we stopped CsA therapy if a patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. We agree that this population deserves the design of specific protocols of CsA therapy. Thus, a clinical trial should include this severely ill population in the protocol. CsA schedules might be different for specific clinical scenarios.\n\n【8】Dear Dr Olga Sánchez Permaute,\n\n【9】Thank you for your comments about our manuscript under the format of a letter to the editor.\n\n【10】They contribute to a scientific debate to boost the research on cyclosporine A for COVID-19.\n\n【11】We thank Dr. Olga Sánchez Permaut for her proposed some interesting points, which give to our research about cyclosporine A for COVID-19 a positive inside. All these comments are relevant to a reasoning scientific debate about this repurposed drug. These comments are mainly focusing on those severely-ill cases of COVID19. We would like to underscore some data already reported in the manuscript.\n\n【12】First, our research aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of the whole cohort (as previously published manuscripts of similar scope). We reported in-hospital mortality (or other cohort features, as suitable), using relative mortality rates 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. This statistical approach is widespread used in the scientific literature and validated elsewhere. We showed all available data in the manuscript, and supplementary material, so that readers could easily make whichever percentage (including crude mortality rates) they consider.\n\n【13】In-hospital crude (or relative) mortality rates might vary according to the design of the research: total hospital admissions 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u> due to severe COVID-19, or just those transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In both researches, unfortunately, the final outcome of all included patients was not available. The authors reported that a relevant percentage of cases were still in ICU at the moment of the publication.\n\n【14】However, the issue is interesting. Most of our patients admitted to ICU received mechanical ventilation. The reported crude mortality of previous reports in the same population was 70% 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. In our cohort, the in-hospital absolute mortality rate in those cases admitted to ICU was lower (48·98%).\n\n【15】As we reported, we stopped cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment if a patient transfers to ICU. Some of them had already been treated with CsA and reached the minimum accumulative dose of 300 mg. Table 2S summed up the impact of CsA in the outcome of these cases. This table shows the mortality rate of those cases treated or not with CsA 300 m.c.d. The proportion of patients admitted to ICU in the group of CsA 300 mg m.c.d. was lower, compared to the group without CsA 300 mg m.c.d (4·52% versus 10·10% per treatment cohort). Furthermore, the in-ICU crude mortality rate was again lower among those treated with CsA 300 m.c.d. (20% versus 56·41%). Of course, we consider it is a small sample to settle categorical conclusions about CsA therapy and ICU admissions and related outcomes. Perhaps, CsA could have a clear advantage when used as an intravenous formulation in severely ill cases. Thus, specific protocols of CsA therapy should schedule considering the singular characteristics of this population.\n\n【16】Second, we chose broadly extended criteria of severe COVID-19 pneumonia (oxygen saturation (SaO2) at or below 94% while breathing ambient air, or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (PaO2/FiO2; or PAFI) at or below 300 mmHg).

Firstly,\"?>\n\n【4】Firstly, CsA might use in those patients in the second stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the pulmonary phase1 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Hypoxemia and bilateral lung infiltrates or ground-glass opacities characterizes this phase. Most hospitals admit patients into wards during this disease phase. The hypoxemia -as mentioned in the manuscript- should be defined as saturation of oxygen below 94% or PaO 2 /FiO 2 < 300 mmHg. Typically, blood tests detect lymphopenia or transaminitis. A rise of inflammatory parameters, such as d-dimer, ferritin, and C-protein reactive, is also identified. Those cases in stage III, systemic hyperinflammation, are, of course, also suitable for CsA therapy. The transition between both phases is rather dynamic, and probable most hospitalized cases share features of both pulmonary and hyperinflammatory stages.\n\n【5】Secondly, in our opinion, CsA therapy should start as soon as possible in hospitalized patients. It also might work as rescue therapy in those cases which do not improve after supportive measures. Nowadays, the best standard of care might include dexamethasone 6 mg q.i.d. intravenously 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u> - and thrombosis prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin.\n\n【6】Thirdly, CsA can have a clear advantage when used as an intravenous formulation in severely ill cases. In our paper, we referenced an effective accumulative therapeutic dose of CsA to the oral administration of 300 mg or more. It is known that a factor of 3 (1:3) should be applied to convert any intravenous to the oral dosage of CsA in the solid-organ transplant recipients. Nevertheless, we used two principles to keep a balance between effective therapy and to avoid side effects. For these purposes, we considered a factor of 2 for the conversion of intravenous to oral CsA formulations 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. A total daily dose of CsA was set on 2·5–3 mg/kg/day, approximately. Thereby, this low-dose of CsA seemed to be safe and successful for COVID-19.\n\n【7】Finally, in our hospital, we stopped CsA therapy if a patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. We agree that this population deserves the design of specific protocols of CsA therapy. Thus, a clinical trial should include this severely ill population in the protocol. CsA schedules might be different for specific clinical scenarios.\n\n【8】Dear Dr Olga Sánchez Permaute,\n\n【9】Thank you for your comments about our manuscript under the format of a letter to the editor.\n\n【10】They contribute to a scientific debate to boost the research on cyclosporine A for COVID-19.\n\n【11】We thank Dr. Olga Sánchez Permaut for her proposed some interesting points, which give to our research about cyclosporine A for COVID-19 a positive inside. All these comments are relevant to a reasoning scientific debate about this repurposed drug. These comments are mainly focusing on those severely-ill cases of COVID19. We would like to underscore some data already reported in the manuscript.\n\n【12】First, our research aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes of the whole cohort (as previously published manuscripts of similar scope). We reported in-hospital mortality (or other cohort features, as suitable), using relative mortality rates 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. This statistical approach is widespread used in the scientific literature and validated elsewhere. We showed all available data in the manuscript, and supplementary material, so that readers could easily make whichever percentage (including crude mortality rates) they consider.\n\n【13】In-hospital crude (or relative) mortality rates might vary according to the design of the research: total hospital admissions 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u> due to severe COVID-19, or just those transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In both researches, unfortunately, the final outcome of all included patients was not available. The authors reported that a relevant percentage of cases were still in ICU at the moment of the publication.\n\n【14】However, the issue is interesting. Most of our patients admitted to ICU received mechanical ventilation. The reported crude mortality of previous reports in the same population was 70% 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. In our cohort, the in-hospital absolute mortality rate in those cases admitted to ICU was lower (48·98%).\n\n【15】As we reported, we stopped cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment if a patient transfers to ICU. Some of them had already been treated with CsA and reached the minimum accumulative dose of 300 mg. Table 2S summed up the impact of CsA in the outcome of these cases. This table shows the mortality rate of those cases treated or not with CsA 300 m.c.d. The proportion of patients admitted to ICU in the group of CsA 300 mg m.c.d. was lower, compared to the group without CsA 300 mg m.c.d (4·52% versus 10·10% per treatment cohort). Furthermore, the in-ICU crude mortality rate was again lower among those treated with CsA 300 m.c.d. (20% versus 56·41%). Of course, we consider it is a small sample to settle categorical conclusions about CsA therapy and ICU admissions and related outcomes. Perhaps, CsA could have a clear advantage when used as an intravenous formulation in severely ill cases. Thus, specific protocols of CsA therapy should schedule considering the singular characteristics of this population.\n\n【16】Second, we chose broadly extended criteria of severe COVID-19 pneumonia (oxygen saturation (SaO2) at or below 94% while breathing ambient air, or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (PaO2/FiO2; or PAFI) at or below 300 mmHg). The emergency department discharged most of the mild COVID-19 cases, and none of them were treated with CsA. We carried out all CsA treatment under in-hospital observation. We applied similar exclusion criteria for all explored therapies (including early discharge or supportive care due to the unfitted condition of the patient). CsA therapy protocols for outpatients might entail further research around this issue.\n\n【17】Finally, to confirm our findings and to assess the real impact of CsA therapy against severe COVID-19, an adequately powered, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled clinical trial must be carried out.\n\n【18】Declaration of Competing Interest\n---------------------------------\n\n【19】None.", "index": 7149, "show": true, "start": 7149, "end": 7196, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:46:05", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:47:29", "cost": 84.053}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:54", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:47:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:46:05"}

Pethidine and tramadol are used for analgesia during obstetrical procedures, but they have not been compared for relief of post-caesarean pain. We therefore compared the analgesic efficacies and adverse effects of pethidine and tramadol in women after a caesarean.\n\n【2】### Methods\n\n【3】In a randomised, unmasked, parallel-group controlled trial, we enrolled women (aged 18–41 years) who were undergoing either elective or emergency lower-segment caesarean under general anaesthetic at Al Helal Al Emirati Hospital, Rafah, Gaza Strip, occupied Palestinian territory. Using a manually generated allocation sequence that was independently managed by medical staff, we randomly assigned women to receive a single dose (100 mg) of pethidine or tramadol intramuscularly immediately after the caesarean. We used a visual analogue scale (VAS; range 0–10, 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as it could be) to record the pain 1 h after the start of the analgesia and then at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h (primary outcome). The secondary outcomes were nausea and vomiting scores (NVS 0–3; 0=no nausea or vomiting and 3=severe, unresponsive to antiemetic drugs), sedation scores (SS 0–3; 0=patient awake and 3=severe sedation, patient difficult to rouse, unrousable), and time to pass first flatus. Another secondary outcome was the use of other analgesic drugs during 24 h. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 13.0). We compared the groups using the Mann-Whitney _U_ test, student's _t_ test, or χ 2 . The study was approved by the Ministry of Health and Helsinki Committee, Gaza Strip. Women provided verbal informed consent before their participation in the trial and consent to undergo a caesarean.\n\n【4】### Findings\n\n【5】We screened 258 women and enrolled 232 (mean age 29·5 years \\[SD 7·3\\]); 26 women were excluded because they had spinal or epidural anaesthesia. 116 women were allocated to each of the two treatment groups. Greater analgesia was achieved with pethidine at 1 h and 6 h than with tramadol (VAS: 1 h, mean score 2·91 _vs_ 5·10, p=0·003; 6 h, 2·97 _vs_ 3·52, p=0·049). No differences were noted in the proportion of patients in the pethidine and tramadol groups with NVS 0 at 1 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after caesarean (102 \\[88%\\] of 116 _vs_ 99 \\[85%\\] of 116, p=0·555; 108 \\[93%\\] _vs_ 105 \\[91%\\], p=0·633; 111 \\[96%\\] _vs_ 112 \\[97%\\], p=1·00; and 114 \\[98%\\] _vs_ 113 \\[97%\\], p=1·00, respectively). Mean time to first passage of flatus was 12·6 h (SD 5·0) and 13·3 h (5·1) in the pethidine and tramadol groups, respectively (p=0·376). More patients in the tramadol group had slight sedation (SS 1) than did those in the pethidine group at 12 h and 24 h (16 \\[14%\\] _vs_ five \\[4%\\], p=0·014; and seven \\[6%\\] _vs_ one \\[<1%\\], p=0·036, respectively). The total intake of other non-narcotic analgesic drugs was greater in the tramadol group than in the pethidine group (99 \\[85%\\] of 116 _vs_ 87 \\[75%\\] of 116 patients; p=0·048).\n\n【6】### Interpretation\n\n【7】Pethidine was more effective than was tramadol for post-caesarean pain relief.

There are additional subtleties involved in these calculations that, if not understood, can lead to misleading conclusions.\n\n【2】The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is defined as the expected number of cases in the next disease generation caused by the index case in a naive population. This number provides a threshold criterion for an infectious agent to invade. Put simply, if R 0 is greater than 1, there are more cases in the next disease generation, and an epidemic will occur. Thus, R 0 is defined for an infectious agent in a particular population. In less formal settings, R 0 is sometimes thought of as an intrinsic property of an infectious agent.\n\n【3】How should one estimate R 0 for SARS? In Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, Toronto, and Singapore, the first disease generation after the index case produced more than one secondary case, but in a few households, there were no secondary cases. Worldwide attention and infection control after the identification of initial cases probably reduced the number of cases per case in subsequent disease generations. Thus, the cumulative case data provide only very limited information about the intrinsic growth rate of SARS epidemics in the absence of control. In fact, cumulative case data reflect more information about subsequent disease generations, and little information about the index case. The proper conclusion from the cumulative case data for SARS is that the reproductive number R, a general term for the number of cases per case, has been near 1 over the course of an epidemic, including the generations before and after control. What was happening before control?\n\n【4】Infectious disease epidemics are birth-death processes, so an exponential model is the proper basis from which to reason, not a linear one; the geometric mean is the proper statistic of measure of the growth rate, not the arithmetic mean. We note that the cumulative number of cases is linear when R 0 \\=1, but one should not choose a linear model to reason about epidemics, a priori, any more than one should use a linear model to compute the future value of an annuity.\n\n【5】Assuming conditions remain the same and R 0 is really less than 1, control measures will eventually eradicate SARS, but it may take several generations. However, conditions may change: transmission rates may be seasonal, the virus may mutate, or the efficacy of infection control may wane as people's fear subsides. Most seriously, if the number of active cases gets very large, it might limit the amount of resources that can be devoted to control, per case, and the epidemic may escape control. If we are lucky, control will succeed and we will never know how bad things might have been.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:38:48", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:39:31", "cost": 43.635}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:54", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:39:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:38:48"}

Then he changed—maybe because of one patient's suffering, or his own. Or, perhaps, as Berger suggests, because he developed relationships with his patients and “began to notice how people developed”. He began to develop an imagination—what some in the medical humanities call a “narrative” imagination: what is it like to be sick like this particular person is sick; how would that feel?”\n\n【2】What's it like for a patient whose doctor is missing that crucial, non-biomedical trait of imagination? What's it like for that doctor? Here's what Robert Lowell tells us at the beginning of his poem, _Notice_ :\n\n【3】“The resident doctor said, ‘We are not deep in ideas, imagination or enthusiasm— how can we help you?’”\n\n【4】Of course, the answer is, “you can't”. I remember being a resident doctor like that, hiding behind my white coat. I was very busy, sometimes proud of it. I had to hold on tight to my conviction that there was much more to medicine than the biomedical, because the biomedical was, is, so very much, and so very important.\n\n【5】Rita Charon addresses such issues in her most-welcome book, _Narrative Medicine: Honoring the Stories of Illness_ , a “primer,” as she calls it, for the emergent field of “narrative medicine” that she has helped to define. The book combines theory—drawn from literary studies, philosophy, anthropology, psychotherapy—and rich narratives from her own and her patients' and students' lives. It is a compelling mix, backed by the unusual authority of a physician who is also a literary scholar. Theory gives us a way of understanding what her stories tell us more directly: that we human beings communicate best about who we are and what is important to us by means of narrative.\n\n【6】Early on in her book, Charon writes: “Most agree that medical schools and training programs cannot train adults to be empathetic, respectful, altruistic and ethically responsible, for such traits are developed and nurtured from infancy onward.” (In fact, she says, some claim that medical training may lessen our innate empathic sense as “doctors become hardened against the suffering they witness through their education”.) Instead, she suggests that education in narrative can “equip students with compassion's prerequisites” by offering the means to acquire what is sorely lacking in the practice of medicine today, “narrative competence”.\n\n【7】To define narrative competence, Charon details the knowledge and skills that come from studying narrative: “how to read, write, and interpret texts; how to systematically adopt others' points of view; how to recognize and honor the particular along with the universal; how to identify the meaning of individuals' words, silences, and behaviors; how, as a reader or a listener, to enter an authentic relation with a writer or a teller or a text; and how to bring one's own thoughts and sensations to achieving the status of language”. The contribution of each of these to self-understanding and the understanding of others, and to the practice of good medicine, is explained in various and compelling ways throughout her text.\n\n【8】When Charon lays out for us five “narrative features of medicine”, the reading can get a bit thick, and this was when I found myself asking: will knowledge of narratology really help us be better doctors? But Charon always brings us back with a clinical story to make her points. And her points are substantive: our stories, how we tell them, and the words we use to convey them, matter; so does how we listen. As she explains, some “literary tellings as well as our clinical tellings are like handling fire”; and this is so for the teller and receiver of the story, because both are inextricably involved in making and discerning meaning. Moreover, in the world of suffering, anything and everything can be of critical importance. We _must_ pay attention.\n\n【9】Charon says she's not out to make literary scholars of her readers. Although she does provide a good dose of scholarship, her stated purpose is to “equip \\[health-care professionals\\] with the skills to open up the stories of their patients to nuanced understanding and appreciation…to strengthen those cognitive and imaginative abilities that are required for one person to take in and appreciate the representation—and therefore the reality—of another”. In the end, it serves the work of building relationships and alleviating suffering.\n\n【10】Of course, “representation” isn't the real thing. Reading about illness may, or may not, stimulate the narrative imagination in the empathic ways that lead to helpful action. Similarly, writing about others who are sick may, or may not, induce empathic action. These hypotheses remain to be empirically confirmed, and Charon and her colleagues are beginning this work. When I have made such claims, friends in the humanities have reminded me that even possessing the most finely honed narrative skills is no guarantor of virtue.\n\n【11】However, I believe that most of us in the health-care professions entered with a sincere desire to help ease suffering. We already know the truth of what Charon is telling us, instinctively perhaps, or, like Berger's John Sassal, through the experience of medical practice. Francis Peabody, in his famous speech “The Care of the Patient” to Harvard medical students, in 1925, recognised this: “The treatment of a disease may be entirely impersonal; the care of a patient must be completely personal…It is one thing to write an examination paper on the treatment of gastric ulcer and quite another thing to treat John Smith who happens to have a gastric ulcer…The good physician knows his patients through and through, and his knowledge is bought dearly. Time, sympathy, and understanding must be lavishly dispensed, but the reward is to be found in that personal bond which forms the greatest satisfaction of the practice of medicine.”\n\n【12】If we have already the awakened sense of empathic concern, then why should we read this book? Because we are distracted by the bureaucracy of medicine and its technologies and don't seem to have the time that Peabody suggests we “lavishly dispense”. Because we sometimes forget and can benefit from reminders and encouragement. Because the narrative skills Charon offers are instruments of care. By paying closer, more informed, attention we not only learn about our patients, we are also reminded of who we are—not so different from “the other”. We see this is true if only for the mere fact that we all are subject to suffering, old age, and death. We are in this great narrative soup together. With that realisation, what else can we be but kind and compassionate? Narrative medicine is not a “proven” path to compassionate and effective care; but, as Charon writes, “it appears a most compelling hypothesis”.\n\n【13】_Narrative Medicine_ is practical enough to be beneficial to the clinician, yet sufficiently theoretical to serve as a seminal text in the field. Even master clinicians can gain from the knowledge and skills presented here.

However, more than half of the participants in this trial did not promptly complete the vaccination course. Surveillance data suggest that self-reported hepatitis B vaccine uptake has increased greatly in people who inject psychoactive drugs in the UK from around two-fifths in 2002 to three-quarters in 2012. Because most people who inject psychoactive drugs are now vaccinated (as shown by the authors' difficulty in finding eligible participants), cases of acute hepatitis B are very rare in people who inject psychoactive drugs and less than 1% are infected with the hepatits B virus. Contingency management approaches could be a useful, but controversial, method to maintain high levels of vaccine uptake in people who inject drugs, especially if they can be shown to be effective in people who access needle and syringe programmes or those new to injecting drugs (when the risk of hepatitis B infection by unsafe injecting is high).\n\n【1】Of increasing concern are the levels of hepatitis B, and other infections, in people who inject image and performance enhancing drugs (such as anabolic steroids and Melanotan), with 9% of these people infected with hepatitis B virus. This population, which has probably been increasing in the UK (and elsewhere), has a much lower level of hepatitis B vaccination, with only one in four reporting vaccination uptake. Because people who inject image and performance enhancing drugs are typically employed—often in skilled or professional occupations —contingency management approaches are less likely to be effective. Strategies to improve vaccine uptake in this population are urgently needed.\n\n【2】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/02 17:46:04", "endTime": "2024/09/02 17:46:25", "cost": 21.201}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:54", "update_time": "2024-09-02 01:46:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 01:46:05"}

The UN Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents’ Health (2016–30) and the Every Newborn Action Plan (led by UNICEF and WHO) call for an end to preventable stillbirths. A first step to prevent stillbirths is obtaining standardised measurement of stillbirth rates across countries. We estimated stillbirth rates and their trends for 195 countries from 2000 to 2019 and assessed progress over time.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】For a systematic assessment, we created a dataset of 2833 country-year datapoints from 171 countries relevant to stillbirth rates, including data from registration and health information systems, household-based surveys, and population-based studies. After data quality assessment and exclusions, we used 1531 datapoints to estimate country-specific stillbirth rates for 195 countries from 2000 to 2019 using a Bayesian hierarchical temporal sparse regression model, according to a definition of stillbirth of at least 28 weeks’ gestational age. Our model combined covariates with a temporal smoothing process such that estimates were informed by data for country-periods with high quality data, while being based on covariates for country-periods with little or no data on stillbirth rates. Bias and additional uncertainty associated with observations based on alternative stillbirth definitions and source types, and observations that were subject to non-sampling errors, were included in the model. We compared the estimated stillbirth rates and trends to previously reported mortality estimates in children younger than 5 years.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Globally in 2019, an estimated 2·0 million babies (90% uncertainty interval \\[UI\\] 1·9–2·2) were stillborn at 28 weeks or more of gestation, with a global stillbirth rate of 13·9 stillbirths (90% UI 13·5–15·4) per 1000 total births. Stillbirth rates in 2019 varied widely across regions, from 22·8 stillbirths (19·8–27·7) per 1000 total births in west and central Africa to 2·9 (2·7–3·0) in western Europe. After west and central Africa, eastern and southern Africa and south Asia had the second and third highest stillbirth rates in 2019. The global annual rate of reduction in stillbirth rate was estimated at 2·3% (90% UI 1·7–2·7) from 2000 to 2019, which was lower than the 2·9% (2·5–3·2) annual rate of reduction in neonatal mortality rate (for neonates aged <28 days) and the 4·3% (3·8–4·7) annual rate of reduction in mortality rate among children aged 1–59 months during the same period. Based on the lower bound of the 90% UIs, 114 countries had an estimated decrease in stillbirth rate since 2000, with four countries having a decrease of at least 50·0%, 28 having a decrease of 25·0–49·9%, 50 having a decrease of 10·0–24·9%, and 32 having a decrease of less than 10·0%. For the remaining 81 countries, we found no decrease in stillbirth rate since 2000. Of these countries, 34 were in sub-Saharan Africa, 16 were in east Asia and the Pacific, and 15 were in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Progress in reducing the rate of stillbirths has been slow compared with decreases in the mortality rate of children younger than 5 years. Accelerated improvements are most needed in the regions and countries with high stillbirth rates, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Future prevention of stillbirths needs increased efforts to raise public awareness, improve data collection, assess progress, and understand public health priorities locally, all of which require investment.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\n\n【10】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【11】Rate of stillbirth is regarded by the global health community as an important marker of a health system's quality of care during pregnancy and childbirth, but global monitoring of trends in stillbirth rate has been infrequent. Countries and the global health community have given notably less attention to this public health issue than to maternal and child mortality. Stillbirths are missing as a specific target in the Sustainable Development Goals agenda, despite being included in the Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) led by UNICEF and WHO and the UN Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents’ Health 2016–30.\n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【14】Before the release of estimates from the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation, to our knowledge, the only global estimates of stillbirths were published by WHO (latest estimates in 2016) and the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD; latest estimates in 2017). The previous estimates from WHO for developed countries with high quality data were obtained from stillbirth rate data directly, and smoothed with Loess regression. Estimates for all other countries were obtained from a regression model with country-specific intercepts and global regression coefficients. Stillbirth estimates from GBD 2017 were based on a space-time Gaussian process regression model for estimating the stillbirth rate to neonatal mortality rate ratio as a function of educational attainment of women of reproductive age, a non-linear function of the neonatal death rate, location random effects, and random effects for specific data source types nested within each location. The GBD approach used the definitional adjustments developed by WHO.\n\n【15】**Added value of this study**\n\n【16】In this study, we expanded the global stillbirth database and used a new approach to estimate stillbirth rates for all countries during the period 2000–19. We extended and updated the database with more than 2800 country-year datapoints from 171 countries, building on those provided by WHO in 2016. The new estimation model used a Bayesian hierarchical temporal sparse regression model. The model produced estimates that track high quality data while generating covariate-driven trend estimates for countries with limited or no data. The covariate selection extended previous work by introducing sparsity-inducing priors for estimating regression coefficients. The model also introduced new statistical approaches to address various data quality issues. First, we analysed observed stillbirth rate to neonatal mortality rate ratios for the population of interest and excluded ratios that suggested under-reporting of stillbirths as compared with neonatal deaths. Second, we introduced an estimation approach that incorporated observations with alternative definitions of stillbirth (eg, based on ≥22 weeks’ gestational age) into the model with mean adjustment and additional uncertainty associated with such observations. In the model fitting, we accounted for bias and varying sources of random error for data from different sources. Stillbirth rate estimates were obtained for 195 countries from 2000 to 2019. We also estimated stillbirth-associated indicators, such as rates of change, numbers of stillbirths, aggregated regional outcomes, and uncertainty intervals, and assessed time trends in stillbirths to monitor progress in prevention. The estimation method improved on previous methods by allowing for data-driven changes in stillbirth rate with time, taking biases and measurement errors into account and improving the method for covariate selection.\n\n【17】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【18】We estimated that 2·0 million babies (1·9–2·2) were stillborn in 2019, with most stillbirths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Progress in reducing stillbirth rates has been slower than progress in improving child survival. The number of stillbirths has increased in sub-Saharan Africa, with modest decreases in stillbirth rates negated by increases in the number of births. Closing gaps in the data and improving data quality in the regions with the highest stillbirth rates will be a necessary first step crucial to reducing the number of stillbirths. High quality stillbirth data are sparse in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia; these regions accounted for only 17% of the stillbirth data used in the model, while three-quarters of the estimated stillbirths in 2019 occurred in these regions. Although the availability of stillbirth data has increased in recent years, further efforts are needed to improve data collection, data quality, and comparability. Improvements in stillbirth data quality have to occur concomitantly with improvements in women's health and in the provision of antenatal and intrapartum care services for women.\n\n【19】In many administrative registration systems of low-income and lower-middle-income countries, such as civil and vital registration systems or medical birth or death registries (if available), stillbirths are often not recorded, making it difficult to produce reliable and timely stillbirth data and statistics. Data on stillbirth rates in these countries, if available, typically come from health management information systems (HMIS), household surveys, and population-based studies.\n\n【20】The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME), together with its Technical Advisory Group and Core Stillbirth Estimation Group, developed a set of annual stillbirth estimates for the years 2000–19 on the basis of administrative data, household surveys, and population-based study data. Building on the data and methods previously used by WHO and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (London, UK), we improved on previous estimations by expanding their database, estimating definitional adjustments, incorporating an assessment of data quality, and developing a robust estimation model. The initial method that used a regression model for countries with little data resulted in covariate-driven estimates and preselected covariates. With the new robust estimation model, we made use of the advantages of a Bayesian framework combining covariates with temporal smoothing to allow estimates to be data driven for countries where data on stillbirths are available. In this framework we also applied an improved covariate selection process.\n\n【21】In this paper, we estimated stillbirth rates and their trends for 195 countries from 2000 to 2019 on the basis of the work of the UN IGME. We present key findings on the burden of stillbirths and progress in preventing stillbirths at the global, regional, and national levels.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】### Design\n\n【24】For this systematic assessment, we present a summary of the source data and methods; a more detailed description of the methods is available in Wang et al.\n\n【25】We created a database with 2833 country-year datapoints from 171 countries starting in the year 2000 up to the year 2019, updating and further developing the database used in 2016 by WHO. We extracted stillbirth rates from nationwide administrative registration systems such as vital registration systems, medical birth or death registries and HMIS, nationally representative household surveys with pregnancy histories or reproductive calendars, and population-based studies. Subnational population-based study data were sought for all countries without high coverage of routine administrative data from registration systems 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 3–5 )</u>.\n\n【26】Definitional adjustment of stillbirth data was required, given that stillbirths were reported inconsistently in countries according to different combinations of definitional criteria, including gestational age, birthweight, or, occasionally, length at birth, and with varying thresholds 删除2:<u>( panel 1 )</u>. In some instances, no clear criteria or thresholds were provided. These differences make it difficult to compare stillbirth rates and trends across countries and to calculate the global burden, as highlighted previously. We estimated stillbirth rate using a 28 weeks’ gestation or more definition of stillbirth 删除2:<u>( panel 1 )</u>. If information for the 28 weeks’ gestation definition was not available, adjustments and additional uncertainty associated with alternative definitions were accounted for in the model fitting. For each definitional conversion, we estimated the mean and variance associated with the ratio of the expected stillbirth rate based on an alternative definition, to the expected stillbirth rate based on the 28 weeks’ gestation or more definition. For low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), high quality data from studies were used to calculate adjustments and variance; for high-income countries (HICs), national administrative data were used. The World Bank Group income classification of countries from the year 2020 was used.\n\n【27】Panel 1\n\n【28】**Stillbirth definitions**\n\n【29】The term stillbirth generally applies to a baby born with no signs of life after a given viability threshold, with viability typically assessed on the basis of gestational age, birthweight, or length at birth. A stillbirth is defined as the birth of a baby following fetal death before labour (antepartum stillbirth) or during labour or birth (intrapartum stillbirth). Although most stillbirths occur within hours or days of fetal death, occasionally, such as in the case of twins, this can be delayed by months. For international comparisons of stillbirths, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) definition (ICD 10th and 11th revisions) of late fetal deaths is used. ICD defines late fetal death as the in-utero death of a baby (ie, born with no signs of life at birth) with a birthweight of 1000 g or more; or if birthweight is not available, at a gestational age of 28 weeks or more, or (if gestational age is not available), a body length of 35 cm or more at birth. Early fetal death is defined as the in-utero death of a baby (ie, born with no signs of life at birth) with a birthweight of 500–999 g; or, if birthweight is not available, at a gestational age at birth of 22–27 weeks, or a body length of 25–34 cm at birth. Since gestational age and birthweight thresholds do not perfectly correspond, the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) and the Core Stillbirth Estimation Group (CSEG) recommend the use of gestational age rather than birthweight to define a stillbirth. Gestational age is a better predictor of maturity and hence viability; of note, gestational age is the most commonly available criterion across data sources globally. Gestational age is typically measured from the first day of the last normal menstrual period, although in circumstances in which early ultrasound dating scans are available, gestational age should be based on the best obstetric estimate to avoid recall errors and differences in the length of menstrual cycles. Recommendations from the UN IGME and the CSEG also include omitting the birth length criterion and making a clearer distinction between stillbirth and fetal death. These recommendations are under review for inclusion in an updated edition of ICD-11.\n\n【30】Consistent with these recommendations, in this paper we defined a stillbirth as the birth of a baby with no signs of life at or after 28 weeks of gestation. When possible, data with a 28 weeks or more gestation definition were extracted. When data were collected according to a different definition (eg, based on birthweight or an alternative gestational age definition), stillbirth rates were adjusted in the modelling to allow for consistent international comparisons. For the estimates presented in this paper, stillbirth rate was defined as the number of stillbirths at 28 weeks’ gestation or more per 1000 total births (ie, livebirths plus stillbirths).\n\n【31】### Data quality and data exclusion\n\n【32】We assessed the quality of the various types and sources of stillbirth data by evaluating completeness and consistency. Data were excluded if the definition of stillbirth used or the method of data collection was not specified, more than 50% of reported stillbirths had unknown gestational age or birthweight, or coverage of livebirths in administrative registration data systems was estimated to be lower than 80% (or 75% for HMIS). Registration data with incomplete coverage of child deaths (<95%) were also excluded on the basis of WHO completeness assessments that used the same threshold. Additionally, data were excluded on the basis of external information that suggested some stillbirth rate observations were unreliable, for example due to poor quality of the data source, known data quality issues, undercapture of stillbirths, or inconsistency in reported numbers.\n\n【33】As part of the assessment of data quality, the plausibility of the ratio of stillbirth rate (measured according to the 28 weeks’ gestation or more definition) to neonatal mortality rate (for babies aged <28 days) from the same data source was determined. In the case of HMIS data, for which data on neonatal mortality rate might be less reliable than data on stillbirths as neonatal deaths are more likely to occur outside the health facility, or if the HMIS or other data source did not contain neonatal mortality rate, the UN IGME neonatal mortality rate estimates were used to calculate the ratio of stillbirth rate to neonatal mortality rate for assessment purposes. The UN IGME neonatal mortality rates were estimated within a Bayesian hierarchal framework at the country level and aggregated to region and global levels. The observed stillbirth rate to neonatal mortality rate ratios were compared to the distribution of ratios obtained from high quality LMIC study data. We excluded observations with extremely low ratios using methods detailed in Wang et al. In summary, if stillbirths were under-reported relative to neonatal deaths for a country-year datapoint, the associated observed ratio of stillbirth rate to neonatal mortality rate would be lower than the true ratio. To quantify whether an observed ratio from our global dataset was extremely low, we calculated the probability of obtaining a ratio that is smaller than the observed ratio (taking account of the uncertainty associated with the observed ratio) using the distribution of ratios obtained from the high quality data. If this probability was less than 0·05, the observation was excluded from the database. This approach was applied to all observations in the database with 28 weeks’ gestation or more definitions and adjusted definitions 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 5–6 )</u>.\n\n【34】Due to data quality concerns, 1302 (46·0%) of 2833 datapoints on stillbirths were excluded from the model (regional distribution shown in the appendix \\[p 4\\] ). Among 195 countries for which we generated stillbirth estimates, 24 countries had no stillbirth data at all and 38 countries had no good quality stillbirth data, after excluding data according to our criteria 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 37–40 )</u>.\n\n【35】### Estimation of stillbirth rates\n\n【36】We estimated stillbirth rates using a Bayesian hierarchical temporal sparse regression model for all country-years 删除2:<u>( appendix p 6 )</u>. In the model, stillbirth rate was estimated assuming that the logarithm of the observed stillbirth rate plus adjustments and random measurement error equals the logarithm of the true stillbirth rate. Adjustments included those related to application of definition conversions and source type bias. Source type bias was equal to zero for all observations except for those from surveys, which were assumed to have a negative bias associated with them as surveys have been shown to underestimate stillbirths. Random measurement error referred to the sum of the stochastic or sampling error, the random definitional adjustment, and a random error related to source type. Each error was expected to be zero on average but included a variance term that reflected how much uncertainty was associated with the error. The stochastic or sampling error was due to not observing the complete population or survey sampling design. The random definitional adjustment error was non-zero for alternative definitions of stillbirth (ie, not the ≥28 weeks’ gestation definition) and followed from the analysis of the definitional adjustment ratios. The source type error referred to variances specific to source type, which accounted for random errors that might occur in the data collection process, and potential non-representativeness of observations. The distinct data source types considered in the model were administrative registration data (including vital registration systems and birth and death registries), HMIS, household surveys, and population-based studies.\n\n【37】The estimated stillbirth rate (on the logarithmic scale) for each country for the years 2000–19 was given by the sum of a regression function with a country-specific intercept and a country-specific temporal smoothing process. Resulting estimates were a weighted combination of information from adjusted country data and covariates associated with stillbirth rate, and accounted for the varying uncertainty associated with the adjusted observations. If data were precise when accounting for biases, uncertainty, and non-sampling errors, the stillbirth rate point estimates followed the adjusted country data. In cases of no data or imprecise data, the estimates were based on covariates. The uncertainty associated with the stillbirth rate estimates depended on data availability and precision for the respective country-period; uncertainty decreased as data availability and precision increased. Uncertainty in stillbirth rate estimates increased when extrapolating to periods without data.\n\n【38】The candidate covariates were based on a conceptual framework published in 2016 by Blencowe and colleagues. The framework included distal determinants such as socioeconomic factors, inter-related and overlapping demographic and biomedical factors (eg, adolescent fertility rate, maternal age, and malaria prevalence), perinatal outcome markers associated with stillbirth, and access to health care. The covariate data from household surveys, such as coverage of antenatal care visits and proportion of caesarean deliveries, were smoothed with a time-series trend to reduce small fluctuations in measured covariates. In the model fitting, regression coefficients for covariates with low predictive power were shrunk towards zero with sparsity-inducing priors as part of the Bayesian hierarchical temporal sparse regression model. The final covariates used in the model were neonatal mortality rate, low birthweight rate (on a logarithmic scale), coverage of four or more antenatal care visits, caesarean section rate, mean years of schooling of females, and gross national income per capita (on a logarithmic scale). A more detailed description of the model is available in Wang et al and covariate coefficients are available in the appendix (page 10) .\n\n【39】We used a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm implemented with the use of Stan and R package RStan to generate samples from the posterior distributions of stillbirth rate.\n\n【40】### Computation and construction of estimates\n\n【41】Given the inherent uncertainty in stillbirth rate estimates, 90% uncertainty intervals (UIs) are used by the UN IGME instead of the more conventional 95% intervals. Although reporting intervals that are based on higher uncertainty (ie, 95% instead of 90%) would reduce the chance of not including the true value in the interval, the disadvantage of choosing higher uncertainty is that intervals lose their utility in presenting meaningful summaries of a range of likely outcomes when the indicator of interest is highly uncertain. The resulting UIs are not necessarily symmetrical around the point estimates, as stillbirth rates were estimated on the logarithmic scale, but reflect the uncertainty range associated with the stillbirth rates. The UIs for the number of stillbirths generated by the UN IGME do not account for uncertainty associated with other inputs required for calculation, such as the number of livebirths, because uncertainty assessments of these inputs are not yet available. The number of stillbirths was calculated from the number of livebirths estimated by the UN Population Division, according to the formula: number of stillbirths=livebirths × \\[stillbirth rate/(1 – stillbirth rate)\\]. The codes used in the model are available on request. We generated stillbirth rate estimates for 195 countries from 2000 to 2019. We produced regional aggregates from the country estimates and countries within these regions were defined according to UNICEF's regional classifications 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 7–8 )</u> and the World Bank 2020 income classification. We computed the percentage change and the annual rate of reduction with 90% UIs in the stillbirth rate and number of stillbirths for selected periods (2000–19, 2000–09, and 2010–19). The annual rate of reduction was defined as log(rate in t2/rate in t1)/(t1–t2), where t1 and t2 refer to different years (t1<t2). We compare the estimated progress in stillbirth rate with the UN IGME estimates for mortality among children younger than 5 years (neonatal mortality and child mortality at 1–59 months) and the WHO, UNICEF, UN Population Fund, World Bank Group, and UN Population Division estimates of maternal mortality ratio (number of maternal deaths per 100 000 livebirths). We also present the ratio of stillbirth rate to UN IGME neonatal mortality rate estimates (with 90% UIs).\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【42】The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.\n\n【43】</u>\nResults\n-------\n\n【44】Globally in 2019, an estimated 2·0 million babies (90% UI 1·9–2·2) were stillborn at 28 weeks or more of gestation, with a global stillbirth rate of 13·9 stillbirths (90% UI 13·5–15·4) per 1000 total births 删除2:<u>( table )</u>.

The robust stillbirth estimates from our modelling can be used to guide programming, research, and policy, with an ultimate aim to end preventable stillbirths, and to highlight data needs around stillbirths.\n\n【61】The loss of a baby late in pregnancy remains too common. Although the burden is immeasurable for women, families, and society, stillbirths remain a largely unseen and unaddressed problem. In the 20 years since 2000, an estimated 48·2 million stillbirths occurred globally, with an estimated 2 million women and families experiencing a stillbirth in 2019. The slower progress in preventing stillbirths, compared with reductions in neonatal mortality rate and mortality rate in children aged 1–59 months, highlights the insufficient effort and investments in ending preventable stillbirths. Furthermore, our estimates did not show acceleration in preventing stillbirths in the past 10 years globally. Urgent action is needed to accelerate progress and meet the ENAP target of reducing stillbirth rate to 12 or fewer stillbirths per 1000 total births in every country by 2030. National aggregate rates are not an accurate reflection of geographical heterogeneity and sociodemographic inequalities in rates, and, therefore, countries already meeting the ENAP target should work to reduce equity gaps. If current trends continue, a total of 19·5 million babies will be stillborn in 2020–30, a great tragedy for too many babies, women, and families.\n\n【62】West and central Africa, eastern and southern Africa, and south Asia are the regions with the highest numbers and burden of stillbirth. In 2019, the risk of a stillbirth in west and central Africa, eastern and southern Africa, and south Asia was around 8 times, 7 times, and 6 times higher, respectively, than in western Europe. Despite modest decreases in stillbirth rate in the two regions of sub-Saharan Africa, the number of stillbirths has levelled off because small decreases in stillbirth rate were negated by the increase in the number of births. Concerted efforts are needed to accelerate progress in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. With current trends, 56 countries worldwide will not meet the ENAP target by 2030, 48 of which are located in these high-burden regions. 34 countries are projected to meet the target only after 2050, 28 of which are in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n【63】Ending preventable stillbirths does not necessarily require new or innovative interventions. Globally, an estimated 42·3% (95% UI 41·3–46·1) of all stillbirths are intrapartum and almost all of these can be prevented with timely, quality care during childbirth, including ongoing intrapartum monitoring and timely intervention in case of complications 删除2:<u>( panel 2 )</u>. Many antepartum stillbirths are also preventable, as long as evidence-based interventions that improve the health of mothers and their babies along the continuum of care, including during antenatal care, are available and can be accessed. Health system strengthening is as important as clinical interventions in stillbirth prevention to ensure that women and babies at risk can access timely, high quality care, including emergency obstetric care and caesarean section if required. Perinatal audits are a potential useful tool to improve the suboptimal care that contributes to many stillbirths, but these audits need to be implemented as part of an intervention package that includes training and adequate resources, supervision, and mentorship. \n\n【64】Panel 2\n\n【65】**Timing of stillbirth**\n\n【66】Globally, an estimated 832 000 stillborn babies (95% uncertainty interval \\[UI\\] 811 000–990 000) died during labour (intrapartum) in 2019, accounting for an estimated 42·3% (95% UI 41·3–46·1) of all stillbirths. About half of all stillbirths in the two regions of sub-Saharan Africa (47·7% in eastern and southern Asia and 50·7% in west and central Africa) and in south Asia (49·5%) were intrapartum, compared with about 6·4% in western Europe and North America. Overall, an estimated 745 000 babies (712 00–897 000) died during labour in 2019 in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, accounting for 89·5% of all intrapartum stillbirths worldwide.\n\n【67】Intrapartum stillbirth is a sensitive marker of the timeliness and quality of intrapartum care. Action is urgently needed in the regions of sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia to provide interventions, particularly during labour, that could save lives. Gaps in the availability and quality of data have posed challenges to understanding the true burden of intrapartum stillbirths, contributing to insufficient action to reduce such mortality. Although information on intrapartum stillbirths is recorded in birth registers in most health facilities, in many countries appearance of the skin (fresh rather than macerated) is used as a surrogate marker for intrapartum stillbirth. However, this is an unreliable measure. Furthermore, these data are infrequently collated at a national level.\n\n【68】Although the majority of causes of stillbirths can now be prevented with available interventions, further research is needed to improve the prevention, detection, and management of fetal growth restriction, an important factor in many antepartum stillbirths. Currently, the detection of fetal growth restriction is poor, especially in LMICs, and, when detected, the potential gains with current approaches (ie, monitoring fetuses with low fetal weight or biometric parameters) are fairly modest and might result in obstetric intervention and iatrogenic prematurity with its associated risks. One new approach is screening of low-risk pregnancies with continuous wave Doppler ultrasound, which can improve detection of fetal growth restriction (unpublished data) and reduce stillbirth rates.\n\n【69】This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of global stillbirth trends based on the latest data for 195 countries. We build on the previous methods of WHO, making greater use of the available input country-level data and improving the covariate selection process in a Bayesian framework for a better prediction. However, our estimates have several limitations. First, the scarcity of data available limits our ability to make precise estimates. High quality stillbirth data are in particularly short supply in the sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia regions, which accounted for only 17% of the stillbirth data used in the model but were responsible for three-quarters of the estimated stillbirths in 2019. Countries in west and central Africa had, on average, 2·0 datapoints included for the past 20 years, while countries in western Europe had 16·4 datapoints available. Limited data availability results in considerable uncertainty in the estimates. The stillbirth rate estimates are more uncertain than other child survival indicators and, although from point estimates, 115 countries reduced their stillbirth rate by at least a quarter since 2000, only 32 countries achieved that reduction with 95% probability. In the absence of empirical country-year observations, the estimates were covariate driven. Covariates were selected on the basis of both a conceptual framework and predictive power, but the selection was limited by data availability. Data measuring the quality of care of health services were not available, and the coverage of interventions such as the frequency of antenatal visits, was used as a proxy.\n\n【70】Second, stillbirth data are often not standardised and definitional adjustments were necessary, increasing the uncertainty in the estimates. For HICs, corresponding data from administrative sources in these settings were used to estimate the definitional adjustments and, for LMICs, high quality study data were used. The definitional adjustments did not take the magnitude of the stillbirth rate into account and this might have affected estimated adjustments because of missed variations. Even with this approach, 9·6% of the stillbirth data in the database could not be used because a clear definition was lacking or the available definition was not widely used elsewhere and no adjustment factor could be calculated. Consistent with International Classification of Diseases recommendations, we only estimated late gestation stillbirths at 28 weeks or more. This definition underestimates the true burden of all stillbirths because it excludes stillbirths occurring at earlier gestational ages. Studies in HICs indicate that about a third of stillbirths occur at 22–27 weeks of gestation, which was reflected in our definitional adjustments, whereby in high-income settings the stillbirth rate at 22 weeks or more of gestation was 1·5 times the stillbirth rate for stillbirths at 28 weeks or more of gestation. In low-income and middle-income settings the ratio of the 22-week stillbirth rate to the 28-week stillbirth rate was 1·2 删除2:<u>( appendix p 9 )</u>.\n\n【71】Third, our assessment of data quality and source type biases has limitations as the available literature and our understanding of biases in stillbirth data remain poor. We aimed to exclude data of very low quality with a new statistical approach, and estimated source type biases and variance in definitions and data source types. However, further in-depth studies analysing potential reporting biases for stillbirths, early neonatal deaths, and livebirths in surveys, surveillance data, and vital registration data are needed to improve the understanding of these biases and inform future modelling work. Reported stillbirths across all data sources might be influenced by misclassification errors particularly with regards to early neonatal deaths. A few studies analysing survey and surveillance data have shown that the misclassification can occur in both directions, but further research is needed to improve understanding of these biases and develop further data quality assessment criteria. \n\n【72】Lastly, due to limited data availability and poor data quality, we were not always able to distinguish true regional and country effects from data quality issues in empirical observations and covariates. In the absence of data in many LMICs, estimates were driven by covariates and might not fully represent trends within each country. The covariates, or predictors, used in these models also have data limitations. For example, variables on health services, such as antenatal care visits or caesarean section (and variables these relate to, such as skilled birth attendance), while representing coverage of interventions, do not account for all variations in the quality of care that affect stillbirth rates. The estimated ratios of stillbirth rate to neonatal mortality rate in several countries with limited data were lower than ratios derived from high quality data in other countries. Previous studies have reported stillbirth rate to neonatal mortality rate ratios of greater than 1 across varying mortality contexts, with ratios tending to increase with decreasing stillbirth and neonatal mortality rates. \n\n【73】Globally, our estimates are between the previous estimates published by WHO in 2016 and the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) in 2017. WHO estimated 18·4 stillbirths (95% UI 16·6–21·0) per 1000 total births and 2·6 million stillbirths (95% UI 2·4–3·0) worldwide in 2015. Our global stillbirth rate estimate for 2015 was 15·0 stillbirths (90% UI 14·6–16·3) per 1000 total births, with an estimated 2·1 million (90% UI 2·1–2·3) stillbirths. The GBD estimated a global stillbirth rate of 13·1 stillbirths (95% UI 12·5–13·9) per 1000 total births and 1·7 million stillbirths (95% UI 1·6–1·8) in 2016; our stillbirth rate estimate for the same year was 14·7 stillbirths (14·3–16·0) per 1000 total births and 2·1 million stillbirths (2·0–2·3). At the country level, our stillbirth estimates were similar to the modelled stillbirth estimates produced by WHO in 2016 for most countries; they were slightly lower at the global level. Between this study and the WHO analysis, the correlation coefficient of the two sets of country-specific point estimates for 186 countries, with estimates for the years 2000 and 2015, was 0·94. Differences between the two sets of estimates were the result of differences in input data, processing of input data, and modelling approaches. The correlation coefficient of our country-specific point estimates with the GBD point estimates for the year 2016 was 0·87 for 187 countries with estimates available in both sets.\n\n【74】Persistent gaps in stillbirth data, especially in countries and regions with the highest rates and numbers of stillbirths, based on our estimates, can mask the huge burden of stillbirths 删除2:<u>( panel 3 )</u>. This invisibility can result in reduced attention, despite impacts on families and particularly women's mental health and wellbeing. Although there were limitations and uncertainty in the estimates, our findings indicate a large burden of stillbirths, with around 2 million stillbirths occurring annually, and slow progress in reducing the rate of stillbirths in the past two decades especially in high-burden countries. The real burden, including stillbirths from 22 weeks’ gestation, is even higher considering that we only considered late stillbirths. Acceleration is needed in increasing the coverage of interventions via high quality antenatal and intrapartum care to achieve the ENAP target of ending preventable stillbirths, and closing equity gaps. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses increasing new challenges to health-care provision and access to service, requiring additional efforts to reduce stillbirths and accelerate progress. Improved data collection systems and timely and quality data will also help to understand the effect of COVID-19 on stillbirths across the globe.\n\n【75】Panel 3\n\n【76】**Data availability and data quality**\n\n【77】A crucial first step to preventing stillbirths is understanding the burden by accurately measuring stillbirth rates. This measurement is challenging due to poor availability of quality stillbirth data. In this analysis, for 62 countries, accounting for 29% of all stillbirths in 2019, no high quality empirical stillbirth data were available and the stillbirth estimates of the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation were based on a covariate-based model.\n\n【78】To accelerate progress in reducing stillbirths, a focus on reducing data gaps in stillbirth rate data is needed, especially for sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Use of comparable definitions for stillbirths across all countries, strengthening the quality of stillbirth data collection in health management information systems (HMIS), linking vital registration systems with HMIS, and including pregnancy histories in all household surveys will all be important for closing these gaps.\n\n【79】Across all regions, detailed data are needed to better understand when and why stillbirths happen, and to enable improved targeting of interventions to prevent stillbirths. Gaps in data on the timing of stillbirths during pregnancy are large, with high quality information available for only 38 countries. Comparable data on causes of stillbirth in different settings are scarce. Across all country-income groups, regardless of the classification system used, the most frequently reported cause is commonly “unexplained”. In low-income countries, infection and complications during labour and birth remain important causes of stillbirth, while in middle-income and high-income countries stillbirths are more commonly attributed to placental complications; however, data quality for determining causes of stillbirth is generally poor. Improved recording of the timing of stillbirth and causes with a harmonised classification system is urgently needed. In 2016, WHO published the International Classification of Diseases-Perinatal Mortality (ICD-PM) for the application of the ICD 10th revision to deaths during the perinatal period, which is an important step for facilitating comparable reporting of the causes of stillbirths and early neonatal deaths across different settings. ICD-PM is now being used in a number of settings. \n\n【80】Data sharing\n------------\n\n【81】All input data from administrative registration systems, HMIS, household surveys, and population-based studies are available in the public domain with final estimates.

The recommendation was based on data available at the time, evidence from previous outbreaks, and principles underpinning the IHR. It formed an important part of WHO's messaging about how states could effectively respond in a coordinated way. Instead, over the following months, according to WHO, 194 countries adopted some form of cross-border measure—eg, travel restrictions, visa restrictions, border closures, among others—with little reproach from WHO or other actors in the international community. This response is a sharp increase from at most 25% of member states that imposed trade and travel restrictions during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2013–16 outbreak of Ebola virus disease in west Africa. Indeed, WHO's recommendation against measures such as travel restrictions and border closures became a point of criticism of the organisation's role at the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【1】The universal adoption of cross-border measures raises fundamental questions about what coordination means during a pandemic, and what role WHO has in facilitating this. Coordinated action among states in an interconnected world underpins effective prevention, detection, and control of disease outbreaks across countries. As parties to the IHR, governments agree that coordination is important to ensure that measures do not unnecessarily disrupt international trade and travel. Thus, during major disease outbreaks, part of WHO's role is to provide evidence-informed guidance on cross-border measures.\n\n【2】A wider range of cross-border measures have been adopted by countries during the COVID-19 pandemic than in past disease outbreaks. Not all these measures fall under the IHR, but patterns of adoption point to several knowledge gaps. First, what measures have been adopted over time and space not only by member states but also by commercial companies such as airlines and cruise ships? Companies do not fall under the remit of the IHR, but their actions have had clear consequences. There is a need to track the full range of cross-border measures 删除2:<u>( panel )</u> adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the specific requirements they impose, and, for member states, consistency with the IHR.\n\n【3】Panel\n\n【4】**Measures to control cross-border trade and travel related to disease outbreaks**\n\n【5】**International travel**\n\n【6】*   •\n\n【7】    Travel warning\n\n【8】*   •\n\n【9】    Travel advisory\n\n【10】*   •\n\n【11】    Suspend transportation (land, air, and sea)\n\n【12】*   •\n\n【13】    Visa requirement or refusal\n\n【14】*   •\n\n【15】    Expedite entry of selected foreign nationals (eg, farm labourers, health workers)\n\n【16】*   •\n\n【17】    Restrict entry of selected foreign nationals on the basis of nationality, travel history, or health status\n\n【18】*   •\n\n【19】    Close national borders in part or whole\n\n【20】**International trade**\n\n【21】*   •\n\n【22】    Restrict import of specific goods from selected country\n\n【23】*   •\n\n【24】    Expedite import of selected goods (eg, ventilators, active ingredients for drug manufacturing, personal protective equipment)\n\n【25】*   •\n\n【26】    Restrict export of personal protective equipment\n\n【27】*   •\n\n【28】    Impose technical requirements for imported goods (eg, labelling, certification)\n\n【29】**Entry and exit controls at national borders**\n\n【30】*   •\n\n【31】    Compulsory temperature measurement\n\n【32】*   •\n\n【33】    Compulsory questionnaire (eg, symptoms, travel history, contact tracing)\n\n【34】*   •\n\n【35】    Voluntary or compulsory quarantine upon entry\n\n【36】*   •\n\n【37】    Voluntary or compulsory testing upon entry\n\n【38】*   •\n\n【39】    Distribution of public health information at ports of entry\n\n【40】*   •\n\n【41】    Mandatory certification (eg, vaccination, disease free status)\n\n【42】*   •\n\n【43】    Vector control and surveillance (eg, spraying at borders or on airplanes)\n\n【44】Second, the impacts of cross-border measures are not well understood. From a public health perspective, research on past outbreaks—and the even more limited research that exists on cross-border measures during COVID-19—has focused on the impact of travel restrictions on the prevention of disease transmission, for which evidence is mixed. Some studies suggest such restrictions can delay disease spread, whereas other research suggests negligible effects on the overall number of cases. However, studies have not compared effectiveness of cross-border measures across outbreaks caused by different pathogens and focus only on containment but not the mitigation or suppression phases of an outbreak. Other studies suggest certain cross-border measures are counterproductive because they discourage disclosure of potentially relevant information by individuals during screening and by governments seeking to avoid being the target of restrictions. Forced quarantines, visa restrictions, and flight cancellations could hinder the movement of health workers and essential supplies. Importantly, cross-border measures have economic, social, legal, and ethical impacts that can be inequitably experienced if there is insufficient attention to such impacts. Protectionist trade and travel restrictions might maintain public and investor confidence in some affected countries, but could contribute to economic strain and poorer health outcomes in other affected countries, further hindering response efforts. To date, the extent to which these effects vary in terms of the public health threat and the context in which they occur have not been studied. Probing these effects across different stages of the pandemic is important since COVID-19—and the related cross-border measures—will be with us in some form for longer than other major outbreaks of the recent past.\n\n【45】Third, beyond public health rationales, explanations for why governments adopt travel restrictions are largely limited to economic interests and political pressure to “do something”. However, decision making behind the unprecedented cross-border measures adopted during this pandemic needs fuller explanation. Complex considerations could be at play: evolving knowledge about COVID-19; uncertainty about the source of the outbreak or biases about the origin; insufficient clarity of WHO recommendations; timing of the PHEIC declaration; unknown efficacy of specific measures; lack of trust in public health officials; geopolitical dynamics; and epidemiological trends over time. Relatedly, the question of why, when, and how governments decide to lift cross-border measures is largely unexplored in existing research. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most policy attention so far has been on lifting domestic restrictions, but easing cross-border measures—and possibly reintroducing them if there are subsequent waves of new cases—will pose similar challenges for decision makers. Indeed, recent discussion of an Australia–New Zealand “travel bubble” is one example of the coordination challenge of lifting cross-border restrictions. Protecting public health while minimising unnecessary interference with travel and trade has been a core principle of the IHR since adoption of the International Sanitary Regulations by WHO member states in 1951. This longstanding goal, which member states collectively supported by signing the revised IHR in 2005, should not be abandoned lightly. Instead, a comprehensive accounting is needed of what cross-border measures have been adopted during the COVID-19 and past outbreaks, how these measures impact on public health and wider society, and what factors influence decision making. Such information is required to enable evidence-based, real-time decisions on adopting and lifting cross-border measures to mitigate harm during COVID-19 and future outbreaks.\n\n【46】删除9:<u>KL was a member of two donor-funded reviews of WHO in 1995 and 1997, was Co-Director of the WHO Collaborating Centre on Global Change and Health in 2005–10, and chaired the WHO Expert Group on Globalization, Trade and Health.

A World Report in this week's issue describes torture, rape, detentions, and summary executions perpetrated by the Sri Lankan Government against people suspected of involvement in the defeated Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and government critics. Evidence suggests a state-sanctioned campaign rather than isolated incidents and, because of a culture of impunity for the perpetrators (mainly Sri Lankan army, security forces, police officers) and fear of reporting by victims, the true scale of abuse is unknown.\n\n【1】The government and the LTTE also stand accused of committing war crimes in the escalation of violence at the end of the war, which is estimated to have claimed the lives of 40 000 people, mainly civilians. Allegations against the government include large-scale shelling of humanitarian operations and hospitals, and those against the LTTE include point-blank shooting of civilians trying to flee the conflict zone. In March, the UN Human Rights Council voted in favour of an inquiry into suspected war crimes because the government had failed to investigate them properly. However, Sri Lanka has refused to cooperate with such an inquiry.\n\n【2】This deplorable situation stands in stark contrast to positive achievements in health and development. Despite the war, Sri Lanka has the highest Human Development Index rank in South Asia, and the country is on track to meet most Millennium Development Goals. Challenges remain, however, including persistent health disparities between different regions and ethnic groups for indicators such as maternal mortality and infant nutrition. Health infrastructure in the northern and eastern provinces most affected by the conflict is also in need of urgent restoration.\n\n【3】Inequalities and injustices in Sri Lanka present a threat to its future.

However, few experimental or clinical studies address the combined effects of hormone and radiation therapy. Preclinical models have shown changes in tumour cell kinetics with the addition of tamoxifen, and some show reduced tumour cell death with concurrent anti-oestrogen treatment and radiotherapy. Although data from in-vitro studies support the notion of antagonistic effects of concurrent tamoxifen and radiotherapy on tumour cells, in-vivo research suggests a synergistic effect that could be attributable to micro-environmental changes in tumour responsiveness to ionising radiation and hormone therapy. Retrospective studies suggest that in practical application, concurrent administration of tamoxifen with radiotherapy does not compromise local control but might increase toxicity. Preliminary results from simultaneous treatment with aromatase inhibitors and radiation indicate that this combination of endocrine and radiation therapy could enhance cytotoxicity and improve tumour response. Further studies are needed to clarify the physiological mechanisms activated by oestrogens, which will allow a more thorough understanding of the complex interactions between 17beta-oestradiol and P53/P21 WAF1/CIP1 /Rb pathways and of the interaction between endocrine therapy and radiotherapy.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet Oncology_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

We aimed to evaluate the antitumour activity of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment in advanced oesophageal cancer and Siewert type 1 gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 3 study across 168 medical centres in 26 countries. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, histologically or cytologically confirmed, locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic oesophageal cancer or Siewert type 1 gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (regardless of PD-L1 status), measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1, were randomly assigned (1:1) to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo, plus 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (chemotherapy), once every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles. Randomisation was stratified by geographical region, histology, and performance status. Patients, investigators, and site staff were masked to group assignment and PD-L1 biomarker status. Primary endpoints were overall survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) of 10 or more, and overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, and in all randomised patients.删除1-2:<u> 删除8:<u>This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03189719, and is closed to recruitment.</u></u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between July 25, 2017, and June 3, 2019, 1020 patients were screened and 749 were enrolled and randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (n=373 \\[50%\\]) or placebo plus chemotherapy (n=376 \\[50%\\]). At the first interim analysis (median follow-up of 22·6 months), pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was superior to placebo plus chemotherapy for overall survival in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more (median 13·9 months _vs_ 8·8 months; hazard ratio 0·57 \\[95% CI 0·43–0·75\\]; p<0·0001), oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (12·6 months _vs_ 9·8 months; 0·72 \\[0·60–0·88\\]; p=0·0006), PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more (13·5 months _vs_ 9·4 months; 0·62 \\[0·49–0·78\\]; p<0·0001), and in all randomised patients (12·4 months _vs_ 9·8 months; 0·73 \\[0·62–0·86\\]; p<0·0001).

However, it concentrates solely on the immediate period after administration and neglects the potential long-term adverse effects of parenteral iron.\n\n【1】Patients with CKD have an exaggerated risk of cardiovascular death which can partly derive from anaemia, but correction to a normal haemoglobin concentration does not ameliorate, and can exacerbate, this risk. Giving boluses of iron salts can aggravate oxidative stress and thereby potentiate existing, or cause de novo, cardiovascular disease. Infection is already a major cause of mortality and morbidity in dialysis (and cancer) patients; certain microorganisms use iron as a metabolic cofactor and can thus become either more frequent, or more virulent, as causes of infection as a result of iron use.\n\n【2】Our available markers to monitor total body iron (stored and useable) are poor, much the more so in CKD (in which ferritin, also an acute-phase reactant, is even less reliable as a marker of iron stores). The “safe” (ie, anaphylaxis-free) short-term repeated administration of intravenous iron to patients on dialysis might in fact come at the expense of increased risk of medium-term to long-term complications.

The measures follow the takeover of Indonesia's major cigarette manufacturers by transnational tobacco companies (TTCs), which raises the concern that imports will displace domestic production.

The introduction of effective antiretroviral therapies in areas of high HIV-1 prevalence may also contribute to the control of the pandemic, as has been documented in developed countries. Efficient targeting of the extensive genetic diversity of HIV-1 constitutes one of the major challenges in present efforts against the pandemic, although the significance of HIV-1 genetic forms for vaccine development and therapy remains to be defined.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

Patients in ELEVATE UC 52 were enrolled from 315 centres in 40 countries. Patients in ELEVATE UC 12 were enrolled from 407 centres in 37 countries. Randomisation was stratified by previous exposure to biologicals or Janus kinase inhibitor therapy (yes _vs_ no), baseline corticosteroid use (yes _vs_ no), and baseline disease activity (modified Mayo score \\[MMS\\]; 4–6 _vs_ 7–9). ELEVATE UC 52 comprised a 12-week induction period followed by a 40-week maintenance period with a treat-through design. ELEVATE UC 12 independently assessed induction at week 12. The primary efficacy endpoints were the proportion of patients with clinical remission at weeks 12 and 52 in ELEVATE UC 52 and week 12 in ELEVATE UC 12. Safety was evaluated in both trials.删除1-2:<u> ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03945188 and NCT03996369, respectively.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Patients in ELEVATE UC 52 were enrolled between June 13, 2019, and Jan 28, 2021. Patients in ELEVATE UC 12 were enrolled between Sept 15, 2020, and Aug 12, 2021. ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 screened 821 patients and 606 patients, respectively, with 433 and 354 subsequently undergoing random assignment. The full analysis set of ELEVATE UC 52 comprised 289 patients assigned to etrasimod and 144 to placebo. In ELEVATE UC 12, 238 patients were assigned to etrasimod and 116 to placebo. In ELEVATE UC 52, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the etrasimod group achieved clinical remission compared with patients in the placebo group at completion of the 12-week induction period (74 \\[27%\\] of 274 patients _vs_ ten \\[7%\\] of 135 patients; p<0·0001) and at week 52 (88 \\[32%\\] of 274 patients _vs_ nine \\[7%\\] of 135 patients; p<0·0001). In ELEVATE UC 12, 55 (25%) of 222 patients in the etrasimod group had clinical remission compared with 17 (15%) of 112 patients in the placebo group at the end of the 12-week induction period (p=0·026). Adverse events were reported in 206 (71%) of 289 patients in the etrasimod group and 81 (56%) of 144 patients in the placebo group in ELEVATE UC 52 and 112 (47%) of 238 patients in the etrasimod group and 54 (47%) of 116 patients in the placebo group in ELEVATE UC 12. No deaths or malignancies were reported.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Etrasimod was effective and well tolerated as an induction and maintenance therapy in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Etrasimod is a treatment option with a unique combination of attributes that might address the persistent unmet needs of patients with ulcerative colitis.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Arena Pharmaceuticals.\n\n【10】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【11】Ulcerative colitis is a chronic, immune-mediated disease that is characterised by diffuse mucosal inflammation. The goals of ulcerative colitis treatment are to achieve symptomatic control and to improve the endoscopic appearance of the mucosa. Despite numerous approved treatments, many patients do not respond to therapy, or show a reduced response over time. Additionally, many treatments require chronic parenteral administration or are associated with serious infections and malignancies. Therefore, there is a need for safe and effective orally administrated ulcerative colitis treatment options. Although the cause of inflammatory bowel disease has not been fully elucidated, elevated levels of inflammatory T cells in the gastrointestinal tract are characteristic of ulcerative colitis. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a membrane-derived lysophospholipid signalling molecule that is involved in pathophysiological processes via extracellular activation of the cell surface expressed S1P receptor subtypes 1–5 (S1P 1 –S1P 5 ). Modulation of S1P 1 receptors reversibly sequesters specific lymphocyte subsets in lymph nodes, resulting in fewer peripheral immune cells available to traffic to sites of inflammation, such as the gastrointestinal tract in patients with ulcerative colitis. The first-generation non-selective S1P receptor modulator fingolimod was approved for the treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis in 2010. The interaction of fingolimod with S1P 2 and S1P 3 has been associated with serious adverse events, including reduced pulmonary function, malignancies, macular oedema, and cardiovascular effects. Ozanimod, a selective S1P 1,5 receptor modulator, is approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis. Ozanimod avoids interaction with S1P 2 and S1P 3 , potentially reducing the risk of serious adverse events versus fingolimod. The functions of S1P 4 and S1P 5 are not well understood, but evidence suggests they are involved in dendritic cell trafficking and natural killer cell localisation, respectively. Because of an on-target, S1P 1 \\-associated first-dose heart-rate-lowering effect, ozanimod requires a 7-day up-titration regimen in which the identified effective dose is first used on day 8, potentially delaying the onset of symptom relief in patients with ulcerative colitis. The ozanimod parent compound forms major active metabolites that are inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B, which might increase the risk of drug–drug and food interactions. These factors leave a continuing unmet need for the development of a new generation of selective S1P receptor modulators.\n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【14】Etrasimod is an oral, once-daily, selective, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P 1,4,5 ) modulator that is in development for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. In the phase 2 OASIS randomised trial (NCT02447302) and open-label extension study (NCT02536404), patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who received etrasimod showed greater improvements in their modified Mayo score, clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, and symptom relief, beginning as early as week 2, compared with patients who received placebo. We searched PubMed on Oct 10, 2022, using search strings with the terms “etrasimod,” “ulcerative colitis,” “S1P receptor,” and “treat-through design,” with no language or date restrictions to contextualise our findings. This search revealed that, to date, there are no published, phase 3 placebo-controlled trials that use a treat-through design of an S1P receptor modulator in patients with ulcerative colitis.\n\n【15】**Added value of this study**\n\n【16】ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 are two phase 3 randomised trials of etrasimod in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. To our knowledge, ELEVATE UC 52 is the first phase 3 treat-through design trial of S1P receptor modulators in which all patients enrolled in the trial were included in the efficacy evaluation at the end of the 40-week maintenance period without re-randomisation of responders at the end of the 12-week induction period. Etrasimod treatment resulted in improvements in the primary endpoint of clinical remission in both the ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 trials and was well tolerated by patients. Key secondary endpoints for both trials, including endoscopic improvement, symptomatic remission, and endoscopic improvement–histological remission, and sustained clinical remission and corticosteroid-free clinical remission in ELEVATE UC 52, were achieved in patients treated with etrasimod.\n\n【17】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【18】The results of these trials show the potential of etrasimod as an oral, once-daily treatment option for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. Although the past decade has not seen the treat-through design readily used in phase 3 ulcerative colitis programmes, the outcomes of ELEVATE UC 52 suggest that this is an appropriate study design for assessment of the safety and efficacy of new potential treatments for ulcerative colitis.\n\n【19】Etrasimod, a once-daily, oral, S1P receptor modulator that selectively activates S1P 1,4,5 , with no detectable activity on S1P 2,3 , is in development for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases, including ulcerative colitis. Etrasimod is dosed without an up-titration regimen and phase 1 studies suggest that etrasimod is metabolised by three different cytochrome P450s with approximately equal contributions, potentially limiting the risk of drug–drug and food interactions. Treatment with etrasimod (2 mg, once daily) showed significant benefit versus placebo in the 12-week, phase 2 OASIS study and the 36-week, open-label extension study. Here, we report the results of ELEVATE UC 52, which comprised a 12-week induction period followed by a 40-week maintenance period with a treat-through design, and ELEVATE UC 12, which comprised a 12-week induction period only. In these two phase 3 trials, we aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of etrasimod in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.\n\n【20】Methods\n-------\n\n【21】### Study design and patients\n\n【22】We did two randomised, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials. Patients in ELEVATE UC 52 were enrolled from 315 centres in 40 countries. Patients in ELEVATE UC 12 were enrolled from 407 centres in 37 countries. The protocols were approved by the institutional review board at each participating centre. All patients provided written informed consent. Both trials were done in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.\n\n【23】In both trials, eligible patients (aged 16–80 years) had moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (confirmed by endoscopy with ≥10 cm rectal involvement and on the basis of a modified Mayo score \\[MMS\\] of 4–9 with a centrally read endoscopic subscore ≥2 and rectal bleeding subscore ≥1) and a documented history of inadequate response, loss of response, or intolerance of at least one therapy approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Patients with isolated proctitis (<10 cm rectal involvement) at baseline who met other eligibility criteria (based on an MMS of 4–9 with a centrally read endoscopic subscore ≥2 and rectal bleeding subscore ≥1) could enrol in both trials, with enrolment capped at 15% of total patients. Patients were permitted to receive concomitant treatment for ulcerative colitis with stable doses of oral aminosalicylates or corticosteroids (prednisone \\[≤20 mg/day\\], budesonide \\[≤9 mg/day\\], or equivalent), provided that they were on a stable dose 2 weeks or 4 weeks before trial screening, respectively. Investigators were directed to taper corticosteroids in ELEVATE UC 52 after the week 12 assessment. Exclusion criteria included previous treatment with at least three biological agents or at least two biologicals plus a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis; a high risk of requiring a colectomy in the next 3 months (per investigator); a clinically relevant cardiac condition (a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or second-degree or third-degree atrioventricular block); a history of opportunistic infections or macular oedema; or pregnancy or lactation. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 20–26 )</u>.\n\n【24】Demographics including sex at birth were collected at screening as reported by the patient. Only male or female options for sex were provided.\n\n【25】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【26】In both trials, patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to etrasimod or placebo, stratified by previous exposure to biologicals or JAK inhibitor therapy (yes _vs_ no), baseline corticosteroid use (yes _vs_ no), and baseline disease activity (MMS; 4–6 _vs_ 7–9). Participants were centrally assigned to randomised study treatment using an interactive web response system (IWRS) using block randomisation methods stratified by naive to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy at study entry (yes _vs_ no), baseline corticosteroid use (yes _vs_ no), and baseline disease activity (MMS 4 to 6 _vs_ 7 to 9). Block randomisation schedules were computer generated by a vendor with a block size of 6 in a randomisation ratio of 2:1 and distributed to the IWRS vendor (endpointClinical) for participant randomisation. This was a double-blind study with limited access to the randomisation code. The study treatment and placebo tablets and bottles were identical in physical appearance. The treatment each patient received was not disclosed to the investigator, study site staff, patient, sponsor personnel involved with the conduct of the study (with the exception of the clinical supply staff and designated safety staff), or study vendors. LabCorp Drug Development (a subcontractor to the IWRS vendor) generated the live randomisation schedules. Site personnel enrolled participants in the IWRS. The IWRS assigned participants to the trial groups per live randomisation schedules. LabCorp Drug Development didn't have any involvement in the rest of the trial. The IWRS vendor was involved in the rest of the trial for drug supply services (eg, supply and resupply and shipment). Site personnel were involved in participant care and performing trial procedures throughout the trial; however, they were masked to treatment assignment.\n\n【27】The IWRS housed treatment codes and bottle numbers for study treatment. In case of an emergency, the investigator had the sole responsibility for determining if unmasking of a participant's treatment assignment was warranted to provide appropriate medical care. Participant safety was always the first consideration in making such a determination. The IWRS was programmed with blind-breaking instructions to guide the investigator on how to obtain treatment assignment in the event of an emergency unmasking. The investigator was requested to contact the medical monitor promptly in case of any treatment unmasking. If a participant's treatment assignment was unmasked, the sponsor was to be notified within 24 h after unmasking. The date and reason for the unmasking were recorded in the source documentation and electronic case report form, as applicable. Investigators broke the masking for four participants: one in ELEVATE UC 12 (on etrasimod) and three in ELEVATE UC 52 (on etrasimod).\n\n【28】### Procedures\n\n【29】Patients received once-daily oral treatment with etrasimod 2 mg or placebo. ELEVATE UC 52 had a treat-through design that comprised a 12-week induction period followed by a 40-week maintenance period and 4-week follow-up period. Beginning at week 12, all patients could continue their randomly assigned treatment into a 40-week maintenance period; those whose disease had not improved or had worsened compared with baseline (on the basis of investigator judgement), could discontinue treatment and, if objective disease worsening criteria were met (having either or both rectal bleeding subscore ≥2 or rectal bleeding plus stool frequency subscores ≥4 at two timepoints ≥7 and ≤14 days apart), enrol in an open-label extension study (NCT03950232). At the end of week 52, patients could enrol in the open-label extension study 删除2:<u>( figure 1 )</u>.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 trial schematic</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【30】R=randomisation.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【31】ELEVATE UC 12 comprised a 12-week induction period and a 4-week follow-up period. At the end of week 12, patients could enrol in the open-label extension study (NCT03950232). In either trial, patients who did not enrol in the open-label extension study entered a 4-week follow-up period with visits at week 2 and week 4.\n\n【32】Patient demographics and clinical characteristics were collected by study staff during the screening period. MMS, physician's global assessment, and quality-of-life assessments were collected at weeks 0, 12, and 52 for patients in ELEVATE UC 52 and weeks 0 and 12 for patients in ELEVATE UC 12. The complete schedule of assessments and procedures are listed in the appendix 删除2:<u>(p 27)</u> .\n\n【33】MMS was a composite of three assessments (stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and endoscopic subscore), each rated from 0 (none) to 3 (most severe); overall MMS scores range from 0–9, with higher scores indicating greater activity. The total Mayo score was defined as the sum of the rectal bleeding subscore, stool frequency subscore, endoscopic subscore, and physician's global assessment subscore (each subscore on a scale of 0–3); total scores range from 0–12, with higher scores indicating greater activity. Clinical remission was defined as a composite of stool frequency subscore = 0 (or stool frequency subscore = 1 with a ≥1-point decrease from baseline), rectal bleeding subscore = 0, and endoscopic subscore of 1 or less by independent, centrally read assessment (without friability).\n\n【34】Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, modifications were implemented in accordance with regulatory guidance to allow study continuity, maintain compliance with Good Clinical Practice, and ensure data integrity while protecting the safety of patients and clinical site staff.\n\n【35】### Outcomes\n\n【36】The coprimary endpoints in ELEVATE UC 52 were the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission at week 12 (induction period) and week 52 (maintenance period). The primary endpoint for ELEVATE UC 12 was the proportion of patients in clinical remission at the end of the 12-week induction period. Endoscopy images and video recordings of the entire endoscopic procedure were obtained for each endoscopy and were sent for central reading for assessment. The endoscopic subscore was evaluated by the investigator and the central reader. The central read was used for determination of efficacy endpoints.\n\n【37】Key secondary endpoints for ELEVATE UC 52 included endoscopic improvement (endoscopic subscore ≤1, without friability), symptomatic remission (stool frequency subscore = 0 \\[or stool frequency = 1 with a ≥1-point decrease from baseline\\] and rectal bleeding subscore = 0), and endoscopic improvement–histological remission (endoscopic subscore ≤1, without friability) with histological remission (Geboes Index score <2·0 ) at week 12 and at week 52 (referred to as mucosal healing in the protocol and statistical analysis plan). Corticosteroid-free (clinical remission at week 52 and corticosteroid free for ≥12 weeks before week 52) and sustained clinical remission (clinical remission at both weeks 12 and 52) were additional key secondary endpoints assessed at week 52. Other prespecified endpoints included clinical response (≥2-point and ≥30% decrease from baseline in MMS and a ≥1-point decrease from baseline in rectal bleeding subscore or an absolute rectal bleeding subscore ≤1) at weeks 12 and 52; 4-week and 12-week corticosteroid-free remission among patients with baseline corticosteroid use (clinical remission at week 52 and corticosteroid free for at least 4 weeks or 12 weeks immediately before week 52); endoscopic normalisation at week 12 and week 52 (endoscopic subscore = 0); and change from baseline per visit in symptomatic remission, rectal bleeding subscores, stool frequency subscores, rectal bleeding plus stool frequency composite subscores, lymphocyte counts, faecal calprotectin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.\n\n【38】Key secondary endpoints for ELEVATE UC 12 included endoscopic improvement, symptomatic remission, and endoscopic improvement–histological remission at week 12. Other prespecified endpoints included clinical response at week 12, endoscopic normalisation at week 12, and change from baseline per visit in symptomatic remission, rectal bleeding subscores, stool frequency subscores, rectal bleeding plus stool frequency composite subscores, lymphocyte counts, faecal calprotectin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.\n\n【39】The full list of protocol-defined primary and secondary endpoints is included in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 16–19; with endpoints examined in this study defined on appendix pp 30–32)</u>. To ensure that key data from both trials were presented, we prioritised reporting of primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints, and additional secondary efficacy endpoints that were most relevant for clinical decision making. Subsequent publications will report data not included in this manuscript.\n\n【40】Safety was evaluated by adverse event monitoring, clinical laboratory findings, physical examinations, pulmonary function tests, and ophthalmological examinations. Safety endpoints evaluated in both trials included the incidence and severity of adverse events, the incidence and severity of laboratory abnormalities and change from baseline in laboratory values (haematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), and the incidence of clinically significant vital sign abnormalities and changes from baseline. The severity of each adverse event was assessed at the onset by a nurse or physician. When recording the outcome of the adverse event, the maximum severity of the adverse event was also recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0).\n\n【41】### Statistical analysis\n\n【42】Sample sizes for ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 were determined using a two-group Fisher's exact test, a two-sided significance level of 0·05, and a 2:1 randomisation ratio. To achieve at least 90% power to detect a 12·5% difference in clinical remission between the etrasimod group and placebo group at week 12 in either trial and a 13·5% difference at week 52 in ELEVATE UC 52, 420 patients (280 assigned to etrasimod and 140 assigned to placebo) were required for the coprimary endpoints in ELEVATE UC 52 and 330 patients (220 assigned to etrasimod and 110 assigned to placebo) for the primary endpoint in ELEVATE UC 12. Additional details regarding statistical analysis are provided in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 27–29 )</u>.\n\n【43】Consistent with the statistical analysis plan, the primary efficacy analysis was done in patients with a baseline MMS of 5–9 (to align with regulatory body feedback), comprising randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Efficacy analyses were done using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method, stratified by previous exposure to biological or JAK inhibitor therapy (yes _vs_ no), baseline corticosteroid use (yes _vs_ no), and baseline disease activity (MMS; 4–6 _vs_ 7–9). Primary and key secondary endpoints were controlled for multiplicity via parallel gatekeeping procedures that preserved the familywise type I error rate at 5%; significant values for other prespecified endpoints were nominal. Results were expressed as the number of patients in each binary endpoint, percentages, and differences in percentages between the etrasimod and placebo groups with associated 95% CIs and p values. All p values were unadjusted. Two-sided p≤0·05 was considered to indicate a significant difference.\n\n【44】Patients who discontinued the trials for reasons other than worsening disease, lack of efficacy, or ulcerative colitis-related adverse events were considered to have missing data; otherwise, they were considered to have a known outcome of non-response. In the analysis of the primary endpoint and all binary responder-type endpoints, patients with missing data were considered non-responders. For continuous or score-based endpoints, data were analysed as observed in a mixed-effect model with repeated measures. Safety data were listed and summarised by treatment group in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.\n\n【45】An external independent data monitoring committee was used to monitor the safety of participants and to enhance the integrity and credibility of the study.\n\n【46】All analyses were done using SAS (version 9.4 or later).删除1-2:<u> ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , NCT03945188 and NCT03996369, respectively.</u>\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【47】The funder of the study participated in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and review and approval of the manuscript.\n\n【48】</u>\nResults\n-------\n\n【49】Patients in ELEVATE UC 52 were enrolled between June 13, 2019, and Jan 28, 2021.

A total of 265 (92%) patients in the etrasimod group and 124 (86%) patients in the placebo group completed the induction period and 161 (56%) patients and 46 (32%) patients, respectively, completed week 52. The most common reason for discontinuation in either study group during the induction period was withdrawal by the patient. The most common reason for discontinuation in either study group during the maintenance period was disease worsening 删除2:<u>( figure 2 )</u>.\n\n【52】In ELEVATE UC 12, 238 patients were assigned to etrasimod and 116 to placebo, of whom 213 (89%) and 103 (89%), respectively, completed the trial. The most common reason for discontinuation in the induction period for patients in the placebo group was withdrawal by the patient and in the etrasimod group was adverse events. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the treatment groups in both trials 删除2:<u>( table 1 )</u>. As reported by investigators during the screening period, 163 (38%) of 433 patients in ELEVATE UC 52 and 132 (37%) of 354 patients in ELEVATE UC 12 had previous biological or JAK inhibitor experience; however, based on subsequent evaluation of patient medication history, 129 (30%) of 433 patients in ELEVATE UC 52 and 118 (33%) of 354 patients in ELEVATE UC 12 had actual biological or JAK inhibitor

No malignancies were reported in either trial. Elevated liver enzymes were reported in both trials, with a higher incidence in the etrasimod treatment groups. No patients met Hy's Law criteria for elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin in either study. Two patients discontinued treatment in ELEVATE UC 52 because of increased alanine aminotransferase, one of whom had a history of primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the other had all transaminase tests less than 3 times the upper limit of normal 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 48–49 )</u>. Bradycardia or sinus bradycardia was identified as a sponsor-designated adverse event of special interest if the heart rate was less than 40 beats per min, there were associated symptoms (eg, lightheadedness), or the event led to study discontinuation. Across both trials, nine events of bradycardia or sinus bradycardia were reported in patients receiving etrasimod—four in ELEVATE UC 52 and five in ELEVATE UC 12; no events were reported in patients receiving placebo. Of these nine events, five met the criteria for sponsor-designated adverse events of interest. Eight of the nine events were first reported on day 1 and the remaining event was reported on day 2. Two of the events of bradycardia were symptomatic (accompanied by mild or moderate dizziness) and led to study discontinuation; both events resolved without the need for pharmacological intervention. Of the seven asymptomatic events, all were reported on day 1, and three of the patients who had these events discontinued the study. One of the three asymptomatic patients who discontinued the trial had both bradycardia and asymptomatic atrioventricular block second-degree Mobitz type I on day 1. Two additional patients had asymptomatic atrioventricular block on day 1; both events were first degree (one of the two patients was discontinued). One of the atrioventricular block first-degree events was reported as an adverse event before the first study drug dose and did not change 4 h after the dose. All three events of atrioventricular block resolved without administration of interventional treatment. No atrioventricular block second-degree Mobitz type II or higher events were reported in either trial. There were no serious events of bradycardia or atrioventricular block, and no patients had a nadir heart rate less than 40 beats per min 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 50–55 )</u>. 13 patients across both trials had hypertension, but none of these events led to study interruption or discontinuation.\n\n【74】Across both trials, three patients had macular oedema: one patient in the etrasimod group of ELEVATE UC 52 who discontinued because of the event; one patient in the placebo group of ELEVATE UC 12 who continued without study treatment interruption; and one patient in the etrasimod group of ELEVATE UC 12 (who had a preceding moderate adverse event of uveitis) and continued without study treatment interruption. All events of macular oedema resolved.\n\n【75】Discussion\n----------\n\n【76】The results of these two phase 3 trials show that once-daily, oral etrasimod 2 mg had clinical efficacy in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis at week 12 and week 52. In ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12, etrasimod treatment led to a statistically significant improvement in clinical remission at week 12 and week 52. In ELEVATE UC 52, we observed an increase in the proportion of patients who had clinical remission with etrasimod versus placebo at week 52 compared with week 12, indicating a subset of patients who achieved clinical remission after completion of the induction period. All key secondary endoscopic, symptomatic, and endohistological endpoints were met, including corticosteroid-free clinical remission at week 52. All patients with remission at week 52 in ELEVATE UC 52 were no longer taking corticosteroids as part of their treatment. Patients treated with etrasimod had a rapid onset of symptom relief, with symptomatic remission as early as week 2. Patients treated with etrasimod who were naive to previous treatment with biologicals or JAK inhibitors showed clinically meaningful improvements compared with those treated with placebo for induction and maintenance efficacy endpoints. Patients previously treated with at least one biological or JAK inhibitors showed clinically meaningful improvements compared with those treated with placebo for induction and maintenance efficacy endpoints, albeit with smaller treatment effects. These results are consistent with those observed in other advanced ulcerative colitis therapy trials that included biological-naive and biological-experienced patients. The safety profile up to 52 weeks was consistent with previous studies of etrasimod.\n\n【77】Etrasimod is among a new class of small-molecule S1P receptor modulators that target immune-mediated inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis. Our efficacy results for both induction and maintenance are in line with all advanced therapeutic classes for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, including TNFα antagonists, anti-integrin antibodies, anti-IL-12/23 antibodies, JAK inhibitors, or S1P 1,5 receptor modulators. When contextualising our maintenance efficacy results in ELEVATE UC 52, differences in clinical trial design should be noted. After the ACT 1 and ULTRA 2 anti-TNFα clinical studies, which had treat-through designs, all placebo-controlled phase 3 clinical trials that assessed maintenance efficacy in patients with ulcerative colitis had responder re-randomisation designs. Treat-through design studies are consistent with clinical practice, where treatment is not interrupted after a fixed induction period with a potential change to placebo after response, and have been used in studies of S1P receptor modulators in other disease states. This study design allows for an extended placebo-controlled observation period and evaluation of response to treatment beyond the standard induction timepoint. In contrast to responder re-randomisation studies, treat-through design studies do not allow for evaluation of the efficacy of continuing treatment to maintain an induction response versus switching to placebo. Cross-trial comparisons should be evaluated cautiously, as relative efficacy can only be definitively determined by well-designed head-to-head randomised trials.\n\n【78】In both ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12, etrasimod showed a favourable safety profile consistent with previous studies. S1P receptor modulators have been shown to maintain components of immune function, which might provide a measure of immunosurveillance not seen with other classes of advanced treatments. Previous reports in healthy volunteers suggest that etrasimod partly reduced circulating levels of specific subsets of adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells) with no notable effects on natural killer cells and monocytes, innate immunity components that are involved in immune surveillance. Indeed, in the etrasimod development programme, we did not observe an increased incidence of infections (overall infections, herpes zoster, opportunistic, or serious infections) in patients treated with etrasimod compared with patients treated with placebo. This finding contrasts with other classes of advanced ulcerative colitis treatments, which are associated with an increased risk of serious infections. Transient, first-dose heart rate reduction or conduction aberrations are known effects of S1P receptor modulators. As a result, approved labelling for other S1P receptor modulators recommends a pre-first dose electrocardiogram to identify patients with pre-existing cardiac conduction abnormalities. To minimise these first-dose heart rate effects, some previous S1P receptor modulator studies used a dose-titration phase, delaying administration of the effective dose and the largest heart rate decrease until day 8. In our studies, etrasimod was initiated with the full 2-mg dose on day 1. The overall cardiovascular profile of etrasimod was similar to other S1P receptor modulators that had a dose-titration phase. Most events of bradycardia in our trials were mild and asymptomatic. All but one event of bradycardia or atrioventricular conduction delay were reported on day 1 of dosing, and no events were reported after day 2. All events resolved without intervention. Importantly, no serious events of bradycardia or atrioventricular block were reported. S1P receptor modulators have been associated with an increased risk of macular oedema. In approved labelling for other S1P receptor modulators, an ophthalmic evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, is recommended in patients with a history of diabetes, macular oedema, or uveitis. The incidence of macular oedema in our trials was low and similar across treatment groups. No malignancies were reported. Data from the ongoing 5-year open-label extension will provide additional longer-term follow-up information to further elucidate the etrasimod safety profile.\n\n【79】Etrasimod has some distinct features that separate it from other S1P receptor modulators, notably its half-life of approximately 30 h, resulting in a relatively fast wash-out period of 1 week. Presumably due to the fast wash-out period, in both ELEVATE studies absolute lymphocyte counts returned to the normal range for around 80% of patients within 2 weeks after cessation of treatment, which was the earliest planned follow-up visit. Ozanimod has a long-acting active metabolite with a half-life of up to 11 days, requiring up to 55 days (five half-lives) for complete wash-out after treatment cessation. The lingering effects of the active metabolite keep peripheral lymphocyte levels below the normal range in 80–90% of patients up to 90 days after treatment cessation. The faster wash-out for etrasimod might be important for family planning purposes, as there is a paucity of data on the effect of S1P receptor modulators on pregnancy in humans. Additionally, the rapid lymphocyte recovery observed after cessation of etrasimod treatment might be valuable in updating vaccinations and providing a margin of safety in situations where the rate of immune reconstitution is critical.\n\n【80】Our study results should be interpreted in the context of some limitations. Because of the duration of the studies, any conclusions surrounding long-term safety are restricted. Notably, ELEVATE UC 12 took place entirely during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas a large portion of patients in ELEVATE UC 52 were enrolled before the pandemic, which might have affected patient behaviour, potentially affecting the results.\n\n【81】In conclusion, treatment with etrasimod 2 mg was well tolerated and effective as an induction and maintenance therapy for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. As an orally administered small molecule with once-daily dosing, durable efficacy, and a favourable safety profile, etrasimod is a treatment option with a unique combination of attributes that might address the persistent unmet needs of patients with ulcerative colitis.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n\n【82】All authors meet the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors criteria for authorship for this Article, take responsibility for the integrity of the work as a whole, were involved in drafting and critical review of the manuscript, and approved the final version for submission.

This finding confirms and extends the results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) in which the incidence of diabetes was lower in hypertensive patients on lisinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, than on amlodipine.

We aimed to develop and validate a genotype-guided model for determining personalized initial dose of tacrolimus.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】By combining pharmacokinetic modeling, pharmacogenomic analysis and multiple statistical methods, we developed a genotype-guided model to predict individualized tacrolimus initial dose after LT in the discovery (n = 150) and validation cohorts (n = 97) respectively. This model was further validated in a prospective, randomized and single-blind clinical trial from August, 2021 to February, 2022 (n = 40, ChiCTR2100050288).\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Our model included donor's and recipient's genotypes, recipient's weight and total bilirubin, which achieved an area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC of ROC) of 0.88 and 0.79 in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. We found that patients who were given tacrolimus within the recommended concentration range (RCR) (4–10 ng/mL), the new-onset metabolic syndromes are lower, especially for new-onset diabetes (p = 0.043). In the clinical trial, compared to those in experience-based (EB) group, patients in the model-based (MB) group were more likely to achieving the RCR (75% _vs_ 40%, p = 0.025) with a more variable individualized dose (0.023–0.096 mg/kg/day _vs_ 0.045–0.057 mg/kg/day). Moreover, significantly fewer medication adjustments were required for the MB group than the EB group (2.75 ± 2.01 _vs_ 6.05 ± 3.35, p = 0.001).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Our genotype-based model significantly improved the initial dosing accuracy of tacrolimus and reduced the number of medication adjustments, which are critical for improving the prognosis of LT patients.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Natural Science Foundation of China, Shanghai three-year action plan, National Science and Technology Major Project of China.\n\n【10】</u>\nKeywords\n--------\n\n【11】*   Tacrolimus\n*   Liver transplantation\n*   Pharmacogenomics\n*   Precision medicine\n\n【12】Research in context\n\n【13】### Evidence before this study\n\n【14】The initial dose of tacrolimus after liver transplantation is critical for rapidly achieving the steady state of the drug concentration, minimizing potential adverse reactions, and warranting long-term patient prognosis. Current strategies to guide personalized tacrolimus (based on weight and/or based on the _CYP3A5_ genetic variants) have not shown an accurate and reliable predictive performance of tacrolimus initial dose.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】Via the discovery cohort (n = 150), an independent validation cohort (n = 97), and a pilot prospective clinical trial (n = 40), respectively, we developed and validated a pharmacogenomics-based model to determine the initial dose of tacrolimus after liver transplantation. Compared to the experience-based tacrolimus dosing paradigm, our model was proven to significantly reduce the number of dose adjustments and was more likely to achieve the recommended steady-state therapeutic range, which potentially reduces the risk of new-onset diabetes due to tacrolimus overdose.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】Our study, for the first time, established a new pharmacogenomics-guided model that significantly improved the initial dosing accuracy of tacrolimus, reducing the number of medication adjustments, with the potential to improve the prognosis of LT patients as well. Further long-term safety and efficacy of the model should be evaluated in the full randomized clinical trial.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Tacrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor and the mainstay immunosuppressant used after solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Sufficient immunosuppression is essential for suppressing allograft rejection and increasing the survival rate of transplantation. On the other hand, tacrolimus overdosing can lead to serious adverse drug reactions, such as infection, diabetes, and renal insufficiency. However, the narrow therapeutic index and large inter-individual variabilities of tacrolimus concentration complicate its routine dosage adjustment. Inter-patient dosage requirement of tacrolimus is more than 20-fold (0.5–10 mg/day). Among patients in East Asian countries, it was demonstrated that maintaining balanced immunosuppression requires only half of the empirical dosage recommended by current standard guidelines primarily based on recipient's weight. Whereas, we found that even with the same weight-based dosing, the inter-individual trough concentration varied greatly, considering that a large variation exists in preoperative weight and postoperative weight, particularly in patients undergoing liver transplantation (LT) with ascites or hydrothorax. Besides, a series of clinically contributing factors containing donor liver quality, warm ischemia time, cold ischemia time, transplanted liver cell regeneration, hematocrit, albumin etc. also have an impact on tacrolimus metabolism. Thus, a precise, personalized strategy to determine the initial dose of tacrolimus is important for achieving an accurate use of this drug and a better long-term outcome.\n\n【21】In recent years, the pharmacogenomics approach based on patients' genotypic information has been demonstrated robust to predict individualized response to drug efficacy and safety. Genetic factors account for more than 50% of the variability in tacrolimus prescription. Enzymes in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A family are responsible for the oxidative metabolism of tacrolimus. Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of the genetic variation (rs776746, or ∗3) of _CYP3A5_ gene in tacrolimus metabolism. Recent guidelines for the use of tacrolimus proposed by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) provide preliminary suggestions relevant to the rs776746 genotype and tacrolimus dosing. In this CPIC guideline, according to the genotype of the _CYP3A5_ gene, the recipient's tacrolimus metabolism phenotype was assigned to 3 categories, namely Extensive Metabolizer (EM) for individuals carrying two functional alleles; Intermediate Metabolizer (IM) for individuals carrying one functional allele and one nonfunctional allele; and Poor Metabolizer (PM) for individuals carrying two nonfunctional alleles. This simple CPIC-EIP (EM, IM, PM) classification for tacrolimus is recommended broadly for many organ transplant operations, including kidney, heart, lung, and liver transplants in which the donor and recipient genotypes are identical. \n\n【22】However, the current CPIC-EIP classification has limitations in its application to allogeneic LT. First, the liver plays important role in the metabolism of tacrolimus. Almost all clinical LT is allogeneic. Therefore, the recipient's and donor's genotype are often different. Second, the majority of pharmacogenomic studies on tacrolimus and _CYP3A5_ variants were conducted in Caucasian populations. However, the allele frequency of rs776746 is highly variable among different ethnic groups. For example, according to the dbSNP 删除1:<u>( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp )</u>, the frequency of the major loss-of-function allele (A) of rs776746 of _CYP3A5_ , ranging from 7% among the Caucasian population to around 30% among East Asians, and 70% among African or African-American populations. This population difference may lead to differential clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) outcomes. Therefore, the current guideline mainly based on the limited data in Caucasian patients may not apply well to the patients of other ethnic groups. There is thus far no sufficient data supporting a pharmacogenomic assessment for Chinese and East Asian liver transplantation patients. Third, the CPIC-EIP classification only considers the _CYP3A5_ genotypes without taking into account of other important factors, e.g. other genetic and non-genetic markers. This is extremely important, since other genes and factors may also contribute to the metabolism and/or excretion of tacrolimus. Meanwhile, among the early stage of the post-transplantation recovery, the donor liver function is not fully restored, and markers reflecting the liver function status is important to be considered for adjusting the initial dose of tacrolimus. Taken together, there is an urgent need to construct a specific dosing strategy to guide personalized tacrolimus use for liver transplantation patients among East Asian populations and beyond.\n\n【23】In this study, we aimed to develop and externally validate a model to predict individual tacrolimus metabolism integrating the donors' and recipients’ genotypic data and other important clinical information for LT patients. More importantly, for the first time, we converted the predictive model to a personalized recommendation tool of initial dose and to verify in a randomized pilot trial that the model-based dosing strategy is superior to the traditional experience-based strategy for LT patients.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Study design and subjects\n\n【26】The study consists three independent cohorts 删除2:<u>( Fig. 1 )</u>: a discovery cohort, a validation cohort and a randomized, single-blinded pilot trial.\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 1 **Flow diagram of the study.** Patients were divided into a discovery cohort (n = 150), a validation cohort (n = 97) and a prospective trial (n = 40).

Informed consent was obtained from all donors and recipients. No donor organs were obtained from executed prisoners or other institutionalized persons.\n\n【32】### Intervention\n\n【33】All patients underwent orthotopic LT, during which a healthy donor liver was placed in the recipient's anatomical location after the original liver was removed. Immunosuppression regimens of LT recipients included tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with basiliximab induction according to the guideline. Tacrolimus was administered orally twice daily after the operation starting with an initial dose and continuously adjusted by TDM. 1 mg dose of MMF was given before the operation, and the postoperative MMF at dosage of 750 mg at each administration twice a day. 500 mg of methylprednisolone was only given intravenously before the portal vein was reopened intraoperatively. On postoperative day 1 and day 4, 20 mg of basiliximab was given intravenously.\n\n【34】In the pilot trial, all recruited patients were 1:1 randomized into the model-based (MB) initial-dosing group or the experience-based (EB) initial-dosing group. The EB group started with an initial dose (0.05–0.07 mg/kg/day) determined by experienced clinician who know all the genetic data. The MB group started with an initial dose given by our developed dose recommendation model. Afterwards, both groups received TDM dose adjustment ( Protocol in supplementary ).\n\n【35】### Model development\n\n【36】Our workflow of model development included five major steps (as shown in Fig. 1 ): (1) Pharmacokinetic modeling; (2) Candidate gene/SNP selection; (3) PK prediction model; (4) Dose recommendation model; (5) web-based calculator.\n\n【37】#### Step 1: Pharmacokinetic modeling\n\n【38】We performed population pharmacokinetic modeling based on the daily collected tacrolimus dosage and blood concentration of 150 patients from the discovery cohort, using nonlinear mixed-effect model (NONMEM) implemented by R. One- and two-compartment pharmacokinetic models with first-order absorption were compared and chosen according to the goodness of fit of models. Parameters included the tacrolimus clearance rate (CL) and volumes of distribution (V). Elimination half-life (τ) was estimated accordingly. To address the variation of metabolism over time, we allowed the parameters to change by week for each subject.\n\n【39】#### Step 2: Candidate gene/SNP selection\n\n【40】Candidate SNPs were selected based on analysis of the first 115 patients from the discovery cohort. The genotypic data (1936 loci of 225 genes) of these patients (both donors and recipients) was collected using the pharmacogenome-wide DMET plus Microarray by Affymetrix Inc. The gene selection used following criteria: 1) The association p-value between individual genotype and the estimated elimination half-life (τ) from Step 1 is less than 0.05; 2) SNPs have a minor allele frequency >0.1; 3) a representative SNPs in a linkage disequilibrium block with R-square > 0.5; and 4) Exonic and UTR SNPs were preferred over intronic ones.\n\n【41】#### Step 3: C/D prediction model\n\n【42】We constructed a generalized linear model to predict initial C/D (the blood concentration of tacrolimus at 24 h/the initial daily dose of tacrolimus) based on all the 150 patients from the discovery cohort. Candidate predictors included the 34 SNPs selected in Step 2 and clinical characteristics of age, sex, height, weight, total bilirubin (TB), direct bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase, and hemoglobin. Predictors in the final model were selected using Lasso regression. The last 35 patients in the discovery cohort were genotyped for selected SNPs using PCR Sequenom MassARRAY SNP-genotyping platform, so as the patients in the validation cohort and the pilot trial.\n\n【43】#### Step 4: Dose recommendation model\n\n【44】For convenience of clinical practice, we converted the C/D prediction model into a dose recommendation form. The recommended initial daily dose of tacrolimus was given as:\n\n【45】I n i t i a l d o s a g e \\= r o u n d \\[ T a r g e t b l o o d c o n c e n t r a t i o n p r e d i c t e d ( i n i t i a l C / D ) × m i n d o s e \\] × m i n d o s e ( m g )\n\n【46】The target blood concentration of tacrolimus is determined to balance the risk of acute rejection and new-onset diabetes according to our data. The mindose is the minimum dose of tacrolimus drug pill currently available in clinical practice. “round” is the discretization function.\n\n【47】#### Step 5: Web-based calculator\n\n【48】We developed a web-based online calculator to conveniently implement our dose recommendation model using the Shiny package of R 删除1:<u>( https://liverstudy.shinyapps.io/tacrolimus\\_initial\\_dose/ )</u>.\n\n【49】The analysis strategy of our workflow is to use the pharmacokinetic data during 4 weeks to select candidate gene, but only use the pharmacokinetic data of the first 24 h to build the final predictive model. This analysis strategy is picked from several possible strategies based on the consideration of bias-variance trade-off. More detailed explanation was included in supplementary materials 删除2:<u>( Fig. S1 )</u>.\n\n【50】### Model evaluation\n\n【51】#### C/D prediction model\n\n【52】The prediction performance of our C/D prediction model was evaluated by two approaches. First, the scatter plot was made and the assumption of linearity was checked, Pearson correlation was then used to compare the observed and model-predicted blood concentrations of tacrolimus at 24 h after the first dose. Second, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate our model's discrimination capability to distinguish fast and slow tacrolimus metabolizers (fast/slow were dichotomized by median of population). These evaluations were conducted both in the discovery cohort and the independent validation cohort.\n\n【53】#### Dose recommendation model\n\n【54】The clinical utility of our dose recommendation model was evaluated using the proportion in range (PIR) defined as the proportion of patients whose C24 falls within the recommended concentration range (RCR, 4–10 ng/ml) among all patients who took tacrolimus, where C24 is the tacrolimus blood concentration measured at 24 h after the initial dose and before the next dose. In the discovery and validation cohort, we use the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) regression method to estimate PIR with respect to different initial dosing strategy. In the pilot trial, PIR was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include: (1) The incidence of acute rejection confirmed by biopsy within three months after LT; (2) The number of tacrolimus dose adjustments given due to incomplete immunosuppression; (3) PIR within one week after liver transplantation; (4) The incidence of new-onset diabetes within six months after LT; (5) One-year survival rate after LT; (6) Recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma with standards of UCSF after LT during the follow-up period; (7) Quality of life within twenty-eight days, three months, six months, and one year after LT; (8) Direct and indirect costs associated with the treatment and management of LT recipients; (9) The incidence of acute rejection is confirmed by biopsy during the follow-up period.\n\n【55】### Statistical analysis\n\n【56】In most cases, we used the residual plot to observe whether the residual distribution significantly deviated from normality assumption. The association between gene polymorphisms and tacrolimus pharmacokinetics was studied with ANOVA analysis. Multiplicity was adjusted by the FDR method. Homogeneity of variance test for tacrolimus blood concentration was performed using Levene's test. The model predicting tacrolimus pharmacokinetics was constructed by a multivariate generalized linear model with the lognormal distribution. Model selection was performed according to BIC criteria. The log transformation of predictive variables and interaction terms were also considered during model selection. All statistical analysis was performed using R (version 3.6) software. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium and haplotype analysis were analyzed using PLINK software. There was less than 10% of missing value in the development and validation cohort, and no missing value of the primary endpoint in the pilot trial. Typical missing values were imputed with the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. It should be noted that these missing values were due to that patients were in stable state so that the clinicians decided there were no need to repeat the laboratory test. Therefore, these are not missing data at random. The sample size of the randomized trial was estimated according to the result of the validation cohort. The primary endpoint between two groups was compared with chi-square method. p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【57】None of the funders had any role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation or writing.

This is especially an issue for populations in China and East Asian counties, where the conventional dosage of tacrolimus is nearly half of the internationally recommended dose. Our study for the first time established a dose recommendation model for tacrolimus and showed that the model-based initial dosing strategy is a promising way to improve prognosis of LT patients, which has a great potential to shift the current paradigm for the use of tacrolimus in LT patients among East Asian populations and beyond.\n\n【92】There is currently a global advocation to minimize anti-rejection therapy for organ transplantation. We chose the targeted trough concentration for tacrolimus ranging 4–10 ng/mL by considering the following rationale. First, genetic background in different ethnic groups is a crucial factor leading to the different tacrolimus dosages used in Eastern and Western transplant recipients. It was demonstrated that the trough levels of tacrolimus in East Asian are lower than in White population, with the 5th and 95th percentile among the East Asian population ranging around 4–10 ng/mL in a large inter-ethnic comparison study and in our discovery and validation cohorts. Second, tacrolimus overdosing leads to serious adverse drug reactions. Jia's study in Chinese LT patients showed strategy by targeting 5–10 ng/mL of tacrolimus was beneficial in terms of long-term survival after LT, and did not increase the incidence of adverse reactions or graft rejection. Third, in line with the aforementioned findings, our analysis on retrospective cohorts suggested 4–10 ng/ml may be an appropriate target range of tacrolimus blood concentration balancing the new-onset metabolic syndromes and acute rejection incidence. Our finding also suggested that the earlier to achieve target range, the better the prognosis of LT patients.\n\n【93】Our model was validated internally and externally in an independent cohort, as well as in a prospective clinical trial. All of these validations consistently confirmed that our model can serve as a safe and effective clinical decision-making tool for personalizing tacrolimus initial dose to quickly achieve desired blood concentration range within 24h (75% _vs_ 40%, p = 0.025), as compared to the conventional decision based on the clinician's experience. Furthermore, we found the model-based initial dose required less dose adjustments in the prospective randomized trial (2.75 ± 2.01 _vs_ 6.05 ± 3.35, p = 0.001). The pilot trial also showed that with the user-friendly web calculator and developed PCR panel of selected SNPs, the model-based dosing strategy is feasible and convenient in real-world clinical practice.\n\n【94】Our final model includes six predictors, four SNPs (donor's and recipient's _CYP3A5_ rs776746, recipient's _SLCO1B1_ rs4149015 and _CHST10_ rs3748930) and two clinical variables (recipient weight and TB). Our finding confirmed the well-established _CYP3A5_ polymorphism rs776746 has the greatest impact on tacrolimus metabolism among all gene variants. But surprisingly recipient's _CYP3A5_ polymorphism plays a more important role than the donor's. _SLCO1B1_ encodes the protein of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1, is highly expressed in the liver and is involved in the biliary excretion of tacrolimus. _CHST10_ (Carbohydrate Sulfotransferase) encodes an enzyme adds sulfate to glucuronic acid to form a carbohydrate antigen, HNK -1 that is capable of transferring sulfate to glucuronidated steroid hormones and other lipophilic drugs to facilitate their excretion via urine. The three recipient SNPs in the model suggested that drug distribution/elimination in extrahepatic organs such as intestine may be especially important in the early phase since the liver-related drug elimination may be weak before the restoration of liver function. Body weight of the recipient affects the apparent volume of distribution. Changes in total body fat or water mass due to the transplant may also affect the distribution and metabolism of tacrolimus. The TB in the model is a critical liver function and metabolism marker which may reflect the status of the liver function restoration. In the early period after LT, liver function may change rapidly and excessive drug dose can easily overwhelm the liver function capacity and lead to poisoning. In summary, our study demonstrated that integrating both donor and recipient's genotypes as well as relevant clinical factors is critical in constructing accurate predictive models for personalized medication.\n\n【95】Our study has several limitations. First, due to the limited sample size and follow-up time, our study does not have sufficient power to conclude the impact of different initial dosing strategy on long-term prognosis. Our randomized trial is primarily focused on the PIR, instead of long-term prognosis, therefore should be only considered as a pilot trial. Second, we did not consider the factors of concomitant medicine and food, which may also impact the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus. Lastly, given the population differences in genetic allele frequency and other genetic variations, our model was primarily established based on a Chinese patient population. Therefore, the tools we have generated and data interpretation should be limited to Chinese or possibly East Asian populations. Whether our model can be generalized into other populations needs further investigation.\n\n【96】In conclusion, we for the first time developed a precision medication model capable of recommending the optimized initial dose of tacrolimus for LT patients. With the expansion of our ongoing clinical trial in a multicenter, randomized, single-blind study, our model would significantly close the gap in the current clinical practice and further improve the prognosis of LT patients.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【97】Conceptualization: Zhihai Peng; Methodology: Weituo Zhang, Yuan Liu, Liyun Yuan, Junjie Xia, Lin Zhong; Investigation: Tonghai Xing, Jinyan Zhang, Haitao Gu, Zhaowen Wang, Zhaojie Su; Data collection: Yuan Liu, Peihao Wen, Wenzhi Guo, Jie Wang, Wenbin An, Peizhen Wen, Tonghai Xing, Jinyan Zhang, Haitao Gu; Visualization: Zhaojie Su, Junjie Xia, Rui Wang, Dehua Liu, Shiquan Xu; Funding acquisition: Zhihai Peng; Supervision: Zhihai Peng, Weituo Zhang, Hao Li; Writing – original draft: Baojie Shi, Junwei Fan, Yuan Liu, Weituo Zhang, Liyun Yuan, Jie Wang; Writing – review & editing: Zhihai Peng, Hao Li.\n\n【98】Data sharing statement\n----------------------\n\n【99】All data can be viewed in NODE 删除1:<u>( http://www.biosino.删除1-1:<u>org/node )</u> by pasting the accession (OEP000278) into the text search box or through the URL: http://www.biosino.org/node/project/detail/OEP000278 .</u>\n\n【100】Declaration of interests\n------------------------\n\n【101】The authors of this manuscript have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\n【102】Acknowledgements\n----------------\n\n【103】We thank the funding supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.

Alagille syndrome is a cholestatic liver disease that leads to pruritus, xanthomas, and impaired quality of life. Surgical interventions to interrupt the enterohepatic bile acid circulation or liver transplantation are often pursued because there are no approved medical therapies. ASBT has a key role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids because it absorbs approximately 95% of bile acids from the terminal ileum. Because intrahepatic bile acids are thought to be the main driver behind hepatocellular injury in cholestatic diseases, pharmacological inhibition of ASBT has the potential to not only improve pruritus, but also disease trajectory. Studies in mouse models of cholestasis have shown that ASBT inhibition can decrease intrahepatic bile acid concentrations and improve fibrosis and disease progression. \n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

There is massive variation between, say, trials of prevention and advanced disease, and within trials, between cancer centres and clinicians.\n\n【3】No matter how carefully designed a trial is from a scientific perspective, its ultimate success depends on the cooperation of those most important research partners, the patients. Yet, too often the patients' perspectives are ignored in developing and designing studies, resulting in two key problems. First, the study design might be unacceptable to patients or the study question might seem irrelevant, illegitimate, or one to which affected patients ascribe little priority. Second, the vitally important processes of recruitment (explanation, information, support) might be poorly managed. These elements are the most under-researched and poorly understood of trial practices. The writing of patients' information leaflets, for example, is sometimes seen as an irritating hoop to be jumped through for the sake of complying with ethics committee requirements. The task might be delegated to junior team members. The situation is not helped by the absence of systematic research-based guidelines on patients' own priorities for leaflets.\n\n【4】If finite research money is to be used equitably and well, thorough exploratory groundwork by all stake-holders is needed to assess feasibility, relevance, and acceptability. In the trials you mention in your editorial, women were offered entry into two chemoprevention trials, a study of risk-reducing mastectomy or a study of breast screening by magnetic resonance imaging, whereas those not wishing to take part in any studies were offered annual mammography. Doing pretrial qualitative research, or, later, surveys of refusers or women who chose annual mammography, would have been extremely useful. Such research might perhaps show, for example, that some women opting for mammographic screening believe that screening is preventive, not diagnostic. Inadequate information, media hype, and endorsement by advocacy groups might contribute to women's faith in screening at the expense of the trial option.\n\n【5】Addressing core problems of poor information provision in all health-care areas, undertaking research endeavours owned by all stakeholders, not just the scientific community, might lead to fewer but higher-quality and more-relevant truly successful studies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:54:55", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:55:03", "cost": 8.146}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:54", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:55:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:54:55"}

The omicron wave, with its high transmissibility and milder course than previous variants, especially for people who are fully vaccinated and without comorbidities, is abating in many countries. Restrictions are being relaxed, and people are slowly returning to pre-pandemic activities, including gatherings, office-based working, and cultural events. Mask mandates are being lifted in many countries. Testing and surveillance have decreased and travelling is recommencing widely. People are understandably exhausted and want to forget about the pandemic. This would be a grave mistake.\n\n【1】First, the pandemic situation is not the same everywhere in the world. China, for example, continues to employ its so-called dynamic zero COVID strategy of mass testing, quarantining of those testing positive, and lockdown of districts or even whole cities (most recently Shanghai). Chinese authorities have been harshly and ruthlessly implementing these measures, without much consideration for human costs. The goal is, according to Chinese officials, to avoid further spread, to protect the health system, and to avert deaths. The problem is that older and vulnerable people are often not fully vaccinated, and the efficacy of the licensed vaccines is suboptimal. For China, the top priority must be to accelerate an effective vaccination strategy. The current approach is not a long-term solution for Chinese people.\n\n【2】Second, the global vaccination strategy is far from on track. Unacceptable vaccine inequity persists. WHO's goal of complete vaccination in at least 70% of people in every country by June, 2022, is way out of reach. Although 59·7% of people globally have received two vaccine doses, in more than 40 countries fewer than 20% are completely vaccinated. Even in high-income countries, a sizeable proportion of the population continue to refuse vaccination. The emergence of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant is almost inevitable with continuous high transmission rates. The BA.4 and BA.5 omicron subvariants first seen in South Africa are being monitored closely. Continuing vigilance is needed everywhere.\n\n【3】Third, vaccine inequity is mirrored by slow and delayed access to one of the few effective oral treatments for COVID-19—paxlovid. When taken early, paxlovid reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death by 89%. Although high-income countries are ordering millions of doses from the manufacturer, Pfizer, mechanisms to make paxlovid available in low-income and middle-income countries via the Medicines Patent Pool are slow. An agreement has been reached with 35 generic manufacturers in 12 countries, but is not expected to deliver the drug before 2023.\n\n【4】Finally, now is the time to plan, learn from mistakes, and create strong resilient health systems, as well as national and international preparedness strategies with lasting funding. Capacities of health systems need to be strengthened, not only to be ready for future pandemics, but immediately to deal with the delays in treatment, diagnosis, and care for other diseases after the disruption of the past 2 years. Catch-up vaccine campaigns for diseases such as measles are urgently needed. Preparedness plans, both nationally and internationally, must have a strong emphasis on early data sharing and transparent surveillance. One Health should be the underlying principle, with simultaneous consideration of both human and animal health. At the 75th World Health Assembly (May 22–29, 2022), there is an opportunity to examine progress in revising the International Health Regulations and to discuss further a pandemic treaty—the process for a treaty has been far too slow. The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body's progress report is not expected until 2023.\n\n【5】Nationally, countries need independent inquiries into their responses to COVID-19. Learning from mistakes is never easy and governments can be reluctant to even accept that they have been made. When the UK High Court ruled last week that it was unlawful to discharge hospital patients to care homes without COVID-19 testing, the UK Government claimed to have acted on the best evidence available at the time. This is a blatant lie. The evidence for asymptomatic transmission was clearly available by late January, 2020.\n\n【6】Now is not the time to turn away from COVID-19 or rewrite history. It is time to vigorously engage, redouble efforts to end the acute phase of the pandemic in 2022 for all, and lay strong sustainable foundations for a better future with clear accountabilities and honest acceptance of uncomfortable truths.\n\n【7】删除1-1:<u>For more on the **WHO plan on COVID-19 vaccination** see https://www.who.int/news/item/23-12-2021-achieving-70-covid-19-immunization-coverage-by-mid-2022</u>\n\n【8】删除1-1:<u>For the **preliminary programme of the 75th WHA** see https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf\\_files/EB150/B150\\_40-en.pdf</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2022 Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【9】### Publication history\n\n【10】Published: 07 May 2022\n\n【11】### Identification\n\n【12】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00817-0</u>\n\n【13】### Copyright\n\n【14】© 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\n\n【15】### ScienceDirect\n\n【16】Access this article on ScienceDirect\n\n【17】COVID-19: the next phase and beyond\n\n【18】*   \n\n【19】Hide Caption Download See figure in article\n\n【20】Toggle Thumbstrip\n删除4:<u>\n*   Figure</u>\n\n【21】删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download .PPT</u>\n删除4:<u>\nFigures</u>\n-------\n删除4:<u>\n*   Copyright © 2022 Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library</u>\n\n【22】Linked Articles\n---------------\n\n【23】*   The global COVID-19 treatment divide\n    *   Experts warn of huge global inequities in access to new treatments for COVID-19.

Healthy volunteers recruited from a university community in USA were randomized 1:1 using a computer generated code to ingest either Bl-04 (n=165) or placebo (n=169) for 28 days and were then challenged with RV-A39, and followed for 14 days. All study interactions and sample collection occurred in dedicated clinical research space. The primary analysis was the effect of the probiotic on the incidence of RV-associated illness.

These studies suggested that the probiotic might have beneficial effects on viral respiratory infection in general and rhinovirus infection in particular. The observed effects were not definitive, however, and there was no evidence for a mechanism of action for the probiotic.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】This large study in the rhinovirus challenge model found no evidence of a clinical effect of the probiotic on rhinovirus infection or rhinovirus-associated illness. Furthermore, the probiotic did not appear to have effects on the host or the host response.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】The rhinovirus challenge model has been shown to have predictive value for subsequent studies of effectiveness in the general population. The current evidence suggests that orally administered Bl-04 does not have a beneficial treatment effect on rhinovirus infections or illness. The absence of definitive effects of the probiotic on the host and host response suggest that the current understanding of potential mechanisms of action for probiotics in viral respiratory infection should be further evaluated.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Probiotics, “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host” are among the most commonly consumed dietary supplements. A variety of probiotic preparations have been studied for different human illnesses with some evidence of a beneficial effect on various diarrheal and gastrointestinal disorders. The results of studies using probiotics for the treatment or prevention of viral respiratory illnesses have; however, been inconsistent. These inconsistent results may be due to the variable quality of the study designs and results reporting of the clinical trials. These trials have generally not addressed potential mechanisms of action in humans, and the proposed mechanism of action of probiotics as treatment for viral respiratory disease have been based primarily on animal models. \n\n【21】The experimental RV challenge model has been used for many years as a tool for the exploration of pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of these infections in human volunteers in a well-controlled, clinically relevant setting. Previous studies of a probiotic, _Bifidobacterium animalis,_ subsp. _lactis_ Bl-04 (Bl-04), in the experimental challenge model were directed at examining the effect of the probiotic on the nasal innate immune response to the viral infection. Modest but inconsistent immune effects were noted and associated exploratory analyses suggested effects on viral shedding. Another exploratory analysis from the study found apparent effects of the nasal microbiota, unrelated to probiotic consumption, on the clinical and immunologic response to the RV infection. The purpose of the present study was to further explore in a larger challenge study the effects of Bl-04 on clinical outcomes associated with RV infection as well as assess the virologic, immunologic, and microbiomic basis for any observed effect.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】_Subjects_ : Healthy adult volunteers, 18-60 years old, were recruited by posted advertisements from the University of Virginia community. Written informed consent was obtained prior to study participation in a form approved by the Human Investigations Committee of the University of Virginia (FWA#:00006183) and the study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.删除1-2:<u> The trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02679807) and the study protocol is available at that site.</u> Subjects were compensated for participation. Volunteers susceptible to RV type 39, as evidenced by a serum neutralizing antibody titer of ≤.1:4, were invited to participate. Volunteers who had significant underlying respiratory or gastrointestinal disease or had an acute illness were excluded.\n\n【24】_Study material and randomization_ : The active supplement was _Bifidobacterium animalis_ ssp. _lactis_ Bl-04 (Danisco US, Madison, WI). The daily dose of probiotic was provided in a sachet containing a minimum of 2 × 10 9 colony forming units of Bl-04 mixed with 1g of sucrose as a carrier. The placebo was provided as a sachet containing 1g of sucrose that was identical to the study product in appearance, smell, and taste. Volunteers enrolled in the study were randomized 1:1 to the probiotic or placebo group. The randomization sequence was created by the study sponsor using nQuery Advisor software (version 7.0.1490.0) using a block size of 6. All study personnel involved in the conduct and analysis of the study were blinded to the randomization scheme until the study database was locked. Volunteers were assigned sequential subject numbers as they enrolled in the study and then provided numbered study product corresponding to their subject number.\n\n【25】_Conduct of the study_ : The study design was similar to that described in a previous study. Study cohorts were conducted in the Spring of 2016, 2017, and 2018 and in the Fall of 2016 and 2017. All cohorts were conducted in an identical fashion; the schedule for study activities is outlined in Supplemental Material Table 1 . On day -28 of the study, all eligible volunteers had specimens collected and were then randomized to active or placebo supplement to be taken daily through study day 14. Volunteers returned to the study site on days -21, -14, and -7 to replenish supplies of study product and to monitor compliance with the study protocol. During the supplementation period, days -28 to 14, the volunteers were instructed to avoid ingestion of other probiotics or probiotic containing foods and were prohibited from taking antibiotics or anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n【26】_Assessment of compliance and blinding_ : Compliance with study supplements was assessed by counting used sachets of the study products and by qPCR for Bl-04 on stool specimens collected at day 0. The adequacy of study blinding was assessed on day 0, after 28 days of supplementation but prior to virus challenge, by asking volunteers whether they believed they were receiving the active or placebo preparation or “don't know”.\n\n【27】_Challenge virus_ : The challenge virus used for this study was RV-A39. The starting material for this pool was nasal lavage from a donor volunteer who was infected with RV-A39 as a participant in a previous challenge study. The challenge pool was produced under GMP conditions and safety tested according to protocols used for intranasal viral vaccines before use in this study under FDA IND #15241. All subjects were inoculated with 20-100 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) of virus by intranasal drops.\n\n【28】_Virus isolation and serology_ : Nasal lavage specimens collected on day 0, before virus challenge, were tested by multiplex PCR (Biofire Diagnostics, SLC, Utah) for the detection of unsuspected viral infections. Nasal lavage collected on study days 1-5 was cultured for RV by standard methods. Sera were tested for neutralizing antibody to RV-A39 by a standard microtiter assay. Volunteers who had RV-A39 isolated from at least one post-challenge specimen or had at least a 4-fold increase in serum neutralizing antibody to RV-A39 between the acute and convalescent specimens were considered infected with the study virus. Viral titers were determined in the original nasal wash specimens stored at -80C by culturing serial 10-fold dilutions in microtiter plates of MRC-5 cells as previously described.\n\n【29】_Symptom assessment_ : Symptom scoring was done daily on each of the five days after virus challenge using the modified Jackson symptom score. The symptoms of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough, sneezing, headache, myalgia, and chilliness were scored as 0-4 corresponding to absent, mild, moderate, severe or very severe by an interactive interview with study staff. The total symptom score was the total score for all symptoms over the five days after virus challenge. Volunteers who had a total symptom score of at least 6 and either three days of rhinorrhea or the subjective impression they had experienced a common cold illness were defined as having a symptomatic illness for the data analysis. On study days 6-14, volunteers recorded in a study diary the presence and severity of the same symptoms using the same scoring scale.\n\n【30】_Assessment of airway inflammation_ : Interleukin (IL)-8/ chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8) concentration was measured in nasal lavage using a commercially available ELISA assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), IL-1β, IL-6, interferon gamma-induced protein (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-10 cytokine concentrations from the nasal lavages were analyzed using multiplex ELISA (Aushon Biosystems, Billerica, MA, USA). Only data points within the standard range were accepted for statistical analysis.\n\n【31】_Transcriptomics:_ Blood samples were collected into PAXgene RNA extractor tubes on study day -28 at baseline, day 0 before RV infection, and day 2 during RV infection. RNA was extracted for subsequent analysis of relative gene expression by templated oligonucleotide ligation followed by sequencing using an oligo panel targeted at inflammatory and antiviral genes (genes listed in Supplemental Material删除2-1:<u>, Table 2 </u>). The effect of the probiotic and the infection on gene expression over time was assessed by comparing differential gene expression overall and at the different time points collected between the study groups, between infected and uninfected subjects, and between those with and without a rhinovirus-associated illness. A complete description of the methods is provided in the Supplemental Material .\n\n【32】_Microbiota analyses:_ Nasal swabs were collected on study days -28, 0 and 3, throat swabs were collected on days -28, 0, 3, 5 and 14, and a fecal specimen was collected on day 0 for microbiota analysis. The microbiota composition from the per-protocol population samples was assessed by Illumina sequencing of the V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene and data were analyzed using QIIME2 (v. 2019.6). Alpha diversity was calculated for the pre-infection period as the change from day -28 to day 0 and post-infection as the change from day 0 using the unique amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Differential taxa tests were conducted for the main effect of study group for each time point and overall (including adjustment for day, cohort, viral load, day\\*treatment and random effect of subject). The effect of day -28 or day 0 abundance of the predominant genus-level nasal taxa ( _Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Moraxella, Alloiococcus_ ) on the clinical outcomes was investigated by including each taxa as a fixed effect into the statistical models used for the primary clinical endpoint analyses. Also, the two-way interaction of taxa and treatment was investigated. Similarly, the effect of the most abundant fecal bacterial genera ( _Blautia, Faecalibacterium, Coprococcus_ ) on duration of illness and clinical symptom scores were investigated. A detailed description of the microbiomic methods is provided in the supplemental material .\n\n【33】In addition to the sequencing approach, a strain-specific PCR was used to detect the supplemented probiotic strain Bl-04 from the fecal (quantitative real-time PCR) and nasal/throat swab samples (droplet digital PCR). Throat swab samples were further analyzed for the presence of pathogenic bacterial DNA (real-time qPCR) which included: _Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes_ group A.\n\n【34】_Assessment of safety_ : Information on adverse events (AEs) or severe adverse events (SAEs) was gathered by interactive interview with study staff at each study visit for all randomized subjects in the study and coded using the latest MedDRA dictionary. The study interventions in this study included the study procedures, the virus infection and the administration of the study product. The study investigator assessed the relatedness of all adverse events to the study interventions prior to the unblinding of the study groups.\n\n【35】### Statistical analysis\n\n【36】The primary outcome variable for this study was the incidence of rhinovirus-associated illness compared between the active and placebo groups. A rhinovirus-associated illness was defined by the study protocol as an illness that met the study criteria for illness in a volunteer who also met the definition for RV infection as described above. The per-protocol analysis cohort was the volunteers who were susceptible to RV-A39 (serum neutralizing antibody titer ≤ 1:4), had no virus detected in the nasal lavage on day 0, were infected with RV-A39, and completed the study taking at least 80% of the intended treatment doses. Two subjects voluntarily withdrew from the study after the virus challenge. These volunteers were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. There were two missing symptom score data points of 1160 in the per-protocol analysis cohort. No correction or imputation was made for the missing data.\n\n【37】Sample size analysis: The sample size for this study was calculated on the primary endpoint of rhinovirus-induced illnesses. The challenge model results in an infection rate of approximately 90% in the control group. Approximately 60% of all infected volunteers are expected to develop a symptomatic illness and will meet the study definition of a rhinovirus-induced illness. A sample size of 95 completed subjects/arm would be expected to detect a reduction in rhinovirus-induced illness of 20% (from 60% to 40%) with 80% power with pα= 0.05. A reduction from 60% to 40% was established as a target effect based on results of previous successful studies in the rhinovirus challenge model. To ensure that a sufficient number of volunteers would be evaluable by the protocol criteria, a target of 254 subjects challenged with the study virus was established.\n\n【38】Analysis of results: The relationship between treatment and incidence of rhinovirus-associated illness was assessed by a chi-square test. Duration of illness, incidence of viral infection, quantitative viral shedding, shedding of virus in nasal lavage, and total symptom score both during the acute illness period and during the total study period were analyzed as secondary endpoints. The relationship between treatment and incidence of infection and shedding of virus in nasal lavage were analyzed exactly the same way as the primary response. For duration of illness Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used to compare durations between treatments. Quantitative viral shedding was analyzed with a repeated measures analysis of variance model (RM-ANOVA). Total symptom scores were analyzed with Poisson regression analysis models using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) technique for repeated measures. The main interest in these analysis models was the over-time treatment effect. All p values for these analyses were two-sided tests. A hierarchical strategy was used to control the type I error in the secondary analyses. As exploratory endpoints, changes in CXCL8, IFN-γ, IL-10, G-CSF, MCP-1, IP-10, IL-6, and IL-1β concentrations both from day -28 until virus challenge and from day 0 onwards were analyzed with repeated measures analysis of covariance models (RM-ANCOVA). For the exploratory endpoints there was no correction for multiple comparisons. All p-values are reported as two-tailed tests.删除1-1:<u> A complete description of the statistical methods for the study is provided as Supplemental Material and the Statistical Analysis Plan is provided at clinicaltrials.gov.

Age, gender, race, and ethnicity were comparable between the two study arms 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Three-hundred thirty-four (334) subjects were randomized to the study product and 318 volunteers (95%) completed the study as designed. All volunteers who received study product were included in the demographic, safety, and blinding analyses. After withdrawals and per protocol exclusions, 296 (143 active, 153 placebo), were challenged with RV-A39 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>.

Two volunteers, one in the active group and one in the placebo group took less than 80% of intended doses between randomization and virus challenge based on counts of returned used sachets and were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. Bl-04 was detected in stool by PCR on day 0 before challenge in 83% of the volunteers in the active group (data not shown).\n\n【45】The majority of volunteers, 56% in the active group and 50% in the placebo group, reported they didn't know which supplementation they were taking (data not shown). Of those subjects randomized to the active group, 17% believed they were taking the active and 27% believed they were taking the placebo preparation. Of those randomized to placebo, 19% believed they were taking the active and 31% believed they were taking placebo (χ 2 \\=1·81, p=0·41; data not shown).\n\n【46】_Effect of probiotic on RV infection and associated illness:_ There was no effect of administration of the probiotic Bl-04 on the occurrence of rhinovirus-associated illness. Sixty-three (56%, 95% CI \\[47%; 66%\\]) of the 112 subjects in the active group and 60 (50%,95% CI \\[41%; 59%\\]) of the 120 subjects in the placebo group had a protocol-defined rhinovirus-associated illness (χ 2 \\=0·91, p=0·34删除2-1:<u>; Table 2 </u>).

Principal component analysis at day -28 showed each cohort clustering, with a PC1 of ∼50% and a PC2 of ∼20% ( Supplemental Material删除2-1:<u>, Figure 1 </u>). This variation was consistant through day 0 and was only changed after RV challenge resulting in clustering into two distinct groups ( Supplemental Material删除2-1:<u>, Figure 2 </u>). No genes were differentially expressed between the active and placebo groups on study days -28, 0, or 2 (data not shown).\n\n【55】As expected, viral effects were shown for the subjects on day 2 after infection with 298 genes shown to be upregulated and 303 down regulated when comparing samples that were infected with virus and those that were not infected ( Supplemental material删除2-1:<u>, Figure 2 </u>). When performing pathway analysis most genes classifying into pathways involved in immune response, cell signalling, cell repair, and inflammatory response ( Supplemental Material删除2-1:<u>, Table 3 </u>). No genes were differentially expressed in the samples from day -28 or day 0 when volunteers who became infected or ill were compared with those who remained uninfected or infected but not ill (data not shown).\n\n【56】_Effect of probiotic on nasal, throat, and fecal microbiota and association with the response to infection:_ Supplementation with Bl-04 had little effect on the nasal, throat or fecal microbiota. In the nose, there was no difference between the study groups either in alpha-or beta-diversity (data not shown). The most abundant organisms were from the genera _Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Alloiococcus, Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Peptoniphilus_ and _Moraxella_ 删除2:<u>(Figure 5A)</u> and the taxonomic composition was similar between the study groups over the course of the study. Four genus level nasal taxa were previously found relevant by Lehtinen _et al_ . ( _Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, Alloiococcus_ and _Moraxella_ ) and the effect of day -28 and day 0 abundance levels of these taxa on clinical endpoints was further analyzed. We identified potential associations between at least one of these genera and a variety of study parameters ( Supplemental Material删除2-1:<u>, Table 6 </u>).\n\n【57】Evaluation of throat microbiota revealed alpha-diversity (observed ASVs) decreased in the probiotic group whereas in the placebo group the diversity increased between day -28 and day 0 (estimated difference (log.) = -0·06, 95% CI \\[-0·126; -0·003\\] p=0·039, ANCOVA; Supplemental material, Figure 10 ). Furthermore, there were potential associations between day 0 alpha-diversity and clinical endpoints unrelated to the study group. The most abundant organisms in the throat samples were from the genera _Streptococcus, Prevotella, Veillonella_ , and _Actinomyces_ . Their abundance, on average, remained generally similar throughout the course of the infection between the study groups 删除2:<u>(Figure 5B)</u>.\n\n【58】The fecal microbiota analysis revealed no detectable differences between the study groups in terms of alpha-and beta-diversity at day 0. The most abundant genera were _Blautia, Faecalibacterium_ , and _Coprococcus_ , which were similar between the study groups 删除2:<u>(Figure 5C)</u>. Higher _Blautia_ abundance on day 0 was statistically significantly associated with a decrease in total symptom score (estimate (log.) for one unit increase in Blautia = -2·13 95% CI \\[-3·87; -0·38\\], p=0·022, GEE Poisson regression analysis), and higher _Faecalibacterium_ abundance statistically significantly associated with a longer duration of illness (estimate (log.) for one unit change in Faecalibacterium = 1·48 95% CI \\[0·35; 2·62\\], p=0·010, Poisson regression analysis; Supplemental Material, Figure 11).\n\n【59】_Adverse events_ : AEs were recorded for all subjects who were randomized to study product (165 active, 169 placebo). Three (2%) subjects in the active group and seven (4%) subjects in the placebo group reported AEs that were judged as definitely or probably related to the study interventions (χ 2 \\=1·55, p=0·21). There were no significant differences in the occurrence of AEs between the study groups 删除2:<u>( Table 3 )</u>. The AES that were judged as definitely and probably related to the study interventions were related to study procedures or the virus infection. There were no AEs that were judged to be definitely or probably related to the administration of the study product.\n\n【60】Table 3 Table of adverse events judged possibly, probably or definitely related to the study treatment or procedures\n\n| ADVERSE EVENT | ACTIVE | PLACEBO |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Total | 17 | 28 |\n| Ear Discomfort | 2 |  |\n| Decreased Hearing |  | 1 |\n| Abdominal Distension | 2 |  |\n| Abdominal Pain | 1 | 2 |\n| Constipation |  | 2 |\n| Diarrhea | 3 | 2 |\n| Dyspepsia |  | 2 |\n| Flatulence | 2 |  |\n| Nausea |  | 6 |\n| Pain | 1 | 3 |\n| Laryngitis | 1 |  |\n| Sinusitis | 1 | 1 |\n| Decreased appetite |  | 1 |\n| Muscle spasm | 1 | 1 |\n| Presyncope |  | 1 |\n| Dysphonia | 1 |  |\n| Epistaxis | 2 | 6 |\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【62】Discussion\n----------\n\n【63】This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study using the RV challenge model found no effect of oral administration of Bl-04 on RV infection or illness. These results are similar to the outcome of a previous study using the challenge model. However, in contrast to the results of our previous study, we also found no substantial evidence of an effect of probiotic administration on the innate inflammatory response in the nose or on virus shedding. Similarly, an exploratory analysis in our previous study found evidence of an interaction between the nasal microbiome and clinical, virologic and immunologic responses to the virus infection that were not fully replicated in the current study.\n\n【64】The challenge model has been used for decades for the study of pathogenesis and treatment of viral respiratory infection in general and RV infection in particular and has proven to be a sensitive tool for detecting the effect of various treatments and a reliable predictor of the results in subsequent field trials. The challenge model is limited by the fact that the route of inoculation is artificial and only a single serotype of rhinovirus is tested. Although a previous field trial found a modest effect of Bl-04 on the incidence of viral respiratory illness, that study did not characterize the infection status of the ill subjects. Previous experience with the challenge model suggests that it is unlikely that an effect would be found in a field trial directed at rhinovirus infections and illness.\n\n【65】Many clinical trials have explored the effect of probiotics on URTI. However, most clinical trials have been conducted in children and the low number of studies in adults have made systematic comparison challenging. Although some of these trials have reported beneficial effects, the results have been inconsistent. Many of the studies have not included viral diagnostics and the reported effects, whether frequency of illness, duration of illness, or severity of illness vary from study-to-study. Furthermore, there is little information about probiotic strain-specific effects, optimal dose, and potential mechanisms of action. Reviews of these studies have concluded that the usefulness of probiotics in viral upper respiratory disease is uncertain and more studies are needed to clarify the effectiveness of probiotics in healthy adults. Our study was designed to address some of the deficiencies in the earlier studies by using a well-defined and well-controlled model involving documented infection with single pathogen and an adequate sample size to detect a meaningful effect. The study also included extensive analysis by virologic, immunologic, transcriptomic, and microbiomic assays to assess the clinical and biologic effects of probiotic administration and interaction with viral infection.\n\n【66】One potential mechanism of action of the probiotics is alteration of the gastrointestinal or nasopharyngeal microbiota in a way that influences the innate immune response. The ability to conduct longitudinal assessments of individual volunteers with collection of specimens in a fixed relation to the time of consumption of the probiotic and the initiation of the viral infection provides a powerful tool for the study of both microbiota and immunological responses to the probiotic. The administration of Bl-04 in the present study had no clinically relevant effect on cytokine responses or expression of innate immune or proinflammatory genes. Similarly, the oral administration of the probiotic did not produce a detectable change in either the fecal or the nasopharyngeal microbiota, supporting the idea that the microbiota of healthy subjects is relatively resistant to change by probiotic supplementation. Future studies of probiotics that have purported clinical effects should include similar assessment of both immunological and microbiota parameters.\n\n【67】A number of studies, including an exploratory analysis of data from our previous challenge study, have suggested an association between the composition of the nasopharyngeal microbiota and the incidence or severity of viral respiratory infection. Many of these studies have been done in young infants and have reported a positive correlation between the abundance of _Haemophilus_ species and severity of bronchiolitis. Interestingly, the influence of the microbiota on disease severity appears to vary by viral pathogen. There is little longitudinal information about the interaction of the nasopharyngeal microbiota and viral respiratory infection in adults. Allen, _et al_ . reported that bacterial detection from nasal lavage fluid was not statistically significantly influenced during a RV infection although _Haemophilus_ species were less abundant in specimens from infected subjects. In our exploratory analysis and in the current study we also found that the composition of the nasal microbiota was not altered by the RV infection. In contrast to the findings of the current study, our previous study found evidence that different patterns of species dominance in the nasal cavity were associated with effects on viral replication, cytokine elaboration and symptom severity. The failure to detect these patterns in this study may be due to the fact that the species were differentiated at a more granular level (ASVs rather than OTUs) that would potentially obscure this finding. Additional work will be required to resolve this difference.\n\n【68】We found no effect of the probiotic supplementation on blood transcriptome in healthy subjects relative to supplementation or during the infection. In the statistical analyses, we found a statistically significant and unexplained cohort effect, however, within cohort results also showed no effect by the probiotic. These findings are consistent with a previous clinical study where Bl-04 or placebo supplementation to an active healthy adult cohort resulted in no difference in blood cytokine profiles, regulatory T cells or clinical chemistry, indicating that in healthy subjects with normal immune function and physiology probiotics have no measurable effect on peripheral immune markers. On the other hand, modest cytokine level changes were observed in the nasal washes of subject supplemented with Bl-04 in this and the previous challenge study, indicating that the effect of probiotics on mucosal immune function should be investigated further.\n\n【69】This large study in the RV challenge model provided an opportunity for a carefully-controlled assessment of Bl-04 effects on the fecal, throat and nasal microbiome, nasal cytokine profiles and blood transcriptomics. No clinically relevant effects were found. The study did find limited evidence of the effect of the baseline microbiomic profile on clinical, virologic and cytokine responses to the viral infection consistent with but not identical to our previous study. These interactions will continue to be evaluated in future studies.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【70】This work was supported by Danisco Sweeteners Oy, Kantvik, Finland (now IFF Health & Biosciences).\n\n【71】### Data Sharing\n\n【72】Inquiries about access to the original clinical data should be directed to the Corresponding Author.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n### Author contributions\n\n【73】RBT, MJL, LL designed the study; RBT oversaw the conduct of the study; FRB, BZ designed and conducted the analysis of the transcriptomic studies; AH, BZ, designed and conducted the microbiota analyses; NY conducted the qPCR analysis: SM, TH designed and conducted the statistical analysis; RBT, MJL, LL, SM, TH had access to all data; RBT, MJL, LL, AH, BZ, SM wrote the manuscript and all authors reviewed and contributed to the final manuscript.\n\n【74】</u>\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\n---------------------------------\n\n【75】LL, AH, BZ, FB, NY, and MJL report other from IFF Health & Biosciences, outside the submitted work.

With only 215 cases reported worldwide as of Dec 26, 2012—an encouraging contrast to 650 cases in 2011—success seemed close.\n\n【1】But recently, the global effort to eradicate polio has suffered devastating setbacks. In mid-December, nine health workers were shot dead while travelling from house to house to administer polio vaccine to children during the national anti-polio campaign in Pakistan. And on Jan 1, six female Pakistani aid workers and a male doctor were shot dead. The brutal attacks took place in several locations, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which in 2012 accounted for more than 40% of all Pakistan's polio cases and 46% of Pakistan's infected towns and districts; Karachi, the largest city in Pakistan with a population of 18 million; and Sindh province. The killing of the health workers was condemned as “senseless and inexcusable” by UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon. Owing to the safety concerns, the UN was forced to halt its participation in the vaccination campaign, and the campaign itself has been suspended temporarily by the Government of Pakistan and the affected provinces.\n\n【2】In this tragedy, women and children are the main victims. Most of the health workers who were killed were women, and the youngest was a schoolgirl aged 17 years. Female health workers are standing fearlessly and selflessly on the frontline of Pakistan's war against polio, because culturally only women are allowed to enter into houses to talk to mothers and vaccinate their children. Last June, in Federally Administered Tribal Areas, the Pakistani Taliban banned polio vaccination in retaliation for the use of unmanned drones by the USA. It is of deep concern that women who stand for something big have become the Pakistani Taliban's target. Female polio health workers are one example; the schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, whom the Taliban shot in the head in October for campaigning for access to education—another essential ingredient in promoting children's health—is another. More than 3·5 million Pakistani children have missed vaccinations as a result of the campaign's suspension. “Such attacks deprive Pakistan's most vulnerable populations—especially children—of basic life-saving health interventions”, said WHO and UNICEF in a joint statement .\n\n【3】The effect of the killing of polio vaccine workers in Pakistan will have repercussions for its neighbour Afghanistan, which, together with Pakistan itself and Nigeria, is one of the remaining polio-endemic countries. Genetic analysis shows that two of the three chains of polio transmission in Afghanistan are from Pakistan. Other neighbouring countries have also been put at risk. For instance, polio broke out in China in 2011 for the first time since 1999 after being imported from Pakistan; 18 people were paralysed and one died. Heidi Larson, an anthropologist who studies public trust in vaccines and immunisation at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, pointed out that the killings of health workers in Pakistan could be a “game changer” in the global efforts to eradicate polio, calling for a rethink of delivery strategies. She compared it with the 2003–04 immunisation boycott in northern Nigeria, led by religious and political leaders, who claimed that the oral polio vaccine could cause sterility. This boycott led to poliovirus not only rebounding in Nigeria, but also spreading to 15 African countries and to Indonesia. The boycott and its effect prompted discussions between WHO, the Organization of Islamic States, and local religious leaders to help address the rumours and contain the further spread of polio. Indeed, the insecurity of and inaccessibility to vaccination have become the major impediments to the final push for polio eradication. Last year, Kathleen O'Reilly and colleagues reported in The Lancet the effect of mass immunisation campaigns and new oral poliovirus vaccines on the incidence of polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They reported that decreases in vaccination coverage in parts of Pakistan and southern Afghanistan had severely restricted the effectiveness of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccines.\n\n【4】To eradicate polio, the work that the brave polio health workers died for must be continued in 2013. Furthermore, it is imperative not only to ensure immunisation workers' security, but also to address the determinants behind the shooting of polio health workers—ie, to win the hearts of the public, to go beyond the “polio only” agenda, and to enhance polio vaccination's integration into the routine health and immunisation programme.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2013 Corbis</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【5】### Publication history\n\n【6】Published: 05 January 2013\n\n【7】### Identification\n\n【8】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60002-1</u>\n\n【9】### Copyright\n\n【10】© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

High turnover of nurses has also been blamed on the chaotic work environments in most hospitals. Michael McCarthy investigates how design can make hospital stays a far better experience.\n\n【1】In the late 1980s, Craig Zimring's mother was hospitalised in a prestigious hospital, where she was assigned to a room with another seriously ill patient.\n\n【2】“She was in a great deal of pain as was the woman sharing her room”, Zimring recalls, “and every time she fell asleep she was awakened by roommate calling out” or by visitors or by staff coming in and out of the room. The hospital was also noisy, Zimring says, and the nursing station was chaotic: crowded with nurses talking, doctors charting, and “flocks of medical students”.\n\n【3】“We liked the quality of care we got, we liked the nurses, and we liked the doctors”, says Zimring, now a professor of architecture and psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology College of Architecture in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. “But it was very clear that the quality of care that my mother got was in spite of the physical setting rather than because of it.”\n\n【4】For a young psychologist in the field of environmental psychology, a field which studies how our surroundings affect our behaviour and wellbeing, it was a “transformative experience”, says Zimring.\n\n【5】In the report due out this August, entitled _The Role of the Physical Environment in the Hospital of the 21st Century: A Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity,_ Zimring and Roger Ulrich, also a psychologist and a professor of architecture at Texas A&M University, argue that there are now 600 well done studies that show hospital design can significantly influence medical outcomes. The full report will be posted on the websites of the Center for Health Design 删除1:<u>( www.healthdesign.org )</u> and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 删除1:<u>( www.rwjf.org )</u>.\n\n【6】Zimring and Ulrich contend that most hospitals today are noisy, cheerless places that patients find cold and frightening. In addition, crowded, noisy, poorly thought out nursing stations and other staff workspaces add to staff stress and increase the risk of medical errors, which cause an estimated 98 000 deaths in the USA alone. “Hospitals are unnecessarily stressful and dangerous places”, Zimring says.\n\n【7】Simply finding your way around a hospital can be bewildering, Zimring points out. In a study he conducted in a 300-bed hospital in Atlanta he found the staff spent 4500 hours a year helping patients and visitors find their way. He calculated that staff time lost giving directions instead of doing their regular jobs cost the hospital US$220 000 a year, more than what would be needed put up signs, maps, and information kiosks so people could find their own way.\n\n【8】Once admitted, there is a good chance you will be assigned to a room with other patients where you will have little privacy, where your sleep will be disturbed repeatedly through the night, and where you will have an increased risk of acquiring a nosocomial infection or be given the wrong medication, Zimring says.\n\n【9】Design experts claim single-patient rooms would have a substantial impact on hospital outcomes\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2004 Michael Seidi/Anshen & Allen Architects</u>\n\n【10】It will also likely be noisy because sounds from the nursing station, alarms, overhead pages, and rattling supply carts echo down the halls. The racket can be terrific. A study at the prestigious Midwestern medical centre found the noise level at a bedside near a nursing station during the 7 am shift change hit 113 decibels (dB), the equivalent noise level generated by a jackhammer. A portable X-ray machine generates 92 dB, the equivalent of the noise of a truck roaring past you at 50 miles an hour. Background noise levels in a hospital typically run between 65–80 dB with peaks hitting 85–90 dB. These levels, says Ulrich, are “ludicrously higher” than the 35 dB background level recommended by the WHO guidelines for hospital bedrooms.\n\n【11】You might get some quiet if you moved down the hall away from the nursing station, but once there, the chances are you are likely to see less of your nurse. Because most hospital floors are organised around a central nursing station where charts, orders, medications, and often supplies are concentrated in one place, nurses spend most of their time away walking up and down the halls “hunting and gathering” says Ann Hendrich, vice president of clinical excellence for Ascension Health in St Louis, Montana, the largest non-profit health system in the USA. Hendrich has done time–motion studies of health-care workers and, like Zimring and Ulrich, is an advocate of evidence-based design. “Nurses travel miles a day in search of the next bit of stuff they need for care”, she says. In one study, Hendrich and her colleagues used video cameras to track how nurses spent their day and found that on average nurses spent only about 30–40 minutes of their shifts actually giving care at the bedside.\n\n【12】Decentralisation of work stations, as shown in this floor plan, helps nurses interact more closely with patients\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2004 Watkins Hamilton Ross Architects</u>\n\n【13】The noise, the chaotic work environment, and the lack of patient contact, all contribute to the high nurse turnover rates that plague US hospitals, says Leonard Berry, a professor of marketing at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas who studies health care as a service industry. “We don't have a nursing shortage, we have a shortage of nurses willing to work in hospitals”, Berry says.\n\n【14】The one design improvement that would have the greatest impact on hospital outcomes, Zimring and Ulrich say, would be replacing multi-patient rooms with single ones. Patients in single rooms are more comfortable, sleep better, and contract fewer nosocomial infections. They also are less likely to fall and injure themselves in part because family and friends spend more time with patients in private rooms and therefore are around to assist them getting in and out of bed. The evidence for single rooms is so strong, argues Zimring, “that we can now convincingly say that we need not build anything but single-room hospitals in the USA ever again”.\n\n【15】The evidence also supports making patient rooms capable of handling more severe cases, say Ulrich and Zimring. Such “variable acuity rooms” are, for example, equipped so ventilators and other critical-care equipment can be brought in to tide a patient over through a crisis. Variable acuity rooms greatly reduce the need for transfers, during which a great many medical errors occur. “When transfers occur lots and lots of things go wrong”, says Ulrich.\n\n【16】Decentralised floor plans that allow nurses work from stations placed closer to their patients have also been shown to improve care and staff satisfaction. Nurses are able to spend more time caring for patients and are able to respond more quickly when patients call for help.\n\n【17】Research shows that even little touches can have a substantial impact, Ulrich says. Patients, for example, feel and do better if the hospital offers pleasant distractions such as soothing artwork on the walls, windows that offer views of nature, and places to visit such as gardens and lounges.\n\n【18】The additional cost of such design changes are well worth the money, says Derek Parker, an architect and director of the firm Anshen&Allen, and a member of the Center for Health Design's board of directors. Parker calculates that building a 300-bed hospital with larger, variable-acuity single rooms, decentralised nursing stations, and other elements recommended by proponents of evidence-based design would add $12 million to the $240 million that such a facility typically costs to build in the USA today—an increase of roughly 5%. A sum that “would make any CEO nervous”, Parker says, but one that can be recouped in the first year by improved staff performance and the reduction of expenses due to such things as patient falls, which typically cost $10000 each, patient transfers, which typically cost $500–$700 each, as well as hospital-acquired infections and medical errors. In addition, revenues are likely to climb as new patients are drawn to the attractive new facility. The benefits are so great, Parker concludes, that hospitals that don't adopt evidence-based design will not be competitive.\n\n【19】Through thoughtful design, hospitals can be made both more pleasant and safer for both patients and staff, says Ulrich. “We not talking about building the Ritz Carlton”, he says, “We're talking about smarter design based on evidence. We're not just talking abut buildings that look nice or are posh but buildings that are really more effective.”\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【20】### Publication history\n\n【21】Published: 31 July 2004\n\n【22】### Identification\n\n【23】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16787-1</u>\n\n【24】### Copyright\n\n【25】© 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Their system was capable of diagnosing diseases as accurately as an experienced paediatrician.\n\n【1】This was an amazing feat, considering the challenges involved. The human body is a complex piece of biological machinery and trying to diagnose our ailments is a monumental task, even for the most experienced doctors. To improve their diagnoses, doctors gather as much information as they can from their patients. This information comes from a wide range of sources, including genome-wide studies, demographics, doctor's notes, clinical images, laboratory results, genetic tests, or even from wearable sensors.\n\n【2】Today, databases of electronic health records from around the world hold such information for billions of patients. But, despite all the data and the best intentions, misdiagnoses happen more often than you might think. “Clinicians think and act in chaotic, time-pressured, clinical environments while dealing with uncertainty, which is integral to the diagnostic process”, Dr Hardeep Singh, a patient safety researcher at the Michael E DeBakey VA Medical Center and Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, TX, USA, tells _The Lancet Digital Health_ .\n\n【3】All this pressure in the fast-paced primary care environment can translate into diagnostic errors, especially when a doctor runs into problems gathering or interpreting information related to patient history, physical examinations, or tests, Singh explains. He adds, “Things are not always black-and-white when patients' symptoms and disease conditions are unfolding and dynamically evolving over time. Now add to this the currently immature and disconnected data information systems and you get the perfect storm of risk”.\n\n【4】A 2014 study led by Singh found that at least one in 20 adults in the USA left the doctor's office with a misdiagnosis, which equates to 12 million people per year. Half of these misdiagnoses, the authors estimated, are potentially harmful.\n\n【5】One way to help physicians improve their diagnostic accuracy is by helping them analyse data more efficiently. With this goal in mind, and as computers become more powerful, scientists are looking at AI to design systems that can think like humans, only faster and more efficiently. AI approaches, such as machine learning, natural language processing, representation learning, and deep learning, aim to identify patterns in words, images, voice and video recordings, and other data in record time.\n\n【6】To develop an AI system to diagnose paediatric diseases, the Chinese and American team first created a dictionary with key words linking symptoms to a disease. This dictionary, which holds more than 1 million such key terms, was then used to train the AI system. “You can imagine that this requires both a huge dataset and a lot of human physician manpower to curate data—but once it is made, it can save a huge amount of work and has enormous impact to health-care delivery”, Prof Kang Zhang, lead author of the study, at the University of California, San Diego, CA, USA, tells _The Lancet Digital Health_ .\n\n【7】This AI system was then used to analyse plain language inputs that would refer to symptoms with the goal of finding patterns that linked to a disease. To test their system, Zhang and his team used data from retrospective electronic medical records. “We tested diagnoses in 50 000 patients' EMR data as a validated cohort and additional 10 000 patients were tested when we compared accuracy of AI _vs_ physicians” Zhang explains.\n\n【8】The results were nothing short of amazing, with a diagnostic accuracy of 95% for common ailments such as acute upper respiratory infection and sinusitis. The key to their success was in the amount and quality of the data available to train the AI algorithm and in the target population in whom it was tested; and here lays a potential limitation of this AI system. “AI can only work with diseases it has seen and trained before” Zhang says. So, the more data available for training, the more accurate the prediction the AI system can make, Zhang explains.\n\n【9】So far, the AI system designed by Zhang and his teams remains a proof of concept. A promising research experiment, not yet in use with actual patients. But, there are other AI systems that are already interacting with patients, such as IBM's Watson or Babylon's AI chatbot .\n\n【10】Babylon's AI system, for example, is currently being used by over 3 000 000 users from the UK and Rwanda. The system provides quick and easy-to-access advice for common ailments. But, how accurate is this advice? In a non-peer-reviewed 2018 study , Babylon researchers compared the performance of human physicians with Babylon's AI system at evaluating identical medical cases. According to their results, the AI system outperformed the average human doctor.\n\n【11】However, in a 2018 correspondence in _The Lancet_ , Hamish Fraser, Associate Professor of Medical Science at Brown University, Providence, RI, USA, argued that Babylon's AI system still needed more testing before being able to prove it can perform well in real-world settings. For instance, Babylon's study did not use real patient data, but so-called patient vignettes, clinical examples of patient-related cases that are normally used for educational purposes. Other issues with Babylon's study, Fraser says, involves data input into the AI system, which was done by doctors, not patients (lay users), and that few statistical tests were done to assess the significance of their findings.\n\n【12】“The biggest problem at present with diagnosis programs for patients is the lack of rigorous, clinical evaluation. The studies to date have almost all been small and have not used real patient data so we don't know if a system like Babylon performs well with typical patients presenting with a wide range of clinical problems”, Fraser says.\n\n【13】Saurabh Johri, Chief Scientific Officer at Babylon, commented on this lack of rigorous clinical evaluations and says that studies are on their way. “We are keen to run robust, real-world studies on Babylon's AI that can be published in peer-reviewed journals”, he says. According to Johri, Babylon is currently working with academics to validate their AI technology. He added, “…we know new technology needs high quality evidence to earn people's trust”.\n\n【14】The question in people's mind is will doctors ever be replaced by computers? Experts agree that this is unlikely, at least under most circumstances. AI systems could be particularly useful in resource-limited areas or in emergency situations when a human doctor does not have the time or resources to reach a diagnosis. “I would envision AI can be used as a primary deployment to diagnose and triage diseases in rural or resource poor areas, for example, as an online system”, Zhang says. But even under these circumstances, Zhang argues that human doctors should still be involved and that “AI should be used primarily as a physician assistant to reduce overall burdens of physicians and it should not replace physicians”.\n\n【15】Taken together, the use of AI in health care heralds an exciting and promising new era in diagnosis, in which meaningful medical guidance can be made available to more people in need.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【16】### Publication history\n\n【17】Published: May 2019\n\n【18】### Identification\n\n【19】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(19)30011-1</u>\n\n【20】### Copyright\n\n【21】© 2019 The Author(s).

National programmes in several countries, collaborative research efforts, and an established international paediatric multiple sclerosis study group have contributed to revised clinical diagnostic definitions, identified clinical features of multiple sclerosis that differ by age of onset, and made recommendations regarding the treatment of paediatric multiple sclerosis. The relative risks conveyed by genetic and environmental factors to paediatric multiple sclerosis have been the subject of several large cohort studies. MRI features have been characterised in terms of qualitative descriptions of lesion distribution and applicability of MRI aspects to multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria, and quantitative studies have assessed total lesion burden and the effect of the disease on global and regional brain volume. Humoral-based and cell-based assays have identified antibodies against myelin, potassium-channel proteins, and T-cell profiles that support an adult-like T-cell repertoire and cellular reactivity against myelin in paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis. Finally, the safety and efficacy of standard first-line therapies in paediatric multiple sclerosis populations are now appreciated in more detail, and consensus views on the future conduct and feasibility of phase 3 trials for new drugs have been proposed.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet Neurology_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

We aim to develop and validate a hybrid model named SpineHRNet+, which integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and rule-based methods to improve auto-alignment reliability and interpretability.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】From December 2019 to November 2020, 1,542 consecutive patients with scoliosis attending two local scoliosis clinics (The Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital at Sandy Bay in Hong Kong; Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam on Hong Kong Island) were recruited. The biplanar radiographs of each patient were collected with our medical machine EOS™. The collected radiographs were recaptured using smartphones or screenshots, with deidentified images securely stored. Manually labelled landmarks and alignment parameters by a spine surgeon were considered as ground truth (GT). The data were split 8:2 to train and internally test SpineHRNet+, respectively. This was followed by a prospective validation on another 337 patients. Quantitative analyses of landmark predictions were conducted, and reliabilities of auto-alignment were assessed using linear regression and Bland-Altman plots.

The mean angle errors between predictions and GT were 3·18° and 6·32° coronally and sagittally. All predicted alignments were strongly correlated with GT ( _p_ < 0·001, R 2 \\> 0·97), with minimal overall difference visualised via Bland-Altman plots. For curve detections, 95·7% sensitivity and 88·1% specificity was achieved, and for severity classification, 88·6–90·8% sensitivity was obtained.

Cited references in the retrieved articles were further searched. Previous AI studies on scoliosis have mainly focused on a specific task, such as scoliosis severity classification, Cobb Angle (CA) prediction, or vertebrae detection on either posteroanterior or lateral radiographs. Most of these studies suffered from data scarcity. The literature search revealed that no study evaluated the effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for scoliosis or spine malalignment in any prospective trial.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to establish a platform for automatic spine alignment analysis with prospective validation. The performance of the hybrid system was validated via in-house and prospective clinical data, using cases of varying severity, curve type, and radiograph quality. The primary significance of this work compared with previous studies is the prospective data validation and integration into an open platform for clinicians and researchers to obtain fast alignment analysis. The prospective results suggested that our model achieved satisfactory clinical performance.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】Our study suggests that medical AI has the capacity to assist doctors and clinical researchers via fast and consistent analytical results. However, we should note that the prospective validation of this study was performed at two scoliosis clinics and not at a multi-centre international site. Therefore, caution is required when using SpineHRNet+ directly in other clinical settings. Fine-tuning of the models may be required to adapt to other clinical settings. Further studies are necessary to corroborate our results.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Spine malalignment is prevalent and in the paediatric population, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is most common. AIS can affect up to 2·2% of boys and 4·8% of girls. Without prompt intervention, the deformity may deteriorate and significantly reduce the quality of life and mobility. Accurate assessment of spine alignment is crucial for proper treatment. It is based on radiographs with multiple alignment parameters, including but not limited to the coronal Cobb angle (CA) magnitude, curve type (thoracic curve, thoracolumbar and lumbar) as well as the sagittal alignment, i.e. thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), and sacral slope (SS), which are all measured from specific keypoints (end points of the endplates) of specific vertebrae. Thus, current diagnoses and follow-up assessments require extensive clinical experience and expertise to interpret the alignment parameters manually and assess the patient physical appearance, making fast and accurate alignment analyses challenging.\n\n【21】AI has shown great promise in managing spine disease, including disease detection , classification, segmentation, and progression prediction, mainly based on medical images. Previous studies on automatic spine alignment analysis could directly or indirectly regress CAs from radiographs of the major curve but could not compute heterogeneous curve patterns or investigate the curve types. It is challenging to interpret what the AI algorithm has learned, thus reducing the clinical application. Other AI approaches adopted the clinical gold standard strategy of first locating the vertebral endplates followed by CA calculation, but these focused on screened radiographs from retrospective datasets and lacked prospective validations.\n\n【22】Given that medical AI has significant advantages in speed and consistency, an easily accessible platform using validated AI models can significantly assist clinicians. Particularly when face-to-face contact is restricted, such as under the COVID-19 pandemic, an auto-analysis platform able to tolerate large variations in image quality will greatly assist spine surgeons in making clinical decisions. Thus, we developed an open platform termed AlignProCARE, integrating user applications, a data centre, and a backend AI server powered by deep learning models. Our platform aimed to provide clinicians with faster and reliable spine measures to assist their clinical practice and facilitate communication with patients. The significance of this work is multifaceted. First, the deep learning models were designed and trained using radiographs from a range of sources with varying image quality, including smartphone recaptured radiographs as well as original high-resolution radiographs, to increase the generalizability of our models. Second, AlignProCARE is an open platform that can be freely used upon registration using research institute emails to increase the accessibility of auto-analysis. Third, SpineHRNet+, with the clinical keypoints displayed, can provide interpretable spine alignment analysis for spine surgeons, yielding evidence for how results were generated.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Participants and datasets\n\n【25】All deformity patients attending two scoliosis clinics (The Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital at Sandy Bay in Hong Kong; Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam on Hong Kong Island) from December 2019 to November 2020 were recruited. The ethics of this study was approved by the local institutional authority review board (UW15–596), and all participants were required to provide written informed consent before they joined the study. Patients with psychological, systematic neural disorders, congenital deformities, previous spinal operations, any trauma that could impair posture and mobility, and any oncological diseases were excluded. The involved technicians were instructed to recapture the radiographs using a smartphone or take screenshots of the displayed image, with the imaging plane parallel to the screen. No patient identification information was captured. All collected images were anonymised and uploaded to our secure internal server via AlignProCARE. All patient alignment landmarks were manually annotated by spine surgeons using open-source software (ImageJ version 1.52r). The spine alignments recorded as a routine clinical practice were considered as the ground truth (GT). Senior surgeons with more than 20 years’ clinical experience manually annotated the end points of all endplates from the 1st thoracic vertebra to the 1st sacrum as key point landmarks. Those annotated landmarks were used as GT landmarks to train our AI model for landmark detection. The surgeons measured alignment parameters were considered as GT angles to evaluate the alignments prediction performance of our model. We tested the inter-rater variability of alignments measurements between two surgeons and discovered a small absolute angle difference of 4°–6° (mean = 4·5° ± SD 0·6). The agreements were satisfactory for clinical practice and thus no third assessor was involved.\n\n【26】Of the 1542 consecutive patients attending the scoliosis clinic during the study period for SpineHRNet+ development, 185 were excluded because of degenerative deformities but not AIS, and another 8 were excluded due to congenital deformities. A total of 1349 cases with biplanar radiographs (both coronal and sagittal) were included, with 1079 cases (74% female; age range 10–18) used to train SpineHRNet+ and 270 used for the in-house validation dataset to evaluate the performance. After the model was developed, it was tested on 337 prospective cases, which were not involved in training and optimising SpineHRNet+. Most of the patients had two radiographs (i.e. posteroanterior and lateral radiographs), while a small proportion of the patients have four biplanar radiographs since they were scanned twice before and after wearing braces. Therefore, the number range of radiographs per patient is 2–4. The average and standard deviation of radiographs per patient for training the model were 2·28 and 0·69, respectively, while for prospective testing were 2·30 and 0·71, respectively. Radiographs of the patients with the brace were eliminated during the data cleaning.\n\n【27】### Definition of alignment parameters, severity, and types\n\n【28】For measuring the coronal alignment , the end vertebrae must be identified first, which are the most tilted vertebrae from the curve apex. The CA is formed by the angle between the upper endplate of the most cranial vertebra and the lower endplate of the most caudal vertebra. A threshold of 10° was used according to the clinical gold standard to differentiate the presence of a curve at a given location of the spine in the coronal plane.\n\n【29】The severity of the deformity is classified as shown in Table 1 . A CA smaller than 20° is considered as normal-mild, 20–40° is considered as moderate and greater than 40° is considered severe. The type of curve is considered as thoracic (T) if the apex of the curve was between the 1st to the 11th thoracic vertebrae; as thoracolumbar (TL) if the apex was located between the 12th thoracic vertebra and the 1st lumbar vertebra; and as lumbar (L) if the apex of the curve was between the 2nd and the 5th lumbar vertebrae.

We adopted the previously reported normal ranges for TK (20–40°) , LL (20–45°) , and SS (32–49°).\n\n【33】### Image pre-processing\n\n【34】To minimise input image variance, image sizes were automatically unified by cropping each image to an 896 × 448 pixels patch, containing the entire spine. Subsequently, we adopted data-augmentation to enhance model robustness, including random flipping (probability = 0·5), scaling \\[0·8, 1·2\\], rotation \\[−5°, 5°\\], horizontal/vertical translation \\[−10 pixels, 10 pixels\\], and contrast augmentation \\[0·8, 1·2\\]. The generated heatmaps and GT landmarks were scaled accordingly.\n\n【35】### Procedures\n\n【36】The AlignProCARE open platform has been deployed to a website 删除1:<u>( https://aimed.hku.hk/alignprocare )</u>. It consists mainly of three parts: the user end, a data centre, and an AI server 删除2:<u>( Figure 1 )</u>. Users can utilise the automated alignment analysis function after registration using research institutional emails. They can access the platform and upload new images through both the PC user interface and smartphone application (App Store and Google Play). Analytic results from SpineHRNet+ can be received and parsed directly on the user end with key landmarks visualised on the user interface or smartphone. Alignment degrees and deformity severity can be automatically computed based on the landmarks. Users can modify the landmark positions, and the alignment results are simultaneously re-calculated.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Workflow diagram of our medical AI platform — AlignProCARE. The platform consists of mainly three parts, i.e. the client end, data centre, and server. The workflow is: (1) On the client end, users upload the spine radiographs via PC or smartphone applications. (2) The data centre receives the captures from different users and assigns each one with a specific identity number, and then sends ammonized images to the server with end-to-end encryption. (3) On the server side, a hybrid AI-powered model continuously receives the images, analyses the images using SpineHRNet+, and sends back the results to the data centre. (4) The data centre forwards the results to different devices according to the identity number.

SpineHRNet+ “mimics’’ diagnostic procedures of clinicians for AIS via incorporation of both deep learning networks and a rule-based algorithm 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. It can process and analyse biplanar radiographs of the spine with deformities. The processing pipeline essentially consists of two stages. In stage 1, the algorithm utilises two deep learning models as backbones. HRNet is adopted to detect endplate landmarks of each vertebra and identify the location of the end vertebrae. The detailed architecture of the adopted HRNet is presented in Figure 1.1 in the supplementary materials. The landmarks are visualised to increase result interpretability for users. In parallel, UNet is adopted to segment the spine region, followed by a rule-based algorithm to obtain a spine segmentation map. The detailed architecture of the adopted UNet is presented in Figure 1.2 in the supplementary materials.Details of all the networks are provided in the supplementary materials. In stage 2, SpineHRNet+ integrates the outputs of the previous two stages to perform bad point detection and correction 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The corrected landmarks are further used for CA prediction.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 Overview processing pipeline of the SpineHRNet+. The model consists of two stages. The stage 1 (denoted with the green panel) adopts deep learning models for endplate and vertebral landmark detection and spine segmentation map (segmap) generation. The stage 2 (yellow panel) uses rule-based techniques for bad point detection and correction. The corrected landmarks are used for alignment prediction. In each panel, we visualize the outputs in the corresponding stage and use digits (a–e) to concatenate each output with the corresponding processing step. Compared with end-to-end models, the designed staged pipeline increases our model interpretability. For coronal X-ray captures, stage 1 predicts the end vertebra (a) and endplate landmarks (b) indicated by the heatmaps. The heatmap suggests the probability of the appearance of end vertebrae or landmarks within the image. High probability regions are indicated with warm colour while low probability regions are indicated with cold colour. Another output is a binary map indicating the spine region with white pixels (c). Such binary map is useful for bad point detection subsequently.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【39】For model development, we used a computer with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4114 CPU 2.20 GHz central processing unit, 128GB of RAM and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti core. The network was implemented using PyTorch (version 1.6.1) accelerated by Cuda 10.2. The detailed structure of deep learning networks adopted in SpineHRNet+ is provided in the supplementary materials (Section 1.1). Landmark detection and spine segmentation were trained using the training data. HRNet was optimised by minimising a pixel-wise binary cross-entropy loss between the model outputs and GT labels, while UNet was optimised by minimising the cross-entropy loss. During model training, the Adam optimiser was adopted, and a decay factor d was used to control the learning rate at each epoch. The decayed learning rate update follows the equation\n\n【40】l r i \\= l r · 1 1 \\+ d · i ,\n\n【41】(1)\n\n【42】where l r was the initial learning rate and l r i was the learning rate at the i th epoch. In our experiments, the Adam optimiser with an initial learning rate of 0·0001, a decay of 0·05, a batch size of 4, and an epoch of 200 was used for landmark detection training. For segmentation training, the Adam optimiser with an initial learning rate of 0·00,005, a decay of 0·03, a batch size of 4, and an epoch of 100 was used, with hyper-parameters decided empirically.\n\n【43】### Performance evaluation\n\n【44】To comprehensively assess our method, we tested the performance of the model on multiple tasks, including landmark detection, CA detection, and severity prediction (only for coronal images).\n\n【45】For landmark detection, we used two quantitative measurements to examine the difference between predicted results and landmark labels (ground truth). The two measurements are mean Euclidean distance (MED) and mean Manhattan distance (MMD), which are defined as:\n\n【46】MED \\= 1 N ∑ n \\= 1 N ( 1 M ∑ i \\= 1 M ( x i − x i ^ ) 2 \\+ ( y i − y i ^ ) 2 ) ,\n\n【47】(2)\n\nMMD \\= 1 N ∑ n \\= 1 N ( 1 M ∑ i \\= 1 M ( | x i − x i ^ | \\+ | y i − y i ^ | ) ) ,\n\n【49】(3)\n\n【50】where ( x i , y i ) and ( x ^ i , y ^ i ) denote the i th predicted landmark coordinates and corresponding label coordinates, respectively. _M_ is the number of landmark coordinates in a single radiograph capture, and _N_ is the number of image samples in the dataset. These two measurements can provide a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of SpineHRNet+ on a landmark detection task. MED measures the 2D Euclidean distance between the predicted landmark coordinates and their GT counterparts, which is a straightforward criterion that can assess the predicted results of each landmark. MMD can measure the distance as well. However, it emphasises the distance on each coordinate dimension. Therefore, by combining these two measurements, the performance of the model can be more accurately evaluated.\n\n【51】### Statistical analysis\n\n【52】To demonstrate if the performance of SpineHRNet+ has improved significantly, we conducted a hypothesis test on the two measurements MED and MMD. First, we used the Shapiro-Wilk test, a commonly used normality test, to evaluate the normality of the quantitative error of SpineHRNet and SpineHRNet+ in terms of MED and MMD. Such an evaluation was tested with the stats.shapiro删除7:<u>()</u> function of SciPy 1.7.0 in the Python 3.6 environment. A threshold of _p_ < 0·05 was set as the standard for the input data not following the normal distribution, and the results showed that the error values, regardless of either MED or MMD measurements using either coronal or sagittal captures, did not follow a normal distribution. Therefore, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test , the nonparametric equivalent to the paired _t_ \\-test, was performed using the stats.wilcoxon删除7:<u>()</u> function in SciPy. Mean value and standard deviation (SD) were calculated, and _p_ < 0·0001 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【53】CA presence detection is a binary classification task to distinguish a curve on the spine radiograph, and we evaluated the model performance on posteroanterior radiographs. Coronal CA location (3 types: T, TL and L) detection at different regions of the spine and the severity (3 types: normal-moderate, moderate, and severe) were assessed. To assess classification performance, true positive (TP), true negative (TN), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN) values were counted. Five descriptive quantitative assessments were calculated, namely, sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp), precision (Pe), negative prediction value (NPV), and accuracy (Acc), as follows:\n\n【54】Sn \\= TP TP \\+ FN ,\n\n【55】(4)\n\n【56】Sp \\= TN TN \\+ FP ,\n\n【57】(5)\n\n【58】Pe \\= TP TP \\+ FN ,\n\n【59】(6)\n\n【60】NPV \\= TP TP \\+ FN ,\n\n【61】(7)\n\n【62】Acc \\= TP \\+ TN TP \\+ FP \\+ TN \\+ FN .\n\n【63】(8)\n\n【64】A confusion matrix analysis was conducted for the severity and type prediction on coronal alignments. For sagittal alignment assessment, we distinguish the patients from healthy controls according to the normal range of different parameters. Confusion matrices were generated for these sagittal parameters to visualise the agreement between GT and predicted results.\n\n【65】To quantitatively assess the validity of our medical AI system, linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis were conducted on several clinically relevant parameters defined in Section 2.2 . That is, for coronal cases, thoracic CA, thoracolumbar CA, and lumbar CA were considered, and for sagittal cases, TK, LL, and SS were considered. For each clinical parameter, linear regression was conducted between the predicted value and GT. The regression line (blue line), the 95% confidence interval of the predictions (green dashed line) and the perfect correspondence (red line) between the predictions and GT are shown in Figure 3 as well. The Bland-Altman analysis was performed between the mean of the predicted and GT values ((prediction+GT)/2) and their residual ((prediction-GT)/2) to examine the agreement of CAs between the predictions of SpineHRNet+ and the GTs. All statistical analyses in this study were performed using SciPy (version 1.7.0) and scikit-learn (version 0.23.2) python packages.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 3 Confusion matrices for the severity classification and sagittal CA detection on the prospective test data.

Table 3 compared the quantitative performance of the two models on the prospective test data (quantitative results on the in-house validation data were presented in Table 2.1 in the supplementary materials). As shown, SpineHRNet+ reduced both MED and MMD loss by at least 26·3% and 25·3%, respectively. Results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test suggested that the performance of SpineHRNet+ was significantly improved (all _p_ < 0·0001) compared with our previous version. In addition, several nonparametric statistical descriptors of two quantitative measurements, such as the median and interquartile range (IQR) were calculated to comprehensively evaluate the performance.

The predicted degrees of CAs are printed beside the endplate of the top end vertebra, and on the bottom, we count the angle difference (degree) of each CA between the predicted results and ground truth.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【93】Discussion\n----------\n\n【94】In this study, we developed a hybrid AI-powered model (SpineHRNet+) linking with our open platform AlignProCARE for easily accessible auto-alignment analysis. We prospectively tested its validity on multiple analytic tasks, including endplate landmark detection with the prospective evaluation of CA prediction, end vertebrae localisation, and severity classification in real-world trials. With this open platform, users can upload their radiographs by taking photos with a smartphone and instantly access the analysis results with the flexibility of further modification. Both the images and analytic results are encrypted during the uploading and downloading, with all processing and analysis performed on our server with SpineHRNet+.\n\n【95】Considering that spine alignment analysis is critical in the diagnosis and further management planning of scoliosis, assessment reliability and speed are important. Previously published studies have reported the use of machine learning models for measuring CAs . Although these studies have shown the potential value of AI techniques in determining spine shape, the datasets used to build the models were relatively small with debatable reliability. Instead of directly predicting CAs, some recent studies promoted the use of convolutional architectures to detect vertebral landmarks, followed by the calculation of CAs , \\]. Most of these approaches were trained in an end-to-end manner, directly outputting the landmark coordinates. In this regard, the AI model was used as a “blackbox” in these studies, making it hard to interpret how the predictions were made.\n\n【96】SpineHRNet+ can visualise the heatmap of landmarks as outputs, indicating the location of each endplate landmark, and the landmark coordinates are determined by the region with the highest probability value 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The design of the image processing pipeline adopted in SpineHRNet+ was inspired by the AIS clinical diagnosis procedure. We designed the pipeline into two stages, and in each stage, the model fulfils a sub-task, outputting the intermediate results. Using this approach, model interpretability is increased, also facilitating the supervision of model operation.\n\n【97】Our AI-powered model was trained and evaluated on captured biplanar radiographs with variable image quality to improve both the usefulness and generalisability of different user scenarios. Considering the resolution of a smartphone camera, environmental disturbances, and user handshake, the quality of user-uploaded images is usually much worse than the original high-resolution radiographs. However, even with low-quality images, our model can still achieve competitive and even better results compared with other AI models trained directly on the actual radiographs. In this regard, this work suggested that smartphone-captured radiographs are informative enough for the AI model to learn the spine alignment features.\n\n【98】Alignment prediction performed better for the coronal alignment and L curve detection since the radiographs demonstrate clearer individual vertebrae with the best intensity contrast in the L region 删除2:<u>( Figure 6 )</u>. For the severity classifications, the moderate curves were predicted most accurately due to the larger number of such samples in the training dataset 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Moderate cases are the most prevalent in scoliosis clinics. Furthermore, the severe cases were significantly fewer compared to moderate cases, and thus the performance was slightly decreased. The imbalance in curve severities is a feature of this population. We attempted to balance the training data using re-sampling during the model development stage, but this did not improve the performance during the in-house training. Thus, we kept the original dataset distribution.\n\n【99】We prospectively validated SpineHRNet+ for auto-spine analysis and deployed the first automatic AI-powered platform. Exiting open platforms for this purpose require clinicians to manually annotate the radiographs, which is laborious, time-consuming, and suffers from inter-rater variation. Our model and open platform can facilitate clinicians and researchers in handling large volumes of alignment assessment requests. However, femoral head detections in lateral radiographs were not included, thus pelvic incidence and pelvic tilt cannot be provided. It is because in our training dataset, a collection of the radiographs had the femoral head not included in the imaging field. We are in the process of collection recaptured radiographs with femoral heads and improve the sagittal alignments auto-analyses further. It must be noted the system was tested in two centres followed the same procedure to collect radiographs with the same clinical assessment standard to evaluate the spine alignments. The performance of the auto-alignment may reduce when directly apply in another centre. We are planning an international multi-centre trial to further assess the reliability of SpineHRNet+. Another limitation is no post-operative data were collected thus the auto-alignments cannot be performed on radiographs with instrumentation.\n\n【100】In summary, we deployed the first prospectively validated auto-alignment analysis model for spine curve classification using an open platform. The AI-powered hybrid system, SpineHRNet+ was trained and assessed with radiographs with variable qualities and sources, but still exhibited improved performance on multiple spine disease scenarios compared with our previous version. On further multi-centre validation in future, our platform can better assist clinicians and clinical research in large volumes.\n\n【101】Declaration of interests\n------------------------\n\n【102】删除9:<u>All authors declare there is no conflict of interest.</u>\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【103】We sincerely appreciated the support from the RGC Research Impact Fund (R5017–18F), Innovation and Technology Fund (ITS/404/18), and the AOSpine East Asia Fund (AOSEA(R) 2019–06).\n以下都删除1:<u>\n### Contributors\n\n【104】NM implemented the hybrid deep learning and rule-based model, deployed the model on the server, and managed the server.

He says much of the escalating cost of new drugs relates not to their effectiveness but to the expense of implementing inadequate treatments and return of patients to their doctors because of poor efficacy.\n\n【2】The escalating drug cost is due to preclinical research, manufacturing process, running expensive multicentre clinical trials, and marketing of the product. However the efficacy of some of these new drugs is no greater than that of older drugs. What differs is that the new drugs have better side-effect profiles and are better tolerated by patients.\n\n【3】In the current economic climate, universities and hospitals have lost the desire to support small investigator-initiated research unless it is self-funded. Universities commonly take a proportion of grants as an administrative cost, even if the individual researcher has a small amount of money in the research trust account. This cut is frequently disproportionate and does not take into consideration how the fund is generated-eg, lecture fees, conferences, clinical trials, and so on. Therefore, smaller research players, however innovative, are put at a disadvantage compared with those working on larger projects.\n\n【4】Evidence-based medicine has become a buzz phrase; it is difficult to test novel treatments with no evidence base. However, many things in the history of medicine have been discovered because of lateral thinking. Horrobin questions the ethics of a control system and argues that it impedes testing of treatments of no interest to the pharmaceutical industry. However, this distinction is not so in psychiatric practice, in which psychological treatments of no interest to pharmaceutical industry face the same rigour of testing under institutional ethics committees.\n\n【5】Ethics committees exist to protect patients' rights and prevent their potential abuse in the name of science. If these guidelines did not exist or were loosely applied, there is a grave danger of some scientists wanting to find a cause or cure for a poorly defined ailment, and possibly subjecting prisoners, minority groups, and chronically ill people whose capacity to give a truly informed consent can be doubted, as has been seen throughout history.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:39:52", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:40:02", "cost": 10.025}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:53", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:40:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:39:52"}

This has been a year of profound change during which the world has experienced the most consequential infectious disease outbreak of the past 100 years. However, although COVID-19 continues to dominate the headlines, progress addressing one of the most significant infectious disease concerns, antimicrobial resistance, remains glacial. The status of antibacterial pipelines was summarised by WHO on April 15 in their report _2020 Antibacterial Agents in Clinical and Preclinical Development: an overview and analysis_ .\n\n【1】The report emphasises the seriousness of the situation with the bottom line that “the clinical pipeline and recently approved antibiotics are insufficient to tackle the challenge of increasing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance”. However, the activity within the preclinical pipeline offers some hope, and if a fraction of the energy and investment directed against COVID-19 were to be diverted here, it is easy to imagine that the future of antimicrobials would be reinvigorated. As the report outlines, “the preclinical and clinical pipeline continues to be driven by small- and medium-sized companies, which in general are struggling to find investors to finance late-stage clinical development up to regulatory approval”.\n\n【2】Given that genuinely new types of traditional antibacterials are in increasingly short supply as new agents are mainly derivatives of existing classes, the report, for the first time, expands its scope to encompass non-traditional products, such as monoclonal antibodies, bacteriophages, antimicrobial peptides, and antibacterial enhancers. That these products tackle infection in novel ways provides further hope that they can reduce the pressures on microbial populations that drive the selection of resistance against conventional drugs. Nevertheless, it is likely that even the most novel non-traditional antibacterial product will at some point select for resistance if used at scale. As for the traditional antibacterial drugs, the guiding principle will still need to be stewardship.\n\n【3】As noted above, the report highlights that a lack of financial impetus is the underlying problem when it comes to encouraging and supporting the development of new antimicrobial products. This issue also has a bearing on COVID-19. Although not directly relevant to antimicrobial development, a recent preprint explored the sources of investment that fed into one of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, offering some lessons that counter the prevailing dogma of the importance of private enterprise. The study investigators scoured records to uncover the source of funding for the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine . They found that at least 97% of the research and development funding for both the vaccine and the underlying technology came from public and charitable funds. Despite the assertion in WHO's report that “small- and medium-sized companies” drive the antimicrobial pipeline, it is not unusual for private enterprise to be absent at this early stage, with discovery and development costs borne by universities and public funding bodies. Maybe we need to be brave enough to admit that sometimes the commercial model is not the answer to all questions.\n\n【4】This statement is not intended as a criticism of commercial enterprise per se, it is just a recognition that conventional models of antimicrobial drug development have not succeeded. And tweaks that build on the current commercial system have not shown signs of delivering the results the world needs. Furthermore, finding better ways to fund pharmaceutical manufacturers does not seem to be the most efficient way to get support to researchers who drive the development process.\n\n【5】Increasingly it is pointed out that the COVID-19 pandemic has shown what can be achieved with the appropriate political will. Such statements are closely followed by bemusement that other issues approaching similar scales of impact are not looked upon with the same urgency. This question is even more pertinent with regard to antimicrobial resistance, which more so than other problems has the genuine potential to be existential in its impact. Over the second year of _The Lancet Microbe_ , we hope to see the COVID-19 pandemic significantly diminished. Unfortunately, we are less optimistic about progress in tackling antimicrobial resistance. In fact, it will come as little surprise if a similar report in a year's time will be almost indistinguishable from the current version. Maybe the only way tangible progress can be made is if policy makers and the electorates that motivate them recognise, admittedly very late in the day, that we are in an antimicrobial resistance crisis?\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: May 2021\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(21)00097-5</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2021 The Author(s).

We appreciated this Review very much; however, as paediatric cardiologists, we would like to draw hepatologists' and pulmonologists' attentions to the following hypothesis.\n\n【1】The same pattern of hepatopulmonary syndrome is seen in some patients with “Fontan”-like circulations and exclusion of hepatic venous return through the pulmonary vascular bed. This finding reinforces the likelihood that the cause of the arteriovenous malformations is the absence of an as-yet unidentified hepatic vasoactive substance. However, the development of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae is not only associated with these low-flow, low-shear-stress pulmonary perfusions caused by vena cavae surgically connected to the pulmonary arteries and resulting in missing right-heart function, but also with intact pulsatile pulmonary blood flow only if hepatic venous return is excluded. Patients with this disorder have severe hypoxaemia as well as orthodeoxia. The only therapeutic option for these patients is the surgical redirection of hepatic venous flow to the pulmonary arterial system.\n\n【2】In patients with staging bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis and already developed intrapulmonary fistulae, the “hepatic” blood can be included by “Fontan” completion (total caval pulmonary connection). In this context, the pulmonary vessels are thought to need hepatic blood from a healthy liver to avoid these pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae, which result from an excessive angioproliferative process.\n\n【3】This hypothesis raises the question of whether there is some protecting or scavenging factor, produced by or located in a healthy liver, that is missing in patients with cirrhosis or in pulmonary circulations with an excluded first-bypass hepatic circulation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to assist clinicians in the detection and diagnosis of middle ear diseases through imaging.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Otoendoscopic images obtained by otolaryngologists from Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan between Jany 1, 2011 to Dec 31, 2019 were collected retrospectively and de-identified. The images were entered into convolutional neural network (CNN) training models after data pre-processing, augmentation and splitting. To differentiate sophisticated middle ear diseases, nine CNN-based models were constructed to recognize middle ear diseases. The best-performing models were chosen and ensembled in a small CNN for mobile device use. The pretrained model was converted into the smartphone-based program, and the utility was evaluated in terms of detecting and classifying ten middle ear diseases based on otoendoscopic images. A class activation map (CAM) was also used to identify key features for CNN classification. The performance of each classifier was determined by its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】A total of 2820 clinical eardrum images were collected for model training. The programme achieved a high detection accuracy for binary outcomes (pass/refer) of otoendoscopic images and ten different disease categories, with an accuracy reaching 98.0% after model optimisation. Furthermore, the application presented a smooth recognition process and a user-friendly interface and demonstrated excellent performance, with an accuracy of 97.6%. A fifty-question questionnaire related to middle ear diseases was designed for practitioners with different levels of clinical experience. The AI-empowered mobile algorithm's detection accuracy was generally superior to that of general physicians, resident doctors, and otolaryngology specialists (36.0%, 80.0% and 90.0%, respectively). Our results show that the proposed method provides sufficient treatment recommendations that are comparable to those of specialists.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】We developed a deep learning model that can detect and classify middle ear diseases. The use of smartphone-based point-of-care diagnostic devices with AI-empowered automated classification can provide real-world smart medical solutions for the diagnosis of middle ear diseases and telemedicine.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】This study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST110-2622-8-075-001, MOST110-2320-B-075-004-MY3, MOST-110-2634-F-A49 -005, MOST110-2745-B-075A-001A and MOST110-2221-E-075-005), Veterans General Hospitals and University System of Taiwan Joint Research Program (VGHUST111-G6-11-2, VGHUST111c-140), and Taipei Veterans General Hospital (V111E-002-3).\n\n【10】</u>\nKeywords\n--------\n\n【11】*   Middle ear diseases\n*   Deep learning\n*   Convolutional neural network\n*   Transfer learning\n*   Mobile applications\n*   Edge computing\n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】### Evidence before this study\n\n【14】Deep learning methods have been used to train learning models to predict middle ear diseases, which are among the most common issues faced by clinicians around the world. We searched PubMed without language constraints for peer-reviewed research articles up to Dec 31, 2021, using the search terms (“tympanic membrane”\\[MeSH Terms\\]) AND (“artificial intelligence” \\[MeSH Terms\\]). Neither of the studies mentioned a small-sized model applicable to mobile devices had been developed.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】This is the first study to develop a smartphone-based edge AI application to assist clinicians in detecting and categorising eardrum or middle ear diseases. This study applied the transfer learning model to develop a mobile device application to detect middle ear diseases. Our model successfully distinguished normal eardrums and diseased eardrums and achieved 98.9% detection accuracy; when the data were divided into ten common middle ear diseases, the accuracy reached 97.6%.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】This AI application, which is based on edge computing, is low-cost, portable, and functional in real time and thus innovative and practical. The application could be executed without additional cloud resource requirements. The proposed model can be easily integrated into mobile devices and used in telemedicine for detecting middle ear disorders.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Middle ear diseases such as otitis media and middle ear effusion are amongst the most common issues faced by clinicians providing primary care to children and adolescents. The worldwide prevalence of otitis media and otitis media with effusion are 2.85% and 0.6%, respectively, in the general population and 25.3% and 17.2%, respectively, in childhood. Making correct diagnoses through the inspection of ear drums is still a challenge for most general practitioners due to lack of specialty training, and ancillary hearing tests are often needed to achieve better accuracy. Severe complications such as acute mastoiditis, labyrinthitis or meningitis may develop if middle ear diseases are not properly diagnosed and treated in time, and these complications may cause sequalae such as hearing impairment or neurological deficits. Furthermore, some of these middle ear diseases are treated with unnecessary medications, such as broad-spectrum antibiotics, due to the difficulty of making prompt diagnoses. It is not surprising that even experienced otolaryngologists can only reach a diagnostic accuracy of 75% for some middle ear diseases, such as otitis media with effusion.\n\n【21】To overcome this diagnostic dilemma and improve diagnostic accuracy, several methods, such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks and Bayesian decision approaches, have been used to train different learning models and predict whether an image corresponds to a normal ear or an otitis media case. Myburgh et al. utilized a video endoscope to acquire images and a cloud server for pre-processing and entered the images into a smartphone-based neural network program for diagnosis. This system can distinguish five different middle ear diseases with a diagnosis rate of 86%. Seok et al. created a deep learning model for detection and identified the fine structures of the tympanic membrane; the interpretation accuracy of the sides of the tympanic membrane can reach 88.6%, and the diagnosis rate of tympanic membrane perforation is 91.4%.\n\n【22】Deep learning algorithms with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been successfully utilized in many medical specialties. Lightweight CNNs such as MobileNet are models derived from CNNs that are widely used in image analysis. The main advantage of using the lightweight CNNs is that they require fewer computing resources than the traditional CNN models, making them suitable for running on mobile devices such as smartphones.\n\n【23】Transfer learning and ensemble learning are the new trends for increasing performance and have been proven to be efficient in handling relatively small datasets. While transfer learning algorithms are built for classification, the ensemble learning technique can be further implemented to obtain a more accurate classification result with a weighted voting approach. Transfer learning is a type of learning framework that transfers the parameters of a pretrained model to a new model and can therefore perform a large amount of time-consuming data labelling work and improve the learning performance. Such a lightweight network contains fewer parameters and smaller scales of specific problems and learns the patterns contained in the input data through pretrained models; therefore, it is suitable for mobile devices with constrained computing resources.\n\n【24】In this study, we developed a deep learning model adapted to smartphones for the detection and diagnosis of middle ear diseases. The pretrained model with the best performance was converted into a smartphone-based program by transfer learning. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm was compared against a cohort of professional otolaryngologists and other practitioners.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Data acquisition\n\n【27】Our data were acquired from patients with middle ear diseases who sought medical help in the Department of Otolaryngology at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) in Taiwan from January 1st, 2011 to December 31st, 2019. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital 删除2:<u>(no. 2020-03-001CCF)</u>, and the study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was not applicable due to de-identified data.\n\n【28】The human- and computer-aided diagnosis system implemented in this study is summarized in Figure 1 .\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 **Developing a smartphone-based computing program for diagnosing middle ear disease and providing medical suggestions** .</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【29】The main architecture of our AI model is a CNN with transfer learning. Each layer extracts different tympanic membrane/intermediate image features, and all the extracted features are integrated to determine the type of middle ear disease and the corresponding treatment. Subsequently, a Core ML model was developed for this new smartphone-based eardrum application, where users can upload eardrum images to the cloud. The eardrum app analyses the input image and indicates the type of middle ear disease and the treatment to be performed based on the results.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【30】Data attributes and types include eardrum images and categories 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The ground-truth eardrum classification was annotated by three otolaryngology specialists. First, the otolaryngology specialists determined if the acquired otoendoscopic images were normal or diseased. Next, we checked if there were space-occupying abnormalities or foreign bodies (such as cerumen impactions, otomycosis or ventilation tubes) and then inspected if there were any perforations in the eardrum (chronic suppurative otitis media or tympanic perforation). We then scrutinized whether the middle ear was currently experiencing acute inflammation (acute otitis media or acute myringitis) or chronic inflammation (middle ear effusion or tympanic retraction). Ten classes of common middle ear conditions/diseases were selected and annotated, including (A) normal tympanic membrane, (B) acute otitis media, (C) acute myringitis, (D) chronic suppurative otitis media, (E) otitis media with effusion, (F) tympanic membrane perforation, (G) cerumen impaction, (H) ventilation tube, (I) tympanic membrane retraction, and (J) otomycosis. Because the initial image data were obtained in different sizes, we conducted an initial quality control step, filtering out low-resolution or incorrectly formatted images. The inclusion standard was 224 × 224 pixels, which is a 32-bit original image format.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 **Representative images of ten classes of common middle ear conditions/diseases** .</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【31】(A) normal tympanic membrane, (B) acute otitis media, (C) acute myringitis, (D) chronic suppurative otitis media, (E) otitis media with effusion, (F) tympanic membrane perforation, (G) cerumen impaction, (H) ventilation tube, (I) tympanic membrane retraction, and (J) otomycosis.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【32】### Data preparation\n\n【33】Pre-processing is the process of preparing raw data into a format that is suitable for machine learning. The processes, including image classification, the removal of images that cannot be judged by the human eye and the removal of black edges from images, were performed using the OpenCV libraries and Canny edge detection function.\n\n【34】Data augmentation expands the amount of data by generating modified data from an original dataset. As the normal eardrum category accounts for more than half of the original classification data, we deployed several transformation techniques using the OpenCV library, including flips (vertical, horizontal and both) and colour transformations (histogram normalisation, gamma correction, and Gaussian blurring). Images were randomly assigned to either the training set and validation dataset with a ratio of 8:2 ratio using the Scikit-Learn library.\n\n【35】### Development of the deep learning algorithms\n\n【36】Several standard CNN architectures were used to train the middle ear disease detection and classification model, including VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionV3, NASNetLarge, and ResNet50. The training was performed with the Keras library, with TensorFlow as the backend. The final softmax layer was added with two units to fit the number of different target categories in the middle ear disease classification task. Because the weight initialisation technique with an ImageNet pretrained network has been shown to improve the convergence speed, we applied this procedure in the initial training of the middle ear disease training model. All the layers of the proposed CNNs were fine-tuned by performing training for 50 epochs using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimiser (a batch size of 32 images, a learning rate of 0.0002, and a moment of 0.8). Our model uses an independent test dataset to evaluate the performance, and both the accuracy and the loss converged during the model training and model validation stages. The same experimental learning rate policy was applied to train all of the tested CNN models. All the AI model training and validation were performed on an IBM AC-922 Linux-based server with a 20-core Power CPU, an NVIDIA V100 SMX2 32-GB GPU card, and 1,024 GB of available RAM.\n\n【37】After the CNN training was completed, the best-performing model was selected as the pretrained model, and the weights were entered into the lightweight mobile CNNs, including NASNetMobile, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet201. The three mobile CNNs with transfer learning were then built for further assessment.\n\n【38】### Model assessment\n\n【39】We evaluated the performance of the models in terms of their ability to detect and classify middle ear diseases using the following metrics: ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves (true versus false-positive rate), AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), accuracy, precision and recall. Accuracy \\= ( TP \\+ TN ) / ( TP \\+ TN \\+ FP \\+ FN ) ; precision \\= TP / (TP \\+ FP ) ; recall or true-positive rate \\= TP / (TP \\+ FN ) ; false-positive rate = FP / ( FP \\+ TN ) (TP: true-positive; TN: true-negative; FP: false-positive; FN: false-negative).\n\n【40】The F1-score is the harmonic mean of recall and precision, which are the sum of true positives divided by the sum of all positives and the sum of true positives divided by the sum of all relevant samples. The F1-score considers the number of each label when calculating the recall and precision and is therefore suitable for evaluating the performance on multi-label classification tasks with imbalanced datasets. The model selection was based on the F1-score.\n\n【41】### Class activation map\n\n【42】To interpret the prediction decision, a class activation map (CAM) was deployed to recognize the CNN results. The CAM is presented with a rainbow colormap scale, where the red colour stands for high relevance, yellow stands for medium relevance, and blue stands for low relevance. This process can effectively visualize feature variations in illuminated conditions, normal structures, and lesions, which are commonly observed in middle ear images. CAMs can provide supplementary analysis for the CNN model so that the location of the disease pre-set by the program can be clearly understood instead of being recognized as an indistinct judgement.\n\n【43】### Model conversion and integration into a smartphone application\n\n【44】The pretrained model was integrated into the smartphone application by using the Python library Core ML Tools. Figure 3 demonstrates the application's interface (designed for the Apple iOS system). A user provides a middle ear disease image as input. This image is then transformed into a probability distribution over the considered categories of middle ear lesions. The most probable classification (e.g. normal eardrum, acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, tympanic perforation, otitis media with effusion, cerumen impaction, acute myringitis, ventilation tube, eardrum atelectasis, or otomycosis) is then displayed on the screen. The inference process is executed in near-real-time.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 3 Representative demonstration of middle ear disease detection in the mobile application.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【45】### Evaluating the performance of clinicians\n\n【46】To compare the performance of our AI program with that of clinicians, 6 practitioners with different levels of expertise, including 2 board-certified otolaryngology specialists (over 5 years of expertise), 2 otolaryngology residents (1-4 years of expertise or training in otolaryngology) and 2 general practitioners (GPs) (less than 1 year of expertise or training in otolaryngology), were recruited. A set of questionnaires was designed with a total of fifty questions, each containing a picture of the endoscopic view of an eardrum from our preliminary data bank of images, and the responders were asked to choose the most suitable option from ten middle ear disease categories.\n\n【47】### Statistical analysis\n\n【48】The performance of our model was evaluated by the indices of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ROC curve and AUC were plotted using the Python Scikit-Learn library. An ROC curve plots true positive rate versus the false positive rate at different classification thresholds. The AUC scales with overall performance across all possible classification thresholds. All statistical tests were two-sided permutation tests. A p-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The obtained data were entered into Excel and analysed using SPSS (version 24 for Windows; IBM Company, Chicago, USA).\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【49】The funder of the study has no role in study design, the collection, analysis and interpretation of data, the writing of the report, or the decision to submit the paper for publication.

The corresponding authors have final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n【50】</u>\nResults\n-------\n\n【51】### Establishing and pre-processing an eardrum image dataset for CNN model training\n\n【52】A total of 4,954 pictures were initially included in the study. Next, 2,134 pictures were excluded because the photos were not suitable for analysis due to issues such as blurring, duplications, inappropriate positions, and missing medical records. The remaining 2,820 clinical eardrum images were collected and divided into 10 categories. After pre-processing, 2,161 images were selected for further CNN training. To improve the performance of deep learning, the dataset was increased by data augmentation, and the total number of images was expanded to 10,465. The image number of each category is detailed in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n【53】### Diagnostic performance of the CNN models and mobile CNN models\n\n【54】Six different CNN architectures (Xception, ResNet50, NASNetLarge, VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionV3) were tested on the training dataset, and the performance of the different models based on these ten types of normal and middle ear disease images was verified using the validation dataset. The training process was run for 50 epochs, and the best models with the minimal loss values (corresponding to the 34th, 50th, and 42nd epochs for VGG16, InceptionV3 and ResNet50, respectively) were selected and used for verification 删除2:<u>(Supplementary Figure 2)</u>. After parameter adjustment, our results show that among the six tested CNN architectures, InceptionV3 exhibited the highest F1-score during validation (98%) and was selected for further transfer learning 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Our results showed that almost all CNNs achieved a high detection accuracy in binary outcome cases (pass/refer) of middle ear disease images and successfully subclassified the majority of the images. By making use of the confusion matrix and classification report to examine the training results, the average preliminary accuracy achieved on the test dataset reached 91.0%, and the average training time was 6,575 seconds.\n\n【55】Table 1 Image characteristics and diagnostic performance.\n\n| EvaluationIndicators | Acc (%) | Recall (%) | Precision (%) | Sen (%) | Sp (%) | F1-Score (%) | AUC Score(95%CI) | Training/Test Time (sec) | Best Number of Epochs |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** |\n| VGG16 | 97.3 | 97.1 | 97.2 | 97.1 | 99.7 | 97.1 | 0.984(0.979-0.989) | 1200 | 34 |\n| VGG19 | 96.7 | 96.4 | 96.5 | 96.4 | 99.6 | 96.5 | 0.998(0.996-0.999) | 1650 | 41 |\n| Xception | 76.6 | 75.8 | 81.7 | 75.8 | 97.4 | 77.0 | 0.866(0.853–0.879) | 2550 | 49 |\n| InceptionV3 | 98.0 | 97.9 | 98.1 | 97.9 | 99.8 | 98.0 | 0.989(0.985–0.992) | 9000 | 50 |\n| NASNetLarge | 80.8 | 80.7 | 81.4 | 80.7 | 97.9 | 80.0 | 0.893(0.888–0.898) | 23,200 | 47 |\n| ResNet50 | 96.8 | 96.5 | 96.7 | 96.5 | 96.8 | 96.5 | 0.981(0.977–0.984) | 1850 | 42 |\n| **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** |\n| NASNetMobile(TL) | 97.2 | 97.1 | 97.2 | 97.1 | 99.7 | 97.1 | 0.984(0.980–0.988) | 1550 | 2 |\n| MobileNetV2(TL) | 97.6 | 97.4 | 97.4 | 97.4 | 99.7 | 97.4 | 0.985(0.980–0.990) | 4500 | 9 |\n| DenseNet201(TL) | 97.3 | 97.1 | 97.2 | 97.1 | 99.7 | 97.1 | 0.984(0.979–0.989) | 1600 | 2 |\n\n【57】Acc = accuracy; Sen = sensitivity; Sp = specificity; AUC = area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; TL= Transfer learning with InceptionV3.\n\n【58】 Champion model for transfer learning.\n\n【59】  Champion model integrated into smartphone.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【60】To enable the use of the CNN model on a mobile phone without affecting the accuracy of the model, we further shifted the information contained in different but relatively large source domains by transfer training with three lightweight CNNs, including NASNetMobile, MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201.

Our model successfully distinguished normal eardrums and diseased eardrums and achieved a high detection accuracy. When the data were divided into ten common middle ear diseases, the accuracy reached 97.6%. The model showed a high degree of accuracy in disease prediction and provided the most probable diagnoses ranked by the probability of various diseases on a smartphone interface. In addition, this model is a “device-side AI” (also called “edge AI”); because the computations can be performed locally on the images acquired on mobile devices, this method has the advantage of offline connection with a fast-computing power, which reduces latency delays and protects patient privacy. This study is also the first to investigate several mainstream CNN methods with lightweight architectures for ear drum/middle ear disease detection and diagnosis on mobile devices.\n\n【65】In the past, CNNs were experimentally used for otitis media diagnosis tasks, although most current databases and codes were not available for public use, and only limited disease categories were available to support empirical clinical diagnosis. We divided all collected otoendoscopic eardrum pictures into 10 categories (normal ears and common ear diseases) based on past research and clinical experience. To improve the accuracy of system interpretation, we deleted pictures with a poor image quality, blurry images and less representative images, aggregated the results into 2161 pictures with a better quality, and then analysed them via the artificial intelligence system. Machine learning techniques such as SVMs, k-nearest neighbours (K-NN) and decision trees are supervised machine learning models with simple processes and high levels of execution efficiency. These models are suitable for the prediction and classification and regression data; however, their model training processes may be time-consuming and GPU-consuming, as deep learning approaches must be trained on a very large dataset. To overcome this drawback, a deep CNN was pretrained via transfer learning, which applies the knowledge learned by certain models to another task.\n\n【66】Due to the advancement of image analysis, we found that MobileNet had fewer parameters than other CNN models and was more feasible in mobile devices with less processing power, such as smartphones. Recent studies have shown that although MobileNet is a lightweight network model, its classification accuracy was only 1% less than that of the conventional CNN after conducting the transfer learning-based training technique, and this result was similar to that obtained in our study. Eventually, we successfully developed the CNN system with transfer learning and placed it in a mobile application to make it more convenient and accessible.\n\n【67】Some relevant studies utilizing mobile devices for the detection and diagnosis of middle ear diseases have been performed, as summarized in Table 2 . Wu et al. used a digital handheld otoscope connected to a smartphone and developed a CNN model for the automated classification of paediatric acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion, achieving an accuracy of 90.7%. By using smartphone-enabled otoscopes, Moshtaghi et al. reported a 100% sensitivity rate for the detection of abnormal middle ear conditions and developed a model to achieve a 98.7% overall accuracy on intact tympanic membranes and a 91% overall accuracy in terms of perforation. Myburgh et al. reported on a smartphone application for loading ear drum images and obtained an accuracy of 86.8% with a neural network. Viscaino et al. developed a computer-aided support system based on digital otoscope images and machine learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN and decision tree. With otoendoscopic images, Khan et al. also developed a CNN model that reached a 95% accuracy in differentiating otitis media with effusion (OME) from normal eardrum conditions. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilize transfer learning for smartphone applications to develop device-side AI for detecting and diagnosing middle ear diseases. Edge computing, which is also called “edge AI” or “device AI”, is meant to deal with the constraints faced by conventional deep learning-based architectures deployed in a centralized cloud environment, such as the considerable latency of the mobile network, energy consumption and the financial costs affecting the overall performance of the system. Our results show that the developed algorithm achieved a high detection accuracy in binary outcome cases (pass/refer) of middle ear disease images and successfully subclassified the majority.\n\n【68】Table 2 Comparison of the proposed model with previous studies.\n\n|  | N | Classification | Accuracy | Year | Algorithm | Device |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Senaras et al. | 247 | 2 | 84.6% | 2017 | CNN | PC |\n| Myburgh et al. | 389 | 5 | 81.6%∼ 86.8% | 2018 | DT+ CNN | PC |\n| Cha et al. | 10,544 | 6 | 93.7% | 2019 | CNN+ETL | PC |\n| Livingstone et al. | 1366 | 14 | 88.7% | 2020 | AutoML | PC |\n| Khan et al. | 2484 | 3 | 95.0% | 2020 | CNN | PC |\n| Wu et al. | 12,230 | 2 | 90.7% | 2021 | CNN+TL | Smartphone-otoscope |\n| Zafer et al. | 857 | 4 | 99.5% | 2020 | DCNN, SVM | PC (public dataset) |\n| Viscaino et al. | 1060 | 4 | 93.9% | 2020 | SVM, K-NN, DT | PC |\n| Zeng et al. | 20,542 | 6 | 95.6% | 2021 | CNN+ETL | Real-time detection device |\n| Current study | 2171 | 10 | 97.6% | 2022 | CNN+TL | Smartphone application |\n\n【70】N= number of images in dataset; DT= decision tree; AutoML = automated machine learning; CNN=convolutional neural network; DCNN= deep convolutional neural network; K-NN= K-nearest neighbour; PC = personal computer; ETL=ensemble transfer learning.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【71】In our study, the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed AI algorithm was comparable to that of otolaryngology specialists and superior to that of non-experts, including general practitioners and otolaryngologic residents. Khan et al. developed an expert judgment system to differentiate 2 different middle ear diseases (normal, chronic otitis media with tympanic perforation, and otitis media with effusion). The average accuracy score for medical professionals with mixed expertise was 74%, which is inferior to that of the proposed CNN model (95%). Byun et al. reported an average accuracy score of 82.9% in diagnosing three common middle ear diseases (otitis media with effusion, chronic otitis media, and cholesteatoma) for junior otolaryngology resident doctors, which is inferior to the results of the proposed AI algorithm (97.2%). A similar trend was observed in the study by Livingston et al. who found a lower accuracy of 58.9% for non-experts compared to the proposed AI algorithm (88.7%). While AI algorithms have achieved performances that are comparable to those of medical experts in diagnosing common middle ear disorders, the difference between a diagnosis made by AI and that made by a clinician with different types of expertise still needs to be further explored.\n\n【72】The utilisation of artificial intelligence coupled with the CNN strategies of deep learning for automated disease detection is made possible by the fact that each ear drum/middle ear disease has a unique visual feature. Ear drum/middle ear diseases are usually detected and diagnosed through visual examination by clinicians based on otoscopy. However, it is challenging for general practitioners or non-otolaryngologists to make proper diagnoses due to limited training and experience in otoscopy. In addition, due to economic or geographical barriers, access to otolaryngology specialists for an adequate diagnosis and a proper subsequent treatment may be limited. The burden of hearing loss has attracted increasing attention worldwide, and hearing damage caused by middle ear disease can be reversed if diagnosed promptly. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has also posed challenges in terms of providing adequate health services, rendering telemedicine a useful tool in detecting and diagnosing diseases that previously required close contact and on-site inspection. Telemedicine for middle ear diseases is made possible for clinicians by using otoscopic images obtained from smartphone-enabled otoscopy. However, conducting telemedicine for otoscopic inspection may be difficult in areas or countries with poor mobile internet infrastructure or limited mobile internet access. Our system can be simply embedded in smartphones, and it enables the detection and recognition of ear drum/middle ear diseases in a timely manner without experts or online consultations.\n\n【73】The training results of the CNN models showed that the detection and diagnosis of middle ear disease could be achieved and simplified by transfer learning. Therefore, a lightweight model such as MobileNetV2 can also have a comparable accuracy with that of other large models. Using MobileNetV2 and TensorFlow Serving or Core ML technology, the model can be put on a mobile device to assist doctors in the diagnosis of middle ear diseases. The program also revealed a user-friendly interface for assisting diagnoses. For example, the intricate interrogation showed that 9 of the 180 images of chronic suppurative otitis media were diagnosed as tympanic perforation, while 7 of the 155 images of tympanic retraction were diagnosed as otitis media with effusion. In real-world practice, both diseases sometimes coexist and are diagnosed simultaneously. Our solution provides clinicians with the most likely diagnosis by ranking percentages and including the coexisting disease in the first two orders.\n\n【74】In this study, the transfer learning model was used to develop a mobile device application to detect middle ear diseases, so that model inference could be performed without additional cloud resource requirements. Other studies were based on cloud computing methods to perform model inference, which requires internet access and long-latency connections, and personal privacy could be violated. However, our system does not require internet access. In places where medical resources are scarce or mobile internet access is limited, clinicians can make good use of this device to assist in proper the diagnosis of middle ear diseases.\n\n【75】Current AI systems have achieved diagnostic performances that are comparable to those of medical experts in many medical specialties, especially in image recognition-related fields. Smartphones with features such as high-resolution cameras and powerful computation chips have been extensively used worldwide. The diagnostic accuracy of our smartphone-based AI application was comparable to that of otolaryngology experts. The diagnostic suggestions generated by medical AI may be beneficial for medical professionals with different levels and types of expertise. For non-otolaryngology medical professionals, the proposed algorithm may assist in expert-level diagnosis, leading to seamless diagnoses, increasing the speed of treatment or ensuring a proper referral. For otolaryngology experts, the proposed algorithm may provide an opportunity for shared decision making by providing easily accessible smartphone tools, thereby improving the doctor-patient relationship.\n\n【76】Our study has some limitations that should be noted. First, the model cannot cover all eardrum/middle ear diseases, such as complicated cholesteatoma and rare middle ear tumours. However, our model is sufficient for the interpretation of the most common eardrum/middle ear diseases and the decision regarding further referral. Second, despite the high accuracy, the final diagnoses still require further inspection by medical personnel to prevent misjudgements. Procrastination with regard to treating some middle ear diseases, such as acute otitis media, may lead to fatal complications in rare cases. Third, all of our image data were retrieved from a single medical centre with high-resolution otoendoscopy, and further expansion of the image database or labelling of the disease targets may be required to extend its applicability and publicity. Finally, although the smartphone application can either take an existing middle ear image or a snapshot provided by the mobile device as input, the quality of the images obtained via the latter approach may not be satisfactory for further processing. Further studies are required to examine the coupled otoscopic application to better acquire eardrum images.\n\n【77】In this study, we developed a system for detecting and categorizing common eardrum or middle ear diseases by artificial intelligence and integrated it into a smartphone application to detect ten common ear conditions by transfer learning. The accuracy of the proposed model is comparable to that of otolaryngology specialists in the detection or diagnosis of common middle ear diseases. Due to its compactness, the developed model can easily be integrated into a mobile device and used in telemedicine for detecting middle ear disorders.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【78】YC Chen, YF Cheng and YC Chu participated in writing the final draft.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to assist clinicians in the detection and diagnosis of middle ear diseases through imaging.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Otoendoscopic images obtained by otolaryngologists from Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan between Jany 1, 2011 to Dec 31, 2019 were collected retrospectively and de-identified. The images were entered into convolutional neural network (CNN) training models after data pre-processing, augmentation and splitting. To differentiate sophisticated middle ear diseases, nine CNN-based models were constructed to recognize middle ear diseases. The best-performing models were chosen and ensembled in a small CNN for mobile device use. The pretrained model was converted into the smartphone-based program, and the utility was evaluated in terms of detecting and classifying ten middle ear diseases based on otoendoscopic images. A class activation map (CAM) was also used to identify key features for CNN classification. The performance of each classifier was determined by its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】A total of 2820 clinical eardrum images were collected for model training. The programme achieved a high detection accuracy for binary outcomes (pass/refer) of otoendoscopic images and ten different disease categories, with an accuracy reaching 98.0% after model optimisation. Furthermore, the application presented a smooth recognition process and a user-friendly interface and demonstrated excellent performance, with an accuracy of 97.6%. A fifty-question questionnaire related to middle ear diseases was designed for practitioners with different levels of clinical experience. The AI-empowered mobile algorithm's detection accuracy was generally superior to that of general physicians, resident doctors, and otolaryngology specialists (36.0%, 80.0% and 90.0%, respectively). Our results show that the proposed method provides sufficient treatment recommendations that are comparable to those of specialists.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】We developed a deep learning model that can detect and classify middle ear diseases. The use of smartphone-based point-of-care diagnostic devices with AI-empowered automated classification can provide real-world smart medical solutions for the diagnosis of middle ear diseases and telemedicine.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】This study was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST110-2622-8-075-001, MOST110-2320-B-075-004-MY3, MOST-110-2634-F-A49 -005, MOST110-2745-B-075A-001A and MOST110-2221-E-075-005), Veterans General Hospitals and University System of Taiwan Joint Research Program (VGHUST111-G6-11-2, VGHUST111c-140), and Taipei Veterans General Hospital (V111E-002-3).\n\n【10】</u>\nKeywords\n--------\n\n【11】*   Middle ear diseases\n*   Deep learning\n*   Convolutional neural network\n*   Transfer learning\n*   Mobile applications\n*   Edge computing\n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】### Evidence before this study\n\n【14】Deep learning methods have been used to train learning models to predict middle ear diseases, which are among the most common issues faced by clinicians around the world. We searched PubMed without language constraints for peer-reviewed research articles up to Dec 31, 2021, using the search terms (“tympanic membrane”\\[MeSH Terms\\]) AND (“artificial intelligence” \\[MeSH Terms\\]). Neither of the studies mentioned a small-sized model applicable to mobile devices had been developed.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】This is the first study to develop a smartphone-based edge AI application to assist clinicians in detecting and categorising eardrum or middle ear diseases. This study applied the transfer learning model to develop a mobile device application to detect middle ear diseases. Our model successfully distinguished normal eardrums and diseased eardrums and achieved 98.9% detection accuracy; when the data were divided into ten common middle ear diseases, the accuracy reached 97.6%.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】This AI application, which is based on edge computing, is low-cost, portable, and functional in real time and thus innovative and practical. The application could be executed without additional cloud resource requirements. The proposed model can be easily integrated into mobile devices and used in telemedicine for detecting middle ear disorders.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Middle ear diseases such as otitis media and middle ear effusion are amongst the most common issues faced by clinicians providing primary care to children and adolescents. The worldwide prevalence of otitis media and otitis media with effusion are 2.85% and 0.6%, respectively, in the general population and 25.3% and 17.2%, respectively, in childhood. Making correct diagnoses through the inspection of ear drums is still a challenge for most general practitioners due to lack of specialty training, and ancillary hearing tests are often needed to achieve better accuracy. Severe complications such as acute mastoiditis, labyrinthitis or meningitis may develop if middle ear diseases are not properly diagnosed and treated in time, and these complications may cause sequalae such as hearing impairment or neurological deficits. Furthermore, some of these middle ear diseases are treated with unnecessary medications, such as broad-spectrum antibiotics, due to the difficulty of making prompt diagnoses. It is not surprising that even experienced otolaryngologists can only reach a diagnostic accuracy of 75% for some middle ear diseases, such as otitis media with effusion.\n\n【21】To overcome this diagnostic dilemma and improve diagnostic accuracy, several methods, such as decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks and Bayesian decision approaches, have been used to train different learning models and predict whether an image corresponds to a normal ear or an otitis media case. Myburgh et al. utilized a video endoscope to acquire images and a cloud server for pre-processing and entered the images into a smartphone-based neural network program for diagnosis. This system can distinguish five different middle ear diseases with a diagnosis rate of 86%. Seok et al. created a deep learning model for detection and identified the fine structures of the tympanic membrane; the interpretation accuracy of the sides of the tympanic membrane can reach 88.6%, and the diagnosis rate of tympanic membrane perforation is 91.4%.\n\n【22】Deep learning algorithms with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been successfully utilized in many medical specialties. Lightweight CNNs such as MobileNet are models derived from CNNs that are widely used in image analysis. The main advantage of using the lightweight CNNs is that they require fewer computing resources than the traditional CNN models, making them suitable for running on mobile devices such as smartphones.\n\n【23】Transfer learning and ensemble learning are the new trends for increasing performance and have been proven to be efficient in handling relatively small datasets. While transfer learning algorithms are built for classification, the ensemble learning technique can be further implemented to obtain a more accurate classification result with a weighted voting approach. Transfer learning is a type of learning framework that transfers the parameters of a pretrained model to a new model and can therefore perform a large amount of time-consuming data labelling work and improve the learning performance. Such a lightweight network contains fewer parameters and smaller scales of specific problems and learns the patterns contained in the input data through pretrained models; therefore, it is suitable for mobile devices with constrained computing resources.\n\n【24】In this study, we developed a deep learning model adapted to smartphones for the detection and diagnosis of middle ear diseases. The pretrained model with the best performance was converted into a smartphone-based program by transfer learning. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm was compared against a cohort of professional otolaryngologists and other practitioners.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Data acquisition\n\n【27】Our data were acquired from patients with middle ear diseases who sought medical help in the Department of Otolaryngology at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) in Taiwan from January 1st, 2011 to December 31st, 2019. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei Veterans General Hospital 删除2:<u>(no. 2020-03-001CCF)</u>, and the study adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was not applicable due to de-identified data.\n\n【28】The human- and computer-aided diagnosis system implemented in this study is summarized in Figure 1 .\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 **Developing a smartphone-based computing program for diagnosing middle ear disease and providing medical suggestions** .</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【29】The main architecture of our AI model is a CNN with transfer learning. Each layer extracts different tympanic membrane/intermediate image features, and all the extracted features are integrated to determine the type of middle ear disease and the corresponding treatment. Subsequently, a Core ML model was developed for this new smartphone-based eardrum application, where users can upload eardrum images to the cloud. The eardrum app analyses the input image and indicates the type of middle ear disease and the treatment to be performed based on the results.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【30】Data attributes and types include eardrum images and categories 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 )</u>. The ground-truth eardrum classification was annotated by three otolaryngology specialists. First, the otolaryngology specialists determined if the acquired otoendoscopic images were normal or diseased. Next, we checked if there were space-occupying abnormalities or foreign bodies (such as cerumen impactions, otomycosis or ventilation tubes) and then inspected if there were any perforations in the eardrum (chronic suppurative otitis media or tympanic perforation). We then scrutinized whether the middle ear was currently experiencing acute inflammation (acute otitis media or acute myringitis) or chronic inflammation (middle ear effusion or tympanic retraction). Ten classes of common middle ear conditions/diseases were selected and annotated, including (A) normal tympanic membrane, (B) acute otitis media, (C) acute myringitis, (D) chronic suppurative otitis media, (E) otitis media with effusion, (F) tympanic membrane perforation, (G) cerumen impaction, (H) ventilation tube, (I) tympanic membrane retraction, and (J) otomycosis. Because the initial image data were obtained in different sizes, we conducted an initial quality control step, filtering out low-resolution or incorrectly formatted images. The inclusion standard was 224 × 224 pixels, which is a 32-bit original image format.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 **Representative images of ten classes of common middle ear conditions/diseases** .</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【31】(A) normal tympanic membrane, (B) acute otitis media, (C) acute myringitis, (D) chronic suppurative otitis media, (E) otitis media with effusion, (F) tympanic membrane perforation, (G) cerumen impaction, (H) ventilation tube, (I) tympanic membrane retraction, and (J) otomycosis.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【32】### Data preparation\n\n【33】Pre-processing is the process of preparing raw data into a format that is suitable for machine learning. The processes, including image classification, the removal of images that cannot be judged by the human eye and the removal of black edges from images, were performed using the OpenCV libraries and Canny edge detection function.\n\n【34】Data augmentation expands the amount of data by generating modified data from an original dataset. As the normal eardrum category accounts for more than half of the original classification data, we deployed several transformation techniques using the OpenCV library, including flips (vertical, horizontal and both) and colour transformations (histogram normalisation, gamma correction, and Gaussian blurring). Images were randomly assigned to either the training set and validation dataset with a ratio of 8:2 ratio using the Scikit-Learn library.\n\n【35】### Development of the deep learning algorithms\n\n【36】Several standard CNN architectures were used to train the middle ear disease detection and classification model, including VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionV3, NASNetLarge, and ResNet50. The training was performed with the Keras library, with TensorFlow as the backend. The final softmax layer was added with two units to fit the number of different target categories in the middle ear disease classification task. Because the weight initialisation technique with an ImageNet pretrained network has been shown to improve the convergence speed, we applied this procedure in the initial training of the middle ear disease training model. All the layers of the proposed CNNs were fine-tuned by performing training for 50 epochs using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimiser (a batch size of 32 images, a learning rate of 0.0002, and a moment of 0.8). Our model uses an independent test dataset to evaluate the performance, and both the accuracy and the loss converged during the model training and model validation stages. The same experimental learning rate policy was applied to train all of the tested CNN models. All the AI model training and validation were performed on an IBM AC-922 Linux-based server with a 20-core Power CPU, an NVIDIA V100 SMX2 32-GB GPU card, and 1,024 GB of available RAM.\n\n【37】After the CNN training was completed, the best-performing model was selected as the pretrained model, and the weights were entered into the lightweight mobile CNNs, including NASNetMobile, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet201. The three mobile CNNs with transfer learning were then built for further assessment.\n\n【38】### Model assessment\n\n【39】We evaluated the performance of the models in terms of their ability to detect and classify middle ear diseases using the following metrics: ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves (true versus false-positive rate), AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), accuracy, precision and recall. Accuracy \\= ( TP \\+ TN ) / ( TP \\+ TN \\+ FP \\+ FN ) ; precision \\= TP / (TP \\+ FP ) ; recall or true-positive rate \\= TP / (TP \\+ FN ) ; false-positive rate = FP / ( FP \\+ TN ) (TP: true-positive; TN: true-negative; FP: false-positive; FN: false-negative).\n\n【40】The F1-score is the harmonic mean of recall and precision, which are the sum of true positives divided by the sum of all positives and the sum of true positives divided by the sum of all relevant samples. The F1-score considers the number of each label when calculating the recall and precision and is therefore suitable for evaluating the performance on multi-label classification tasks with imbalanced datasets. The model selection was based on the F1-score.\n\n【41】### Class activation map\n\n【42】To interpret the prediction decision, a class activation map (CAM) was deployed to recognize the CNN results. The CAM is presented with a rainbow colormap scale, where the red colour stands for high relevance, yellow stands for medium relevance, and blue stands for low relevance. This process can effectively visualize feature variations in illuminated conditions, normal structures, and lesions, which are commonly observed in middle ear images. CAMs can provide supplementary analysis for the CNN model so that the location of the disease pre-set by the program can be clearly understood instead of being recognized as an indistinct judgement.\n\n【43】### Model conversion and integration into a smartphone application\n\n【44】The pretrained model was integrated into the smartphone application by using the Python library Core ML Tools. Figure 3 demonstrates the application's interface (designed for the Apple iOS system). A user provides a middle ear disease image as input. This image is then transformed into a probability distribution over the considered categories of middle ear lesions. The most probable classification (e.g. normal eardrum, acute otitis media, chronic otitis media, tympanic perforation, otitis media with effusion, cerumen impaction, acute myringitis, ventilation tube, eardrum atelectasis, or otomycosis) is then displayed on the screen. The inference process is executed in near-real-time.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 3 Representative demonstration of middle ear disease detection in the mobile application.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【45】### Evaluating the performance of clinicians\n\n【46】To compare the performance of our AI program with that of clinicians, 6 practitioners with different levels of expertise, including 2 board-certified otolaryngology specialists (over 5 years of expertise), 2 otolaryngology residents (1-4 years of expertise or training in otolaryngology) and 2 general practitioners (GPs) (less than 1 year of expertise or training in otolaryngology), were recruited. A set of questionnaires was designed with a total of fifty questions, each containing a picture of the endoscopic view of an eardrum from our preliminary data bank of images, and the responders were asked to choose the most suitable option from ten middle ear disease categories.\n\n【47】### Statistical analysis\n\n【48】The performance of our model was evaluated by the indices of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The ROC curve and AUC were plotted using the Python Scikit-Learn library. An ROC curve plots true positive rate versus the false positive rate at different classification thresholds. The AUC scales with overall performance across all possible classification thresholds. All statistical tests were two-sided permutation tests. A p-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. The obtained data were entered into Excel and analysed using SPSS (version 24 for Windows; IBM Company, Chicago, USA).\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【49】The funder of the study has no role in study design, the collection, analysis and interpretation of data, the writing of the report, or the decision to submit the paper for publication. All authors had full access to all data within the study. The corresponding authors have final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n【50】</u>\nResults\n-------\n\n【51】### Establishing and pre-processing an eardrum image dataset for CNN model training\n\n【52】A total of 4,954 pictures were initially included in the study. Next, 2,134 pictures were excluded because the photos were not suitable for analysis due to issues such as blurring, duplications, inappropriate positions, and missing medical records. The remaining 2,820 clinical eardrum images were collected and divided into 10 categories. After pre-processing, 2,161 images were selected for further CNN training. To improve the performance of deep learning, the dataset was increased by data augmentation, and the total number of images was expanded to 10,465. The image number of each category is detailed in Supplementary Table 1.\n\n【53】### Diagnostic performance of the CNN models and mobile CNN models\n\n【54】Six different CNN architectures (Xception, ResNet50, NASNetLarge, VGG16, VGG19, and InceptionV3) were tested on the training dataset, and the performance of the different models based on these ten types of normal and middle ear disease images was verified using the validation dataset. The training process was run for 50 epochs, and the best models with the minimal loss values (corresponding to the 34th, 50th, and 42nd epochs for VGG16, InceptionV3 and ResNet50, respectively) were selected and used for verification 删除2:<u>(Supplementary Figure 2)</u>. After parameter adjustment, our results show that among the six tested CNN architectures, InceptionV3 exhibited the highest F1-score during validation (98%) and was selected for further transfer learning 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Our results showed that almost all CNNs achieved a high detection accuracy in binary outcome cases (pass/refer) of middle ear disease images and successfully subclassified the majority of the images. By making use of the confusion matrix and classification report to examine the training results, the average preliminary accuracy achieved on the test dataset reached 91.0%, and the average training time was 6,575 seconds.\n\n【55】Table 1 Image characteristics and diagnostic performance.\n\n| EvaluationIndicators | Acc (%) | Recall (%) | Precision (%) | Sen (%) | Sp (%) | F1-Score (%) | AUC Score(95%CI) | Training/Test Time (sec) | Best Number of Epochs |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** | **CNN models** |\n| VGG16 | 97.3 | 97.1 | 97.2 | 97.1 | 99.7 | 97.1 | 0.984(0.979-0.989) | 1200 | 34 |\n| VGG19 | 96.7 | 96.4 | 96.5 | 96.4 | 99.6 | 96.5 | 0.998(0.996-0.999) | 1650 | 41 |\n| Xception | 76.6 | 75.8 | 81.7 | 75.8 | 97.4 | 77.0 | 0.866(0.853–0.879) | 2550 | 49 |\n| InceptionV3 | 98.0 | 97.9 | 98.1 | 97.9 | 99.8 | 98.0 | 0.989(0.985–0.992) | 9000 | 50 |\n| NASNetLarge | 80.8 | 80.7 | 81.4 | 80.7 | 97.9 | 80.0 | 0.893(0.888–0.898) | 23,200 | 47 |\n| ResNet50 | 96.8 | 96.5 | 96.7 | 96.5 | 96.8 | 96.5 | 0.981(0.977–0.984) | 1850 | 42 |\n| **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** | **Lightweight CNN models** |\n| NASNetMobile(TL) | 97.2 | 97.1 | 97.2 | 97.1 | 99.7 | 97.1 | 0.984(0.980–0.988) | 1550 | 2 |\n| MobileNetV2(TL) | 97.6 | 97.4 | 97.4 | 97.4 | 99.7 | 97.4 | 0.985(0.980–0.990) | 4500 | 9 |\n| DenseNet201(TL) | 97.3 | 97.1 | 97.2 | 97.1 | 99.7 | 97.1 | 0.984(0.979–0.989) | 1600 | 2 |\n\n【57】Acc = accuracy; Sen = sensitivity; Sp = specificity; AUC = area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; TL= Transfer learning with InceptionV3.\n\n【58】 Champion model for transfer learning.\n\n【59】  Champion model integrated into smartphone.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【60】To enable the use of the CNN model on a mobile phone without affecting the accuracy of the model, we further shifted the information contained in different but relatively large source domains by transfer training with three lightweight CNNs, including NASNetMobile, MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201.

The difference between the specialist and general practitioner groups reached statistical significance (p<0.005); however, the difference between the specialist and resident groups was not significant (p=0.136). The AI model and specialists had similarly high prediction accuracy scores. On the other hand, less experienced reviewers demonstrated markedly worse prediction accuracy scores, which were separate from the cluster of AI and experienced reviewer scores. For acute myringitis and acute otitis media, AI obviously outperformed the reviewers with all levels of expertise 删除2:<u>( Figure 5 )</u>.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 5 **Heatmap comparing the results produced by the AI and the human practitioners.** GP=general practitioner, R=resident doctor, SP=otolaryngology specialist, AI= artificial intelligence.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【63】Discussion\n----------\n\n【64】In this study, we developed the first smartphone-based edge AI system to assist clinicians in detecting and categorising ear drum or middle ear diseases, to our knowledge. Our model successfully distinguished normal eardrums and diseased eardrums and achieved a high detection accuracy. When the data were divided into ten common middle ear diseases, the accuracy reached 97.6%. The model showed a high degree of accuracy in disease prediction and provided the most probable diagnoses ranked by the probability of various diseases on a smartphone interface. In addition, this model is a “device-side AI” (also called “edge AI”); because the computations can be performed locally on the images acquired on mobile devices, this method has the advantage of offline connection with a fast-computing power, which reduces latency delays and protects patient privacy. This study is also the first to investigate several mainstream CNN methods with lightweight architectures for ear drum/middle ear disease detection and diagnosis on mobile devices.\n\n【65】In the past, CNNs were experimentally used for otitis media diagnosis tasks, although most current databases and codes were not available for public use, and only limited disease categories were available to support empirical clinical diagnosis. We divided all collected otoendoscopic eardrum pictures into 10 categories (normal ears and common ear diseases) based on past research and clinical experience. To improve the accuracy of system interpretation, we deleted pictures with a poor image quality, blurry images and less representative images, aggregated the results into 2161 pictures with a better quality, and then analysed them via the artificial intelligence system. Machine learning techniques such as SVMs, k-nearest neighbours (K-NN) and decision trees are supervised machine learning models with simple processes and high levels of execution efficiency. These models are suitable for the prediction and classification and regression data; however, their model training processes may be time-consuming and GPU-consuming, as deep learning approaches must be trained on a very large dataset. To overcome this drawback, a deep CNN was pretrained via transfer learning, which applies the knowledge learned by certain models to another task.\n\n【66】Due to the advancement of image analysis, we found that MobileNet had fewer parameters than other CNN models and was more feasible in mobile devices with less processing power, such as smartphones. Recent studies have shown that although MobileNet is a lightweight network model, its classification accuracy was only 1% less than that of the conventional CNN after conducting the transfer learning-based training technique, and this result was similar to that obtained in our study. Eventually, we successfully developed the CNN system with transfer learning and placed it in a mobile application to make it more convenient and accessible.\n\n【67】Some relevant studies utilizing mobile devices for the detection and diagnosis of middle ear diseases have been performed, as summarized in Table 2 . Wu et al. used a digital handheld otoscope connected to a smartphone and developed a CNN model for the automated classification of paediatric acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion, achieving an accuracy of 90.7%. By using smartphone-enabled otoscopes, Moshtaghi et al. reported a 100% sensitivity rate for the detection of abnormal middle ear conditions and developed a model to achieve a 98.7% overall accuracy on intact tympanic membranes and a 91% overall accuracy in terms of perforation. Myburgh et al. reported on a smartphone application for loading ear drum images and obtained an accuracy of 86.8% with a neural network. Viscaino et al. developed a computer-aided support system based on digital otoscope images and machine learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN and decision tree. With otoendoscopic images, Khan et al. also developed a CNN model that reached a 95% accuracy in differentiating otitis media with effusion (OME) from normal eardrum conditions. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilize transfer learning for smartphone applications to develop device-side AI for detecting and diagnosing middle ear diseases. Edge computing, which is also called “edge AI” or “device AI”, is meant to deal with the constraints faced by conventional deep learning-based architectures deployed in a centralized cloud environment, such as the considerable latency of the mobile network, energy consumption and the financial costs affecting the overall performance of the system. Our results show that the developed algorithm achieved a high detection accuracy in binary outcome cases (pass/refer) of middle ear disease images and successfully subclassified the majority.\n\n【68】Table 2 Comparison of the proposed model with previous studies.\n\n|  | N | Classification | Accuracy | Year | Algorithm | Device |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Senaras et al. | 247 | 2 | 84.6% | 2017 | CNN | PC |\n| Myburgh et al. | 389 | 5 | 81.6%∼ 86.8% | 2018 | DT+ CNN | PC |\n| Cha et al. | 10,544 | 6 | 93.7% | 2019 | CNN+ETL | PC |\n| Livingstone et al. | 1366 | 14 | 88.7% | 2020 | AutoML | PC |\n| Khan et al. | 2484 | 3 | 95.0% | 2020 | CNN | PC |\n| Wu et al. | 12,230 | 2 | 90.7% | 2021 | CNN+TL | Smartphone-otoscope |\n| Zafer et al. | 857 | 4 | 99.5% | 2020 | DCNN, SVM | PC (public dataset) |\n| Viscaino et al. | 1060 | 4 | 93.9% | 2020 | SVM, K-NN, DT | PC |\n| Zeng et al. | 20,542 | 6 | 95.6% | 2021 | CNN+ETL | Real-time detection device |\n| Current study | 2171 | 10 | 97.6% | 2022 | CNN+TL | Smartphone application |\n\n【70】N= number of images in dataset; DT= decision tree; AutoML = automated machine learning; CNN=convolutional neural network; DCNN= deep convolutional neural network; K-NN= K-nearest neighbour; PC = personal computer; ETL=ensemble transfer learning.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【71】In our study, the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed AI algorithm was comparable to that of otolaryngology specialists and superior to that of non-experts, including general practitioners and otolaryngologic residents. Khan et al. developed an expert judgment system to differentiate 2 different middle ear diseases (normal, chronic otitis media with tympanic perforation, and otitis media with effusion). The average accuracy score for medical professionals with mixed expertise was 74%, which is inferior to that of the proposed CNN model (95%). Byun et al. reported an average accuracy score of 82.9% in diagnosing three common middle ear diseases (otitis media with effusion, chronic otitis media, and cholesteatoma) for junior otolaryngology resident doctors, which is inferior to the results of the proposed AI algorithm (97.2%). A similar trend was observed in the study by Livingston et al. who found a lower accuracy of 58.9% for non-experts compared to the proposed AI algorithm (88.7%). While AI algorithms have achieved performances that are comparable to those of medical experts in diagnosing common middle ear disorders, the difference between a diagnosis made by AI and that made by a clinician with different types of expertise still needs to be further explored.\n\n【72】The utilisation of artificial intelligence coupled with the CNN strategies of deep learning for automated disease detection is made possible by the fact that each ear drum/middle ear disease has a unique visual feature. Ear drum/middle ear diseases are usually detected and diagnosed through visual examination by clinicians based on otoscopy. However, it is challenging for general practitioners or non-otolaryngologists to make proper diagnoses due to limited training and experience in otoscopy. In addition, due to economic or geographical barriers, access to otolaryngology specialists for an adequate diagnosis and a proper subsequent treatment may be limited. The burden of hearing loss has attracted increasing attention worldwide, and hearing damage caused by middle ear disease can be reversed if diagnosed promptly. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has also posed challenges in terms of providing adequate health services, rendering telemedicine a useful tool in detecting and diagnosing diseases that previously required close contact and on-site inspection. Telemedicine for middle ear diseases is made possible for clinicians by using otoscopic images obtained from smartphone-enabled otoscopy. However, conducting telemedicine for otoscopic inspection may be difficult in areas or countries with poor mobile internet infrastructure or limited mobile internet access. Our system can be simply embedded in smartphones, and it enables the detection and recognition of ear drum/middle ear diseases in a timely manner without experts or online consultations.\n\n【73】The training results of the CNN models showed that the detection and diagnosis of middle ear disease could be achieved and simplified by transfer learning. Therefore, a lightweight model such as MobileNetV2 can also have a comparable accuracy with that of other large models. Using MobileNetV2 and TensorFlow Serving or Core ML technology, the model can be put on a mobile device to assist doctors in the diagnosis of middle ear diseases. The program also revealed a user-friendly interface for assisting diagnoses. For example, the intricate interrogation showed that 9 of the 180 images of chronic suppurative otitis media were diagnosed as tympanic perforation, while 7 of the 155 images of tympanic retraction were diagnosed as otitis media with effusion. In real-world practice, both diseases sometimes coexist and are diagnosed simultaneously. Our solution provides clinicians with the most likely diagnosis by ranking percentages and including the coexisting disease in the first two orders.\n\n【74】In this study, the transfer learning model was used to develop a mobile device application to detect middle ear diseases, so that model inference could be performed without additional cloud resource requirements. Other studies were based on cloud computing methods to perform model inference, which requires internet access and long-latency connections, and personal privacy could be violated. However, our system does not require internet access. In places where medical resources are scarce or mobile internet access is limited, clinicians can make good use of this device to assist in proper the diagnosis of middle ear diseases.\n\n【75】Current AI systems have achieved diagnostic performances that are comparable to those of medical experts in many medical specialties, especially in image recognition-related fields. Smartphones with features such as high-resolution cameras and powerful computation chips have been extensively used worldwide. The diagnostic accuracy of our smartphone-based AI application was comparable to that of otolaryngology experts. The diagnostic suggestions generated by medical AI may be beneficial for medical professionals with different levels and types of expertise. For non-otolaryngology medical professionals, the proposed algorithm may assist in expert-level diagnosis, leading to seamless diagnoses, increasing the speed of treatment or ensuring a proper referral. For otolaryngology experts, the proposed algorithm may provide an opportunity for shared decision making by providing easily accessible smartphone tools, thereby improving the doctor-patient relationship.\n\n【76】Our study has some limitations that should be noted. First, the model cannot cover all eardrum/middle ear diseases, such as complicated cholesteatoma and rare middle ear tumours. However, our model is sufficient for the interpretation of the most common eardrum/middle ear diseases and the decision regarding further referral. Second, despite the high accuracy, the final diagnoses still require further inspection by medical personnel to prevent misjudgements. Procrastination with regard to treating some middle ear diseases, such as acute otitis media, may lead to fatal complications in rare cases. Third, all of our image data were retrieved from a single medical centre with high-resolution otoendoscopy, and further expansion of the image database or labelling of the disease targets may be required to extend its applicability and publicity. Finally, although the smartphone application can either take an existing middle ear image or a snapshot provided by the mobile device as input, the quality of the images obtained via the latter approach may not be satisfactory for further processing. Further studies are required to examine the coupled otoscopic application to better acquire eardrum images.\n\n【77】In this study, we developed a system for detecting and categorizing common eardrum or middle ear diseases by artificial intelligence and integrated it into a smartphone application to detect ten common ear conditions by transfer learning. The accuracy of the proposed model is comparable to that of otolaryngology specialists in the detection or diagnosis of common middle ear diseases. Due to its compactness, the developed model can easily be integrated into a mobile device and used in telemedicine for detecting middle ear disorders.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【78】YC Chen, YF Cheng and YC Chu participated in writing the final draft.

Since, there are few data for the treatment-related outcomes of XDR tuberculosis in settings with a high HIV prevalence, we investigated the associations of these diseases in such settings to formulate recommendations for control programmes.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In a retrospective cohort study, we analysed the case records of patients (>16 years old) with XDR tuberculosis (culture-proven at diagnosis) between August, 2002, and February, 2008, at four designated provincial treatment facilities in South Africa. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess risk factors associated with the outcomes—mortality and culture conversion.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】195 of 227 patients were analysed. 21 died before initiation of any treatment, and 174 patients (82 with HIV infection) were treated. 62 (36%) of these patients died during follow-up. The number of deaths was not significantly different in patients with or without HIV infection: 34 (41%) of 82 versus 28 (30%) of 92 (p=0·13). Treatment with moxifloxacin (hazard ratio 0·11, 95% CI 0·01–0·82; p=0·03), previous culture-proven multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (5·21, 1·93–14·1; p=0·001), and number of drugs used in a regimen (0·59, 0·45–0·78, p<0·0001) were independent predictors of death. Fewer deaths occurred in patients with HIV infection given highly active antiretroviral therapy than in those who were not (0·38, 0·18–0·80; p=0·01). 33 (19%) of 174 patients showed culture conversion, of which 23 (70%) converted within 6 months of initiation of treatment.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In South Africa, patients with XDR tuberculosis, a substantial proportion of whom are not infected with HIV, have poor management outcomes. Nevertheless, survival in patients with HIV infection is better than previously reported. The priorities for the country are still prevention of XDR tuberculosis, and early detection and management of multidrug-resistant and XDR tuberculosis through strengthened programmes and laboratory capacity.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】South African Medical Research Council, European Union Framework 7 program, and European Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership.\n\n【10】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【11】Tuberculosis kills 1·8 million people per year worldwide. Unsuccessful treatment programmes for disease control, and continued transmission are contributing to the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (ie, bacillary resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid). The diagnosis and treatment of MDR tuberculosis in such settings diverts much needed resources away from case finding and the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (ie, bacillary resistance to at least rifampicin, isoniazid, a fluoroquinolone, and at least one second-line injectable drug—amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin) has been identified in more than 59 countries and, because of the changes in international travel and migration patterns, the threat is global. Treatment of XDR tuberculosis shows varying results. Data from Estonia suggested that the outcome associated with resistance to capreomycin was poor. However, data from Peru, although few, are encouraging because 60% of patients with XDR tuberculosis completed treatment or were cured with intensive multidrug treatment.\n\n【12】However, despite having the highest caseload of tuberculosis, there have been few reports of XDR tuberculosis from high-burden settings, including those with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, possibly because of the absence of comprehensive drug-susceptibility testing. Reports from KwaZulu Natal, South Africa, showed that almost all patients with XDR tuberculosis acquired in a hospital or community outbreak were infected with HIV and had a short-term mortality rate of more than 80%. Because of the initial global media scare, XDR tuberculosis in Africa is generally perceived to arise predominantly in HIV-infected patients, who have increased susceptibility to infection and poor survival. Subsequently, 4% of cases of MDR tuberculosis were in fact shown to be cases of XDR disease, and were present in most provinces in South Africa. \n\n【13】Thus, the high rate of HIV infection and poorly functioning tuberculosis control programmes in many parts of Africa are likely to contribute to the emergence of XDR tuberculosis, which could destablise the control of tuberculosis in these areas. Urgent implementation of rational control policies is required to counter this threat. However, there are few data from Africa on which to base such recommendations, including those relevant to advocacy, diagnosis, case finding, and treatment. Furthermore, several uncertainties have implications for the design and implementation of tuberculosis control programmes, including the prognosis for individuals with XDR tuberculosis with or without HIV infection in a non-outbreak setting, the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on outcome in patients with HIV infection, the best treatment regimens for XDR tuberculosis, and predictors of poor outcome in a resource-poor setting. We therefore attempted to address these issues on the basis of our experience of treating patients with XDR tuberculosis at several centres in South Africa.\n\n【14】Methods\n-------\n\n【15】### Study setting and participants\n\n【16】We retrospectively reviewed the case records of 227 patients (>16 years) with XDR tuberculosis, diagnosed (culture proven) between August, 2002, and February, 2008, at four of nine dedicated provincial facilities for the treatment of XDR tuberculosis in South Africa. This country has a population of nearly 48 million people, HIV prevalence of 11% in 2008, tuberculosis notification of 948 per 100 000 population in 2007, and notification of more than 7000 cases of MDR disease in 2007. National policy recommends that drug-susceptibility testing should be done for rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol in all new cases of tuberculosis who have not culture-converted by 3 months, all retreatment cases at presentation, and high-risk patients. Second-line testing was done by use of the indirect method on solid media (Middlebrook 7H11, Becton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France) at dedicated provincial tuberculosis laboratories (Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Kimberley, and Johannesburg) with standardised reagents and methods, which did not change during the study. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Cape Town, South African Medical Research Council, and the University of Witwatersrand's human research ethics committees.\n\n【17】### Diagnosis of XDR tuberculosis\n\n【18】According to national policy, isolates resistant to isoniazid and rifampicin should be sent for second-line testing (ethionamide, ofloxacin, amikacin, and streptomycin in selected centres). Patients with MDR tuberculosis who were still culture-positive at the end of the intensive phase of treatment were also sent for second-line testing. In this study, patients with isolates of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ that were resistant at diagnosis (time of sputum collection) to at least isoniazid, rifampicin, a fluoroquinolone, and at least one of the second-line injectable drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin) were judged to have XDR tuberculosis. In early 2007, with the newly adopted definition of XDR tuberculosis and revised guidelines, second-line drug-susceptibility testing again became widely available. Thus, XDR tuberculosis was only widely diagnosed and treated from late 2006 and early 2007, with a few cases identified retrospectively from before this period. Drug-susceptibility testing to capreomycin, cycloserine, terizidone (a derivative containing a double molecule of cycloserine), and fluoroquinolones other than ofloxacin is not available within the provincial laboratories. However, to gain further insight into prevailing patterns, we tested the susceptibility to capreomycin in 57 isolates obtained from patients in Western Cape in accordance with the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n【19】### Treatment regimens\n\n【20】MDR tuberculosis, was generally treated with a standardised regimen of kanamycin, ofloxacin, ethionamide, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide (terizidone was added for ethambutol-resistant patients) before the diagnosis of XDR tuberculosis. By contrast, treatment of XDR disease was given in hospital, and individualised with the use of capreomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid as the main drugs, with other first-line and second-line drugs used at the discretion of the attending clinician, or to which the microorganism showed susceptibility. Capreomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid were introduced into the programme in about March, 2007. Linezolid is unavailable through the national tuberculosis programme and moxifloxacin is only accessible at specific centres (in Eastern Cape) or on a restricted basis through non-governmental organisations (eg, in Western Cape). Highly active antiretroviral therapy was offered to all patients infected with HIV at the discretion of the attending physician.\n\n【21】### Outcomes\n\n【22】The date of diagnosis of XDR tuberculosis was the same as the date on which the sputum sample was sent to the laboratory, and from which the organism was cultured. There was thus a delay between diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Conversion was judged to have occurred when two consecutively negative cultures were obtained, 1 month apart, and when the first culture was positive at the start of treatment for XDR tuberculosis. Because widespread and targeted screening for XDR tuberculosis was only available in many centres from late 2006 or early 2007, most of the cohort had a short follow-up. Hence, we focused on early outcomes (conversion and mortality).\n\n【23】### Strain typing\n\n【24】To establish whether XDR tuberculosis was acquired or transmitted, a subset of isolates (n=52) from patients living in the Western Cape were genotyped by use of IS _6110_ DNA fingerprinting, spoligotyping, and DNA sequencing of the _inhA_ promoter and the _katG, rpoB, embB, pncA, gyrA_ , and _rrs_ genes. Transmission chains were defined by use of isolates that had identical IS _6110_ DNA fingerprints, spoligotypes, and mutations that conferred resistance.\n\n【25】### Statistical analysis\n\n【26】A risk-management strategy for data, including double data entry, was used to ensure data integrity. We compared categorical variables by use of the χ 2 test, or Fisher's exact test when appropriate, and we compared continuous variables, because of the non-normal distribution of the analysed variables, using the Mann-Whitney _U_ test or Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate probabilities of events at different timepoints, and the log-rank test was used to compare these probabilities by group. Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to determine risk factors associated with outcomes in time-to-event-based analyses. Variables that were significantly associated with the outcome (p<0·05) were included in the final model. The proportionality assumption of the Cox models was tested with −ln(−ln \\[survival\\]) curves and regression of scaled Schoenfeld residuals on functions of time. The assumption of uninformative censoring (ie, more censored observations at an earlier time in one group than in another group, or a greater proportion of censored survival times in patients with a particular range of values of the explanatory variables) was investigated with observed survival times plotted against the values of the explanatory variables included in the model. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were done to account for patients excluded from the analysis, and for those lost to follow-up.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【27】None of the funding sources had any role in the design or execution of the study.

Ten (19%) of these clustered cases showed mutations that caused identical resistance to first-line and second-line drugs, suggesting that resistance to second-line drugs was acquired in 81% of patients from the Western Cape.\n\n【35】174 patients started treatment with a regimen containing capreomycin and para-aminosalicylic acid, and were given a median of seven drugs per regimen (IQR 6–8). The drug-specific resistance and treatment profile are summarised in table 2 . Median duration of treatment was 6·9 months (3·1–12·0), and duration of treatment with injectable drugs was 13·4 months (4·7–15·5). 33 (58%) of 57 random isolates that were retrospectively tested for susceptibility to capreomycin were resistant, and 42 (74%) patients were given the drug after the isolate was harvested for susceptibility testing. Only 20 (48%) of these patients had isolates that were capreomycin-susceptible.

Overall drug susceptibility profiles did not differ with HIV status or when HIV-infected patients were stratified by CD4-cell count. 52 (63%) of 82 patients with HIV infection given treatment for XDR tuberculosis were also taking highly active antiretroviral therapy; zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz were the most commonly used antiretroviral drugs in 26 (50%) of these patients.\n\n【36】Table 2 Drugs used in treatment regimens for patients (n=174) with extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis\n\n|  | **Patients given drug** | **Treatment duration (months; median, IQR)** | **Resistance pattern (number of patients resistant to treatment/number of susceptibility tests done in treated patients \\[%\\])** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ethambutol | 103 (59%) | 6·8 (4·0–11·4) | 62/117 (53%) |\n| Pyrazinamide | 140 (80%) | 7·2 (3·3–11·5) | ND |\n| Amikacin | 3 (2%) | 4·2 (2·1–5·8) | 124/124 (100%) |\n| Capreomycin | 162 (93%) | 7·2 (3·1–12·1) | 22/42 (52%) |\n| Kanamycin | 4 (2%) | 13·4 (4·8–15·6) | 50/50 (100%) |\n| Moxifloxacin | 14 (8%) | 12·1 (10·4–18·3) | ND |\n| Ofloxacin | 31 (18%) | 8·1 (4·2–12·0) | 174/174 (100%) |\n| Terizidone | 147 (84%) | 9·2 (3·5–12·1) | ND |\n| Ethionamide | 107 (61%) | 8·0 (3·2–11·9) | 59/167 (35%) |\n| Para-aminosalicylic acid | 156 (90%) | 7·3 (3·7–12·2) | ND |\n| Amoxicillin–clavulanate | 66 (38%) | 7·1 (3·1–12·2) | ND |\n| Clarithromycin | 77 (44%) | 8·6 (3·7–13·9) | ND |\n| Clofazimine | 28 (16%) | 8·7 (4·3–14·3) | ND |\n| Dapsone | 95 (55%) | 6·6 (3·1–11·6) | ND |\n| Azithromycin | 11 (6%) | 7·9 (2·8–12·1) | ND |\n| Isoniazid+thiacetazone | 2 (1%) | 7·8 (1·9–13·7) | ND |\n| Rifabutin | 1 (<1%) | NA | ND |\n| Streptomycin | 1 (<1%) | NA | ND |\n\n【38】Data are number (%), unless otherwise indicated.

Four of these patients refused surgery, three were judged to be unsuitable for surgery, and three underwent the procedure (two pneumonectomies and one lobectomy). One of the patients who had surgery converted and continued treatment but later relapsed, the other two died 12 days and 24 days after surgery. Four patients with XDR tuberculosis had previously undergone surgery for MDR tuberculosis.\n\n【55】Discussion\n----------\n\n【56】We have shown several associations of XDR tuberculosis in settings with high HIV prevalence. First, XDR tuberculosis in South Africa is not predominantly associated with HIV infection as perceived from studies done in KwaZulu Natal in 2006 and 2009. Although the numbers of deaths were high, we noted no difference in treatment outcomes (mortality and culture-conversion status) when comparing patients who were HIV-positive with those who were HIV-negative. This finding is important for the design of policy guidelines and programmes for management, reduction of stigma associated with a fatal prognosis, and advocacy purposes. Second, fewer deaths occurred in patients with concomitant HIV infection and XDR tuberculosis given highly antiretroviral therapy than in untreated patients. These data also have implications for the design of programmes for the treatment of XDR tuberculosis since the data from the studies in KwaZulu Natal indicated an invariably fatal outcome in individuals with concomitant HIV infection, showing the importance of WHO's recommended strategy for treatment of HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Third, that moxifloxacin was an independent predictor of survival is another useful finding because there are no new licensed drug options for XDR tuberculosis in high-burden settings. Fourth, previous culture-proven MDR tuberculosis, and high number of drugs used in a regimen were predictors of survival and culture conversion. Fifth, the outcome of management of patients with XDR tuberculosis in South Africa is poor, despite good adherence and availability of drugs.\n\n【57】Our results are relevant to African governments and the WHO Stop TB Partnership to improve management guidelines for XDR tuberculosis programmes, case finding, diagnostic algorithms, and outcomes of treatment in patients with and without HIV infection in resource-limited settings.\n\n【58】Another important finding was that overall prognosis for the patient was poor irrespective of HIV status, and despite supervised inpatient multidrug treatment and access, when available, to surgical resection of diseased lung. Indeed, conversion rates were low (19%) and culture reversion occurred in some patients (6% by end of study and, at the time of writing, 54% of 13 converters in Western Cape for whom we have follow-up data after the study). Moreover, the overall 12-month mortality rate was higher than the rates associated with most aggressive malignant diseases. By contrast, results from four studies in intermediate or high-burden settings, with smaller cohorts, were better than our results. Mitnick and colleagues in Peru showed that 32 (67%) of 48 patients with XDR tuberculosis in the cohort had converted by 4 months (median time to conversion 90 days), and 11 (23%) died. Possible reasons for the poorer survival in our cohort of patients, independent of HIV status, include the long duration of drug-resistant and drug-susceptible tuberculosis before initiation of treatment for XDR tuberculosis; delays in initiation of such treatment; malnutrition; co-exposures such as smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use; different _M tuberculosis_ strains (their pathogenic characteristics and resistance patterns); lack of treatment with moxifloxacin; and exposure to helminths and other environmental mycobacteria, which might alter the underlying immunological phenotype, thus reducing effectiveness of treatment. Other causes such as malabsorption of drugs, and interactions between antituberculosis drugs and highly active antiretroviral therapy seem unlikely as putative causes because of similar outcomes in patients with or without HIV infection, and because highly active antiretroviral therapy was well tolerated. The poor outcomes draw attention to the need to urgently develop and prospectively validate new interventions for XDR tuberculosis. The outcome data and the high proportion of acquired resistance to second-line drugs in this study and nationally suggest that the national tuberculosis control programmes need to aggressively ensure treatment adherence with effective regimens to restrict the spread of resistance. This prevention of drug resistance can be achieved by programme strengthening to prevent system failures, integration of treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, intensive counselling and follow-up, and surgery when necessary and available.\n\n【59】Available data for XDR tuberculosis from Africa indicate that this disease was almost exclusively associated with HIV infection, and that prognosis in patients with both diseases is poor with a high 30-day mortality rate. Hence, since the data were first reported in 2006, and again in 2009 from Kwazulu Natal, the general opinion is that XDR tuberculosis in Africa arises predominantly in HIV-infected individuals who have increased susceptibility to tuberculosis. By contrast, our data show that a substantial proportion (53%) of patients with XDR tuberculosis outside the KwaZulu Natal province are HIV-negative. Moreover, survival in patients with HIV infection in our study cohort, from a wider South African setting, is substantially longer (50% died at 12 months _vs_ 83–100% in KwaZulu Natal ). Although not small, this proportion is substantially better than in KwaZulu Natal. The reasons are unclear but might include patients presenting at different stages of their illness, degree of immunosuppression, different drug-susceptibility profiles of isolates, lack of availability of capreomycin before 2006, nutritional status, and local differences in strain virulence. Furthermore, the KwaZulu Natal strain showed different pathogenic properties due to its high capacity to cause recrudescence through reinfection, and clonal expansion through transmission compared with the findings in the Western Cape, where resistance was mostly acquired. We also show that highly active antiretroviral therapy, despite its overlapping toxicity and adverse effects with antituberculosis drugs, and the high pill burden, substantially improves survival in patients with concomitant HIV/AIDS and XDR tuberculosis, and was generally well tolerated. Our data suggest that highly active antiretroviral therapy should be used at an early stage in patients with HIV infection and XDR tuberculosis. These findings are important for advocacy purposes because they support the notion that treatment for XDR tuberculosis in patients with HIV infection is not without hope, and thus counteract the stigmatisation of this group of patients.\n\n【60】Treatment with moxifloxacin was an independent predictor of survival in ofloxacin-resistant patients with XDR tuberculosis and has hitherto not been described. Evidence suggests that the incomplete cross-resistance within the quinolone class can be explained by differential drug-specific binding to DNA gyrase. Unlike the cohort in Mitnick and colleagues' study, with 34 (72%) of 47 patients ever treated with moxifloxacin, our programme does not provide this drug nationally. Prospective clinical and in-vitro studies are urgently needed to investigate how best to use fluoroquinolones for treatment of XDR tuberculosis. Meanwhile, we recommend that, in the absence of specific results of drug-susceptibility testing, moxifloxacin should be used in treatment regimens for XDR tuberculosis unless contraindicated. With our findings and those from studies of MDR tuberculosis, we also suggest that patients with a weight of less than 50 kg should be given nutritional supplementation, intensive follow-up, and a bolstered regimen. These recommendations, which also have importance for the design of treatment programmes, need to be prospectively validated. The high capreomycin resistance is cause for concern since this antibiotic is the mainstay of regimens for the treatment of XDR tuberculosis that are used globally, and it has not previously been widely used in South Africa. The reasons are not known, but might partly indicate the unreliability of capreomycin-susceptibility testing, or the potentially high cross-resistance with aminoglycosides like kanamycin. \n\n【61】An additional key finding was that 21 of 195 patients died before starting treatment, indicating that they had late access to treatment or inappropriate delivery of health services. Our data therefore emphasise the need to reduce delays in diagnosis and initiation of treatment through intensified case finding, improve patient access and diagnostic reporting systems, and improve the rollout of rapid diagnostic tests for MDR and XDR tuberculosis. Because existing nucleic acid amplification tests are not efficient enough in smear-negative cases, application of rapid drug-sensitivity testing to all smear-positive patients would be rational at first presentation. A favourable cost-benefit analysis of such an approach is supported by mathematical models. Development and validation of alternative methods that could be useful for detection of sputum-smear-negative tuberculosis are also urgently needed. \n\n【62】Our data showed a high incidence of adverse events associated with drugs used for the treatment of XDR tuberculosis. The most serious adverse effects were caused by capreomycin-associated renal dysfunction, which can occur at any time during the course of treatment; thus monitoring of capreomycin-based regimens, even in resource-poor settings is mandatory.\n\n【63】Limitations of our findings are due to the retrospective study design. We have tried to reduce bias by excluding patients with incomplete treatment and microbiological data, by excluding individuals who had culture converted before initiation of treatment for XDR tuberculosis, by crosschecking patients against clinical and laboratory databases, and by using methods to ensure data integrity. Selection bias, particularly in the HIV-infected subgroup, might have led to an underestimate of the true number of deaths since survivors would have had an increased likelihood of being included in our study. Since all cases of XDR tuberculosis were detected passively, we are likely to have missed many patients who had remained undiagnosed or died before susceptibility testing, and patients who did not have access to health care, or in whom appropriate susceptibility testing was not undertaken because of capacity limitations. Nevertheless, the proportion of deaths did not differ in centres with a high urbanised population and easy medical access (Gauteng and Western Cape) compared with those that had high rural populations with restricted access (Eastern Cape and Northern Cape). Although we noted a survival benefit with moxifloxacin, the number of patients treated with this drug was small, and we could not correlate outcomes with quinolone-specific resistance profiles because of the lack of specific data for drug-susceptibility testing. Our findings are only generalisable to a resource-poor high HIV prevalence setting like South Africa. Outcomes in settings with low HIV prevalence and in those that are even more severely resource-constrained might be different.\n\n【64】Since patients with XDR tuberculosis have poor management outcomes in South Africa, prevention of this type of tuberculosis, and early detection and management of MDR and XDR tuberculosis, through strengthened programmes and laboratory capacity remain the priorities for areas that have high endemicity of tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【65】KD, AZ, and MB designed the study.

A comparison with the third British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes & Lifestyles (Natsal-3)\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Background\n\n【2】Traditional modes of survey data collection show decreasing response rates and increasing costs. Web surveys potentially provide a cost-effective alternative. Opt-in volunteer web panels are widely used for market research or opinion polling, but less for academic or government research because of concerns about their representativeness arising from the effect of self-selection bias. Various methods attempt to make web panel surveys more representative of the population. We compared results from four UK web surveys with Natsal-3, a national probability sample survey.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】The four web surveys were done by three UK market research companies, each with large volunteer web panels. A shortened Natsal-3 questionnaire was included on four web surveys: two used basic demographic quotas and two were modified with variables correlated with key outcomes as additional quotas. Panel members aged 18–44 years, who were resident in Great Britain, and who met the criteria set for the quotas were eligible. Each company was asked to provide a sample of 2000 participants, which achieved between 2000 and 2099 participants, with data collection between May and July, 2012. After weighting for age and sex, comparisons were made with Natsal-3 for demographic characteristics, key behaviours, and opinions, to examine whether modified quotas improved the results. We calculated mean absolute odds ratios (ORs) and the percentage of variables that significantly differed from Natsal-3 at the 5% significance level. We used _Z_ tests based on bootstrap standard errors to assess whether the modified quota surveys provided estimates closer to Natsal-3 than the basic quota surveys. We used generalised estimating equations to assess whether the two modified quota surveys and likewise the two basic quota surveys provided consistent estimates. Six demographic and 35 behaviour or opinion variables were compared, including reporting of same-sex experience and attraction, vaginal sex in the past month, number of heterosexual partners, and attendance to a sexually transmitted infection clinic.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】All four web surveys gave different results from Natsal-3 for most of the variables, and overall the two surveys with modified quotas did not provide estimates that were closer to Natsal-3 than the basic quota surveys. Estimates for men from the web surveys differed more from Natsal-3 than estimates for women. For men, the mean absolute OR was 1·81 for basic and 1·64 for modified surveys, and for women the results were 1·43 for basic and 1·42 for modified surveys. The differences between the web surveys and Natsal-3 were numerically greater for questions asked face-to-face than those asked in self-completion format, but no formal statistical comparison was made. The two modified quota surveys seemed to differ from each other (ie, were inconsistent, p=0·07), as did the basic quota surveys (p<0·0001). Adjustment of web panel quota controls did not lead to much improvement according to the results of _Z_ tests, although for men improvements were more evident than for women. Moreover, meeting the modified quotas proved difficult, and the quotas had to be relaxed in both cases.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】When measuring sensitive sexual behaviours in the Great Britain population, volunteer web panel surveys provided significantly different estimates than a probability computer-assisted personal interview or computer-assisted self-interview survey, and modified quotas did not clearly improve estimation. At present, non-probability web panels are not an appropriate means of gathering data if accurate estimates of population prevalence are the intention, regardless of whether quotas are basic or more sophisticated. This finding is consistent with findings from similar research from the USA and other European countries.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】BE was involved in the design of the study, coordinated the fieldwork and research, and wrote the initial abstract drafts.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the authors found that urbanisation level is associated with an increase in cardiometabolic adverse events. This type of evidence, as well as multilevel studies with individual data and context variables when heterogeneous results are observed, suggests effects of social determinants. However, the analysis performed by Kramer and colleagues also revealed the existence of the psychologistic fallacy among the studies included in the systematic review. This fallacy is often forgotten by epidemiologists who privilege individual data, denying that social determinants have heterogeneous effects on different social groups. The psychologistic fallacy occurs when contextual or ecological variables are not incorporated and inferences are made based exclusively on individual variables.\n\n【1】These facts should be enough to encourage the study of social determinants in multilevel or multicentre studies. However, systematic reviews with analyses stratified by the levels of a social determinant could be a better option because it can include many more contexts, representing different populations and social realities. The discussion about statistical analyses of fixed or random effects must be overcome, and we must begin to think from a multilevel logic where social determinants are important drivers of health conditions. The PRISMA statement could incorporate the exploration of social determinants involved when a heterogeneous effect is observed. This exploration would not be a simple stratified analysis but should be based on theoretical models from the social sciences.\n\n【2】删除9:<u>I declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:47:32", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:48:06", "cost": 34.118}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:53", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:48:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:47:31"}

Near elimination of _H influenzae_ meningitis has been documented after vaccine introduction. Despite greater than 90% reductions in disease attributable to vaccine serotypes, all-age pneumococcal meningitis has decreased by around 25%, with little data from low-income settings.

Nevertheless, many patients were reluctant to receive the vaccine due to fear of side-effects, disease flare, and lack of information regarding the novel vaccines. The objectives of this study were to assess the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases and health-care professionals in Arab countries and to identify the factors associated with acceptability.\n\n【1】The Arab League of Associations for Rheumatology (ArLAR) COVID Vaccination (ARCOVAX) cross-sectional study used an anonymous web-based survey adapted from the VAXICOV study, translated to Arabic by the authors and validated by the ArLAR scientific committee. A pilot test done in three languages (Arabic, English, and French) found the survey to be well understood and easy to complete.\n\n【2】The survey was disseminated online in the three languages between April 13 and May 11, 2021, through multiple social media platforms of ArLAR, the Arab Adult Arthritis Awareness (AAAA) group (an ArLAR Special Interest Group), rheumatologist and patient association accounts, emails from the ArLAR and AAAA groups, WhatsApp messages, and direct invitation to patients using a QR code on display in physician waiting rooms. Health-care professionals were considered as a convenience control group, expected to serve as a landmark for optimal vaccine acceptability at the time of the study.\n\n【3】Demographic and disease data, perceptions about COVID-19, and perceptions about vaccine hesitancy were presented descriptively. They were compared between patients and health-care professionals using χ 2 or _t_ tests, as appropriate. Health-care professionals who also identified themselves as patients with chronic rheumatic diseases were counted twice, once in each group.\n\n【4】Vaccine acceptability was defined as participants who were already vaccinated or willing to be vaccinated. Non-acceptability was defined as participants who were undecided or refused to be vaccinated, as per the WHO definition of vaccine hesitancy as a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services. Acceptability was compared between patients and health-care professionals, first in the whole study population, then in non-vaccinated participants.\n\n【5】Perceptions about vaccination were evaluated on a 0–10 scale, where 10 is the highest agreement, and stratified according to the vaccine acceptability. Factors associated with acceptability were evaluated using two separate logistic regression models for patients and health-care professionals, with vaccine acceptability as the dependent variable. All statistical analyses were done with SPSS (version 18.0) software.\n\n【6】Accessing the Google form and then clicking on “Agree” after reading the survey description was considered as consent to participate. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the Saint-Joseph University (Beirut, Lebanon) and Specialized Medical Center (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia).\n\n【7】3176 participants from 19 Arab countries completed the survey (1595 patients, 1517 health-care professionals \\[including 48 health-care professionals who were also patients\\], and 64 with missing categories). The participants were recruited from the following countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The mean age of the patients was 39 years (SD 13), 1159 (73%) of 1595 patients were females, 422 (26%) were males, and the remaining 14 (1%) patients either had missing data or preferred not to state their gender 删除2:<u>( appendix p 1 )</u>.

In the past 3 years, 481 (30%) of 1595 patients and 632 (42%) of 1517 health-care professionals had received the influenza vaccine. The fear of COVID-19 was estimated as a median of 7 (IQR 5–10) on the 10-point perception scale in both groups 删除2:<u>( appendix p 1 )</u>.\n\n【8】469 (29%) of 1595 patients, compared with 899 (59%) of 1517 health-care professionals, were already vaccinated against COVID-19.

In addition, 142 (43%) of the 332 undecided patients and 68 (28%) of 247 patients who refused the vaccine would be willing to be vaccinated if it were mandatory by law, compared to 101 (53%) of 191 undecided health-care professionals and 21 (25%) of 85 health-care professionals who refused the vaccine 删除2:<u>( appendix p 4 )</u>.\n\n【11】981 (62%) of 1595 patients trusted their rheumatologist as the most reliable source of information about the vaccine. The most important concerns among patients about the vaccine were concerns about side-effects and the scarcity of experience with and background information about new COVID-19 vaccines, followed by concerns about the health crisis management and concerns about vaccination in general; whereas it was the scarcity of experience with and background information about the vaccines and concerns about the health crisis management by governments, followed by concerns about side-effects among health-care professionals 删除2:<u>( appendix p 5 )</u>. The concerns were greater in participants who refused the vaccine than in those who accepted it (p<0·001删除2-1:<u>; appendix p 2 </u>).\n\n【12】In the multivariable analysis, vaccine acceptability was associated with a higher gross domestic product (GDP), the feeling that it is important to be personally vaccinated, fewer concerns regarding the vaccine side-effects, fewer concerns about vaccination in general, previous influenza vaccination, fear of COVID-19, and fewer concerns about the risk of autoimmune flare 删除2:<u>( appendix p 3 )</u>. Although the association with age and gender was not confirmed in the multivariable analysis, older age in patients and male gender in health-care professionals were associated with acceptability. Comorbidities were not associated with vaccine acceptability in both groups.\n\n【13】This is the first large-scale study to assess the acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases and health-care professionals across Arab countries. Vaccine acceptability was 63% in patients, within the same range as other international studies of patients with chronic rheumatic diseases, including the VAXICOV study (54–93%), but higher than in the general population in Arab countries (37–53%), suggesting the lack of hesitancy specifically related to chronic rheumatic diseases. Notably, more health-care professionals received the vaccine than patients (59% _vs_ 29%), which could be related to vaccine accessibility and national vaccination strategies targeting health-care professionals as a priority at the time of data collection. In April and May, 2021, the vaccine was not compulsory in any of the population categories, and it was offered free of charge by the governments. Nonetheless, acceptability remained lower in patients (48% _vs_ 55%) even after considering the non-vaccinated participants exclusively.\n\n【14】Notably, the results confirmed the influence of the rheumatologist in convincing the patients to get vaccinated. However, different strategies should be used to motivate the health-care professionals to get vaccinated, as their acceptability increased significantly if the vaccine was mandatory by law.\n\n【15】The greatest concerns regarding the vaccine were the fear of side-effects (although the type of side-effect was not specified in this study) and the scarcity of experience with and background information about the vaccines among patients, and the scarcity of experience with and background information about the vaccines and the concerns about the health crisis management by governments among health-care professionals. In the VAXICOV study, Felten and colleagues noted that the highly rated concerns among patients and health-care professionals were similar to the current study—ie, the scarcity of experience with and background information regarding the vaccines, the use of new technology, and side-effects of the vaccine. Nevertheless, the concern about the health crisis management by the health authorities was more frequently reported in our study than in the VAXICOV study. This finding highlights the need for better transparency and communication about safety data to build much-needed trust in vaccines.\n\n【16】One of the possible concerns that could not be identified by the study questionnaire might be the use of vaccines that were not approved by European or American agencies, such as vaccines from China or Russia, at the time of data collection.\n\n【17】The current study also identified a clear association between the GDP level and the vaccine acceptability, indicating that people in countries with higher GDPs were more acceptive, which could be related, in some part, to vaccine access, but most probably to cultural and health-care system differences and higher trust in health authorities.\n\n【18】The strength of this study lies in the large number of participants, including both patients with chronic rheumatic diseases and health-care professionals from 19 Arab countries. The limitations include the possibility of a selection bias and the lack of comparison among the individual countries.\n\n【19】Acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine was not optimal (63% in patients, 81% in health-care professionals) but could be substantially improved if doctors recommended the vaccine to patients. Moreover, addressing the main determinants of acceptability and providing accurate and updated data to physicians can help them to relay more timely and transparent information to their patients, thus facilitating the vaccine uptake in both groups.\n\n【20】删除9:<u>LA reports consulting fees and honoraria from Pfizer and AstraZeneca, outside this work.

Thus, there is a drive to move towards provision of a 7 day health-care service in the UK. However, less is known about variations in clinical outcomes among patients admitted to psychiatric hospitals. We sought to investigate variations in clinical outcomes for patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital at the weekend.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】The study was conducted with anonymised electronic health record data from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Data were obtained from all consecutive admissions to psychiatric hospitals within the Trust between April 1, 2006, and March 31, 2015, with the Clinical Record Interactive Search tool. The association of weekend or bank holiday admission with duration of admission, risk of readmission, and inpatient mortality were investigated by multivariable regression analyses with age, sex, and ethnicity as covariates. Secondary analyses were performed to investigate the distribution of admissions, discharges, inpatient mortality, episodes of seclusion, and violent incidents on different days of the week.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】7303 (16·1%) of 45 264 admissions commenced during a weekend or bank holiday. Patients who were aged between 26 and 35 years, female, or from a minority ethnic group were more likely to be admitted at the weekend. Patients admitted at the weekend were more likely to present via acute hospital services, other psychiatric hospitals, or the criminal justice system than to be admitted directly from their own home. Weekend admission was associated with a shorter duration of admission (β coefficient −21·1 days, 95% CI −24·6 to −17·6; p<0·001) and increased risk of readmission in the 12 months after index admission (incidence rate ratio 1·13, 1·08–1·18; p<0·001) but no significant difference in inpatient mortality (odds ratio 0·79, 0·51–1·23) compared with weekday admission. Fewer episodes of seclusion occurred at the weekend (χ 2 \\=15·8, p=0·02) but there was no significant variation in deaths during hospital admission or violent incidents on different days of the week.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】We show that patients admitted at the weekend had shorter admissions and increased risk of readmission but no significant difference in risk of inpatient mortality compared with those admitted during the week. This finding contrasts with previous studies in acute hospitals where weekend admission is typically associated with increased likelihood of inpatient mortality, and highlights a need to consider variations in demand when implementing health-care services across a 7 day week.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Institute for Health Research, Medical Research Council.\n\n【10】Poster 23\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【11】The study was conceived by RP and PM.

A recent meta-analysis of prospective studies showed that a 25% lower concentration of homocysteine in plasma (about 3 μmol/L) was associated with an 11% lower risk of ischaemic heart disease and a 19% lower risk of stroke. In the general population, the two strongest determinants of plasma homocysteine are folate status and renal function. The relation between folate and homocysteine derives from the active form of folic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which provides a methyl group in the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. By contrast, the nature of the strong inverse relation between plasma homocysteine and glomerular filtration rate is less clear. In end-stage renal disease, the prevalence of hyperhomocysteinaemia is 85–100%, and the mean plasma homocysteine concentration in patients not on folic-acid supplementation is 35–50 μmol/L (ie, 3–4 times the upper limit of normal). If homocysteine is vasculotoxic, hyperhomocysteinaemia may explain, at least partly, the very high cardiovascular disease risk in end-stage renal disease, and several prospective studies indeed support this notion.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

These results contrast substantially with findings from Scotland. In our study _Acanthamoeba_ was the most common microbe isolated, with an incidence of 1 in 6710 lens wearers, and _P aeruginosa_ was much less frequent. Why then has this discrepancy occurred?\n\n【2】The Scottish cohort study, which found 14 cases of _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis over 8 months, investigated risk factors for this organism. Use of chlorine tablets and storage of lenses in tap water, instead of disinfectants, was a significant risk factor (p<0·05). The lowest risk for _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis was found in those disinfecting their lenses with hydrogen peroxide (incidence 1 in 26 700) or the new multipurpose solutions (incidence 1 in 7600).\n\n【3】Why was the risk of _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis much lower in the Netherlands? First, the most likely explanation is that chlorine tablets have never been used in the Netherlands to disinfect contact lenses. Second, many contact-lens wearers use rigid gas-permeable lenses (639 000 out of a total of 1·376 million \\[46%\\]), which are much less frequently associated with _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis because the amoeba does not adsorb to the lens polymer. In addition, sterile alcoholic solutions are commonly used to store these lenses.\n\n【4】In the UK, it is now believed that the incidence of _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis is declining due to the introduction of sterile multipurpose solutions. There is also an emphasis on public-health teaching to avoid exposure of the lens or storage case to domestic tap water. Such practice may be relevant in the Netherlands but will prevent a smaller number of cases of _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis than in the UK.\n\n【5】Finally, Cheng and colleagues did not culture the storage cases of their contact-lens wearers or relate such findings to their patients. Recent research in the UK has found that a new multipurpose solution is remarkably effective in practice, reducing the bacterial count within the lens storage case to less than 10 000/mL in 93% of cases, with sterility in 78% of cases after 4 weeks of use. Less effective results were found with the one-step hydrogen-peroxide systems. However, use of either system, combined with the avoidance of tap water for rinsing the lens storage case, resulted in a failure to isolate _Acanthamoeba_ from 150 lens-wearing individuals who did not have symptoms. The use of such hygiene practice in the UK should reduce the incidence of _Acanthamoeba_ keratitis to a similar level to that found in the Netherlands.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 13:56:57", "endTime": "2024/09/03 13:57:08", "cost": 11.636}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:53", "update_time": "2024-09-02 21:57:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 21:56:56"}

Born in Parkman, ME, USA, on Oct 21, 1921, he died on July 22, 2008, in Baltimore, MD, USA, of complications of cancer, aged 86 years.\n\n【2】Victor McKusick had a promising career ahead of him as a cardiologist in 1957 when he decided to leave the heart for the chromosome and founded Johns Hopkins' division of medical genetics. “Some of my colleagues thought I was committing professional suicide because I had a reputation in cardiology and was shifting over to focus for the most part on rare, unimportant conditions and so forth”, McKusick told _The Baltimore Sun_ earlier this year. “But it didn't bother me. I felt certain it was going somewhere.” He was right, of course. Medical genetics was in its infancy, with Arno Motulsky founding a department similar to McKusick's at the University of Washington the same year. But it soon took off. So did McKusick's contributions to it. In 1966, he published the first edition of _Mendelian Inheritance in Man_ . The online edition of that book now has 20 000 entries, and McKusick's name is now synonymous with human genetics.\n\n【3】The idea for the move to genetics took root in 1947. “The most important influence directing me into medical genetics was a teenager named Harold Parker”, McKusick would later write in _Annual Reviews in Genomics and Human Genetics_ . Parker was one of five patients McKusick saw with the “polyps-and-spots syndrome”, and he went on to write up the cases with Harold Jeghers in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ in 1949. The syndrome, of course, would later be named the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.\n\n【4】McKusick became particularly interested in patients with Marfan's syndrome while training in cardiology. “Encountering Marfan syndrome in my clinical work in cardiology, and having been schooled in the principle of pleiotropism, it was not difficult to be impressed with the probability that the various features of that disorder—in the skeletal system, in the eye, in the aorta—could be due to a mutation-determined defect in one element of connective tissue wherever it occurred in the body”, he wrote. As he turned his attention to genetics in the early 1960s, McKusick studied the US Amish, a largely isolated population that had a high prevalence of certain genetic conditions, including dwarfism. Two conditions—McKusick type metaphyseal chondrodysplasia and McKusick-Kaufman syndrome—now bear his name.\n\n【5】Just as McKusick's interest in genetics stemmed from personal interactions with particular patients, his interest in medicine had developed after an infection for which he needed weeks of then-new sulfonamide antibiotics at the age of 15 years. “After many attempts to culture the causative organism(s) I ended up in the Massachusetts General Hospital where I spent 10 weeks in the summer of 1937”, he later wrote. “In the process I saw much of medicine and decided that it was the field for me.”\n\n【6】McKusick never earned his bachelor's degree, although he attended Tufts University in Medford, MA, before earning his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University and then training as an internist and cardiologist there.\n\n【7】It was a 1969 talk by McKusick that raised the idea for what became the Human Genome Project. “In part, the proposal reflected the exuberant mind-set that followed the first moon landing”, McKusick later wrote. He became active in the effort as it took shape, serving as founding president of HUGO, the Human Genome Organisation. He adapted the genomic and information technology that developed along the way, from improved mapping and sequencing to Google, particularly when it came to the online edition of his _Mendelian Inheritance in Man_ .\n\n【8】McKusick won many awards for his work, including the 1997 Lasker Award, the Gairdner Award in Canada in 1977, the US National Medal of Science in 2001, and the 2008 Japan Prize in Medical Genetics and Genomics.\n\n【9】McKusick also trained some of today's leading geneticists. Bert Vogelstein, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and professor of oncology and pathology at Johns Hopkins, credits McKusick with introducing him to human genetics in a course McKusick taught in 1970 at Johns Hopkins. “His course led me on a lifelong fascination with genetics and cancer”, said Vogelstein.\n\n【10】McKusick is survived by his wife, Anne, and three children, as well as his identical twin brother, Vincent.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【11】### Publication history\n\n【12】Published: 06 September 2008\n\n【13】### Identification\n\n【14】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(08)61328-8</u>\n\n【15】### Copyright\n\n【16】© 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the resource intensiveness of this in-person intervention has limited its widespread delivery. We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial with a noninferiority design to evaluate whether a web-based version of BI requiring fewer resources is noninferior to in-person administration.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】621 caregivers of children with newly diagnosed cancer were randomly assigned to standard BI delivered face-to-face or a web-based version delivered via mobile device. The primary outcome was caregiver-reported problem-solving skills. The noninferiority margin was defined as 0.2 standard deviation units of the change from baseline to end of intervention. Secondary outcomes included caregiver-reported mood disturbance, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.删除1-2:<u> The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01711944.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】The effect of the standard treatment was preserved; parents in the standard BI arm improved their problem-solving (effect size = 0.53, _t_ \\= 8.88, _p_ < .001). Parents in the web-based BI group also improved their problem-solving (effect size = 0.32, _t_ \\= 5.32, _p_ < .001). Although the web-based intervention preserved 60% of the standard treatment effect, the test of noninferiority was non-significant (effect size = -0.21, _p_ \\= 0.55). Similarly, the web-based intervention preserved > 60% of the standard intervention effect on all secondary outcomes; however, tests of noninferiority were non-significant.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Noninferiority of web-based BI relative to standard face-to-face administration was not established. Further development of the web-based BI is needed before it can be recommended as a stand-alone intervention. However, the documented benefits of the web-based intervention as well as the advantages of low resource utilization and ease of delivery suggest that further development of web-based BI is indicated, and that it may play a valuable role in alleviating distress in caregivers of children with serious or chronic illness.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Institutes of Health (U.S.), R01 CA159013 (P.I.

We anticipated there might be some attenuation of efficacy of an online administration due to reduction in interpersonal attention and support, but reasoned that a minor reduction in efficacy would be acceptable given the capacity for wider dissemination of a web-based intervention requiring fewer resources. Thus, this was designed as a noninferiority trial.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】This randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate the noninferiority of a web-based implementation in comparison to the standard in-person approach. However, benefits of the web-based intervention were documented, which encourages further tailoring and incorporation of newer technologies to enhance the efficacy of this approach.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】Considering all available evidence, further development of the web-based BI program is needed before it can be recommended as a stand-alone intervention. Web-based technologies are rapidly developing, and with utilization of new machine learning approaches to more closely mirror a personal therapist, the effects of web-based BI are likely to improve. Future research should investigate enhanced web-based BI, as well as multimodal approaches that combine in-person intervention supplemented with enhanced online materials.\n\n【19】1\\.

The coping and adjustment of parents as they struggle to manage the many challenges of their child's illness may also have a significant effect on child outcomes, not only for the ill child 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u> but for healthy siblings as well 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Thus, interventions to facilitate parental coping and improve their well-being can have synergistic beneficial effects on all family members who must adapt to a new cancer diagnosis.\n\n【21】The Bright IDEAS (BI) paradigm of problem-solving skills training (PSST) has been demonstrated to be an effective intervention to improve problem-solving skills and decrease negative affectivity (symptoms of mood disturbance, depression, and posttraumatic stress) in mothers of children with recently diagnosed cancer 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Data from three multisite randomized trials has demonstrated both the efficacy and specificity of the BI program, which has been recognized by the National Cancer Institute as a Research Tested Intervention Program (RTIP) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Bright IDEAS received outstanding RTIP scores of 4.4 and 5.0 (out of 5) for Research Integrity and Dissemination Capability respectively, but a lower score of 2.0 for Intervention Impact. The primary factors for the low impact score were related to high resource intensiveness (standard BI requires 8 h of face-to-face (F2F) administration by specially trained staff) and the emphasis on mothers of recently diagnosed childhood cancer patients, which limited reach to a relatively small population 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In response, we developed an web-based version of the BI intervention appropriate for all caregivers, as a strategy to reduce resource utilization for administration, to extend reach, and to provide 24/7 availability to anyone with Internet access.\n\n【22】Use of internet and mobile technologies has grown rapidly across many areas of medicine, including pediatric oncology 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Internet or computer based psychological interventions have been found to be effective for various kinds of problems compared to usual care 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Such eHealth/mHealth interventions often reach a medium effect size, which approaches that of in-person treatment. Digital health programs are low cost relative to their potential reach, and they provide a variety of benefits to participants and researchers alike, including scale, fidelity, privacy, and ease-of-access. Software is, inherently, much more scale-able than human resources, improving the potential impact of digital interventions, especially in resource-constrained clinical contexts. Apps can be integrated seamlessly into a participant's daily life activities with minimal effort, allowing users to engage with the program on their terms, in their own time.\n\n【23】Despite the benefits of mobile technologies, the effect of internet-based behavioral health treatments appear to be moderated by therapist support, with studies that included access to the support of a therapist showing larger effects than those that do not 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Although such eHealth/mHealth approaches address many barriers to access of services, there is a potential cost for the loss of in-person support. The specificity of the problem-solving skills training component of the BI intervention, beyond the non-specific effects of providing empathic, supportive contact, was clearly documented in our prior trial 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Nevertheless, a proportion of the intervention effect remained attributable to the in-person effects of attention and therapeutic support. Thus we anticipated that some attenuation of efficacy was possible with online administration, but this was considered acceptable, as it would be counterbalanced by the ease of delivery and capacity for widespread dissemination. Therefore, rather than conducting a superiority trial, the current study was designed to test the noninferiority of a web-based version of BI as the candidate intervention in comparison to our standard in-person approach.\n\n【24】2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\n【25】### 2.1 Participants\n\n【26】Caregivers of children with cancer were recruited at 5 sites across the U.S. (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), University of Texas/MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA), Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP), and Texas Children's Hospital (TCH)). Eligibility criteria included: parent of a child diagnosed with any malignancy, and treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery; child diagnosed 4–16 weeks prior to enrollment; parent ability to speak and read English or Spanish; child not in medical crisis at time of enrollment (e.g. admitted to ICU). At 3 sites (MDACC, CHLA, TCH), parents who were primarily Spanish-speaking were preferentially recruited, with a goal of 20% of total enrollment across all sites. At SJCRH and CHP, only English-speaking parents were enrolled. In prior trials, recruitment was limited to mothers, given the typically limited availability of fathers 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. In the current trial, fathers were eligible, and if both parents were equally available, fathers were preferentially recruited, with a goal of including a minimum of 10% fathers in the sample. Recruitment began in October 2013, and the trial was closed to accrual in December 2017.\n\n【27】### 2.2 Procedures\n\n【28】This multicenter RCT used a noninferiority design to compare the Bright IDEAS problem-solving skills training intervention (BI) administered in its standard format, which involves 8 1-hour F2F sessions, to a web-based version of BI requiring significantly less in-person contact.删除1-2:<u> The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01711944), and Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at all participating sites.</u> Participants provided written informed consent, and completed a baseline (T1) battery of assessment measures prior to random assignment to treatment arm (face-to-face \\[F2F\\] or web-based BI) in a 1:1 ratio, using a block design stratified by site and language. An identical battery of measures was completed at the end of intervention (T2) and 3 months post-intervention (T3). Assessments were completed using the web database, REDcap, with paper and pencil as backup. Participants received modest gift cards for their time ($25 at T1 and T2, $50 at T3).\n\n【29】### 2.3 Interventions\n\n【30】#### 2.3.1 Standard (F2F) BI\n\n【31】This intervention was delivered as in previous trials 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. BI has been developed as an appealing, easily understood approach to the teaching and coaching of problem-solving skills. A comprehensive manual has been developed to guide the interventionist, along with worksheets and attractive graphic materials for the caregiver. The term “Bright” signifies optimism, and instilling the belief that problems can be solved, which is considered an essential component for successful implementation of the intervention. The acronym ‘IDEAS’ is used as a mnemonic for the 5 essential steps of our problem solving approach, with each letter signifying a step: I (Identify the problem), D (Determine the options), E (Evaluate/choose the best option), A (Act), and S 删除2:<u>(See if it worked)</u>. Problem-solving is presented as a general coping skill applicable to many life challenges, including those commonly faced in parenting a child during cancer treatment. The intervention is administered in 8 1-hour F2F individual sessions. Guided by the manual, the sessions are designed to follow a set sequence: session 1: Rapport building, understanding relevant personal and medical history, introduction of the BI program and worksheets; session 2: Review of the BI program and worksheets, and initial application to a real problem; sessions 3–7: continued application of BI to identified problems and promotion of problem-solving strategies and skills in vivo; and session 8: review of BI principles, relapse prevention, and termination.\n\n【32】Interventions were delivered by research assistants (RAs) with graduate education in clinical psychology or related fields, under the supervision of the site principal investigators (PI's) who were all licensed psychologists. RAs were trained in and delivered both the F2F and web-based formats to minimize differences in personal style. Bilingual RAs worked with Spanish-speaking participants using Spanish language materials. The interventionists were initially trained together as a group before the trial opened to accrual. Site PI's provided weekly supervision to ensure adequate therapeutic delivery and fidelity to the treatment manual. All sessions were digitally recorded for review of treatment integrity (discussed below).\n\n【33】#### 2.3.2 Web-based BI\n\n【34】The web-based intervention was produced in collaboration with web developers from Radiant Digital Corporation. Development followed a user-centered design process, which included a series of formative focus groups to obtain parent perspectives. An initial website prototype was then reviewed by representative users from the study sites. Feedback from this review was used by the developers, and program changes were updated in a stepwise incremental process. Ultimately, the content of the web-based intervention included modeling videos, interactive activities and homework/worksheet tools designed to be similar to the F2F intervention. This included 7 videos presenting the steps of problem-solving via the interaction between a clinician and parent, and 4 fotovellas depicting parents working through typical problems encountered. The web-based program also featured a counselor interface for web-users; this permitted counselors to track progress through the lessons and view completion status/follow-up as necessary. The fotonovelas incorporated interactive skills practice—brief practice exercises for each step of the BI method. The skills practice delivered reinforcement or remediation based on user responses.\n\n【35】An initial meeting between participant and RA provided explanation of BI, and directions for navigating the website on the caregiver's preferred device (lap/desktop删除2-1:<u>, tablet or cellphone</u>). A caregiver without convenient access was loaned an inexpensive device for the duration of his/her participation in the project. Participants were asked to access the site at least weekly and to: (1) view the 7 instructional videos and 4 fotonovellas illustrating common problems; and (2) work through ≥1personal problem(s). Prompt logistical support was available throughout from the developer. Content or intervention questions were emailed to the site RA for response by the next business day. Two weeks after the initial meeting, the RA phoned the caregiver to review web-based usage and address barriers if adherence was suboptimal. After 8 weeks, a second face-to-face session reviewed principles learned, and encouraged ongoing use of BI. After the wrap-up session, the participant completed the T2 assessment. Three months later, participants completed the T3 assessment. Brief questionnaires about the usefulness of the intervention and suggestions for improvement of the site were included.\n\n【36】### 2.4 Treatment integrity\n\n【37】Treatment integrity (TI) assurance began with training of the interventionists as a group, in a meeting that included all study staff and site PI's, and with emphasis on the use of the standardized treatment manual. Ongoing monitoring of TI was conducted by both the site PI's and a TI team. The TI team included the study PI (OJZS) and 4 study staff (2 Spanish-speaking) who had experience with, but were not providing the intervention in this trial. All sessions conducted with those in the F2F BI group, as well as the first and last sessions of those in the web-based group, were digitally recorded and uploaded to a central password-protected server. The first two sessions conducted by each interventionist in each condition (F2F and online) were reviewed by both the site PI and the TI team. Thereafter, 10% of the standard arm sessions, and 20% of the first and last sessions in the online arm, were chosen at random for review by the TI team. Reviewers scored sessions using a rubric developed in prior trials and revised for the online arm. Sessions were scored both on non-specific factors (e.g. therapeutic alliance, support, empathy) and on BI specific factors (e.g. description of BI, review of worksheets, attention to homework). The PIs received reports monthly, and reviewed any noted deviations with the RA. Sessions were scored on a 10-point metric. Of sessions reviewed, 91% (446/492) received a score of ≥ 8 (very good-excellent).\n\n【38】### 2.5 Measures\n\n【39】#### 2.5.1 Demographics\n\n【40】Demographic information obtained included child age, gender, diagnosis, and date of diagnosis; and caregiver age, gender, marital status, educational level, occupational status, and self-reported race/ethnicity.\n\n【41】#### 2.5.2 Problem-solving skills\n\n【42】The Social Problem-Solving Inventory, Revised (SPSI-R) is a widely used, well validated 52-item measure of problem-solving skills, which assesses two dimensions of problem orientation (positive vs. negative) and three dimensions of approach to problems (rational; impulsive-careless; avoidance), and also yields a total score 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. As in prior trials, change in total SPSI-R score served as the primary outcome. Internal consistency in the current trial was excellent (α = 0.95).\n\n【43】#### 2.5.3 Negative affectivity\n\n【44】Parental emotional functioning was measured as in previous trials, with a triad of instruments assessing mood disturbance, symptoms of depression, and posttraumatic stress. The Profile of Mood States Scale (POMS) is a widely used measure of mood disturbance with excellent reliability and validity 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. We used a 15-item short-form 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u> to obtain a composite total mood disturbance scale (TMD) as the outcome. Reliability (α) in the current trial was 0.90). To measure symptoms of depression we used the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The diagnostic validity of the PHQ-9 for assessing the presence of major depression is well established, as is its sensitivity to change. Reliability in the current trial was 0.88. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) is a well-established measure of symptoms of posttraumatic stress in response to a specific event (here identified as the child's cancer diagnosis), with excellent reliability and validity 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Reliability (α) in the current trial was 0.93. This triad of measures was obtained at all timepoints, and serve as secondary outcomes. All measures are available in Spanish and have been validated in Spanish-speaking samples.\n\n【45】### 2.6 Statistical analysis\n\n【46】The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a one-sided alternative hypothesis 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. A non-inferiority trial seeks to determine whether a new intervention is not worse than an established treatment by more than an acceptable amount, referred to as the margin of equivalence (E). When the null hypothesis is rejected (or the 95% CI excludes E), non-inferiority is established; failure to reject the null hypothesis is considered ‘indeterminate’. Estimates of the effect of F2F BI were obtained from prior trials, where moderate effects (0.4 S.D.) were observed in change in SPSI-R scores from baseline to end of intervention (T2) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The margin of equivalence was therefore set at 0.2 times the S.D. of the change from T1 to T2 (or approximately 50% of the prior observed effect). Given these parameters, a sample size of 620 (310 in each group) was required to achieve 80% power to detect noninferiority using a one-sided, two-sample _t_ \\-test, at _α_ of 0.05.\n\n【47】Primary analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis (ITT), using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for incomplete repeated measures (SAS Proc Mixed), with the constraint that under the conditions of randomization, the baseline estimates are equal 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Missing data were handled under the assumption of Missing at Random (MAR) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Estimated change from T1 to T2 in SPSI-R total scores was considered the primary endpoint. Change in SPSI-R from T1 to T3, and changes in negative affectivity measures from T1 to T2 and T3 were examined as secondary endpoints. Because the trial was designed with one-sided alternative hypotheses, the 95% CIs are also one-sided and only one boundary exists. Effect sizes are defined as the estimated mean change divided by the standard deviation of the change.\n\n【48】In addition to the ITT analysis, an objective ‘per protocol’ analysis was also conducted to account for participants who did not receive the full intervention in either arm due to non-compliance or other factors. This per protocol analysis excluded participants in the F2F arm who received fewer than 6 sessions; and in the online arm who did not complete all 7 instructional videos, 2 of 4 fotonovellas, and work on at least one independent problem.\n删除5:<u>\n#### 2.6.1 Role of the funding source\n\n【49】The funder of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication, following review and approval by all authors.\n\n【50】</u>\n3\\. Findings\n------------\n\n【51】Of 945 eligible caregivers approached, 621 (65.7%) consented, completed baseline measures, and were randomized (311 standard BI; 310 web-based BI; CONSORT diagram删除2-1:<u>, Fig. 1 </u>). This participation rate was comparable to that of our prior trials and targeted accrual was met. There were no differences between participants and non-participants based on child diagnosis, language, or whether the target participant was a mother or father. There was a difference in time since diagnosis for recruitment, with participants recruited earlier than decliners (7.3 weeks, vs. 8.9 weeks). Baseline demographic and medical characteristics of the treatment arms were comparable 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In terms of per protocol analysis, in the F2F arm, of 222 who completed the study, 146 (66%) received ≥ 6 sessions, and were considered per protocol. In the web-based arm, of 220 who completed the study, there was a nearly identical 66% rate of per protocol adherence.\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 1 CONSORT Diagram. \\*Due to a temporary server failure, complete data regarding online usage was not available for 64 participants in the web-based arm, thus they were not included in the per-protocol analyses.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【52】Table 1 Demographic and Medical Characteristics of Intent-to-Treat Sample.\n\n|  | FACE-TO-FACE | ONLINE |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | M | SD | M | SD | P |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Child Age | 8.2 | 5.5 | 8.3 | 5.5 | .712 NS |\n| Time DX to T1 (weeks) | 7.3 | 3.2 | 7.4 | 3.5 | .968 NS |\n| Parent Age | 36.7 | 8.8 | 37.0 | 8.6 | .541 NS |\n| Parent Highest | 13.8 | 3.5 | 13.6 | 3.6 | .809 NS |\n| Grade Completed | N | % | N | % | P |\n| Child Gender | Child Gender | Child Gender | Child Gender | Child Gender | Child Gender |\n| % Male | 175 | 56.3 | 170 | 55.2 | .788 NS |\n| Parent Gender | Parent Gender | Parent Gender | Parent Gender | Parent Gender | Parent Gender |\n| % Female | 269 | 86.5 | 280 | 90.3 | .136 NS |\n| Language | Language | Language | Language | Language | Language |\n| English | 267 | 85.9 | 266 | 85.8 | .987 NS |\n| Spanish | 44 | 14.1 | 44 | 14.2 |  |\n| Parent Race | Parent Race | Parent Race | Parent Race | Parent Race | Parent Race |\n| White | 195 | 64.4 | 193 | 64.3 | .182 NS |\n| Black | 43 | 14.2 | 34 | 11.3 |  |\n| Other/Unknown | 65 | 21.4 | 73 | 24.4 |  |\n| Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis |\n| ALL | 118 | 36.7 | 111 | 35.8 | .986 NS |\n| Other Leukemia | 33 | 10.6 | 37 | 11.9 |  |\n| HL/Non HL | 27 | 8.6 | 27 | 8.7 |  |\n| Solid Tumor | 76 | 24.4 | 78 | 25.2 |  |\n| Brain Tumor | 26 | 8.4 | 27 | 8.7 |  |\n| Other | 35 | 11.3 | 30 | 9.7 |  |\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【54】### 3.1 Primary outcome\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 2 a shows the change in problem-solving scores across the study period for the F2F and web-based groups. The effect of the standard F2F treatment was preserved compared to prior trials. Parents in the F2F BI arm increased their problem-solving score on the SPSI-R by a mean of 1.09 points (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.33, effect size _d_ \\= 0.53, _t_ \\= 8.75, _p_ < .001).

Thus, 60.3% of the standard treatment effect was preserved in the web-based group. The mixed model analysis of overall effect showed a between-group difference of −0.44 points favoring the F2F group. P-value for noninferiority = 0.55.

In the per protocol analysis, results were similar. For both the F2F and web-based groups, a significant improvement on the SPSI-R was observed, with a between-group difference favoring the face-to-face group, but tests of noninferiority were non-significant and the overall results indeterminate.</u>\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 2 Longitudinal changes in study outcomes across study timepoints: 1) baselne, 2) end of intervention, 3) 3-months post-intervention Longitudinal changes in study outcomes across study timepoints: 1) baseline, 2) end of intervention; 3) 3-months post intervention.

On the POMS, the F2F group showed a decline in mood disturbance from baseline to T2, with a mean change of −19.8 points (95% CI, −23.4 to −16.6, effect size _d_ \\= −0.58, _t_ \\= −10.6, _p_ < .001). The web-based group showed a decline of −13.0 points on the POMS (95% CI, −16.6 to −9.30, effect size _d_ \\= −0.38, _t_ \\= −6.9, _p_ < .001), representing preservation of 65.5% of the standard intervention effect. The estimated between-group difference was 6.8 points favoring the F2F group. P-value for noninferiority = 0.49. For depression, the F2F group showed a decline on the PHQ-9 from baseline to T2, with a mean change of −2.99 points (95% CI, −3.6 to −2.4, effect size _d_ \\= −0.56, _t_ \\= −9.9, _p_ < .001). In the web-based group, there was a mean decline of −2.4 points on the PHQ-9 (95% CI, −2.95 to −1.77, effect size _d_ \\= −0.44, _t_ \\= −7.8, _p_ < .001), representing preservation of 78.6% of the standard intervention effect. The estimated between-group difference was 0.63 points favoring the F2F intervention. P-value for noninferiority =0.13. For posttraumatic stress, scores for the F2F group showed decline on the IES-R from baseline to T2, with a mean change of −9.6 points (95% CI, −11.4 to −7.8, effect size _d_ \\= −0.60, _t_ \\= −9.6, _p_ < .001). In the web-based group, there was a mean decline of −7.1 points on the IES-R (95% CI, −8.8 to −5.3 effect size _d_ \\= −0.44, _t_ \\= −7.9, _p_ < .001), representing preservation of 73.3% of the standard intervention effect. The estimated between-group difference was 2.5 points favoring the F2F intervention. P-value for noninferiority = 0.28. Again, the pattern of results is indeterminate in relation to inferiority/noninferiority of the web-based intervention 删除2:<u>( Table 2 删除2-1:<u>, Fig. 3 </u>)</u>. Similar results were found on all secondary outcomes at T-3.\n\n【61】Per protocol analyses were conducted for all secondary outcomes and revealed results similar to the ITT analyses, demonstrating significant benefits of both intervention arms and between-group differences favoring the F2F group. Tests of noninferiority failed to reach significance, and results were indeterminate in relation to inferiority/noninferiority.\n\n【62】4\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\n【63】This multicenter RCT, conducted in two languages, examined the benefits of a newly developed web-based version of an established, evidence-based problem-solving skill intervention, Bright IDEAS (BI), in comparison to the standard F2F mode of delivery. The trial used a noninferiority design, testing the hypothesis that the between group differences would not exceed a margin of equivalence set at 0.2 times the standard deviation of change from T1 to T2. The effects of the benchmark intervention (F2F BI) were preserved as in prior trials. Noninferiority of the web-based comparator intervention was not demonstrated on the primary outcome, nor on any of the secondary outcomes. The difference between treatment arms did not indicate that online BI is inferior to the standard intervention, rather the confidence intervals fell in a range considered indeterminate. Although noninferiority was not demonstrated, significant benefit was also found for the web-based condition, and of a magnitude that exceeded 60% of the benchmark intervention on the primary and all secondary outcomes (range 60% - 78%). These findings suggest that further development of the web-based BI is needed before it can be recommended as a stand-alone intervention. However, the documented benefits of the web-based intervention as well as the advantages of low resource utilization and ease of delivery suggest that further development of web-based BI is indicated.\n\n【64】In evaluating the validity of a noninferiority trial, a crucial consideration is whether the effect of the standard treatment was preserved 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In the current trial, not only was the effect of F2F BI on change in problem-solving skills preserved, it was descriptively larger than in prior trials 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. In each successive trial of F2F BI, this effect size has increased, which likely reflects several factors, including fine-tuning of intervention implementation, improvements in the manual and intervention materials, and increased experience of the investigative team which has remained largely consistent over trials. From that perspective, it is informative to consider that the effect on problem-solving skills observed in the online arm in the current trial (0.32) exceeds what was found in our initial trial of F2F BI, where we demonstrated superiority against a standard of care comparison 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Likewise, the effects of the F2F intervention in the current trial on reduction of negative affectivity were descriptively larger than in our prior trials. Thus, although noninferiority of online BI was not demonstrated, it should be noted that it was being compared to an improved and more efficacious version of F2F BI than had been tested in prior trials. With increased experience, fine-tuning, and upgrading of our online materials, we might also expect similar increases in the potential benefits of a web-based intervention. Future upgrades to the web-based intervention would profit from emerging technologies such as machine learning and an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent with humanlike empathic responses. Our group currently has efforts underway to take advantage of these broad advances in digital technology to develop a more engaging, interactive, and responsive version of our electronic BI intervention.\n\n【65】Commonly, noninferiority designs are used to examine a less intensive intervention with an aim of reducing treatment side-effects or adverse events. Reduction in efficacy must be considered in light of a comparable reduction in adverse outcomes. In the current trial, no negative side-effects were anticipated in either treatment arm, and no adverse events were reported. In this setting, the advantage of the web-based intervention is reflected in reduced administrative burden: cost, time and participant inconvenience. Beyond burden, the advantage of an online approach comes from its potential for widespread dissemination and availability for consumers who could access the intervention from anywhere at their convenience. Current estimates of penetration of internet access in North America exceed 90%, and continue to increase, resulting in near universal access of a freely disseminated online intervention 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Our design did not include a formal economic analysis; however, labor costs for the F2F administration exceeded all costs for the development and maintenance of the online site, and cost savings would increase with wider dissemination.\n\n【66】The design of the current trial was intended to compare two different approaches to implementation of the same evidence-based intervention, and efforts were made to keep the arms as distinct as possible Therefore, we attempted to minimize the in-person contact provided in the web-based arm, while the F2F arm did not allow access to the web-based materials. We recognize that this does not reflect developing trends in eHealth where multi-modal approaches combining face-to-face and internet-based components are increasingly common. Future research should explore how these approaches can be combined to optimize outcomes and minimize costs.\n\n【67】Our primary analysis utilized an intent to treat (ITT) approach. For noninferiority trials, there has not been a clear consensus on the optimal sample for analysis, although consideration of analyses that exclude participants that did not receive the intervention as planned is often recommended 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Thus we also conducted a per protocol analysis that was specified a priori, defining a minimal exposure to the intervention in each arm in order to be included. The proportion of participants considered per protocol vs. not per protocol in each arm was nearly identical (66%). The per protocol analysis had substantially reduced power and should be interpreted cautiously, but the findings were consistent with the ITT analysis.\n\n【68】Other potential study limitations include the participation rate (65.7%) of those recruited to the study, which could suggest some bias in the study sample. However, this rate is comparable to that obtained in our prior trials 9,11 but substantially higher than in other trials aimed at parents of children with newly diagnosed cancer or for internet-based interventions for prevention of medical traumatic stress in parents 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Additionally, follow-up was limited to 3 months. Perhaps distinctions between F2F and web-based approaches would become more apparent over time. Finally, our reliance on the SPSI-R as the primary outcome measure, in the absence of an independent, ecological measure of actual problem-solving by participants has been a potential issue in all of our trials. Our prior findings demonstrating that improvement in negative affect following the intervention is mediated by change in problem-solving skills as measured by the SPSI-R serves to largely assuage this concern 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【69】Across 4 large RCT's we have demonstrated that F2F BI is supported by considerable evidence. Noninferiority of an online version of BI relative to standard F2F administration was not established in the current trial. Thus, there is not sufficient evidence to warrant widespread implementation of web-based BI as a stand-alone intervention. However, significant benefits of the web-based intervention were documented on both the primary outcome of problem-solving skills, and the secondary outcomes of negative affectivity. These results suggest that further development and enhancement of a web-based approach are warranted. Given the advantages of low resource utilization and ease of delivery, it appears that a web-based implementation of BI can play a valuable role in alleviating distress in caregivers. However it is likely that web-based administration will be most effective in combination with in-person support. Future research should investigate the benefits of reduced frequency face-to-face delivery of BI, supplemented with enhanced online materials.\n\n【70】Declaration of Competing Interest\n---------------------------------\n\n【71】All authors indicate there are no conflicts of interest to report.\n\n【72】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【73】National Institutes of Health (U.S.), R01 CA159013 (P.I.

However, the resource intensiveness of this in-person intervention has limited its widespread delivery. We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial with a noninferiority design to evaluate whether a web-based version of BI requiring fewer resources is noninferior to in-person administration.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】621 caregivers of children with newly diagnosed cancer were randomly assigned to standard BI delivered face-to-face or a web-based version delivered via mobile device. The primary outcome was caregiver-reported problem-solving skills. The noninferiority margin was defined as 0.2 standard deviation units of the change from baseline to end of intervention. Secondary outcomes included caregiver-reported mood disturbance, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms.删除1-2:<u> The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01711944.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】The effect of the standard treatment was preserved; parents in the standard BI arm improved their problem-solving (effect size = 0.53, _t_ \\= 8.88, _p_ < .001). Parents in the web-based BI group also improved their problem-solving (effect size = 0.32, _t_ \\= 5.32, _p_ < .001). Although the web-based intervention preserved 60% of the standard treatment effect, the test of noninferiority was non-significant (effect size = -0.21, _p_ \\= 0.55).

Further development of the web-based BI is needed before it can be recommended as a stand-alone intervention.

We anticipated there might be some attenuation of efficacy of an online administration due to reduction in interpersonal attention and support, but reasoned that a minor reduction in efficacy would be acceptable given the capacity for wider dissemination of a web-based intervention requiring fewer resources. Thus, this was designed as a noninferiority trial.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】This randomized controlled trial failed to demonstrate the noninferiority of a web-based implementation in comparison to the standard in-person approach. However, benefits of the web-based intervention were documented, which encourages further tailoring and incorporation of newer technologies to enhance the efficacy of this approach.\n\n【17】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【18】Considering all available evidence, further development of the web-based BI program is needed before it can be recommended as a stand-alone intervention. Web-based technologies are rapidly developing, and with utilization of new machine learning approaches to more closely mirror a personal therapist, the effects of web-based BI are likely to improve. Future research should investigate enhanced web-based BI, as well as multimodal approaches that combine in-person intervention supplemented with enhanced online materials.\n\n【19】1\\. Introduction\n----------------\n\n【20】The initial diagnosis and early treatment of childhood cancer is highly stressful for parents, leaving them at risk for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. The coping and adjustment of parents as they struggle to manage the many challenges of their child's illness may also have a significant effect on child outcomes, not only for the ill child 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u> but for healthy siblings as well 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Thus, interventions to facilitate parental coping and improve their well-being can have synergistic beneficial effects on all family members who must adapt to a new cancer diagnosis.\n\n【21】The Bright IDEAS (BI) paradigm of problem-solving skills training (PSST) has been demonstrated to be an effective intervention to improve problem-solving skills and decrease negative affectivity (symptoms of mood disturbance, depression, and posttraumatic stress) in mothers of children with recently diagnosed cancer 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Data from three multisite randomized trials has demonstrated both the efficacy and specificity of the BI program, which has been recognized by the National Cancer Institute as a Research Tested Intervention Program (RTIP) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Bright IDEAS received outstanding RTIP scores of 4.4 and 5.0 (out of 5) for Research Integrity and Dissemination Capability respectively, but a lower score of 2.0 for Intervention Impact. The primary factors for the low impact score were related to high resource intensiveness (standard BI requires 8 h of face-to-face (F2F) administration by specially trained staff) and the emphasis on mothers of recently diagnosed childhood cancer patients, which limited reach to a relatively small population 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In response, we developed an web-based version of the BI intervention appropriate for all caregivers, as a strategy to reduce resource utilization for administration, to extend reach, and to provide 24/7 availability to anyone with Internet access.\n\n【22】Use of internet and mobile technologies has grown rapidly across many areas of medicine, including pediatric oncology 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Internet or computer based psychological interventions have been found to be effective for various kinds of problems compared to usual care 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Such eHealth/mHealth interventions often reach a medium effect size, which approaches that of in-person treatment. Digital health programs are low cost relative to their potential reach, and they provide a variety of benefits to participants and researchers alike, including scale, fidelity, privacy, and ease-of-access. Software is, inherently, much more scale-able than human resources, improving the potential impact of digital interventions, especially in resource-constrained clinical contexts. Apps can be integrated seamlessly into a participant's daily life activities with minimal effort, allowing users to engage with the program on their terms, in their own time.\n\n【23】Despite the benefits of mobile technologies, the effect of internet-based behavioral health treatments appear to be moderated by therapist support, with studies that included access to the support of a therapist showing larger effects than those that do not 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Although such eHealth/mHealth approaches address many barriers to access of services, there is a potential cost for the loss of in-person support. The specificity of the problem-solving skills training component of the BI intervention, beyond the non-specific effects of providing empathic, supportive contact, was clearly documented in our prior trial 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Nevertheless, a proportion of the intervention effect remained attributable to the in-person effects of attention and therapeutic support. Thus we anticipated that some attenuation of efficacy was possible with online administration, but this was considered acceptable, as it would be counterbalanced by the ease of delivery and capacity for widespread dissemination. Therefore, rather than conducting a superiority trial, the current study was designed to test the noninferiority of a web-based version of BI as the candidate intervention in comparison to our standard in-person approach.\n\n【24】2\\. Methods\n-----------\n\n【25】### 2.1 Participants\n\n【26】Caregivers of children with cancer were recruited at 5 sites across the U.S. (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH), University of Texas/MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), Children's Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA), Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP), and Texas Children's Hospital (TCH)). Eligibility criteria included: parent of a child diagnosed with any malignancy, and treated with chemotherapy, radiation, and/or surgery; child diagnosed 4–16 weeks prior to enrollment; parent ability to speak and read English or Spanish; child not in medical crisis at time of enrollment (e.g. admitted to ICU). At 3 sites (MDACC, CHLA, TCH), parents who were primarily Spanish-speaking were preferentially recruited, with a goal of 20% of total enrollment across all sites. At SJCRH and CHP, only English-speaking parents were enrolled. In prior trials, recruitment was limited to mothers, given the typically limited availability of fathers 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. In the current trial, fathers were eligible, and if both parents were equally available, fathers were preferentially recruited, with a goal of including a minimum of 10% fathers in the sample. Recruitment began in October 2013, and the trial was closed to accrual in December 2017.\n\n【27】### 2.2 Procedures\n\n【28】This multicenter RCT used a noninferiority design to compare the Bright IDEAS problem-solving skills training intervention (BI) administered in its standard format, which involves 8 1-hour F2F sessions, to a web-based version of BI requiring significantly less in-person contact.删除1-2:<u> The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01711944), and Institutional Review Board approval was obtained at all participating sites.</u> Participants provided written informed consent, and completed a baseline (T1) battery of assessment measures prior to random assignment to treatment arm (face-to-face \\[F2F\\] or web-based BI) in a 1:1 ratio, using a block design stratified by site and language. An identical battery of measures was completed at the end of intervention (T2) and 3 months post-intervention (T3). Assessments were completed using the web database, REDcap, with paper and pencil as backup. Participants received modest gift cards for their time ($25 at T1 and T2, $50 at T3).\n\n【29】### 2.3 Interventions\n\n【30】#### 2.3.1 Standard (F2F) BI\n\n【31】This intervention was delivered as in previous trials 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. BI has been developed as an appealing, easily understood approach to the teaching and coaching of problem-solving skills. A comprehensive manual has been developed to guide the interventionist, along with worksheets and attractive graphic materials for the caregiver. The term “Bright” signifies optimism, and instilling the belief that problems can be solved, which is considered an essential component for successful implementation of the intervention. The acronym ‘IDEAS’ is used as a mnemonic for the 5 essential steps of our problem solving approach, with each letter signifying a step: I (Identify the problem), D (Determine the options), E (Evaluate/choose the best option), A (Act), and S 删除2:<u>(See if it worked)</u>. Problem-solving is presented as a general coping skill applicable to many life challenges, including those commonly faced in parenting a child during cancer treatment. The intervention is administered in 8 1-hour F2F individual sessions. Guided by the manual, the sessions are designed to follow a set sequence: session 1: Rapport building, understanding relevant personal and medical history, introduction of the BI program and worksheets; session 2: Review of the BI program and worksheets, and initial application to a real problem; sessions 3–7: continued application of BI to identified problems and promotion of problem-solving strategies and skills in vivo; and session 8: review of BI principles, relapse prevention, and termination.\n\n【32】Interventions were delivered by research assistants (RAs) with graduate education in clinical psychology or related fields, under the supervision of the site principal investigators (PI's) who were all licensed psychologists. RAs were trained in and delivered both the F2F and web-based formats to minimize differences in personal style. Bilingual RAs worked with Spanish-speaking participants using Spanish language materials. The interventionists were initially trained together as a group before the trial opened to accrual. Site PI's provided weekly supervision to ensure adequate therapeutic delivery and fidelity to the treatment manual. All sessions were digitally recorded for review of treatment integrity (discussed below).\n\n【33】#### 2.3.2 Web-based BI\n\n【34】The web-based intervention was produced in collaboration with web developers from Radiant Digital Corporation. Development followed a user-centered design process, which included a series of formative focus groups to obtain parent perspectives. An initial website prototype was then reviewed by representative users from the study sites. Feedback from this review was used by the developers, and program changes were updated in a stepwise incremental process. Ultimately, the content of the web-based intervention included modeling videos, interactive activities and homework/worksheet tools designed to be similar to the F2F intervention. This included 7 videos presenting the steps of problem-solving via the interaction between a clinician and parent, and 4 fotovellas depicting parents working through typical problems encountered. The web-based program also featured a counselor interface for web-users; this permitted counselors to track progress through the lessons and view completion status/follow-up as necessary. The fotonovelas incorporated interactive skills practice—brief practice exercises for each step of the BI method. The skills practice delivered reinforcement or remediation based on user responses.\n\n【35】An initial meeting between participant and RA provided explanation of BI, and directions for navigating the website on the caregiver's preferred device (lap/desktop删除2-1:<u>, tablet or cellphone</u>). A caregiver without convenient access was loaned an inexpensive device for the duration of his/her participation in the project. Participants were asked to access the site at least weekly and to: (1) view the 7 instructional videos and 4 fotonovellas illustrating common problems; and (2) work through ≥1personal problem(s). Prompt logistical support was available throughout from the developer. Content or intervention questions were emailed to the site RA for response by the next business day. Two weeks after the initial meeting, the RA phoned the caregiver to review web-based usage and address barriers if adherence was suboptimal. After 8 weeks, a second face-to-face session reviewed principles learned, and encouraged ongoing use of BI. After the wrap-up session, the participant completed the T2 assessment. Three months later, participants completed the T3 assessment. Brief questionnaires about the usefulness of the intervention and suggestions for improvement of the site were included.\n\n【36】### 2.4 Treatment integrity\n\n【37】Treatment integrity (TI) assurance began with training of the interventionists as a group, in a meeting that included all study staff and site PI's, and with emphasis on the use of the standardized treatment manual. Ongoing monitoring of TI was conducted by both the site PI's and a TI team. The TI team included the study PI (OJZS) and 4 study staff (2 Spanish-speaking) who had experience with, but were not providing the intervention in this trial. All sessions conducted with those in the F2F BI group, as well as the first and last sessions of those in the web-based group, were digitally recorded and uploaded to a central password-protected server. The first two sessions conducted by each interventionist in each condition (F2F and online) were reviewed by both the site PI and the TI team. Thereafter, 10% of the standard arm sessions, and 20% of the first and last sessions in the online arm, were chosen at random for review by the TI team. Reviewers scored sessions using a rubric developed in prior trials and revised for the online arm. Sessions were scored both on non-specific factors (e.g. therapeutic alliance, support, empathy) and on BI specific factors (e.g. description of BI, review of worksheets, attention to homework). The PIs received reports monthly, and reviewed any noted deviations with the RA. Sessions were scored on a 10-point metric. Of sessions reviewed, 91% (446/492) received a score of ≥ 8 (very good-excellent).\n\n【38】### 2.5 Measures\n\n【39】#### 2.5.1 Demographics\n\n【40】Demographic information obtained included child age, gender, diagnosis, and date of diagnosis; and caregiver age, gender, marital status, educational level, occupational status, and self-reported race/ethnicity.\n\n【41】#### 2.5.2 Problem-solving skills\n\n【42】The Social Problem-Solving Inventory, Revised (SPSI-R) is a widely used, well validated 52-item measure of problem-solving skills, which assesses two dimensions of problem orientation (positive vs. negative) and three dimensions of approach to problems (rational; impulsive-careless; avoidance), and also yields a total score 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. As in prior trials, change in total SPSI-R score served as the primary outcome. Internal consistency in the current trial was excellent (α = 0.95).\n\n【43】#### 2.5.3 Negative affectivity\n\n【44】Parental emotional functioning was measured as in previous trials, with a triad of instruments assessing mood disturbance, symptoms of depression, and posttraumatic stress. The Profile of Mood States Scale (POMS) is a widely used measure of mood disturbance with excellent reliability and validity 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. We used a 15-item short-form 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u> to obtain a composite total mood disturbance scale (TMD) as the outcome. Reliability (α) in the current trial was 0.90). To measure symptoms of depression we used the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The diagnostic validity of the PHQ-9 for assessing the presence of major depression is well established, as is its sensitivity to change. Reliability in the current trial was 0.88. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) is a well-established measure of symptoms of posttraumatic stress in response to a specific event (here identified as the child's cancer diagnosis), with excellent reliability and validity 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Reliability (α) in the current trial was 0.93. This triad of measures was obtained at all timepoints, and serve as secondary outcomes. All measures are available in Spanish and have been validated in Spanish-speaking samples.\n\n【45】### 2.6 Statistical analysis\n\n【46】The study was designed as a non-inferiority trial with a one-sided alternative hypothesis 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. A non-inferiority trial seeks to determine whether a new intervention is not worse than an established treatment by more than an acceptable amount, referred to as the margin of equivalence (E). When the null hypothesis is rejected (or the 95% CI excludes E), non-inferiority is established; failure to reject the null hypothesis is considered ‘indeterminate’. Estimates of the effect of F2F BI were obtained from prior trials, where moderate effects (0.4 S.D.) were observed in change in SPSI-R scores from baseline to end of intervention (T2) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. The margin of equivalence was therefore set at 0.2 times the S.D. of the change from T1 to T2 (or approximately 50% of the prior observed effect). Given these parameters, a sample size of 620 (310 in each group) was required to achieve 80% power to detect noninferiority using a one-sided, two-sample _t_ \\-test, at _α_ of 0.05.\n\n【47】Primary analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat basis (ITT), using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for incomplete repeated measures (SAS Proc Mixed), with the constraint that under the conditions of randomization, the baseline estimates are equal 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Missing data were handled under the assumption of Missing at Random (MAR) 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Estimated change from T1 to T2 in SPSI-R total scores was considered the primary endpoint. Change in SPSI-R from T1 to T3, and changes in negative affectivity measures from T1 to T2 and T3 were examined as secondary endpoints. Because the trial was designed with one-sided alternative hypotheses, the 95% CIs are also one-sided and only one boundary exists. Effect sizes are defined as the estimated mean change divided by the standard deviation of the change.\n\n【48】In addition to the ITT analysis, an objective ‘per protocol’ analysis was also conducted to account for participants who did not receive the full intervention in either arm due to non-compliance or other factors. This per protocol analysis excluded participants in the F2F arm who received fewer than 6 sessions; and in the online arm who did not complete all 7 instructional videos, 2 of 4 fotonovellas, and work on at least one independent problem.\n删除5:<u>\n#### 2.6.1 Role of the funding source\n\n【49】The funder of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication, following review and approval by all authors.\n\n【50】</u>\n3\\. Findings\n------------\n\n【51】Of 945 eligible caregivers approached, 621 (65.7%) consented, completed baseline measures, and were randomized (311 standard BI; 310 web-based BI; CONSORT diagram删除2-1:<u>, Fig. 1 </u>). This participation rate was comparable to that of our prior trials and targeted accrual was met. There were no differences between participants and non-participants based on child diagnosis, language, or whether the target participant was a mother or father. There was a difference in time since diagnosis for recruitment, with participants recruited earlier than decliners (7.3 weeks, vs. 8.9 weeks). Baseline demographic and medical characteristics of the treatment arms were comparable 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. In terms of per protocol analysis, in the F2F arm, of 222 who completed the study, 146 (66%) received ≥ 6 sessions, and were considered per protocol. In the web-based arm, of 220 who completed the study, there was a nearly identical 66% rate of per protocol adherence.\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 1 CONSORT Diagram. \\*Due to a temporary server failure, complete data regarding online usage was not available for 64 participants in the web-based arm, thus they were not included in the per-protocol analyses.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【52】Table 1 Demographic and Medical Characteristics of Intent-to-Treat Sample.\n\n|  | FACE-TO-FACE | ONLINE |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | M | SD | M | SD | P |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Child Age | 8.2 | 5.5 | 8.3 | 5.5 | .712 NS |\n| Time DX to T1 (weeks) | 7.3 | 3.2 | 7.4 | 3.5 | .968 NS |\n| Parent Age | 36.7 | 8.8 | 37.0 | 8.6 | .541 NS |\n| Parent Highest | 13.8 | 3.5 | 13.6 | 3.6 | .809 NS |\n| Grade Completed | N | % | N | % | P |\n| Child Gender | Child Gender | Child Gender | Child Gender | Child Gender | Child Gender |\n| % Male | 175 | 56.3 | 170 | 55.2 | .788 NS |\n| Parent Gender | Parent Gender | Parent Gender | Parent Gender | Parent Gender | Parent Gender |\n| % Female | 269 | 86.5 | 280 | 90.3 | .136 NS |\n| Language | Language | Language | Language | Language | Language |\n| English | 267 | 85.9 | 266 | 85.8 | .987 NS |\n| Spanish | 44 | 14.1 | 44 | 14.2 |  |\n| Parent Race | Parent Race | Parent Race | Parent Race | Parent Race | Parent Race |\n| White | 195 | 64.4 | 193 | 64.3 | .182 NS |\n| Black | 43 | 14.2 | 34 | 11.3 |  |\n| Other/Unknown | 65 | 21.4 | 73 | 24.4 |  |\n| Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis | Child Diagnosis |\n| ALL | 118 | 36.7 | 111 | 35.8 | .986 NS |\n| Other Leukemia | 33 | 10.6 | 37 | 11.9 |  |\n| HL/Non HL | 27 | 8.6 | 27 | 8.7 |  |\n| Solid Tumor | 76 | 24.4 | 78 | 25.2 |  |\n| Brain Tumor | 26 | 8.4 | 27 | 8.7 |  |\n| Other | 35 | 11.3 | 30 | 9.7 |  |\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【54】### 3.1 Primary outcome\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 2 a shows the change in problem-solving scores across the study period for the F2F and web-based groups. The effect of the standard F2F treatment was preserved compared to prior trials. Parents in the F2F BI arm increased their problem-solving score on the SPSI-R by a mean of 1.09 points (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.33, effect size _d_ \\= 0.53, _t_ \\= 8.75, _p_ < .001).

The estimated between-group difference was 6.8 points favoring the F2F group. P-value for noninferiority = 0.49. For depression, the F2F group showed a decline on the PHQ-9 from baseline to T2, with a mean change of −2.99 points (95% CI, −3.6 to −2.4, effect size _d_ \\= −0.56, _t_ \\= −9.9, _p_ < .001). In the web-based group, there was a mean decline of −2.4 points on the PHQ-9 (95% CI, −2.95 to −1.77, effect size _d_ \\= −0.44, _t_ \\= −7.8, _p_ < .001), representing preservation of 78.6% of the standard intervention effect. The estimated between-group difference was 0.63 points favoring the F2F intervention. P-value for noninferiority =0.13. For posttraumatic stress, scores for the F2F group showed decline on the IES-R from baseline to T2, with a mean change of −9.6 points (95% CI, −11.4 to −7.8, effect size _d_ \\= −0.60, _t_ \\= −9.6, _p_ < .001).

The estimated between-group difference was 2.5 points favoring the F2F intervention. P-value for noninferiority = 0.28. Again, the pattern of results is indeterminate in relation to inferiority/noninferiority of the web-based intervention 删除2:<u>( Table 2 删除2-1:<u>, Fig. 3 </u>)</u>. Similar results were found on all secondary outcomes at T-3.\n\n【61】Per protocol analyses were conducted for all secondary outcomes and revealed results similar to the ITT analyses, demonstrating significant benefits of both intervention arms and between-group differences favoring the F2F group. Tests of noninferiority failed to reach significance, and results were indeterminate in relation to inferiority/noninferiority.\n\n【62】4\\. Discussion\n--------------\n\n【63】This multicenter RCT, conducted in two languages, examined the benefits of a newly developed web-based version of an established, evidence-based problem-solving skill intervention, Bright IDEAS (BI), in comparison to the standard F2F mode of delivery. The trial used a noninferiority design, testing the hypothesis that the between group differences would not exceed a margin of equivalence set at 0.2 times the standard deviation of change from T1 to T2. The effects of the benchmark intervention (F2F BI) were preserved as in prior trials. Noninferiority of the web-based comparator intervention was not demonstrated on the primary outcome, nor on any of the secondary outcomes. The difference between treatment arms did not indicate that online BI is inferior to the standard intervention, rather the confidence intervals fell in a range considered indeterminate. Although noninferiority was not demonstrated, significant benefit was also found for the web-based condition, and of a magnitude that exceeded 60% of the benchmark intervention on the primary and all secondary outcomes (range 60% - 78%). These findings suggest that further development of the web-based BI is needed before it can be recommended as a stand-alone intervention. However, the documented benefits of the web-based intervention as well as the advantages of low resource utilization and ease of delivery suggest that further development of web-based BI is indicated.\n\n【64】In evaluating the validity of a noninferiority trial, a crucial consideration is whether the effect of the standard treatment was preserved 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. In the current trial, not only was the effect of F2F BI on change in problem-solving skills preserved, it was descriptively larger than in prior trials 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. In each successive trial of F2F BI, this effect size has increased, which likely reflects several factors, including fine-tuning of intervention implementation, improvements in the manual and intervention materials, and increased experience of the investigative team which has remained largely consistent over trials. From that perspective, it is informative to consider that the effect on problem-solving skills observed in the online arm in the current trial (0.32) exceeds what was found in our initial trial of F2F BI, where we demonstrated superiority against a standard of care comparison 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Likewise, the effects of the F2F intervention in the current trial on reduction of negative affectivity were descriptively larger than in our prior trials. Thus, although noninferiority of online BI was not demonstrated, it should be noted that it was being compared to an improved and more efficacious version of F2F BI than had been tested in prior trials. With increased experience, fine-tuning, and upgrading of our online materials, we might also expect similar increases in the potential benefits of a web-based intervention. Future upgrades to the web-based intervention would profit from emerging technologies such as machine learning and an artificial intelligence-based conversational agent with humanlike empathic responses. Our group currently has efforts underway to take advantage of these broad advances in digital technology to develop a more engaging, interactive, and responsive version of our electronic BI intervention.\n\n【65】Commonly, noninferiority designs are used to examine a less intensive intervention with an aim of reducing treatment side-effects or adverse events. Reduction in efficacy must be considered in light of a comparable reduction in adverse outcomes. In the current trial, no negative side-effects were anticipated in either treatment arm, and no adverse events were reported. In this setting, the advantage of the web-based intervention is reflected in reduced administrative burden: cost, time and participant inconvenience. Beyond burden, the advantage of an online approach comes from its potential for widespread dissemination and availability for consumers who could access the intervention from anywhere at their convenience. Current estimates of penetration of internet access in North America exceed 90%, and continue to increase, resulting in near universal access of a freely disseminated online intervention 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Our design did not include a formal economic analysis; however, labor costs for the F2F administration exceeded all costs for the development and maintenance of the online site, and cost savings would increase with wider dissemination.\n\n【66】The design of the current trial was intended to compare two different approaches to implementation of the same evidence-based intervention, and efforts were made to keep the arms as distinct as possible Therefore, we attempted to minimize the in-person contact provided in the web-based arm, while the F2F arm did not allow access to the web-based materials. We recognize that this does not reflect developing trends in eHealth where multi-modal approaches combining face-to-face and internet-based components are increasingly common. Future research should explore how these approaches can be combined to optimize outcomes and minimize costs.\n\n【67】Our primary analysis utilized an intent to treat (ITT) approach. For noninferiority trials, there has not been a clear consensus on the optimal sample for analysis, although consideration of analyses that exclude participants that did not receive the intervention as planned is often recommended 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>. Thus we also conducted a per protocol analysis that was specified a priori, defining a minimal exposure to the intervention in each arm in order to be included. The proportion of participants considered per protocol vs. not per protocol in each arm was nearly identical (66%). The per protocol analysis had substantially reduced power and should be interpreted cautiously, but the findings were consistent with the ITT analysis.\n\n【68】Other potential study limitations include the participation rate (65.7%) of those recruited to the study, which could suggest some bias in the study sample. However, this rate is comparable to that obtained in our prior trials 9,11 but substantially higher than in other trials aimed at parents of children with newly diagnosed cancer or for internet-based interventions for prevention of medical traumatic stress in parents 删除3:<u>\\[ , \\]</u>. Additionally, follow-up was limited to 3 months. Perhaps distinctions between F2F and web-based approaches would become more apparent over time. Finally, our reliance on the SPSI-R as the primary outcome measure, in the absence of an independent, ecological measure of actual problem-solving by participants has been a potential issue in all of our trials. Our prior findings demonstrating that improvement in negative affect following the intervention is mediated by change in problem-solving skills as measured by the SPSI-R serves to largely assuage this concern 删除3:<u>\\[ \\]</u>.\n\n【69】Across 4 large RCT's we have demonstrated that F2F BI is supported by considerable evidence. Noninferiority of an online version of BI relative to standard F2F administration was not established in the current trial. Thus, there is not sufficient evidence to warrant widespread implementation of web-based BI as a stand-alone intervention. However, significant benefits of the web-based intervention were documented on both the primary outcome of problem-solving skills, and the secondary outcomes of negative affectivity. These results suggest that further development and enhancement of a web-based approach are warranted. Given the advantages of low resource utilization and ease of delivery, it appears that a web-based implementation of BI can play a valuable role in alleviating distress in caregivers. However it is likely that web-based administration will be most effective in combination with in-person support. Future research should investigate the benefits of reduced frequency face-to-face delivery of BI, supplemented with enhanced online materials.\n\n【70】Declaration of Competing Interest\n---------------------------------\n\n【71】All authors indicate there are no conflicts of interest to report.\n\n【72】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【73】National Institutes of Health (U.S.), R01 CA159013 (P.I.

And her Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology Group at the University of Manchester's Cancer Research UK (CRUK)-funded Paterson Institute for Cancer Research have certainly had their fair share of those in the past few years. Dive had just returned from Paris, where she was awarded the prestigious 2012 Pasteur-Weizmann/Servier Prize for her “remarkable advances in cancer research in the development of circulating biomarkers”. But the cause of her infectious good mood on this particular day was the appointment of a senior manager to her burgeoning ranks; the latest addition to a multidisciplinary translational science team that also scooped the 2011 CRUK Translational Cancer Research Prize.\n\n【2】Dive came to translational oncology from basic science. In 2003 she left a successful career “working on cancer cells in plastic dishes” to establish what has become one of the largest multidisciplinary translational oncology research groups in the CRUK network. There, “her enthusiasm and natural ability to apply cutting edge science to clinical situations where pragmatism and practicality are important ingredients has been a remarkable achievement”, says the Christie Hospital's Malcolm Ranson, who Dive credits with nurturing her ability to speak “medic”.\n\n【3】“2003 in the oncology space was a time when we were really coming over the hill of this enormous challenge of personal medicine for cancer patients; matching the right drug to the right patient at the right dose”, she recalls. To do that effectively you need biomarkers, and when Dive arrived at the Paterson Institute she saw what she calls an “enormous gap” for someone to work more closely with the clinicians at the Christie Hospital “where the patients desperately required biomarker science so that the personalised medicine agenda could be pursued”. And that, Dive hopes, will be her legacy. “The most important thing I've done in my career is build that platform pretty much from scratch to a flourishing 50-person multidisciplinary biomarker research group, which luckily wins international awards.”\n\n【4】Dive's team is unusual in that it includes clinicians and non-clinical staff at many different levels, and it's impossible to ignore Dive's upbringing when she talks about the dynamics of teamwork, shared rewards, and mutual respect that make her unit run with military precision. Not to mention a certain strength of personality that seems perfectly suited to leadership. “My Dad was a colour sergeant in the army, and while I found that all very challenging at the time I look back at it now with a degree of gratitude”, she says. “He taught me a lot about self-discipline, a lot about work ethic. He was a fairly forceful character growing up.” Although not particularly academic at school (she says she had a “busy adolescence”), Dive was still academic enough to be the first member of her family to go to university. “I did pharmacy really for two reasons”, she says. “One was I was interested in science, but the second was you get a job at the end of a pharmacy degree. And then when I did my degree it turned out I was a bit cleverer than I thought I was. At university I found subjects that I was really deeply interested in and enjoyed”.\n\n【5】After a year training in a National Health Service hospital Dive came to the realisation that what she really wanted to do was cancer research. “My maternal grandfather had a brain tumour and died many years ago when pain relief wasn't as good as it is now, and that had a very dramatic impact on my mother”, she says. But in the days before the internet, exactly how to get into basic research was something of a mystery. “I sat in the coffee room in the hospital and there was a magazine called _Cancer Topics_ on the table, and the editors were in alphabetical order”, she says. “The first one was Norman Bleehan, so I decided I was going to write to Norman Bleehan and ask how to get into a PhD programme in cancer research. And the really rather wonderful thing was that Norman Bleehan wrote back pretty quickly and said ‘well come for an interview in Cambridge’. So I did, and they offered me a PhD in the Clinical Oncology Experimental Radiotherapeutics Unit in Addenbrookes Hospital. It was the best career decision I've probably ever made.”\n\n【6】Dive now has her sights set on the “holy grail” of cancer biomarker research: simple blood tests that can indicate how aggressive a tumour is, which therapy will be most effective, and show how the tumour is responding to treatment. “Things are moving fast”, she says. “The sensitivity of the technology is getting better”, and the recent Pasteur-Weizmann/Servier Prize money will help go towards adding to the laboratory's cutting-edge single-cell purification technology to speed up their pioneering work delving into the biology of circulating tumour cells. With the appointment last year of Richard Marais as the Director of the Paterson Institute, “we will be taking big steps forward with personalised medicine for cancer patients, the future looks bright”, Dive asserts. And when it comes to the future, Dive is invested in nurturing the next generation of talent. “I'm also very passionate about training the young clinical fellows who come into the lab for the first time and don't know which way up the pipette goes; they're very smart and they learn so fast, and at the end of the day those clinicians will be the ones delivering personalised medicine”, she says. “As a role model for the young aspiring translational scientists, there is no better mentor”, says Ranson.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 12 January 2013\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60036-7</u>\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Two factors largely account for these decreases; increased deployment of insecticide-treated bednets and increased availability of highly effective artemisinin combination treatments. In large trials, parenteral artesunate (an artemisinin derivative) reduced severe malaria mortality by 22·5% in Africa and 34·7% in Asia compared with quinine, whereas adjunctive interventions have been uniformly unsuccessful. Rapid tests have been an important addition to microscopy for malaria diagnosis. Chemopreventive strategies have been increasingly deployed in Africa, notably intermittent sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine treatment in pregnancy, and monthly amodiaquine–sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine during the rainy season months in children aged between 3 months and 5 years across the sub-Sahel. Enthusiasm for malaria elimination has resurfaced. This ambitious but laudable goal faces many challenges, including the worldwide economic downturn, difficulties in elimination of vivax malaria, development of pyrethroid resistance in some anopheline mosquitoes, and the emergence of artemisinin resistance in _Plasmodium falciparum_ in southeast Asia. We review the epidemiology, clinical features, pathology, prevention, and treatment of malaria.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【2】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【3】Already registered?\n\n【4】Log in to existing account\n\n【5】Forgot password?\n\n【6】One-time access price info\n\n【7】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【8】Not yet registered?\n\n【9】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:26:43", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:27:31", "cost": 47.545}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:52", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:27:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:26:43"}

Distinct from anti-angiogenic drugs, which are inherently cytostatic and inhibit tumour neovascularisation, tumour vascular-disrupting agents target established tumour vasculature and might be more effective against large tumour masses. Combretastatins are one of the main classes of these drugs in clinical trial development. They are tubulin depolymerising drugs that selectively disrupt the tumour endothelial cytoskeleton and cause rapid tumour vascular shutdown and necrosis. Synergistic anti-tumour and complementary spatial activity provides good scientific rationale to support the combination of tumour vascular-disrupting agents with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Treatment with single-agent tumour vascular-disrupting agents typically results in central tumour necrosis but leaves a rim of viable cells at the well-perfused periphery of the lesion, which are best targeted by cytotoxics. Ombrabulin, a prodrug, is a combretastatin derivative.

Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either awake-regional anaesthesia or sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia. Web-based randomisation was done in blocks of two or four and stratified by site and gestational age at birth. Infants were excluded if they had existing risk factors for neurological injury. The primary outcome of the trial will be the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient score at age 5 years. The secondary outcome, reported here, is the composite cognitive score of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III, assessed at 2 years. The analysis was as per protocol adjusted for gestational age at birth. A difference in means of five points (1/3 SD) was predefined as the clinical equivalence margin.删除1-2:<u> 删除8:<u>This trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516 and ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00756600.</u></u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between Feb 9, 2007, and Jan 31, 2013, 363 infants were randomly assigned to receive awake-regional anaesthesia and 359 to general anaesthesia.

These changes include accelerated apoptosis and other effects such as changes to dendritic morphology. Findings have also shown that exposure to general anaesthesia in young animals is associated with long-term cognitive and behavioural changes. These effects have been described in various species including non-human primates. The changes are seen with several different general anaesthesia drugs, are greater with longer exposure, and are less severe in older animals. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown and much debated. \n\n【12】In human beings, there is conflicting evidence for an association between exposure to anaesthesia in early childhood and adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcome; however, confounding restricts any assumption of causality. Young children who receive anaesthesia are inevitably having surgery or an investigative procedure. Added risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome might be due to the underlying pathology, comorbidity, or other perioperative risk factors. These results have prompted recommendations to consider delaying surgery in infancy and there have been several calls for more research to address this important issue. \n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【15】We searched MEDLINE and Cochrane controlled trial register (last search done on Sept 18, 2015) for original research and meta-analyses describing the association between anaesthesia exposure in early life and neurodevelopmental outcome. We used combinations of the search terms “anesthesia”, and “child development”, or “learning disorders”. The search found no randomised trials but several cohort studies. Several reviews have concluded that there is an association between anaesthesia in childhood and neurodevelopmental outcome. Findings of two meta-analyses have shown an association between anaesthesia in children and a range of neurodevelopmental outcomes. All reviews and meta-analyses acknowledge the weaknesses of the cohort studies; including strong likelihood of confounding, bias, heterogeneous populations at times of exposure, and heterogeneous outcome measures, some of which are poorly defined or insensitive. All reviews conclude that causation cannot be established or excluded.\n\n【16】**Added value of this study**\n\n【17】We report results from the first randomised controlled trial assessing the effect of general anaesthesia in infancy on neurodevelopmental outcome. We used the best measure of neurodevelopment available to assess 2-year-old children, and noted strong evidence for equivalence between the use of awake-regional anaesthesia and just less than 1 h of general anaesthesia. However, it should be noted that this was an analysis of a secondary outcome with the primary outcome planned at 5 years of age, and in view of the limited sensitivity of developmental assessment at 2 years of age, this trial does not provide the definitive answer.\n\n【18】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【19】Although there are some limitations that should be noted when interpreting the trial, the randomised prospective design adds substantially to the weight that should be given to the results compared with the mixed results found in previous cohort studies. However, reassessment at an older age is necessary before definitive conclusions can be drawn. The trial does not rule out the possibility that longer or many exposures to anaesthesia in early childhood can cause neurodevelopmental changes. Further research is needed to address these questions.\n\n【20】In view of the many potential confounding factors, a randomised trial is the best study design to establish whether anaesthesia exposure in early childhood causes long-term neurodevelopmental changes. Fortuitously there are two established anaesthetic techniques for inguinal herniorrhaphy in infancy; awake-regional and sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia. Therefore, we undertook a randomised controlled trial comparing neurodevelopmental outcome in children who were randomly assigned to receive either awake-regional or sevoflurane-based general anaesthesia for inguinal herniorrhaphy in early infancy: the General Anaesthesia compared to Spinal anaesthesia (GAS) trial. The primary outcome for the trial will be the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient score at age 5 years. As a secondary outcome, we also planned a priori to assess neurodevelopmental outcome at age 2 years. In this paper we report all secondary outcomes at 2 years of age. Data from the trial relating to post-anaesthesia apnoea and success of regional block have been published elsewhere. \n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Study design\n\n【23】In this observer-blind, international, multisite, randomised, controlled, equivalence trial, we assessed awake-regional anaesthesia versus general anaesthesia in infants undergoing inguinal herniorrhaphy. The trial was done at 28 hospitals in Australia, Italy, the USA, the UK, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Institutional review board or ethics committee approval was obtained at each site and written consent obtained from the child's parents or guardians. A summary of the protocol is available online.\n\n【24】### Participants\n\n【25】Eligibility criteria included infants up to 60 weeks postmenstrual age (ie, gestational age at birth plus chronological age) scheduled for unilateral or bilateral inguinal herniorraphy born at greater than 26 weeks' gestation. Exclusion criteria included any contraindication for either anaesthetic technique, a history of congenital heart disease requiring surgery or pharmacotherapy, mechanical ventilation immediately before surgery, known chromosomal abnormalities or other known acquired or congenital abnormalities that might affect neurodevelopment, previous exposure to volatile general anaesthesia or benzodiazepines as a neonate or in the third trimester in utero, any known neurological injury such as cystic periventricular leukomalacia or grade three or four intraventricular haemorrhage, any social or geographical factor that might make follow-up difficult (eg, planned house move, homelessness, no telephone communication available), or having a primary language at home in a region where neurodevelopmental tests are not available in that language. We identified eligible infants from operating room schedules or at preadmission clinics and recruited in the clinic or in the preadmission areas of the operating floor.\n\n【26】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【27】A 24 h web-based randomisation service was managed by the Data Management and Analysis Centre, Department of Public Health, University of Adelaide, Australia. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either general anaesthesia or awake-regional anaesthesia. Randomisation was done in blocks of two or four and stratified by site and gestational age at birth: 26–29 weeks and 6 days, 30–36 weeks and 6 days, and 37 weeks or more. The anaesthetist was aware of group allocation. Parents were not informed of the group allocation but were told if they asked. The psychologists and paediatricians who did the assessment were masked to group allocation. Once their assessment was completed they were asked to indicate if they were aware of group allocation.\n\n【28】### Procedures\n\n【29】The awake-regional group received either an awake-spinal anaesthetic, an awake-caudal anaesthetic, or a combined spinal-caudal anaesthetic according to institutional protocols. Spinal anaesthesia was done with 0·2 mL/kg 0·5% isobaric bupivacaine with a minimum volume of 0·5 mL. Because isobaric bupivacaine was unavailable at some sites, other agents were used (in the USA, 0·13 mL/kg of hyperbaric 0·75% bupivacaine, and in the UK 0·2 mL/kg 0·5% levobupivacaine). Caudal anaesthesia was done with up to a total dose of 2·5 mg/kg of 0·25% bupivacaine. In the UK, 0·25% levobupivacaine was used. In the USA, if surgery was likely to take longer than 1 h, some patients were given a loading dose of 3% chloroprocaine (1 mL/kg in divided doses of no more than 0·25 mL/kg per 15 s) via a caudal cannula and then an infusion of 1–2 mL/kg per h. Ilioinguinal and field blocks could also be done. The total dose of bupivacaine did not exceed 2·5 mg/kg. In the awake-regional group, oral sucrose was used to settle the child if needed and all other forms of sedation avoided. If the awake-regional anaesthesia was ineffective then a general anaesthesia was done with sevoflurane, and if the child became unsettled intraoperatively, sevoflurane was given to supplement the awake-regional anaesthesia. Both were regarded as protocol violations.\n\n【30】The general anaesthesia group received sevoflurane for induction and maintenance in a mix of air and oxygen. The concentration of sevoflurane was left to the discretion of the anaesthetist, as was choice of airway device, ventilation technique, and use of any neuromuscular blocking agents. No opioid or nitrous oxide was allowed. A caudal, ilioinguinal–iliohypogastric or field block with bupivacaine could be done in both groups to provide postoperative analgesia. Oral or intravenous acetaminophen could also be given. Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and (where applicable) expired sevoflurane concentrations were recorded every 5 min.\n\n【31】Serum glucose was measured after anaesthetic induction. There were rescue protocols for hypoglycaemia, hypotension, and hypoxaemia. If the blood pressure fell more than 20% below baseline, an intravenous bolus fluid was given plus vasoactive drugs if deemed necessary. Hypoglycaemia (blood sugar <3·0 mmol/L) was treated with a bolus of 5 mL/kg of 10% dextrose. Oxygen by face mask in the awake-regional arm and an increased FiO 2 in the general anaesthesia group was used at the discretion of the anaesthetist to maintain arterial oxygen saturation higher than 95%.\n\n【32】Assessments were undertaken within 2 months either side of 2 years of age (corrected for prematurity). The assessment took about 2 h to complete. A trained psychologist administered the Bayley-III. The Bayley-III has cognitive, language, and motor scales. The cognitive scale includes tasks assessing attention, memory, sensorimotor development, exploration, concept formation, and simple problem solving. The language scale assesses expressive and receptive skills, and the motor scale assesses fine and gross motor skills. Parents completed the Bayley-III Social-Emotional and Adaptive Behaviour Questionnaires and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory: Words and Sentences (MacArthur-Bates). The MacArthur-Bates is a parent informant measure that assesses expressive language in children aged 16–30 months. We also recorded demographic data, family history, and medical history, and did a brief physical and neurological examination. The physical examination included anthropometric measurements such as length, weight, and arm and head circumference. The neurological examination included cranial nerve examination, posture assessment, and the muscle strength, tone, and reflexes of the arms and legs.\n\n【33】All study data were sent to the Murdoch Children's Research Institute in Melbourne, Australia. All forms were checked for data quality by trained research assistants and double checked by a research assistant who was not involved in the primary data collection or entry. An independent data safety monitoring committee met every 6 months during recruitment. Summary data by allocation were presented to the committee. There were no formal interim analyses of neurodevelopmental outcome.\n\n【34】### Statistical analysis\n\n【35】The main outcome for the analysis at 2 years of age was prespecified to be the composite cognitive score of the Bayley-III. The hypothesis (as stated in the protocol) was that the composite cognitive score of the Bayley-III measured at 2 years of age in infants who are anaesthetised for inguinal herniorraphy is equivalent when using general anaesthesia compared with awake-regional anaesthesia. The components of the Bayley-III are reported as scaled scores and as composite scores. The five composite scores (cognitive, language, motor, adaptive behaviour, and social-emotional scales) are standardised to have a mean of 100 and an SD of 15 in the reference population. The subscales (eg, fine motor scale) are reported as scaled scores, with a mean of 10 and an SD of 3. The other secondary outcomes for this analysis are the language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behaviour scores from the Bayley-III and the age-adjusted Vocabulary Production Score from the MacArthur-Bates. Published normative scores were used at all sites with forms and instructions translated locally. Diagnosis of cerebral palsy was another prespecified secondary outcome\n\n【36】Because this is an equivalence study, the outcome was analysed on an as-per-protocol basis to ensure a conservative estimate in the direction of non-equivalence. Equivalence was defined a priori if the 95% confidence interval of the difference in means lies within minus five and plus five points. Intention-to-treat analyses were also planned. Analyses were adjusted for categories of gestational age at birth (182–209 days; 210–258 days; ≥259 days).\n\n【37】The sample size was based on the primary outcome for the GAS trial; the 5-year follow-up WPPSI-III Full Scale Intelligence Quotient score. Assuming an expected difference of one standardised score point and a 90% chance that a 95% CI will exclude a difference of more than five points (the largest difference acceptable to show equivalence), the trial would need 598 infants. Enrolling roughly 720 participants would allow for 10% loss to follow-up and 10% with a major protocol violation.\n\n【38】We used multiple imputation with chained equations to impute missing outcome data in the analysis of all outcomes. The following prespecified variables were used as predictor variables within the imputation approach: anaesthesia group, country, sex, gestational age at birth, standardised _Z_ score for birthweight, mother received antenatal steroids, mother diagnosed with chorioamnionitis, intraventricular haemorrhage, maternal age, maternal education, rescue glucose given intravenously, need for fluid bolus for hypotension, vasoactive drugs given for hypotension, duration of surgery, dose of sevoflurane (concentration multiplied by h), significant postoperative apnoea, corrected age at assessment, any more anaesthetic exposures since the inguinal herniorraphy, any malformations, any chronic illness, any prescribed medication for 2 months or longer, total length of any readmission to hospital, any interventions for neurodevelopmental problems, diagnosis of cerebral palsy, any other neurological abnormality.\n\n【39】For the purpose of sensitivity analysis, effect estimates were computed using best and worst case imputation scenarios. Furthermore, effect estimates and CIs based on inverse probability of censoring weighting were reported.\n\n【40】Risk ratios with 95% CIs were reported for the proportion of individuals that fell below one and two SDs of the composite cognitive score. Risk ratios were generated using generalised linear models for a binomial distributed response variable using a log link (binomial log-linear regression). These analyses were not prespecified in the study protocol (post-hoc analyses). All analyses were done in Stata (version 13).\n\n【41】删除1-2:<u>删除8:<u>This trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12606000441516, ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00756600, and the UK Clinical Research Network (UKCRN), number 12437565.</u></u>\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【42】The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

Of those lost to follow-up, some reason for non-attendance was gained in 19 and in only one case was non-attendance due to developmental delay (this child was in the awake-regional arm). Of those that attended for assessment, the cognitive scale of the Bayley-III was completed by 292 in the awake-regional group and 295 in the general anaesthesia group 删除2:<u>( figure )</u>. Very few children were unable to complete the Bayley-III due to developmental delay or other recognised reason for cognitive impairment. In 97% of cases the psychologist and paediatrician were unaware of group allocation at the time of assessment 删除2:<u>( appendix p5 )</u>.\n\n【55】Table 3 shows the Bayley-III cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behaviour scores, and the MacArthur-Bates data for each group. For the cognitive composite score, we noted evidence for equivalence in means between the awake-regional anaesthesia and general anaesthesia groups in both the as-per-protocol and the intention-to-treat analyses using multiple imputation to account for missing outcome data (awake-regional minus general anaesthesia: 0·169, 95% CI −2·30 to 2·64 for the as-per-protocol analysis and 0·256, −2·06 to 2·57 for the intention-to-treat analysis). These results were consistent with the findings of the complete case analyses (awake-regional minus general anaesthesia 0·458, 95% CI −2·02 to 2·94 for the as-per-protocol analysis and 0·430, −1·90 to 2·76 for the intention-to-treat analysis). There was also evidence for equivalence between groups in the composite motor scores, composite language scores, and the composite adaptive behaviour scores 删除2:<u>( table 4 )</u>. The results were consistent in both as-per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, and when using complete case and multiple imputation. With mean differences of one and two score points (multiple imputation and complete case analysis for as per protocol and intention to treat) and upper 95% confidence interval limits exceeding the prespecified five point equivalence margin, evidence for equivalence with regard to the social-emotional composite scale of the Bayley-III was not compelling.

Equivalence was shown in many domains of neurodevelopmental assessment and the 95% CIs fell within a third of an SD, well inside our predefined boundaries of clinical equivalence.\n\n【71】There are no previous randomised trials assessing the effect of anaesthesia in infancy on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Previous cohort studies have found mixed results. Some studies have found an association between exposure to anaesthesia in early childhood and increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Although this association fits with preclinical animal data, it could also be explained by the confounding effects of surgery, pathology, or comorbidity. Conversely, some cohort studies have found no evidence for an association. These studies have limited ability to rule out a link between anaesthesia and neurodevelopmental outcome because of a reliance on outcome measures, such as school grade, which might not detect subtle effects, or because their broad inclusion criteria include children exposed to anaesthesia at an older age when the risk might be less. The heterogeneity of the cohort studies also makes it difficult to analyse the effects of duration of exposure, type of anaesthetic drugs used, or doses or combination of drugs used. The above limitations inherently limit the capacity for cohort studies to establish the link between exposure to anaesthesia and neurodevelopmental outcome. These limitations highlight the importance of methodologically robust and adequately powered trials such as this one.\n\n【72】In this analysis we chose the cognitive scale of the Bayley-III as the main outcome of interest. Changes recorded in preclinical studies tend to be diffusely distributed over several brain regions. Such diffuse changes are most likely to have an effect on general cognition.\n\n【73】The results of two recent studies have shown that whereas children exposed to anaesthesia had similar school grades, those exposed had an increased risk of not sitting the tests. This finding raises the possibility that a subpopulation of exposed children might have significant neurodevelopmental delay. To investigate this possibility, we compared the proportion of children in each group that scored two SDs below the age mean on the composite cognitive score. We noted no difference; however, in view of the limited power of this analysis, equivalence cannot be assumed. We have also reported the number of children with the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, cerebral palsy, and visual or hearing defects. This trial was not powered to detect differences in these diagnoses or events, and as expected we noted a low event rate in both groups. At 2 years of age it is difficult to accurately diagnose the presence of disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, or to accurately assess vision and hearing, and some children could still have undiagnosed neurological or neurobehavioural disorders.\n\n【74】Data from most preclinical studies suggest that prolonged exposure to general anaesthesia is necessary before injury is seen (usually at 2 or 3 h). However, changes have been noted with 1 h of exposure. In this trial, the median sevoflurane exposure was 54 min in the general anaesthesia group and hence the results are consistent with most preclinical data. The trial is an important adjunct to these data because translating doses and exposures from animals to human beings is uncertain, and shorter duration of exposure could still have clinically relevant effects that cannot be detected in animal models.\n\n【75】In human cohorts, some researchers have found an association with a single short exposure, whereas others have only found an association after longer or several exposures. There was no increase in learning disabilities in infants and toddlers exposed to 2 h or less of general anaesthesia in one study; anaesthetic exposure was less than 90 min in 365 (61%) of 593 exposed patients. This finding highlights that most anaesthetics in young children are of fairly brief duration. An internal audit of anaesthetic duration in infants at Boston Children's Hospital showed that 53% of anaesthetics done in babies younger than 12 months of age were less than 2 h in duration. Thus, with regards to duration of exposure, our results are probably relevant to roughly half the anaesthetics given to infants.\n\n【76】The finding of equivalence after short exposure does not rule out the possibility that longer exposure to anaesthetics might have an effect on neurodevelopment. Further trials are needed before any assumptions can be made about the effect of prolonged anaesthesia exposure in infancy. Results of some studies have also shown a stronger association between several anaesthesia exposures and adverse outcome than with a single exposure. This situation might be the result of a greater effect of confounding; inevitably, children who undergo many procedures are more likely to have chronic disease. Our trial cannot address the possible increased toxic effects with multiple exposures.\n\n【77】Our trial has several limitations. Awake-regional anaesthesia inevitably has a failure rate. As this was an equivalence trial, we took the as-per-protocol analysis to be the most conservative analysis, assuming that treatment failure would bias toward no difference. In view of the possibly contentious nature of this assumption, we planned a priori to undertake a secondary intention-to-treat analysis. We noted no measureable differences between the as-per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses, implying no bias was introduced by treatment failure. In this study there was a loss to follow-up of almost 14%. This, along with awake-regional anaesthesia failure, led to an appreciable amount of missing data; however, both the multiple imputation analysis and the inverse probability weighting showed consistent robustness of the findings.\n\n【78】Another limitation is that although the Bayley-III is a well validated assessment method of current development, early neurobehavioural assessment of children is not a perfect predictor of long-term outcome because of the substantial variability in developmental timing in young children. Although Bayley-III has a stronger correlation with intelligence quotient at age 5 years than earlier versions of the test, it was not designed to assess a broad range of cognitive functions. Cognitive skills emerge and differentiate over childhood and a more detailed neuropsychological assessment is needed at a later date to identify mild or circumscribed deficits in cognitive functions such as executive skills and memory. Therefore, it is important that the children be reassessed later in their development to confirm the results and to more thoroughly assess multiple domains of cognition. Children in this trial are undergoing assessment at 5 years of age and the results should be known after 2018.\n\n【79】It is important to note that this study reports the results of a secondary outcome. This analysis of the secondary outcome was prespecified in the study protocol; however, the study was not specifically powered for the secondary outcome and thus it should be interpreted with caution and not regarded as definitive. The analysis of the secondary outcome was planned because of the recognition that there was growing concern over the issue of neurotoxicity and existing evidence to guide practice was inherently limited, and although the 2-year assessment was not definitive, it would still provide higher quality evidence than that which existed up to now. The 2-year assessment was also planned because of concerns over the feasibility of maintaining the cohort for the longer-term follow-up.\n\n【80】In this study, more than 80% of participants were male. It is well recognised that sex can have an effect on recovery from brain injury. The effect is variable and depends on the nature of the injury and outcome measured, although generally greater effects are recorded in males and indeed the neurotoxic effect of anaesthesia on rodents has been shown to be greater in males. Thus, the finding of equivalence in our trial with a preponderance of males makes it unlikely that equivalence would not also be shown in females.\n\n【81】In this trial, sevoflurane was used without other general anaesthetics. We chose a sevoflurane-only anaesthetic because this reflects common practice for anaesthesia for inguinal herniorrhaphy, and the preclinical effects of sevoflurane have been clearly described. Some preclinical data have suggested that combinations of general anaesthetics might be more injurious, and thus our trial cannot shed light on the possibility that an effect might be seen if other agents are added. Finally, the MacArthur-Bates score is dependent on parental report and hence might be open to bias. Additionally, the standardisation data are of varying degrees of validation across different languages.\n\n【82】In conclusion, this trial found strong evidence that exposure of just less than 1 h to a sevoflurane general anaesthesia in infancy does not increase the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcome at 2 years of age. Although not definitive, this is the strongest clinical evidence to date that sevoflurane general anaesthesia in infancy does not result in substantial neurotoxicity.\n\n【83】删除1-1:<u>For the **protocol** see http://www.thelancet.com/protocol-reviews/09PRT-9078</u>\n删除4:<u>\n**This online publication has been corrected.

We said no. The occupied Palestinian territory seemed too difficult a subject to cover from a position of complete ignorance. Derek proposed a meeting with the public health scientist, Rita Giacaman. I can't easily put into words the impact this meeting had on me. Rita, who cofounded the Institute of Community and Public Health at Birzeit University, introduced _The Lancet_ to Palestinian health, culture, and history. In Bethlehem in 2007, Rita began to design what became the 2009 _Lancet_ Series, “Health in the Occupied Palestinian Territory”. We promised that we would return every year to support young Palestinian health scientists. That collaboration led to a new partnership with the charity, Medical Aid for Palestinians—a partnership that we have called _The Lancet_ Palestinian Health Alliance. Together, we set about planning annual scientific conferences and writing workshops to build skills for doing and reporting rigorous research. In 2010, we published 17 research abstracts; in 2011, 13 abstracts; in 2012, 32 abstracts; and this year, 36 abstracts. What does this experience tell us? There are now many productive Palestinian research groups across the occupied territory and among the Palestinian diaspora. These groups are increasingly working together. These collaborations extend globally, embracing researchers in the USA, UK, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, France, and Belgium. The best work we have published includes a strong focus on public health. This year we publish research that documents the impact of poverty and insecurity on the health of adults and children, and analyses the performance of the Palestinian health system. But we are now increasingly seeing the growth of clinical research, examining the quality and coverage of health services, and testing treatments in randomised trials. The work we are doing is not universally welcomed. One correspondent, whom we publish this week, writes that, “For many years _The Lancet_ has advocated on behalf of the Palestinians, sometimes justifiably, but often unjustifiably. On several occasions, I have protested against a distinguished medical journal advocating political issues—only tangentially medical.” It is important to ask, therefore, how Palestinians have benefited from the research activity we have encouraged.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【1】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【2】Already registered?\n\n【3】Log in to existing account\n\n【4】Forgot password?\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Not yet registered?\n\n【8】Register for free\n\n【9】Article info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 14 December 2013\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62628-8</u>\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the past 2 years, our telehealth research group has been building the expertise required to work with remote eye care.\n\n【1】TeleOftalmo is a teleophthalmology strategy that offers comprehensive eye examinations to patients in the Brazilian public health system, as part of a large telehealth initiative in the country. Ophthalmologists using TeleOftalmo deliver eye care through real-time virtual encounters.\n\n【2】As we launch the project, new knowledge and competencies are being incorporated, refining the skillset of our virtualists. This is because propaedeutics of telemedical encounters are diverging from the conventional in-person examination. One example of this diversion is in the detection of cataracts. Usually, this is a straightforward diagnosis, with direct visualisation of the lens using a slit lamp; however, this diagnosis becomes challenging when eye tests are done using telemedicine. Eye-care specialists might resort to astute ways of quantifying lens density, such as taking photographs of the anterior part of the eye with a retinal camera, or measuring the amount of light that scatters through the lens. Either way, these alternative tests are not common in the traditional ophthalmologist eye examinations.\n\n【3】Our expectation is that novel, validated methods will have a central role in remote diagnostics of eye conditions. The virtualist, as a medical specialist, will be required not only to interact with patients through telecommunication technologies, but also to master the application and interpretation of examinations specifically designed for telemedical approaches.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2020 MCS/Science Photo Library</u>\n\n【4】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:39:40", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:40:12", "cost": 31.747}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:52", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:40:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:39:40"}

Owing to understandable limitations, the research only assessed leisure-time physical activity (LTPA); however, Wen and colleagues expand their discussion beyond this type of activity to say “of the four domains of physical activity (work, transportation, household, and LTPA)…LTPA is the most related with health benefits. Furthermore, only LTPA is effort-related and promotable.”\n\n【1】Without wanting to detract from the key findings of this paper, we disagree with this interpretation. Transportation-related physical activity provides the opportunity for regular activity. For example, transit-users have been noted to spend a median of 19 min daily walking to and from transit. Furthermore, transportation physical activity is promotable through changing the built environment so that, for example, walking and cycling to daily destinations could become not only safe but pleasant, and physical activity becomes incorporated into daily life. Although the evidence on the relative benefits of exercise in the different domains is mixed, we argue that transportation-related physical activity is the most appropriate for population-wide interventions.\n\n【2】An urban environment amenable to regular transport by foot or bicycle would be an environment contributing less pollution and lower greenhouse-gas emissions, with fewer road injuries and deaths and lower obesity rates. All of these benefits justify continued efforts to seek practical ways to make changes in the built environment to enhance population levels of purposeful physical activity, and thus to increase the numbers who achieve the health benefits of physical activity reported in this paper.\n\n【3】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:26:40", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:26:47", "cost": 7.361}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:52", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:26:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:26:37"}

There are few national statistics on the development of young children in developing countries. We therefore identified two factors with available worldwide data—the prevalence of early childhood stunting and the number of people living in absolute poverty—to use as indicators of poor development. We show that both indicators are closely associated with poor cognitive and educational performance in children and use them to estimate that over 200 million children under 5 years are not fulfilling their developmental potential. Most of these children live in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. These disadvantaged children are likely to do poorly in school and subsequently have low incomes, high fertility, and provide poor care for their children, thus contributing to the intergenerational transmission of poverty.\n\n【2】\\*Lead authors\n\n【3】†Steering group listed at end of the paper\n\n【4】This is the first in a **Series** of three articles about child development in developing countries\n\n【5】Introduction\n------------\n\n【6】A previous _Lancet_ series focused attention on the more than 6 million preventable child deaths every year in developing countries. Unfortunately, death is the tip of the iceberg. We have made a conservative estimate that more than 200 million children under 5 years fail to reach their potential in cognitive development because of poverty, poor health and nutrition, and deficient care. Children's development consists of several interdependent domains, including sensory-motor, cognitive, and social-emotional, all of which are likely to be affected. However, we focus on cognitive development because of the paucity of data from developing countries on other domains of young children's development. The discrepancy between their current developmental levels and what they would have achieved in a more nurturing environment with adequate stimulation and nutrition indicates the degree of loss of potential. In later childhood these children will subsequently have poor levels of cognition and education, both of which are linked to later earnings. Furthermore, improved parental education, particularly of mothers, is related to reduced fertility, and improved child survival, health, nutrition, cognition, and education. Thus the failure of children to fulfil their developmental potential and achieve satisfactory educational levels plays an important part in the intergenerational transmission of poverty. In countries with a large proportion of such children, national development is likely to be affected.\n\n【7】The first UN Millennium Development Goal is to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, and the second is to ensure that all children complete primary schooling. Improving early child development is clearly an important step to reaching these goals. Although policymakers recognise that poverty and malnutrition are related to poor health and increased mortality, there is less recognition of their effect on children's development or of the value of early intervention. This paper is the first of a three part series reviewing the problem of loss of developmental potential in young children in developing countries. The first paper describes the size of the issue, the second paper discusses the proximal causes of the loss, and the final paper reviews existing interventions. Here, we first examine why early child development is important and then develop a method to estimate the numbers of children who fail to fulfil their developmental potential. We then estimate the loss of income attributed to poor child development.\n\n【8】Why early child development is important\n----------------------------------------\n\n【9】Children's development is affected by psychosocial and biological factors and by genetic inheritance. Poverty and its attendant problems are major risk factors. The first few years of life are particularly important because vital development occurs in all domains. The brain develops rapidly through neurogenesis, axonal and dendritic growth, synaptogenesis, cell death, synaptic pruning, myelination, and gliogenesis. These ontogenetic events happen at different times 删除2:<u>( figure 1 )</u> and build on each other, such that small perturbations in these processes can have long-term effects on the brain's structural and functional capacity.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Human brain development</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【10】Reproduced with permission of authors and American Psychological Association\n\n【11】删除12:<u>(Thompson RA, Nelson CA.

Animal research shows that early undernutrition, iron-deficiency, environmental toxins, stress, and poor stimulation and social interaction can affect brain structure and function, and have lasting cognitive and emotional effects. \n\n【13】In humans and animals, variations in the quality of maternal care can produce lasting changes in stress reactivity, anxiety, and memory function in the offspring,\n\n【14】Despite the vulnerability of the brain to early insults, remarkable recovery is often possible with interventions, and generally the earlier the interventions the greater the benefit.\n\n【15】Early cognitive development predicts schooling\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【16】Early cognitive and social-emotional development are strong determinants of school progress in developed countries. A search of databases for longitudinal studies in developing countries that linked early child development and later educational progress identified two studies. In Guatemala, preschool cognitive ability predicted children's enrolment in secondary school and achievement scores in adolescence. In South Africa, cognitive ability and achievement at the end of grade one predicted later school progress. Three further studies had appropriate data that we analysed (from the Philippines and Jamaica ) or requested the investigators to analyse (from Brazil ). In each case, multiple regression of educational outcome (or logistic regression for dichotomous variables), controlling for a wealth index, maternal education, and child's sex and age, showed that early cognitive development predicted later school outcomes. Table 1 shows that each SD increase in early intelligence or developmental quotient was associated with substantially improved school outcomes. Further evidence of the importance of early childhood is that interventions at this age can have sustained cognitive and school achievement benefits 删除2:<u>( table 1 )</u>.\n\n【17】Table 1 Change in later school outcomes per SD increase in intelligence quotient (IQ) or developmental quotient (DQ) in early life\n\n|  | **N** | **Independent variable** | **Outcome variable** | **Measure of effect** | **Estimate** | **95% CI** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Jamaica | 165 | IQ on the Stanford Binet test (42) at 7 years | Dropped out before grade 11 | Odds ratio | 0·53 | 0·32–0·87 |\n|  |  |  | Reading and arithmetic score at age 17 | Mean difference in SD | 0·65 | 0·53–0·78 |\n| Philippines | 1134 | Cognitive Score at 8 years | Ever repeat a grade by age 14 years | Odds ratio | 0·60 | 0·49–0·75 |\n| Brazil | 152 | DQ on Griffiths test (43) at 4.5 years | Grades attained by age 18 years | Mean difference in grades achieved | 0·71 | 0·34–1·07 |\n\n【19】\\* Adjusted for sex, age, mother's education, and wealth quintile.\n\n【20】† Sample consisted of stunted (<−2 SD) children participating in an intervention trial and a non-stunted (>−1 SD) comparison group.

Failure to complete primary education (Millennium Development Goal 2) gives some indication of the extent of the issue, although school and family characteristics also play a part. In developing countries, an estimated 99 million children of primary-school age are not enrolled, and of those enrolled, only 78% complete primary school. Most children who fail to complete are from sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Only around half of the children enrol in secondary schools. Furthermore, children in some developing countries have much lower achievement levels than children in developed countries in the same grade. In 12 African countries, surveys of grade 6 (end of primary school) children showed that on average 57% had not achieved minimum reading levels ( webtable ). \n\n【28】Indicators of poor development\n------------------------------\n\n【29】In the following section we estimate the numbers of children who fail to reach their developmental potential. We first identify early childhood growth retardation (length-for-age less than −2 SD according to the National Center for Health Statistics growth reference \\[moderate or severe stunting\\]) and absolute poverty as possible indicators for poor development. We then show that they are good predictors of poor school achievement and cognition. Finally, we use these indicators to estimate the number of children involved. We identified stunting and poverty for indicators because they represent multiple biological and psychosocial risks, respectively, stunting and to a lesser extent poverty are consistently defined across countries, both are relevant to most developing countries, and worldwide data are available. We omit other risk factors that could affect children's development because they fail to fit all the above criteria and there is marked overlap between them and with stunting and poverty. However, by using only two risk factors we recognise that our estimate is conservative.\n\n【30】### Assessment of stunting, poverty, and child development\n\n【31】Growth potential in preschool children is similar across countries, and stunting in early childhood is caused by poor nutrition and infection rather than by genetic differences. Patterns of growth retardation are also similar across countries. Faltering begins in utero or soon after birth, is pronounced in the first 12–18 months, and could continue to around 40 months, after which it levels off. Some catch-up might take place, but most stunted children remain stunted through to adulthood.\n\n【32】There are multiple approaches to measuring poverty. One assessment used measures of deprivation of basic needs, availability of services, and infrastructure, and surveys in 45 developing countries reported that 37 % of children lived in absolute poverty, more so in rural areas. We use the percentage of people having an income of less than US$1 per day, adjusted for purchasing power parity by country because this information is available for the largest number of countries. This indicator is considered the best available despite excluding important components of poverty, and is more conservative than measures based on deprivation since it identifies only the very poorest families.\n\n【33】Poverty is associated with inadequate food, and poor sanitation and hygiene that lead to increased infections and stunting in children. Poverty is also associated with poor maternal education, increased maternal stress and depression, and inadequate stimulation in the home. All these factors detrimentally affect child development 删除2:<u>( figure 2 )</u>. Poor development on enrolment leads to poor school achievement, which is further exacerbated by inadequate schools and poor family support (due to economic stress, and little knowledge and appreciation of the benefits of education).\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 Hypothesised relations between poverty, stunting, child development, and school achievement</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【34】Risk factors related to poverty frequently occur together, and the developmental deficit increases with the number of risk factors. Deficits in development are often seen in infancy and increase with age. For example, a cross sectional study in Ecuador reported that the language deficit in poor children increased from 36 to 72 months of age compared with wealthier children 删除2:<u>( figure 3 )</u>.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 3 Vocabulary scores of Ecuadorian children aged 36 to 72 months by wealth quartiles</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【35】TVIP=Test de Vacabulario en Imagenes Peabody.

Stunting prevalence was based on the WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition, and absolute poverty prevalence came from UNICEF. In 79 countries with information on stunting and education, the average prevalence of stunting was 26·0%. For every 10% increase in stunting (less than −2 SD), the proportion of children reaching the final grade of primary school dropped by 7·9% (b=−0·79, 95% CI −1·03 to −0·55, R 2 \\=36·2%, p<0·0001). In 64 countries with information on absolute poverty, the average prevalence was 20%; for every 10% increase in the prevalence of poverty there was a decrease of 6·4% (b=−0·64, 95% CI=−0·81 to −0·46, R 2 \\=46·3%, p<0·0001) of children entering the final grade of primary school **.**\n\n【37】To establish whether stunting and absolute poverty were useful predictors of poor child development in individual studies, we searched the published papers and identified all observational studies that related stunting and poverty in early childhood to concurrent or later child development or educational outcomes. We also identified all studies that related stunting at school age to cognition or education, based on the assumption that stunting developed in early childhood. We selectively reviewed studies of older children that linked economic status to school achievement or cognition, choosing examples with international or nationally representative samples. We assessed whether measurements of the risk factors and developmental outcome were clearly reported, and the relation between them (adjusted or unadjusted) was examined. We did not assess causality.\n\n【38】Stunting and poor development\n-----------------------------\n\n【39】### Cross-sectional studies\n\n【40】Many cross-sectional studies of high-risk children have noted associations between concurrent stunting and poor school progress or cognitive ability. Stunted children, compared with non-stunted children, were less likely to be enrolled in school (Tanzania ), more likely to enrol late (eg, Nepal, and Ghana and Tanzania ), to attain lower achievement levels or grades for their age (Nepal, China, Jamaica, India, Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brazil, Turkey, Guatemala \\[only in boys\\] ), and have poorer cognitive ability or achievement scores (Kenya, Guatemala, Indonesia, Ethiopia, Peru, India, and Vietnam, and Chile ). Only three studies reported no significant relation between stunting and poor school progress. In the Philippines, associations were recorded with weight-for-height, and in Ghana stunted children enrolled in school late but taller children left school early to earn money or help with family farming.\n\n【41】There are fewer studies with younger children. In Guatemala, Jamaica, Chile, and Kenya, associations between height and child development measures were reported. Age of walking was related to height-for-age in Zanzibarian and Nepalese children, but height was not related to motor development in Kenyans at 6 months of age. Weight-for-age, which indicates a combination of weight-for-height and height-for-age, has often been used instead of stunting to measure nutrition in young children. Weight-for-age was associated with child development in India, Ethiopia, and Bangladesh. \n\n【42】### Longitudinal studies\n\n【43】In Pakistan and Guatemala, growth retardation in infancy predicted age of walking. Excluding studies of children hospitalised for severe malnutrition, four published longitudinal studies showed that early stunting predicted later cognition, school progress, or both. Stunting at 24 months was related to cognition at 9 years in Peru and, in the Philippines to intelligent quotient (IQ) at 8 and 11 years, age at enrolment in school, grade repetition, and dropout from school. In Jamaica, stunting before 24 months was related to cognition and school achievement at 17–18 years and dropout from school. In Guatemala, height at 36 months was related to cognition, literacy, numeracy, and general knowledge in late adolescence, and stunting at 72 months was related to cognition between 25–42 years. In Indonesia, weight-for-age at 1 year of age did not predict scores on a cognitive test at 7 years, whereas growth in weight between 1 and 7 years did.\n\n【44】To assess the size of the deficit in later function associated with a loss of 1 SD in height in early childhood, we reanalysed the data from Philippines, Jamaica, Peru, and Indonesia (Guatemala had too few well-nourished children to be included). We added two other longitudinal studies, from Brazil and South Africa, that had not previously analysed the effect of stunting 删除2:<u>( table 2 )</u>. In these studies, stunting between 12 and 36 months was related to later measures of cognition or grade attainment. Being moderately or severely stunted compared with not stunted (height-for-age greater than −1 SD) was associated with scores for cognition in every study, and the effect size varied from 0·4 to 1·05 SD. Stunting was also associated with attained grades. The consistent relation between early childhood stunting and poor child development, with moderate to large effects, justifies its use as an indicator of poor development.\n\n【45】Table 2 Descriptive summary of follow-up studies showing associations between stunting in early childhood and later scores on cognitive tests and school outcomes\n\n|  | **Philippines** | **South Africa** | **Indonesia** | **Brazil** | **Peru** | **Jamaica** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Cognitive score (8 years, n=2489) | Ravens Matrices (7 years, n=603) | Reasoning and arithmetic (9 years, n=368) | Attained grades (18 years, n=2041) | WISC IQ (9 years, n=72) | WAIS IQ (17–18 years, n=165) | Reading and arithmetic (17–18 years) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Not stunted | 56·4 | 0·17 | 11·2 | 8·1 | 92·3 | 0·38 | 0·40 |\n| Mildly stunted | 53·8 (−0·21) | 0·05 (−0·12) | 10·3 (−0·26) | 7·2 (−0·4) | 89·8 (−0·20) |  |  |\n| Moderately or severely stunted | 49·6 (−0·54) | −0·23 (−0·40) | 9·7 (−0·43) | 6·5 (−0·7) | 79·2 (−1·05) | −0·55 (−0·93) | −0·60 (−1·00) |\n\n【47】Data are mean (effect size as unadjusted difference from non-stunted children in _z_ scores).\n\n【48】\\* Males only.\n\n【49】† The sample comprised stunted (<−2 SD) children participating in an intervention trial and a non-stunted (>−1 SD) comparison group.\n\n【50】‡ SD scores.

Gaps in mean attained grades between the richest and poorest children were particularly large in western and central Africa and south Asia, reaching as high as ten grades in India. In Zambia, poor children were four times more likely to start school late than the richest children, and in Uganda the difference was ten times. Representative surveys in 16 Latin American countries also reported that family income predicted the probability of completing secondary schooling. Rural children were worse off in most studies.\n\n【54】There are fewer studies on wealth and development in preschool children. In 3668 Indian children under 6 years, paternal occupation was associated with developmental milestones. In Ecuador, wealth was related to vocabulary scores of children from 3 to 6 years of age. In Jamaica, 71·4% of 3887 children from more affluent families entering fee-paying preparatory schools had mastery of all four school-readiness subjects tested, compared with 42·7% of 22 241 children entering free government primary schools. An association between poverty and child development was recorded at as early as 6 months of age in Egypt, 12 months in Brazil, 10 months in India, and 18 months in Bangladesh. In another Brazilian study, preschool children's language scores were associated with maternal working but not income.\n\n【55】### Longitudinal studies\n\n【56】Several longitudinal studies have assessed the association between wealth at birth and later educational and cognitive attainment. Socioeconomic status in infancy was associated with children's cognition at 5 years of age in Kenya. In Brazil, parental income at birth was associated with poor performance on a developmental screening test at 12 months in 1400 infants, and with school grades attained at 18 years in 2222 men on army enlistment. In Guatemala, socioeconomic status at birth was associated with school attainment and cognition in 1469 adults. We analysed data from three other longitudinal studies 删除2:<u>( table 3 )</u>. Wealth quintiles at birth were related to IQ at 8 years in the Philippines, and to cognitive scores at 7 years in South Africa and 9 years in Indonesia. The effect size in all these studies was substantial, ranging from 0·70 to 1·24 SD scores between the top and bottom quintiles in children from varied socioeconomic backgrounds, and from 0·45 to 0·53 SD scores in Guatemala where all study children were poor. We had to use wealth quintiles rather than the cutoff of US$1 per day because of limitations in the data. Poor children consistently had considerable developmental deficits compared with more affluent children. Thus poverty can be used as an indicator of poor development.\n\n【57】Table 3 Descriptive summary of follow-up studies showing association between wealth quintiles in early childhood, and later cognitive and school outcomes\n\n|  | **Philippines** | **Indonesia** | **South Africa** | **Brazil** | **Guatemala** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Cognitive score (8 years of age at assessment, n=2485) | Reasoning and arithmetic (9 years of age at assessment, n=371) | Ravens progressive matrices (7 years of age at assessment, n=1143) | Attained grades (18 years of age at assessment, n=2222) | **Reading and vocabulary (26–41 years of age at assessment)** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  | Boys (n=683) | Girls (n=786) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fifth quintile (wealthiest) | 56·9 | 12·1 | 0·47 | 9·3 | 50·9 | 44·8 |\n| Fourth quintile | 52·5 (−0·35) | 11·0 (−0·31) | 0·13 (−0·34) | 8·2 (−0·48) |  |  |\n| Third quintile | 51·6 (−0·42) | 11·0 (−0·31) | −0·16 (−0·63) | 7·4 (−0·84) | 43·3 (−0·45) | 43·6 (−0·01) |\n| Second quintile | 49·4 (−0·60) | 9·5 (−0·74) | −0·20 (−0·67) | 6·8 (−1·11) |  |  |\n| First quintile (poorest) | 46·4 (−0·84) | 8·4 (−1·06) | −0·23 (−0·70) | 6·5 (−1·24) | 41·0 (−0·53) | 37·6 (−0·45) |\n\n【59】Data are mean (effect size as unadjusted difference from the richest quintile in z scores).\n\n【60】\\* Tertiles.\n\n【61】† SD scores.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【62】Estimate of number of children who are stunted or living in poverty\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【63】We estimated the prevalence of children under 5 years who are stunted or living in absolute poverty in developing countries. Data for the number of children in 2004 and percent living in poverty were obtained from UNICEF and data for stunting obtained from WHO. Of the 156 countries analysed, 126 have a known stunting prevalence and 88 have a known proportion living in absolute poverty 删除2:<u>( table 4 )</u>. We replaced missing country values of stunting and poverty with the average prevalence of the region for the purpose of estimating the proportion and number of disadvantaged children. Sensitivity analysis based on imputing stunting by poverty and imputing poverty by stunting through regression analysis gave similar results to using the regional average ( webappendix ). The most recent poverty data we obtained was up to year 2003, with median 2000 and inter-quartile range of 4 years. The most recent stunting data were up to year 2004, with median 2000 and inter-quartile range of 3 years. We extrapolated all the stunting and poverty data to the year 2004 删除2:<u>( table 4 )</u>. \n\n【64】Table 4 Prevalence and number (in millions) of disadvantaged children under 5 years by region in 2004\n\n|  | **Population younger than 5 years** | **Percentage living in poverty** | **Number living in poverty** | **Percentage stunted** | **Number** | **Percentage stunted, living in poverty or both** | **Number stunted, living in poverty or both** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa | 117·0 | 46% | 54·3 | 37% | 43·7 | 61% | 70·9 |\n| Middle east and north Africa | 44·1 | 4% | 1·6 | 21% | 9·1 | 22% | 9·9 |\n| South Asia | 169·3 | 27% | 46·3 | 39% | 65·6 | 52% | 88·8 |\n| East Asia and Pacific | 145·7 | 11% | 16·6 | 17% | 25·2 | 23% | 33·6 |\n| Latin America and the Caribbean | 56·5 | 10% | 5·9 | 14% | 7·9 | 19% | 10·8 |\n| Central and eastern Europe | 26·4 | 4% | 1·0 | 16% | 4·2 | 18% | 4·7 |\n| Developing countries | 559·1 | 22% | 125·6 | 28% | 155·7 | 39% | 218·7 |\n\n【66】\\* Population and poverty source data from UNICEF State of the World's Children, 2006.\n\n【67】† Where data missing, regional averages were used for percentage living in poverty and percentage stunted.\n\n【68】‡ We extrapolated poverty figures to 2004 based on findings from Chen and Ravallion that, in the 1990s and early 2000s, decline in absolute poverty (less than US$1 per day) was stagnant in all developing regions except east Asia and south Asia. In east Asia, the decline was levelling off and could be captured accurately by a non-linear regression equation (R 2 \\=93%); in south Asia the decline could be accurately captured by a linear equation (R 2 \\=99%). We used their equations to estimate the expected poverty figures for east Asia and Pacific and south Asia for each country in these regions in the latest years with available poverty data, and then calculated the difference between the expected and observed figures for each country. We added this country-level difference to the regional figure in 2004 projected by Chen and Ravallion's equations to obtain the projected poverty level in 2004 for each country. We used the observed poverty figures as the 2004 estimates for other developing countries. We projected stunting figures for every country except those in the central and eastern Europe region to 2004 based on sub-regional linear trends estimated by de Onis, et al. de Onis, et al, did not include the central and eastern Europe region in their analysis. Poverty reduction was stagnant in the 1990s and early 2000s in central and eastern Europe. We therefore assume that for countries in this region there has been no change in stunting prevalence in the period concerned.\n\n【69】§ Stunting source data taken from WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition.\n\n【70】¶ Based on estimate that prevalence of stunting among children in poverty is 50%.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【71】There are 559 million children under 5 years in developing countries, 156 million of whom are stunted and 126 million are living in absolute poverty 删除2:<u>( table 4 )</u>. To avoid the double-counting of children who are both stunted and living in poverty, we estimated the prevalence of stunting among children in poverty in countries with both indicators available, and calculated the numbers of stunted children plus the number of non-stunted children living in poverty. We refer to these children as disadvantaged.\n\n【72】The relation between prevalence of stunting and poverty at the country level is non-linear and can be captured by a regression line of percentage stunted=7·8+4·2×√%poverty (using the 82 countries with available data; R =40·9%). Extrapolation of this regression line gives an estimate of the prevalence of stunting in people living in poverty to be 50%. Hence, the number of children stunted or living in poverty is the sum of the total number of stunted children (156 million) plus 50% of children living in poverty (63 million) making a total of 219 million disadvantaged children, or 39% of all children under 5 in developing countries.\n\n【73】An alternative estimate of the prevalence of stunting in children in poverty was obtained by analysis of micro-level data from 13 Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in developing countries with data for both stunting and a wealth index. A meta-analysis of the datasets showed that 43% of children below the poverty line were stunted. Based on this estimate, the total number of disadvantaged children is 227 million. Although the estimate of 219 million is inevitably crude, it is more conservative than the alternative estimate of 227 million; we use the lower estimate in the rest of the paper.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 4 shows the numbers of disadvantaged children in millions by region.

However, limitations in the data suggest that the estimate is conservative. We assumed that the percentage of people in absolute poverty was equal to the percentage of children in absolute poverty. This assumption probably underestimates the number of children because poverty is associated with higher fertility levels and larger household size. Furthermore, less than US$1 per day is an extreme measure of poverty, and children in slightly better off households are probably also at risk. Also, we did not take into account many other risk factors for poor development, such as maternal illiteracy, unstimulating homes, and micronutrient deficiencies.\n\n【77】WHO recently produced new growth standards, and the −2 SD curves for length and height-for-age are slightly higher than the −2SD curves of the previous standards in certain age ranges under 60 months. Therefore, if we used the new growth standards our estimate of prevalence of stunting and disadvantaged children would be slightly higher.\n\n【78】The precision of the estimate of disadvantaged children would be improved with internationally comparable data for maternal education and stimulation in the home. We also need data to establish which cutoff for income and poverty is best for identifying children at high risk. Internationally comparable and feasible measures of child development would produce the best estimate of disadvantaged children, and there is an urgent need to develop such measures both to more accurately assess the problem and to assess interventions.\n\n【79】Some of the disadvantaged children would have IQs of less than −2 SD, the level used to diagnose mild mental retardation (IQ 50–69). However, a deficit in adaptive behaviour is usually needed to make the diagnosis and these data are not available, although most would have learning problems in school and restricted employment opportunities. We are concerned in this series about the loss of potential across the whole range of cognitive ability.\n\n【80】Economic implications of poor child development\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【81】Disadvantaged children in developing countries who do not reach their developmental potential are less likely to be productive adults. Two pathways reduce their productivity: fewer years of schooling, and less learning per year in school. What is the economic cost of one less year of schooling? Studies from 51 countries show that, on average, each year of schooling increases wages by 9·7%. Although some of the studies had methodological weaknesses, this average matches another more rigorous study, which reported that each year of schooling in Indonesia increased wages by 7–11%.\n\n【82】Both stunting and poverty are associated with reduced years of schooling. Table 5 presents data for school grades attained in 18-year-old Brazilian men, by income quintile at birth and stunting status in the first 2 years. We estimate from these data that the deficit attributed to being stunted (height-for-age less than −2 z scores compared with non-stunted greater than −1 z scores), stratified for income quintiles was 0·91 grades, and the deficit from living in poverty (first _vs_ third quintile of income) stratified for stunting status was 0·71 grades. Furthermore, the deficit from being both stunted and in poverty (first income quintile) compared with being non-stunted and in the third income quintile was 2·15 grades.\n\n【83】Table 5 Attained grades in 18-year-old Brazilian men, by income level, and stunting status in early childhood\n\n|  | **Income quintile** |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Poorest 20% | 2nd quintile | 3rd quintile | 4th quintile | Wealthiest 20% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| HAZ ≥ −1 | 6·96 (2·11) | 7·10 (2·17) | 7·69 (2·05) | 8·43 (1·89) | 9·40 (1·83) |\n| n | 141 | 213 | 274 | 325 | 336 |\n| HAZ −1 to −2 | 6·67 (2·05) | 6·44 (2·08) | 7·06 (1·92) | 7·74 (1·91) | 9·27 (2·03) |\n| n | 116 | 123 | 127 | 111 | 59 |\n| HAZ < −2 | 5·54 (2·17) | 6·56 (1·98) | 7·03 (2·05) | 6·65 (2·42) | 8·69 (2·29) |\n| n | 71 | 77 | 38 | 17 | 13 |\n\n【85】Data are mean (SD) unless otherwise stated.

Data from the Philippines has shown that, controlling for years of schooling and income, the combined reading and math test score of stunted children was 0·72 SD below that of non-stunted children. This reduction was equivalent to 2·0 fewer years of schooling. Regression analysis with Jamaican data corroborate this finding; controlling for wealth and grade level, stunted children's combined math and reading test score was 0·78 SD below those of non-stunted children. Controlling for stunting, poor children almost certainly learn less per year in school, but we know of no studies that convincingly estimate the deficit.\n\n【88】Assuming that every year of schooling increases adult yearly income by 9%, we estimate that the loss in adult income from being stunted but not in poverty is 22·2%, the loss from living in poverty but not being stunted is 5·9% and from being both stunted and in poverty is 30·1% 删除2:<u>( table 6 )</u>. Taking into account the number of children who are stunted, living in poverty, or both 删除2:<u>( table 6 )</u>, we calculate the average deficit in adult yearly income for all 219 million disadvantaged children to be 19·8%. This estimate is limited by the scarcity of data for the loss of learning ability of children in poverty, and almost certainly underestimates the true loss.\n\n【89】Table 6 Deficit associated with stunting, poverty (first _vs_ third quintile of wealth), and both, in schooling and percentage loss in yearly income in developing countries\n\n|  | **Deficit in school grades attained** | **Deficit in learning ability per grade in grade equivalents** | **Total deficit in grade equivalents** | **Percentage loss of adult yearly income per grade** | **Total percentage loss** **of adult yearly income (compounded)** | **Number (%) of children younger than 5 years in developing countries** | **Average percentage loss of adult yearly income per disadvantaged child** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Stunted only | 0·91 | 2·0 | 2·91 | 8·3% | 22·2% | 92·9 (16·6%) | 19·8% |\n| Poor only | 0·71 | ≥0 | 0·71 | 8·3% | 5·9% | 62·8 (11·2%) |  |\n| Stunted and poor | 2·15 | ≥2·0 | 4·15 | 8·3% | 30·1% | 62·8 (11·2%) |  |\n| Evidence | Brazil | Philippines and Jamaica | Sum of columns 1 and 2 | 51 countries plus Indonesian study | Combining columns 3 and 4 | See table 4 | Weighted average from columns 5 and 6 |\n\n【91】\\* An increase of one grade of schooling is assumed to increase income by 9%.

In consideration of the total cost to society of poor early child development, we need to take into account that the next generation will be affected, sustaining existing inequities in society with their attendant problems. Where large numbers of children are affected, national development will also be substantially affected. These costs have to be weighed against those of interventions.\n\n【98】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【99】Many children in developing countries are exposed to multiple risks for poor development including poverty and poor health and nutrition. There are few national data for children's development but our conservative estimate is that more than 200 million children under 5 years of age in developing countries are not developing to their full potential. Sub-Saharan African countries have the highest percentage of disadvantaged children but the largest number live in south Asia. The children will subsequently do poorly in school and are likely to transfer poverty to the next generation. We estimate that this loss of human potential is associated with more than a 20% deficit in adult income and will have implications for national development. The proximal causes of poor child development are analysed in the second paper in this series.\n\n【100】The problem of poor child development will remain unless a substantial effort is made to mount appropriate integrated programmes. There is increasing evidence that early interventions can help prevent the loss of potential in affected children and improvements can happen rapidly 删除2:<u>(see third paper in this series)</u>. In view of the high cost of poor child development, both economically and in terms of equity and individual well-being, and the availability of effective interventions, we can no longer justify inactivity.\n\n【101】Search strategy and selection criteria\n--------------------------------------\n\n【102】The following databases were searched for studies in developing countries reported in English from 1985, to February, 2006: BIOSIS via ISI web of science, PubMed, ERIC, PsychInfo, LILACS, EMBASE, SIGLE, and Cochrane Review, along with published documents from the World Bank, UNICEF, and UNESCO's International Bureau of Education.

Your earlier Editorial also suggested that reclassification could lead to arrest and, perhaps, a jail sentence. These statements are misleading.\n\n【1】The legal difference between cannabis as a class B or class C drug is small. Legislation introduced at the same time as reclassification in 2004 meant that the only remaining difference was the maximum sentence for possession (5 and 2 years for class B and C, respectively). However, a study by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation showed that only 2% of cannabis-possession offenders received a custodial sentence. Moreover, of those who did get custody, most (>90%) seemed to do so because they were concurrently convicted of other offences. Crown Court statistics for 2005 listed only seven individuals who had a prison sentence of longer than 1 year for possession of a class C drug. It therefore makes little practical difference whether cannabis is class B or C.\n\n【2】Furthermore, the original decision to move cannabis down from B to C does not seem to have affected young people's cannabis use. Therefore moving it up again would also probably have limited effect.\n\n【3】Unfortunately, these facts are little appreciated in the UK, where the decision is still viewed as a crucial and influential one. As Degenhardt and colleagues point out, the danger is that the classification debate distracts from the more pressing need to establish the actual harms associated with cannabis use and what can be done to prevent them.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>I declare that I have no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:39:37", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:39:49", "cost": 11.168}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:52", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:39:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:39:37"}

The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was therefore created and launched its activities in 2000, with the core mission to coordinate control efforts to reach elimination of lymphatic filariasis by 2020. The GPELF proposed a comprehensive elimination strategy, including transmission interruption in endemic communities (by use of mass drug administration \\[MDA\\]) and implementation of interventions to prevent and manage lymphatic filariasis-associated disabilities (the so-called morbidity management and disability prevention \\[MMDP\\] strategy). The GPELF recognised the need to establish a process for external evaluation of the evidence for elimination and for official recognition of success, so they created the Regional Programme Review Group and the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group on Neglected Tropical Diseases to provide advice to endemic countries and evaluate country dossiers help accelerate progress towards control and elimination of targeted diseases, including lymphatic filariasis.\n\n【1】In _The Lancet Global Health_ , the Local Burden of Disease (LBD) 2019 Neglected Tropical Diseases Collaborators use Bayesian model-based geostatistics and time series methods to generate spatially continuous estimates, to report the progress towards elimination and identify geographic variation in the distribution of infection. Although the prevalence of lymphatic filariasis substantially declined—from 199 million individuals (95% uncertainty interval 174–234 million) in 2000, to 51 million individuals (43–63 million) in 2017 (that is after implementation of GPELF-recommended interventions)—not all areas will achieve the original 2020 goal, and this Article provides national programmes and implementing partners with indications on areas where local elimination might not be attained. The study predicted that in 2017, some countries in Central Africa (such as Chad) and West Africa (such as Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire) had a prevalence of lymphatic filariasis above 1% elimination threshold, probably because of high baseline prevalence or more recent programme initiation. These observations can provide insight into the actions needed to accelerate progress towards elimination. For example, it is largely documented that in central and west Africa, loiasis—another filarial infection—constitutes a barrier to elimination of lymphatic filariasis in areas of coendemicity. A twice-yearly albendazole regimen, integrated with malaria vector control, or a test and not treat approach, developed and successfully tested on onchocerciasis, could be explored to achieve elimination of lymphatic filariasis in central and west Africa; such a strategy, based on situation analysis, is one of the applications expected from this study.\n\n【2】Diagnostic tools have regularly changed over the course of lymphatic filariasis elimination programmes. However, WHO recommended immunochromatographic tests—later replaced by the more sensitive filariasis test strips—in areas where _Wuchereria bancrofti_ is endemic and Brugia Rapid in areas where _Brugia_ spp is endemic for mapping, transmission assessment, and surveillance activities. Mapping and monitoring and evaluation exercises have been questioned because of a loss of sensitivity or cross-reactivity with ICT, especially in central and west Africa, where loiasis is coendemic. Although the LBD 2019 Neglected Tropical Diseases Collaborators adjusted the estimates to account for the reliability of diagnostic tools, the question remains as to whether the available diagnostic tools can accurately be used to certify lymphatic filariasis elimination, and further proof of transmission interruption (eg, xenomonitoring) is necessary so that sites with residual infection and at risk of resurgence of transmission can be detected.\n\n【3】MMDP is largely neglected by almost all elimination programmes in endemic countries; therefore, the morbidity associated with lymphatic filariasis (hydrocele, lymphoedema, and elephantiasis) and management procedures are largely ignored and so is progress towards a better lifestyle for affected individuals. Although verification of the absence of transmission of lymphatic filariasis does not include MMDP, data on the burden of lymphatic filariasis and appropriate management are informative on the progress towards elimination, and programmes should be encouraged to implement MMDP concomitantly with MDA.\n\n【4】Research and practice are oriented towards progress in interventions, transmission assessment surveys, and post-MDA surveillance for certification of lymphatic filariasis elimination. In 2012, the WHO neglected tropical diseases roadmap reconfirmed the target date for achieving elimination by 2020. It is obvious that this deadline cannot be met because some endemic countries are yet to complete mapping or launch MDA. The steps taken towards elimination vary by WHO region and area. The LBD 2019 Neglected Tropical Diseases Collaborators have succeeded in compiling and analysing these data globally and provide estimates to accelerate progress towards elimination.\n\n【5】The study by LBD 2019 Neglected Tropical Diseases Collaborators provides valuable information to quantify the progress towards elimination of lymphatic filariasis and identify areas for which additional efforts are still needed. These efforts need to be concerted, wherever this debilitating disease is endemic, and by investigating subnational variation in the distribution of infection, LBD 2019 Neglected Tropical Diseases Collaborators clearly provide crucial insights.\n\n【6】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:52:03", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:52:26", "cost": 23.212}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:52", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:52:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:52:02"}

While similar reviews of epilepsy in literature have suggested a progression in the understanding of epilepsy over time, this survey of the newer medium found examples of all of the ancient beliefs about epilepsy including demonic or divine possession, genius, lunacy, delinquency, and general “otherness”. Nevertheless there has been a progressive trend towards more overt depictions of epilepsy. Male characters with idiopathic epilepsy tend to be mad, bad, and commonly dangerous, whereas characters with post-traumatic epilepsy are usually cast as heroes triumphing against the odds. Epilepsy in female characters tends to signify exotic vulnerability. The dramatic potential of seizures remains highly tempting to film writers and directors alike. Although it is not for the medical profession to dictate or censor cinematic content, a keen eye on these depictions will help us to understand and perhaps combat some of the stereotypes and myths that continue to surround epilepsy in the 21st century.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【1】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【2】Already registered?\n\n【3】Log in to existing account\n\n【4】Forgot password?\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Not yet registered?\n\n【8】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:26:29", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:26:41", "cost": 11.493}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:52", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:26:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:26:29"}

In this trial design, all 17 centres that did pancreatic surgery were randomly allocated for the timing of the crossover from usual care (the control group) to treatment given in accordance with a multimodal, multidisciplinary algorithm for the early recognition and minimally invasive management of postoperative complications (the intervention group). Randomisation was done by an independent statistician using a computer-generated scheme, stratified to ensure that low–medium-volume centres alternated with high-volume centres. Patients and investigators were not masked to treatment. A smartphone app was designed that incorporated the algorithm and included the daily evaluation of clinical and biochemical markers. The algorithm determined when to do abdominal CT, radiological drainage, start antibiotic treatment, and remove abdominal drains. After crossover, clinicians were trained in how to use the algorithm during a 4-week wash-in period; analyses comparing outcomes between the control group and the intervention group included all patients other than those having pancreatic resection during this wash-in period. The primary outcome was a composite of bleeding that required invasive intervention, organ failure, and 90-day mortality, and was assessed by a masked adjudication committee. This trial was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register, NL6671.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】From Jan 8, 2018, to Nov 9, 2019, all 1805 patients who had pancreatic resection in the Netherlands were eligible for and included in this study. 57 patients who underwent resection during the wash-in phase were excluded from the primary analysis. 1748 patients (885 receiving usual care and 863 receiving algorithm-centred care) were included. The primary outcome occurred in fewer patients in the algorithm-centred care group than in the usual care group (73 \\[8%\\] of 863 patients _vs_ 124 \\[14%\\] of 885 patients; adjusted risk ratio \\[RR\\] 0·48, 95% CI 0·38–0·61; p<0·0001). Among patients treated according to the algorithm, compared with patients who received usual care there was a decrease in bleeding that required intervention (47 \\[5%\\] patients _vs_ 51 \\[6%\\] patients; RR 0·65, 0·42–0·99; p=0·046), organ failure (39 \\[5%\\] patients _vs_ 92 \\[10%\\] patients; 0·35, 0·20–0·60; p=0·0001), and 90-day mortality (23 \\[3%\\] patients _vs_ 44 \\[5%\\] patients; 0·42, 0·19–0·92; p=0·029).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The algorithm for the early recognition and minimally invasive management of complications after pancreatic resection considerably improved clinical outcomes compared with usual care. This difference included an approximate 50% reduction in mortality at 90 days.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】The Dutch Cancer Society and UMC Utrecht.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

A systematic review estimated that 18 adverse drug events per 100 outpatients, including almost seven preventable events, occur yearly.

More than 20 years of research into medication safety has shown the efficacy of several interventions, including computer provider order entry, electronic decision support, and some pharmacist interventions. However, progress in medication safety is insufficient, especially studies of the effect on hard patient outcomes, such as adverse drug events and health-care use.

Jan McGirk reports on their findings.\n\n【1】The Gaza Strip still has a persistent drug shortage, despite some recent Israeli and Egyptian talk about easing the strict blockade that has left this crowded enclave isolated since July, 2007. A political rift between the Hamas-run Government of Gaza and Fatah officials in the West Bank hinders communication and coordination between the Palestinian health ministries—adding to the hardships already faced by patients in Gaza.\n\n【2】Norway sent an independent mission to Gaza earlier this year to assess the chronic shortage of drugs and to help find a remedy for the time lag between placing orders to authorities in the West Bank and the delivery of drugs and medical supplies for Gaza's 1·5 million inhabitants. Norwegian diplomats hope to initiate negotiations between Gaza and Ramallah in order to solve this medical crisis through better logistics and monitoring.\n\n【3】Norwegian physicians Tone Hegna and Åse Vikanes followed the delivery of 200 pallets of medical supplies from Ramallah to Gaza in early February, 2011, and confirmed that many drugs and basic disposables remain in short supply, and that a bad situation is made worse by inadequate storage, transport, and incineration facilities. _The Lancet_ has examined their detailed report, which was based on a 4-day mission inside Gaza's hospital pharmacies and outpatient clinics to monitor stocks held in Hamas-controlled warehouses or by the Ministry of Health in Gaza.\n\n【4】“Our aim was to go in there and be as specific as possible and to get an overview of what was in stock in the central drug store, the warehouses, the hospital pharmacies and in the primary health care clinics”, says Hegna.\n\n【5】“The situation is heartbreaking”, Vikanes adds. “Doctors we met were impressive but seemed frustrated. As physicians, we could see that the big challenge was seeing what to do but not being able to do it. Doctors must improvise with what's available or about to expire, and not according to international guidelines. It's so unpredictable. Planning a treatment for cancer is very difficult, for instance. Drug supply is very unstable and there are no backups.”\n\n【6】Because of such uncertainties, radiation therapy for cancer tends to be used inside Gaza even when chemotherapy might be optimum. The survey pointed to cancer patients at Al-Shifa Hospital who had received just one or two of four scheduled chemotherapy treatments and eventually died from the lack of continuity. Oncologists said 100 of 260 cancer patients at Gaza's largest hospital were unable to receive effective treatment because the required combination of several drugs was not obtainable. Gaza's health ministry referred 1523 cancer patients to Egypt or Israel in 2010.\n\n【7】A statistical analysis of records from WHO and Gaza's Ministry of Health from 2008–10 showed drug shortages due to discrepancies between requests and supply 删除2:<u>( figure )</u>, delay, and unpredictability in deliveries, and a substantial reduction in the number of shipments. An essential drug list for Gaza, compiled in 2000, includes 480 drugs, along with 700 disposable medical items.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure Discrepancies between drugs requested by Gaza's Ministry of Health and those received, 2010–11</u>\n\n【8】Source: Gaza's Ministry of Health.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【9】The survey by Hegna and Vikanes found that more than a third of these essential drugs are missing completely, and barely 7% of the remainder exceed 2 months supply. Furthermore, 25 items are scant, with less than 1 month's supply on hand, and there are 23 items for which less than 2 months of supplies are available. There is a shortage of sutures, latex gloves, exchange transfusion sets for newborns, and ethyl alcohol.\n\n【10】An updated tally by WHO issued a fortnight later showed 150 drugs and about 136 disposable items remain out of stock, even after the most recent health ministry deliveries were inventoried. “Not a good situation”, WHO officials noted. Four doctors from the Physicians for Human Rights, Israel, on a rare overnight visit to Gaza, were appalled that the sole CT machine available in the Nasser Children's Hospital has been out of service for months. They reported that new drugs are not in use and that no blood tests were done in January because of equipment shortages.\n\n【11】Vikanes elaborated on the medical repercussions of these drug shortages. She warned that the biggest potential threat arises from the treatment of infectious disease. Using up large stocks of expensive advanced antibiotics before they expire rather than prescribing simple antibiotics more in line with international guidelines promotes bacterial resistance that puts the closed society of Gaza at risk. Meanwhile, too many cases of diarrhoea, pneumonia, and skin infections go untreated.\n\n【12】The team saw rows of empty shelves at Gaza's Central Drug Store in February, 2011\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2011 Tone Hegna</u>\n\n【13】To keep enough drugs in stock, pharmacists at Gazan hospitals sometimes request doctors to reduce a patient's dose below the recommended levels, resulting in suboptimum treatment. Some drugs that are unobtainable in Gaza routinely are purchased privately in neighbouring Egypt and smuggled in through clandestine tunnels. When the uprising in Egypt resulted in the extended closure of Rafah border, from Jan 29–Feb 18, 2011, many of Gaza's patients had to do without. As a result, patients increasingly hoard drugs or seek supplies through international agencies or non-governmental organisations.\n\n【14】Anticoagulant therapy in hospital is compromised by a shortage of enoxaparin sodium, which is the most easily administered treatment. Heparin is often substituted, but a lack of laboratory kits raises the risk of serious complications for unmonitored patients. People diagnosed with kidney failure, congenital heart disease, or organ transplant patients needing immunosuppressant drugs suffer disproportionately.\n\n【15】Patient referrals abroad doubled last year, partly because of Gaza's drug shortage, and this hits the health ministry's budget hard. For example, the antivenom serum to treat a viper's bite would cost a little more than US$19. Without it, a referral to hospital outside the enclave becomes essential, at an estimated cost of $832 per night. Vetting a patient's accompanying family members for a permit to use the Erez crossing into Israel costs precious time, too.\n\n【16】In the primary health-care sector, chronically ill patients now visit clinics twice a month instead of once, leading to an increased number of consultations and double the fees for prescriptions. Asthmatic children in Gaza rarely can obtain an inhaler, so must have daily injections instead.\n\n【17】Beleaguered Gaza has become a destination of choice for donated drugs, which are crucial for its medical inventory. According to Munir al-Barsh, the director general for the Pharmaceutical Department of Gaza's Ministry of Health, some 13 000 tonnes of donations reached Gaza following the 3-week conflict with Israel in January, 2009. 46 additional warehouses were required for storage, and the medical sector is grateful for what they receive from donors.\n\n【18】However, these donations can sometimes present unexpected problems. Spare parts gifted from abroad do not always match outmoded medical equipment used in Gaza, rendering these long-awaited deliveries useless. Because of transport delays, a large proportion of essential drugs are expired or about to expire by the time they reach the Gaza Strip. When Egypt enforces border closures at Rafah, for instance, drug shipments can get left out in the sun and heat at El-Arish and often sustain damage. Sometimes donation committees lack the manpower or capacity to sort through the donation before their items expire.\n\n【19】At Gaza's Central Drug Store (CDS), Mohamed Zemili, the director, pointed to rows of empty shelves which seemed to corroborate his zero stock lists. He told the Norwegian team that in 33 years working at this facility, which provides drugs for 600 000 Gazans, he “had not experienced a worse situation”. The CDS supplies 13 government hospitals and 54 clinics, providing 40% of Gaza's primary health care and 80% of its hospital-care services (the UN Refugee Welfare Association provides 56% of Gaza's primary health care). Inspecting other warehouses, the two doctors encountered “a lot of useless rubble and drugs that were expired”.\n\n【20】Antimalarial drugs or influenza vaccines that proved to be inappropriate for Gaza became a source of despair because there is no channel to send them back where they could be of use. Vikanes lamented that $2 million worth of oseltamivir expired at the end of February, 2011.\n\n【21】How to fix such a dire situation? Vikanes and Hegna suggest that impartial third parties, such as the International Red Cross or UNICEF, should regularly monitor donations from abroad and all shipments from the Ministry of Health in Ramallah to build trust and ensure transparency. To refill dwindling stocks of drugs and make the distribution of emergency medical supplies more efficient requires improved communication, they said. At least 3 months worth of essential medical supplies should be kept on hand, with regular provisions ordered from Ramallah and delivered every other month, according to need.\n\n【22】The Norwegian team also called for three large incinerators for proper disposal of expired drugs. Ironically, this was only days before a health ministry warehouse in Jabaliya was shelled by Israeli fighter planes and donated drugs went up in flames. A military spokesman said the air strikes were a response to the firing of five rockets and mortars into Israel in early February.\n\n【23】Fraught with such challenges, the health system in Gaza must operate under enormous strain. Without a careful plan to remedy the drug shortage, conditions for patients and medical staff are expected to deteriorate.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【24】### Publication history\n\n【25】Published: 09 April 2011\n\n【26】### Identification\n\n【27】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60484-4</u>\n\n【28】### Copyright\n\n【29】© 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This ruling is scandalously objectionable not only for the health and wellbeing of individuals seeking asylum or refuge in Australia, but also for the more than 260 people, including children, on the mainland who are now at risk of deportation.\n\n【1】As noted in Human Rights Watch's World Report 2016 , released on Jan 28, Australia has a good record of protecting civil and political rights, but it fails to respect international standards for asylum seekers and refugees. The country detains migrants in centres on the mainland and offshore, including in poorer, less well equipped countries. As of Oct 31, 2015, more than 900 asylum seekers and refugees were detained in Australian centres on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, while more than 600 were being held on Nauru in Micronesia. Serious health and human rights issues have been reported in some detention centres, including sexual and physical assaults of adults and children, rape, and self-harm.\n\n【2】Concerns have been raised about children in these facilities. A report by paediatricians from the University of Sydney to the Australian Human Rights Commission in October, 2015, concluded that closed immigration detention in Wickham Point (on the mainland) and Nauru was harmful to the health and mental health of young children and youth. The report called for all children to be immediately removed from such facilities, and stated that “under no circumstances should any child detained on the mainland be returned to or transferred to Nauru” either in detention or in the community because the island is an inappropriate place for asylum-seeking children.\n\n【3】The High Court has ruled that offshore detention is legal, but the conditions and populations being detained were not under review. We hope that had they been, the ruling would be different. The Australian Government needs to develop a humane response and reception for those seeking asylum and refuge in the country, starting with an end to the detention of children and their families.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2016 The AGE/Contributor</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【4】### Publication history\n\n【5】Published: 13 February 2016\n\n【6】### Identification\n\n【7】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00317-2</u>\n\n【8】### Copyright\n\n【9】© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We describe the major PAD syndromes, with a particular focus on common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Respiratory infection is a common presenting feature of PAD syndromes. Respiratory complications are frequent and responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality associated with these syndromes. Respiratory complications include acute infections, the sequelae of infection (eg, bronchiectasis), non-infectious immune-mediated manifestations (notably the development of granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease in CVID), and an increased risk of lymphoma. Although minor abnormalities are detectable in the lungs of most patients with CVID by CT scanning, not all patients develop lung complications. Mechanisms associated with the maintenance of lung health versus lung disease, and the development of bronchiectasis versus immune-mediated complications, are now being dissected. We review the investigation, treatment, and management strategies for PAD syndromes, and include key research questions relating to both infectious and non-infectious complications of PAD in the lung.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【2】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【3】Already registered?\n\n【4】Log in to existing account\n\n【5】Forgot password?\n\n【6】One-time access price info\n\n【7】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【8】Not yet registered?\n\n【9】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:20:23", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:20:57", "cost": 33.608}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:52", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:20:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:20:22"}

The material commissioned for the consultations on contentious issues was published to encourage further discussion. The final preparation of the draft guidelines was made by a group of eight experts from Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, the USA, and the CIOMS Secretariat. The final draft was posted on the CIOMS website for comments, which were subsequently considered by the CIOMS Secretariat.\n\n【2】A CIOMS conference was convened in 2002 to discuss and, as far as possible, endorse a final version to be submitted for final approval to the CIOMS Executive Committee. Besides representation of member organisations of CIOMS, the participants included experts in ethics and research from all continents.\n\n【3】Guideline 11, Choice of control in clinical trials, was intensively discussed during the entire revision process, but no consensus was reached.

Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Jerusalem, Malta, and Hong Kong hosted universities, and there were a handful of colleges scattered across the West Indies and Africa. But this could scarcely be considered adequate. In 1945, a Government Commission recommended the formation of the Inter University Council for Higher Education in the Colonies. It was duly established the following year (it later changed its designation to the Inter University Council for Higher Education Overseas), with the aim of assisting the new countries to set up sturdy and enduring systems of tertiary education.\n\n【2】“The Council was terribly supportive in helping African universities and others to develop in the postwar period”, explains Eldryd Parry, cofounder of the Tropical Health and Education Trust (THET). “We saw that because we had benefited from their support in the early years when we were Africa.”\n\n【3】Parry began teaching at Nigeria's University of Ibadan in 1960, on secondment from London's Hammersmith Hospital. He spent time in Ethiopia and would later serve as dean of medicine at universities in Nigeria and Ghana. In all, Parry and his wife Helen spent 25 years working in education in Africa.\n\n【4】The 1970s and 1980s were an exceptionally tumultuous period for the African continent. Countries were wracked by conflict, disease, famine, military coups, and poverty. Small wonder government services failed. Health policies were shaped by the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration, which established primary health care as the cornerstone of an effective public health system. “So the development industry and governments turned all their attention to primary health care, but they forgot a critical component: the teaching of medical students”, recalls Parry. Around the same time, the Inter University Council lost its identity within the British Council. Its work took a lower priority; support for British institutions to develop and maintain links with their counterparts in developing countries faded. It was to this background that Eldryd and Helen Parry, along with Richard Southwell, a senior member of the Queen's Counsel, set up THET, which this year celebrates its 25 year anniversary.\n\n【5】THET's vision\n-------------\n\n【6】“We were promoting a vision not of an ivory tower but something that was intimately related to the needs of institutions to deliver care in their own society”, affirmed Eldryd Parry. THET envisaged links between health professionals and universities in the UK and institutions in low-income and middle-income countries, initially in Africa, with the intention of bolstering education and training in the developing country. “Our approach was not the north telling the south what to do, but the south's voice shaping and framing what was needed”, Parry told _The Lancet_ . He would approach the individual charged with overseeing medical services in a country, a university dean or head of a school of nursing and ask what it was they were trying to achieve and how THET might be able to assist. “It was not prescriptive, with the arrogance of money from the north, but responsive, with the humility to understand that there are needs that are very well understood and expressed by universities and teaching hospitals in the developing world”, outlined Parry. “Once trust has been built up, perhaps then you can say ‘well wouldn't such and such be a good idea?’.”\n\n【7】Opportunities soon arose to work in areas that others had ignored—eg, surgery and anaesthesia. THET was asked to support the training of psychiatric clinical officers in Uganda, and orthopaedic clinical officers in Malawi. Funding would come from UK charitable trusts, and later the lottery fund.\n\n【8】Long-running parternships\n-------------------------\n\n【9】Michael Silverman, a specialist in child health and former THET trustee, oversaw the oldest continuing project, an 18-year-old partnership that joins Leicester National Health Service (NHS) Trust and both of the city's universities with the University of Gondar in northern Ethiopia. “We wanted something that was not charity or humanitarian work but a two-way professional programme, a partnership for the long-term”, said Silverman. The link supports a wide-range of health-related activities, including a sizeable mental health project in Gondar, encompassing a training programme for mental health nurses and north Ethiopia's first inpatient unit. There is no mistaking the need: this is a region with a population of 6 million and no consultant psychiatrists.\n\n【10】THET funds a long-term UK volunteer project in five African countries\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2014 Timur Bekir, THET</u>\n\n【11】THET-sponsored programme training community health workers in Somaliland\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2014 Timur Bekir, THET</u>\n\n【12】Jane Cockerell\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2014 THET</u>\n\n【13】British volunteers working alongside their overseas colleagues also benefit, developing leadership and problem-solving skills. They gain experience of disease and states of disease that are rarely visible in the UK, and engage in intensive medicine and surgery. They also participate in teaching programmes and curricula development at a level usually unavailable in their home country. And, of course, they return with a better understanding of intercultural relationships. Cerdic Hall, a mental health nurse who has developed a health partnership in Uganda, points out that he was enriched by the experience. “I learned how to get the process right, rather than just jump to solutions from my own frame of reference”, he said. Meanwhile, Ugandan nurses seconded to the UK leave with all kinds of ideas as to how to improve services in their own country. Last year, THET supported more than 600 NHS staff in overseas volunteer roles, and almost 14 000 health workers in 26 African and Asian nations benefited from training and support from peers and colleagues in the UK.\n\n【14】Often, the best way to meet a country's needs is by creating curricula for a specific qualification. In Gondar, this led to the establishment of MSc programmes tailored to the needs of Ethiopian health professionals, including anaesthetists, nurses, physiotherapists, and in Mbarara, Uganda, an MMed programme in medicine was created.\n\n【15】All of which is in keeping with Parry's driving philosophy. He was editor of the textbook _Principles of Medicine in Africa_ , now in its fourth edition, which was firmly embedded in the local context. “I did not want to just reproduce a book that would be appropriate to the north”, he said.\n\n【16】New era\n-------\n\n【17】Parry relinquished his role at the helm of THET in 2007. Since then, the organisation has taken on the £30 million Health Partnership Scheme (HPS) run by the UK Department for International Development (DFID), which supports more than 80 projects in more than 20 countries (aside from this work, THET continues to operate country programmes in Zambia and Somaliland). Overseeing expenditure of public funds necessitates a rigorous approach to quantifying progress.\n\n【18】“To work on this scale, we have to demonstrate that we are making a change with taxpayer money”, stresses THET's chief executive Jane Cockerell. Their website is full of relevant statistics—graduates trained and curricula improved—but it is tricky for projects aimed at building expertise to fall in with targets in the same way as, say, vaccination campaigns. Nonetheless, Silverman believes that the partnerships have not assessed their work as assiduously as they might have done. “It is a deficiency of the funding schemes”, he explained. “Often there is no funding left when a project comes to an end to evaluate the longer-term consequences of an activity.” The evaluation procedures do take into account the size of a project, with smaller ones not expected to give the same kind of reckoning as larger ones. “We are keen to show DFID that this work makes a meaningful contribution, both at the local level but also to the UK's global health agenda, and deserves continued government support.”\n\n【19】Today, there is much less conflict in Africa than there was a quarter of a century ago ( _The Economist_ has theorised that the old guerilla leaders just got tired of fighting), and the world is a richer place. The Millennium Development Goals are soon to give way to the Sustainable Development Goals, a shift in rhetoric and focus that moves the international agenda closer to THET's governing ethos. The field of development economics has flourished and think tanks have broadened the academic underpinnings of the field. There have been expansions elsewhere in academia. “25 years ago, we would not have focused on the further academic development of the young physician, but nowadays every institution thinks in those terms—that's a deep change”, said Parry.\n\n【20】He sometimes questions what he would do if he was starting THET today. “I would keep to exactly the same philosophy: where are you going? How can we help you get there?”, he said. “But I would get different answers to the ones I had 25 years ago.”\n\n【21】Eldryd Parry\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2014 THET</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【22】### Publication history\n\n【23】Published: 06 December 2014\n\n【24】### Identification\n\n【25】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62321-7</u>\n\n【26】### Copyright\n\n【27】© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Born on Feb 2, 1983, in Hajiganj subdistrict of Chandpur, Bangladesh, she died aged 25 years on May 8, 2007, in Dhaka Medical College hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n\n【1】Shahin Sultana was the eighth child of a farmer and lived in a part of Bangladesh largely dependent on agriculture, but, unusually for young women in her community, she was a college graduate. Her parents did their best to educate all their children, they say. At the time of her death, Shahin, who loved to read, was preparing to pass on her own enthusiasm for learning, by training to become a teacher.\n\n【2】When she was 22 years old, Shahin married Zahirul Islam, the 28-year-old friend of a cousin from the adjacent sub-district of Matlab who ran a grocer's shop. Her husband was supportive of her plans to become a teacher; he was said to be “eagerly looking forward to his wife's success” in gaining a government teaching post. She worked hard and passed the written examination and began to prepare for the viva voce.\n\n【3】But by then, 2 years into the marriage, Shahin had become pregnant. She was well looked after. Her husband said he encouraged her to eat nutritious foods and the whole family knew the importance of antenatal care. Her husband or her two sisters-in-law would accompany her to regular check-ups at a local clinic run by the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR, B), where she was given vitamin supplements and iron tablets. She had three antenatal check-ups, and none detected any problem with her or the baby.\n\n【4】8 months into the pregnancy, Shahin's mother suggested that her youngest child should move back into the maternal home, where she could care for her until the delivery. Zahirul agreed and Shahin moved back to Hajiganj. Shahin had a fourth antenatal check-up a week before the delivery in the government health complex in a subdistrict. She also went to a private clinic to have an ultrasound scan, which showed that the fetus was developing normally. When her husband came for a 3-day visit shortly afterwards, she told him she was again vomiting and did not want to eat.\n\n【5】2 days after Zahirul had left, Shahin began to have contractions at around midnight. At around 0400 h the family called a traditional birth attendant, expecting that she would deliver the baby. The traditional birth attendant, however, was not happy with Shahin's physical condition and advised the family that they should call the village doctor, who gave her some oral homoeopathic medicines. After an hour it became clear that Shahin's labour was not progressing and the village doctor advised that she should be taken to hospital. Many people in Bangladesh believe, not always correctly, that private medical facilities must be better than those operated by the government. Shahin's family decided to transport her some 4 km by rickshaw to a private clinic in Hajiganj. The journey took about 1 h. Doctors at the clinic gave Shahin injections and fluids in an intravenous drip to speed up her labour. Various biomedical investigations were done that showed that she had jaundice and diabetes. Her blood pressure was also high.\n\n【6】The private clinic then referred Shahin to the nearby Chandpur district hospital. But the family, who had by now been joined by Shahin's husband Zahirul, opted for treatment in the private sector. They took Shahin 20 km by ambulance to another private clinic. But when doctors at the clinic saw the laboratory test results, they refused to admit Shahin, telling the family that she needed to go to a tertiary-level hospital, either in Comilla, 84 km away, or in the capital city, Dhaka, which was 112 km distant.\n\n【7】The family decided to take Shahin to the capital. At about 0400h, after 16 hours of labour, she arrived at Dhaka Medical College hospital, where a physician examined Shahin and found that the baby was dead. The medical staff tried to bring about a normal delivery, but this was not possible. Shahin was by then in a very distressed state, pleading for a caesarean section. Zahirul tried to calm her, saying that money was not the issue and that the doctors were concerned about her physical condition and her ability to withstand the operation. So uncertain were the doctors that a board meeting had to be called, which involved several specialist doctors. After this meeting the decision was taken to go ahead. The caesarean was finally done at midnight, after 24 hours of labour.\n\n【8】Shahin had serious blood loss. She was transfused with four 500 mL bags of blood, two of which were donated by her siblings and two more purchased from the hospital. Her doctors said more would be needed, so some of the family went to persuade some people to donate. But Shahin's condition continued to deteriorate. She slipped into semiconsciousness an hour after the operation, developed respiratory distress, and then stopped breathing. Doctors' attempts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful and at 0430 h, the family were told she had died. The immediate cause of death was given as haemorrhage and postoperative complications, after obstructed labour. Her family say they believe that “God sanctioned limited time for Shahin in the world”. Zahirul said they did all they could, but were unable to save her life.\n\n【9】The information on which this obituary is based was compiled from the verbal autopsy form of the ongoing Health and Demographic Surveillance System of ICDDR, B. The written consent of Zahirul Islam was given.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 12 April 2008\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(08)60548-6</u>\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

At the top of the AMA's list of 18 issues is Indigenous health. When John Howard's Government came to power over 11 years ago they promised to improve the health and social wellbeing of Aboriginal people. To date there is no evidence that this pledge has been met.\n\n【1】Indigenous Australians have a greater burden of ill health than the rest of the Australian population, experience lower levels of access to health services, are more likely to experience disability and reduced quality of life due to ill health, and die at younger ages.\n\n【2】This dire situation now looks set to worsen. On Aug 17, the Australian Senate passed the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Bill 2007\\. This Bill, which was rushed through parliament, is Howard's reply to Little Children Are Sacred _: Report of the Northern Territory Board of Inquiry into the Protection of Aboriginal Children from Sexual Abuse_ . The legislation allows the government to take control of 73 Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory, boost police and army presence, enforce bans on alcohol and pornography, abolish the permit system—which restricts access to Aboriginal land by non-Indigenous people—and limit welfare payments.\n\n【3】But few of the aggressive measures in the Bill address child abuse; most are only likely to exacerbate the problem. The proposed interventions also do not tally with the report recommendations and contradict the approach called for by the authors, who emphasised the “critical importance” of consulting with Aboriginal people when designing initiatives for Aboriginal communities.\n\n【4】Indigenous health is a national emergency that requires investment in health services and the social determinants of health—education, housing, economic development—which underlie the appalling inequalities that Aboriginal people face. The Howard administration's latest approach to Indigenous health will not fulfil its decade-old election promise. John Howard's legitimacy to govern seems fatally compromised based on this critical health failure.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【5】### Publication history\n\n【6】Published: 15 September 2007\n\n【7】### Identification\n\n【8】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61422-6</u>\n\n【9】### Copyright\n\n【10】© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There was no significant difference in age-standardised and sex-standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for all-cause mortality (SMR 1·14, 95% CI 0·65–1·85; p=0·67) or cancer-specific mortality (1·39, 0·60–2·73; p=0·45) in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome when compared with the general population in England and Wales. This remained the case when deaths from suicide were removed from the analysis.

Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome usually have extensive investigations to ensure any potential treatable medical causes of fatigue are addressed. By definition, at diagnosis, individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome are free of prespecified major medical and psychiatric disorders leading to prolonged fatigue, and therefore might be expected to have a mortality risk similar to, or indeed lower than, the general population. \n\n【12】Although claims have been made on the basis of small, uncontrolled, clinical case series of higher overall death risks for heart failure, cancer, and suicide in people with chronic fatigue syndrome, a review of descriptive studies that reported follow-up or outcome data from patients with a primary diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome showed no convincing evidence of increased all-cause mortality or suicide-specific mortality. Specifically, only one study has compared the mortality within a cohort of individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (n=641) with that of the general population, and reported no significant increase in all-cause mortality adjusted for sex, race, age, and calendar time (standardised mortality ratio \\[SMR\\] 0·7, 95% CI 0·4–1·2; 14 deaths). Although the relative risk of suicide was raised in this cohort (SMR 3·6, 95% CI 0·4–12·9; two deaths), limited statistical power made it difficult to draw conclusions about excess suicide risk in people with chronic fatigue syndrome. By contrast, anecdotal accounts in various internet and patient forums repeatedly report increased all-cause mortality. \n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【15】We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO for all studies published from database inception to April 1, 2015, using the following search terms: \\[“mortalit\\*” and (“chronic fatigue syndrome” or “chronic-fatigue syndrome” or “CFS” or “post-viral fatigue syndrome” or “post viral fatigue syndrome” or “CFS/ME” or “ME/CFS” or “myalgic encephalomyelitis” or “myalgic encephalomyelopathy”)\\]. We initially assessed the titles and abstracts identified by the search and excluded articles that were deemed not relevant. We reviewed the full text of the remaining articles for inclusion, and all relevant references were checked for additional citations. We included studies that compared mortality in individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome with that of controls without the disorder.\n\n【16】The search process identified 121 unique records. We assessed three full text articles for eligibility and included one study comparing the mortality of individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome with that of a general population control. The results suggested no increased all-cause or suicide-specific mortality in 641 individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome (standardised mortality ratios \\[SMRs\\] 0·7, 95% CI 0·4–1·2 and 3·6, 0·4–12·9, respectively); however, the study was limited by its small sample size, with both all-cause and suicide-specific mortality outcomes receiving a GRADE rating of very low quality evidence. As such whether chronic fatigue syndrome is associated with a differing mortality compared with the general population remains unknown.\n\n【17】**Added value of this study**\n\n【18】We report the largest study of mortality in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome available so far, with 2147 individuals diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. Our findings showed that although the overall and cancer-specific mortality of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome was not significantly different to that of the general population, we noted an increased risk of completed suicide in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome when compared with a population control. Individuals with a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome and a lifetime diagnosis of depression might be at increased risk of completed suicide.\n\n【19】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【20】The evidence highlights the need for clinicians to be aware of the increased risk of completed suicide and to assess suicidality adequately in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Future studies should focus on identification of protective measures that can reduce suicide-related mortality in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n【21】Mortality associated with chronic fatigue syndrome remains uncertain, and larger studies are needed to further address the issue of chronic fatigue syndrome as a risk factor for all-cause and specific causes of mortality. Therefore, we investigated a retrospective cohort consisting of people diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, using data from the national research and treatment service for chronic fatigue at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) and King's College London Hospital (KCH).\n\n【22】Method\n------\n\n【23】### Setting and study population\n\n【24】The cohort of patients assessed in this study was assimilated from the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS), a case register system that provides de-identified information from electronic clinical records relating to secondary and tertiary mental health care services across SLaM. SLaM is a National Health Service (NHS) mental health trust that provides secondary mental health care to a population of roughly 1·3 million residents of four London boroughs (Lambeth, Southwark, Lewisham, and Croydon), and additionally in collaboration with King's College Hospital (KCH), provides a single secondary and tertiary care national referral service for individuals with suspected chronic fatigue syndrome, accepting referrals from general practitioners, general and specialist physicians, occupational physicians, consultant psychiatrists, and community mental health teams. As is the system in the NHS in England and Wales, all referrals need to be approved by the local clinical commissioning groups before they can be seen at the service.\n\n【25】Electronic clinical records have been used comprehensively across all SLaM services since 2006. CRIS was established in 2008 to allow searching and retrieval of full but de-identified clinical information for research purposes with a permission of secondary data analysis, approved by the Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee C (reference 08/H0606/71+5).\n\n【26】The chronic fatigue syndrome service follows a routine assessment procedure, in which all patients undergo medical screening to exclude detectable organic illness, including a minimum of physical examination, urinalysis, full blood count, urea and electrolytes, thyroid function tests, liver function tests, tissue transglutaminase, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients were interviewed with a semi-structured diagnostic interview to establish whether they had fatigue and whether they met the 1994 case definition or Oxford criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Additionally, we had information about whether patients fulfilled chronic fatigue syndrome criteria as defined by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Patients with the 1994 case definition-specified exclusionary psychiatric disorders and also somatisation disorder (DSM-IV) were excluded from this study. For this study we adopted the most inclusive criteria, and thus included all patients with a clinical diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome. A subsample of 755 patients had full diagnostic criteria applied prospectively of which 65% met Oxford criteria, 58% the 1994 case definition criteria, and 88% NICE criteria. All patients in this sample met at least one criterion. All were clinic attendees referred within the UK NHS and have been shown to be a representative sample of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome in secondary and tertiary care, similar to those in Australia, the USA, Scotland, England, and Northern Ireland. \n\n【27】Study participants were included if they had had contact with the chronic fatigue service (referral, discharge, or case note entry) and received a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome from Jan 1, 2007, to Dec 31, 2013.\n\n【28】Anyone who was active as a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome or newly diagnosed as a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome at any point of this period was followed up until their death or the end of the observation period. The diagnosis was ascertained from having received the prespecified clinic code for a chronic fatigue syndrome diagnosis, which was the ICD-10 code for neurasthenia (F48.0) in structured fields within CRIS, and was supplemented by a bespoke natural language processing application developed at SLaM using General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) software, which extracts and returns diagnostic statements from open-text fields of the source electronic health records. We emphasise that we do not use the category or criteria for neurasthenia in either our clinical or research practice—it is just a computer code imposed by our data or financial management systems that run across the trust and which are based on the ICD-10.\n\n【29】### Mortality identification\n\n【30】The analysis outcome is mortality over a 7-year observation window (2007–13, the at-risk period). In each NHS trust, a list of deceased people is obtained on a monthly basis from the “Service User Death Report” of “the Spine”, maintained by NHS Care Records Service. Therefore, the date of death of each deceased patient ever served by SLaM is recorded. Further routine checking occurs for details, including the cause of death, which were retrieved from the diagnosis (1a) in death certificate via linkage with nationwide data from the UK Office of National Statistics, and classified by code of the 10th edition of the WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). ICD-10 codes for cause of death were searched and ascribed to malignant neoplasm (ICD-10 codes: C00-97), suicide (ICD-10 codes: X60-84), or other causes.\n\n【31】### Covariates in analysis\n\n【32】Date of birth, sex, and ethnic origin were routinely recorded in NHS medical records. For the classification of age bands, the index date was set as July 1, 2010 (ie, the mid-point of the at-risk period), or at death, whichever came first, to define age. Ethnic group was divided into four categories: white, black, Asian, and mixed, unknown, or other. Presence of a lifetime diagnosis of depression was defined as having had a recorded depressive episode (ICD-10 code: F32.x) or recurrent depressive disorder (F33.x). Multiple deprivation score (or the indices of multiple deprivation), a measure of socioeconomic status developed by the UK Office of National Statistics, which combines various indicators to include a range of economic, social, and housing dimensions into one deprivation score for each small area in the UK, was also available for analysis.\n\n【33】### Statistical analysis\n\n【34】SMRs were calculated for the cohort of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome during the 7-year observation period, using number of deaths observed in SLaM records as the numerator. The denominator was the expected number of deaths, estimated by 5-year age bands, and sex-specific mortality rates for the England and Wales population in 2011 multiplied by the weighting of average person-years in the at-risk period experienced by chronic fatigue syndrome patients in each age and sex category. We also did stratified analyses of SMRs by splitting the target population into groups for ethnic category, presence or absence of a lifetime diagnosis of depression, and tertiles of multiple deprivation scores. Focusing on suicide-related mortality of particular interest, we adapted competing risk regression, a modified Cox modelling method developed by Fine and Gray for univariate and multivariate analysis, with suicide-specific deaths as the target events and other causes of death as competing outcomes. Subhazard ratios and their 95% CIs were thus generated with the existence of lifetime diagnosis of depression as the major exposure of interest. This time-to-event analysis method accounts for the fact that cohort members are subject to various potential competing causes of death, which might occur ahead of the specific cause of interest. The main purpose of the modification of the Cox model was to discriminate censoring between deaths from other causes and end of follow-up or loss to follow-up to have a better estimation of relative risk on the specific event of interest (suicide-specific mortality) within the chronic fatigue syndrome cohort. We regarded age and sex as potential confounders in the multivariate analysis. Tertile of multiple deprivation score and ethnic origin were too extreme (because no one died in some smaller categories) to be imputed as potential confounders in multivariate analysis.

Eight deaths were from malignant neoplasm, five from suicide, and four from other causes.\n\n【38】There was no significant difference in age-standardised and sex-standardised mortality ratios for all-cause mortality (SMR 1·14; 95% CI 0·5–1·85; p=0·67) or cancer-related mortality (1·39; 0·60–2·73; p=0·45). This remained the case when stratified by sex, and when those deaths from external causes were removed from the analysis. However, there was a significant increase in suicide mortality with an SMR of 6·85 (95% CI 2·22–15·98; p=0·002删除2-1:<u>; table 1 </u>). Although the suicide-specific SMR was significantly increased compared with the general population, if there had been two fewer deaths by suicide, this result would have been non-significant, although the effect size (SMR>4) would still be indicative of a strong effect.

Four (26%) of 17 patients who died had a lifetime diagnosis of depression, for two of whom the cause of death was suicide. No significance was identified for all-cause (SMR 2·44, 95% CI 0·66–6·24; p=0·17), suicide-specific (3·06, 0·37–11·07; p=0·28), or cancer-specific mortality (0·22, 0·01–1·22; p=0·11) by the presence of lifetime diagnosis of depression.\n\n【49】The mean multiple deprivation score (MDS) was 22·4% (SD 12·4), suggesting that the average patient in our cohort lived in less deprived areas than 78% of the UK population. 64 (3%) of 2147 patients had missing MDS values of whom one died from suicide and was excluded from the analysis. There was no significant difference in age-standardised and sex-standardised SMRs for all-cause or cancer-related mortality in any tertile of the MDS.

Patients with a lifetime diagnosis of depression had a high risk of dying from suicide (subhazard ratio 9·57; 95% CI 1·34–68·13; p=0·02).

This is the first study to show a specific increased risk of suicide in a population of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome compared with the general population; however, if there had been two fewer deaths by suicide, this risk would not be significantly increased.\n\n【56】There are limitations to our data including that, despite being the largest study of mortality in chronic fatigue syndrome available so far, the sample size is still modest. The all-cause mortality gave an estimation of SMR close to 1, and the study had insufficient statistical power to identify such a small effect size with a wide confidence interval. The SMR for suicide is greatly increased and although the estimate is imprecise, it is highly unlikely that the result is due to chance. The modest sample size limited our ability to explore other cause-specific mortality, or the effect of chronic fatigue syndrome on mortality in subgroups of patients. In view of the observational nature of the study design, and the limited number of confounders measured and controlled, it is possible that the findings are a result of confounding. For example, because we relied on population mortality rates, we were unable to control for smoking, BMI, and a range of chronic diseases that might affect mortality risk. Although the joint chronic fatigue syndrome service offered by SLaM and KCH is a national referral service, more than 80% of patients in the cohort were resident in the south of England, and as such national mortality statistics may not be representative of this region. However, previous work to establish sensitivity between mortality in “England and Wales” and London concluded there was no significant difference between the mortality estimates. We also accept that the cohort is quite young and it might, at least theoretically, be possible that differential mortality rates could have emerged after the 7-year observation window.\n\n【57】Patients concerned by ongoing fatigue symptoms might not wish to be referred to mental health services or be assessed by a psychiatrist. Reasons for this are multifactorial but include the perceived stigma of psychological and rehabilitation treatment, and some patients' views that the cause of their symptoms is biological precludes any form of psychological treatment. Because the referral pathway for this centre includes a full assessment including a psychiatric evaluation, an argument could be made that cases referred to the joint SLaM and KCH service may not be representative of chronic fatigue syndrome cases seen in secondary and tertiary care, and may include a referral bias, favouring patients with more severe chronic fatigue syndrome, psychiatric comorbidity, and higher socioeconomic status. However, the study sample has previously been shown to be typical of secondary and tertiary care cases in the UK and internationally. We recognise the sample might not be generalisable to primary-care or community-based samples of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, or generalisable to health-care settings in which services are not free to consumers. However, due to the no-cost setting, we are more likely to capture a broad coverage of source population when compared with insurance-based national services, and only moderate to severe cases not seen by the service would be those that can afford private medical care in the UK. Because this study is restricted to patients aged over 15 years the results cannot be extrapolated to children with chronic fatigue syndrome. Finally, our results might be affected by prevalence bias whereby cases known to a service within a given time are dominated by those with prolonged clinical courses; therefore, they cannot be taken to generalise to incident cases.\n\n【58】Much research has been done to investigate the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and psychiatric disorder comorbidity. A significant cross-sectional and prospective association exists between chronic fatigue syndrome and non-exclusionary psychiatric disorder comorbidity, with depression and anxiety disorders being strongly associated with chronic fatigue syndrome. The incidence of detected comorbidity of psychiatric disorder are similar to those seen elsewhere.\n\n【59】The lack of increase in all-cause mortality within the chronic fatigue syndrome cohort compared with the general population contrasts with that observed in most psychiatric disorders, which show increased mortality especially due to accidents, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. The reasons for the normal all-cause mortality may be that these patients might have good health behaviours, an inherently smaller effect size, or that all-cause mortality is confounded by the higher socioeconomic status of the patient cohort.\n\n【60】Although the suicide-specific SMR is raised compared with the general population, it is lower than for psychiatric disorders including affective disorders, personality disorders, and alcohol dependence reported in other population-based studies.\n\n【61】This study highlights the importance of adequate assessment of mood and other psychiatric symptoms in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, because lifetime diagnosis of depression is an independent risk factor for increased risk of completed suicide in this population. Although completed suicide was a rare event, the findings strengthen the case for robust psychiatric assessment by mental health professionals when managing individuals with chronic fatigue syndrome.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【62】ER contributed to the literature search, study question and design, data collection, analysis, and interpretation, prepared the first draft of the report, and contributed to subsequent versions; SW and TC contributed to data interpretation and drafting of the final report; C-KC and MH contributed to study design, data synthesis and analysis, and drafting of the final report.

In Singapore, quarantine of all close contacts, including entry and exit PCR testing, provided the opportunity to determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants, vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19, and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This retrospective cohort study included all close contacts between September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Regardless of symptoms, all were quarantined for 14 days with entry and exit PCR testing. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with a Covid-19 index case. Secondary attack rates among household close contacts of Delta variant-infected indexes and other variant-infected indexes were derived from prevalence of diagnosed cases among contacts. Relative risk ratios and bootstrapping at the cluster level was used to determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants and vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19. Logistic regression using generalized estimating equations was used to determine risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease\n删除4:<u>\n• View related content for this article</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of 1024 household contacts linked to 301 PCR-confirmed index cases, 753 (73.5%) were linked to Delta-infected indexes and 248 (24.2%) were exposed to indexes with other variants. Household secondary attack rate among unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts was 25.8% (95% boostrap confidence interval \\[BCI\\] 20.6–31.5%) compared with 12.9% (95%BCI 7.0–20.0%) among other variant-exposed contacts. Unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts were more likely to be infected than those exposed to other variants (Relative risk 2.01, 95%CI 1.24–3.84). Among Delta-exposed contacts, complete vaccination had a vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% (95%BCI 32.6–75.8%) against acquisition, 64.1% (95%BCI 37.8–85.4%) against symptomatic disease and 100% against severe disease. Among Delta-exposed contacts, vaccination status (adjusted odds ratio \\[aOR\\] 0.33, 95% robust confidence interval \\[RCI\\] 0.17–0.63) and older age of the index (aOR 1.20 per decade, 95%RCI 1.03–1.39) was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by the contact. Vaccination status of the index was not associated with a statistically-significant difference for contact SARS-CoV-2 acquisition (aOR 0.73, 95%RCI 0.38–1.40).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 Delta acquisition compared with other variants was reduced with vaccination. Close-contacts of vaccinated Delta-infected indexes did not have statistically significant reduced risk of acquisition compared with unvaccinated Delta-infected indexes.\n\n【9】1\\. INTRODUCTION\n----------------\n\n【10】The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) has increased rapidly in many countries including the United Kingdom, United States of America, India and Singapore. Vaccination has been reported to prevent symptomatic disease and hospitalizations related to Delta variant infection. To reduce the spread of disease, it is important also to determine the impact of vaccination on preventing any infection, regardless of symptoms, and the relative risk of onward transmission of disease from vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals, which remains unknown. As asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals are potential sources for onward transmission, especially in populations that do not have high levels of immunity, understanding vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition is essential for transmission risk assessment.\n\n【11】Accurately determining secondary attack rates regardless of symptoms remains challenging as many settings rely on symptom-based SARS-CoV-2 testing. Symptom-based testing will not detect asymptomatic infections and mild non-medically consulted infection. This challenge can be addressed by studies of close contacts with routine SARS-CoV-2 testing regardless of symptoms to detect asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases. As household contacts of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases are likely to be highly exposed to the case and are known to be at high-risk of infection , they are an ideal group to provide estimates of the impact of variants and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates.\n\n【12】We examined the impact of the Delta variant and vaccination among household close-contacts of all locally-acquired COVID-19 cases in Singapore, an island city-state in Southeast Asia with 5.8 million people. Since the identification of the first COVID-19 case on Jan 23, 2020, active contact tracing has been conducted to identify all close-contacts of every COVID-19 case. Close-contacts are quarantined for 14 days with routine PCRs conducted at entry to and exit from quarantine since May 2020. Whole genome sequencing is also performed on all local COVID-19 cases with a RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of less than 30. This cohort, where index case-contact pairs were known, provided a unique opportunity to determine secondary attack rates and risk factors for COVID-19 transmission.\n\n【13】2\\. METHODS\n-----------\n\n【14】### 2.1 Case and close contact definitions\n\n【15】This retrospective cohort study included all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 index cases in Singapore issued legally-binding quarantine orders between September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Since January 2, 2020, surveillance for COVID-19 in Singapore has been conducted according to regularly-reviewed Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 guidance. Since July 1, 2020, all persons aged 13 years old and above presenting with symptoms of febrile or non-febrile acute respiratory infection for any duration were actively offered to have a respiratory swab taken for RT-PCR testing. In addition, all close contacts of COVID-19 cases were also mandated to be tested by PCR upon entry and exit from quarantine, ensuring that additional cases are identified for further contact tracing. Physicians are required by law to report all COVID-19 cases to MOH. A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory specimens.\n\n【16】Contact-tracing was performed by MOH for every diagnosed COVID-19 case. Household close contacts were defined as persons who shared the same residential address as the index case, regardless of duration or proximity of contact. All identified close contacts were placed under legally-binding quarantine for 14 days, during which they were not allowed to leave their residence or assigned location. Persons under quarantine were monitored daily for development of symptoms, and symptomatic contacts were transferred to hospital via a dedicated transport service for COVID-19 testing and clinical evaluation. Regardless of symptoms, all quarantined close contacts were tested for COVID-19 by PCR, upon entry and exit from quarantine. The secondary attack rate was defined as the number of PCR-confirmed cases detected among all household close contacts of the index case.\n\n【17】All confirmed COVID-19 cases were isolated in hospital until MOH-specified discharge criteria were met. All cases of possible COVID-19 reinfection are independently adjudicated by an expert panel comprising specialists in infectious diseases and laboratory medicine.\n\n【18】### 2.2 Detection and identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\n【19】The National Public Health Laboratory started whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 variants routinely since December 2020. WGS was attempted for all SARS-CoV-2 positive cases with a RT-PCR Ct value of less than 30. Variant analysis was performed using Pangolin COVID-19 lineage assigner and CovSurver connected to GISAID to assign and verify lineages to each sequence.\n\n【20】### 2.3 National vaccination programme and vaccination status definitions\n\n【21】By end May 2021, only the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines (authorised for use in Singapore on December 14, 2020 and February 3, 2021, respectively) had been offered to citizens and long-term residents on a voluntary basis under the national vaccination programme. The vaccination exercise was initiated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on December 30, 2020, prioritising healthcare and frontline workers , and was expanded to the community-at-large, starting with seniors aged 70 and above from February 2021 and seniors aged 60 to 69 from end March 2021. As of May 30, 2021, approximately 2.3 million individuals (40% of the population) have received at least the first dose of the vaccine, of whom over 1.7 million individuals (30% of the population) have completed the full vaccination regimen. 73% of eligible seniors aged 60 and above, 72% of eligible persons aged 45 to 59 and 60% of those aged 40 to 44 have received the vaccine or scheduled a vaccination appointment.\n\n【22】Both index cases and close contacts were considered to be partially vaccinated if they had received one vaccine dose before the day the quarantine order was issued, or were within 14 days of the second dose on the day the quarantine order was issued. If more than 14 days had elapsed after their second dose, they were taken to be fully vaccinated.\n\n【23】### 2.4 Epidemiological analysis\n\n【24】Data on the index cases and associated close contacts were obtained from MOH's contact tracing database. For both, demographic information, residential address and vaccination status (i.e. vaccine type, number of doses received and vaccination dates for received doses) were obtained. Additionally, unique national case number, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, WGS-confirmed variant assignment, date of symptom onset, date of hospital admission and reinfection status were obtained for index cases, while start date of quarantine, and if applicable, confirmed COVID-19 status, date of COVID-19 diagnosis and symptom onset, WGS-confirmed variant assignment, whether supplemental oxygen or intensive care were required, and reinfection status were obtained for close contacts. Symptom information was collected via interview by the MOH contact tracers soon after diagnosis while the requirement for supplemental oxygen or intensive care was determined throughout the duration of inpatient care.\n\n【25】Close contacts residing in foreign worker dormitories (as it is difficult to define a household in that setting), those of overseas or imported cases, and those lacking index case information were excluded. The remaining close contacts were linked to community-acquired cases (“community” close contacts), including household close contacts. If multiple linked index cases were listed for a close contact in the national records, the earliest-diagnosed index sharing the same residence as the contact was selected for analysis. It was assumed that all recorded cases in February 2021 and earlier with missing variant status information in the database were infected with variants other than the Delta variant of concern (“non-Delta variant”), as the first detection of the Delta variant in Singapore was in April 2021.\n\n【26】MOH actively investigates every new case for epidemiologically-linked transmission to prior cases and groups cases into transmission clusters which are reported. All cases with individually-assigned variant status in an epidemiologically-linked transmission cluster were found to have identical variant assignment. As such, cases with no individually-assigned variant status were assigned the transmission cluster variant if available.\n\n【27】### 2.5 Statistical analysis and modelling\n\n【28】Until the emergence of the Delta variant, the number of cases during the study period was low, and as a result, there were insufficient numbers of the other variants to analyze them separately. We therefore grouped all non-Delta variants together. Three outcomes were considered: infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease (defined as either need for supplemental oxygen, and/or intensive care admission), though the small number of contacts with severe infection precluded some analyses of the final endpoint. We characterised contacts by their vaccine status and the variant they were exposed to, to account for potentially different protection against the Delta variant conferred by the vaccines. We adjusted for the age and gender of both index case and contact, the vaccine status of the index case, and the number of days of exposure from symptom onset or notification of the index to his or her isolation in a healthcare facility as these co-variates have prior data supporting possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. To accommodate clustering we used generalized estimating equations in the logistic regression and bootstrap at the cluster level to derive relative risks, and hence vaccine effectiveness. In sensitivity analysis, we bootstrapped and adjusted for significant covariates through logistic regression. Statistical analysis was conducted in R. More details are available in the supplementary information.\n\n【29】### 2.6 Ethics\n\n【30】This work was performed as part of the outbreak investigation under the Infectious Diseases Act of Singapore.\n删除5:<u>\n### 2.7 Role of the funding source\n\n【31】The sponsor(s) of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

DISCUSSION\n--------------\n\n【69】This study examined the impact of the Delta variant and vaccination among known index case-contact pairs in households to determine the secondary attack rates and risk factors for COVID-19 transmission. The household secondary attack rate among unvaccinated contacts exposed to index cases infected with the Delta variant was higher at 25.8% (95%BCI 20.6–31.5%) compared with 12.9% (95%CI 7.0–20.0%) among unvaccinated contacts exposed to other variants. There is a significantly higher risk of infection among unvaccinated close contacts by the Delta variant compared to other variants (RR 2.01, 95%BCI 1.24–3.84). This would explain the rapid and extensive epidemic in India, the first country that reported the Delta variant in late 2020 1 ; other South Asian countries with Delta variant-driven epidemics; and the difficulty in controlling the outbreaks caused by the Delta variant in countries and regions such as Singapore and Australia that have hitherto been successful in containing COVID-19 spread. This could be due to the higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding in persons infected with the Delta variant (Singapore unpublished data), and should be the focus of further studies on SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\n【70】An interesting finding is that older primary cases had more secondary infections than younger cases did (aOR 1.20 per decade, 95%RCI 1.03–1.39), a finding corroborated by prior studies. A study from Korea of 4,048 household clusters determined that SARS-CoV-2 transmission was more common from adults to children than from children to adults. The increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from adults compared with children was also supported by studies from Spain and Germany. This is unlike many other respiratory diseases such as influenza, where children and young adults tend to be the conduits of transmission. More studies should be performed to determine the possible causes for this observation—whether older cases have more viral shedding, or increased interaction with household members that facilitate transmission.\n\n【71】Among contacts exposed to the Delta variant, there is a lower risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 for fully vaccinated compared to unvaccinated contacts (Relative risk \\[RR\\] 0.44, 95%BCI 0.24–0.67), and lower risk of symptomatic disease in both fully (RR 0.36 \\[95%BCI 0.15–0.62\\]) and partially (RR 0.37 \\[95%BCI 0.13–0.70\\]) vaccinated contacts. The vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% (95%BCI 32.6–75.8%) for PCR-confirmed infections, or 64.1% (95%BCI 37.8–85.4%) against symptoms, provide important information on the overall effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines used in Singapore. While the estimated vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% against Delta variant acquisition (regardless of symptoms) and 64.1% against symptomatic disease is lower than the 88% (95%CI 85.3–90.1) reported for the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine at preventing symptomatic infection by the Delta variant in England , it is important to note that the household setting is one where vaccine effectiveness estimates are likely to be the lowest, given the context of prolonged close contact between members of the same household. Our estimates show that even for the Delta variant, the mRNA vaccines remain very effective at preventing all infections—both symptomatic and asymptomatic. Asymptomatic infections, if unprevented and undetected, can be the conduits of community transmission for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to preventing infections, vaccinated individuals also have significantly less severe outcomes if infected , although in this study the absence of any severe outcomes in the vaccinated group prevented accurate estimation of the residual risk of severe Covid-19. The estimate of 100% vaccine effectiveness against this outcome should therefore be treated with caution.\n\n【72】Our analysis did not demonstrate a statistically-significant reduction in household contact SARS-CoV-2 acquisition comparing vaccinated index cases with unvaccinated index cases. Our point estimate suggested a possibility of reduced onward transmission and the ability to demonstrate a statistically-significant difference could be affected by the study sample size and index case misclassification. Primary cases who are vaccinated are less likely to experience symptomatic infection , and thus less likely to be tested and diagnosed as index cases. As individuals with more symptoms are associated with increased infectiousness , underdetection of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic vaccinated index cases could result in underestimation of the preventive effect of vaccination on onward transmission to household contacts. In comparison, Harris and colleagues found that the likelihood of household transmission (pre-Delta) was lowered by approximately 40 to 50% in vaccinated index patients , and another study (pre-print) from Guangdong, China, reported that unvaccinated Delta index cases were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received two doses of vaccine. If infected cases who are vaccinated remain sources of onward infection, it is important to ensure that testing and isolating of cases, and public health measures to prevent the community spread of COVID-19, remain in place until high levels of immunity from vaccination and/or natural infection is present. Many countries are relaxing measures such as mask-wearing and testing for vaccinated indvidiuals. If these are not in place, infection among vaccinated individuals, especially if asymptomatic or mild, are likely to go undetected and may result in spread to other individuals who are not immune to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in further waves of infection.\n\n【73】This study has some limitations. The risk of household contacts acquiring infections from non-household sources cannot be excluded, but this would be minimal due to the low number of community cases in Singapore during the study period. The index case, which is the first diagnosed COVID-19 infected person in the household may in some cases not be the true primary case of infection. However this scenario would likely be minimized due to aggressive contact tracing and establishment of transmission chains in Singapore since the first diagnosed case, and where possible the assignment of the index case would be dependent on the earliest symptom onset or likely transmission source outside of the household. The older age of vaccinated indexes could have affected the estimates of the preventive effect of vaccination on onward transmission, a confounding which was adjusted for in the logistic regression 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4)</u>.\n\n【74】Contacts’ symptom data was based on interview by MOH contact tracers soon after index case diagnosis and may have resulted in pre-symptomatic individuals (who were asymptomatic at time of interview) being classified as asymptomatic, a misclassification which could affect the estimates of vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease and not the esimates of vaccine effectiveness against acquisition or severe illness. Chronic disease data is not routinely captured in the MOH contact tracing database and hence we were not able to adjust for chronic disease in our risk factor analysis. Multiple null hypothesis significance tests were conducted, based on potential risk factors that were deemed epidemiologically important, and so some caution should be taken in interpreting the results as no correction for multiple testing was attempted. Bonferroni correction for the logistic regression would result in the age of vaccinated indexes not meeting threshold for statistical significance but would not alter the inference with regards to fully vaccinated individuals.\n\n【75】The majority of non-Delta household indexes occurred prior to March 2021 and all the household Delta index cases occurred after March 2021, and there were differences in public measures between these time periods. The main measure potentially affecting household exposures is the increased recommendation for telecommuting 删除2:<u>(Supplementary Table 2)</u>. If there was significantly increased exposure time within the household as a result, this may contribute to over-estimation of the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant but would not be expected to bias the estimates of vaccine effectiveness or determinants of Delta variant transmission.\n\n【76】5\\. CONCLUSION\n--------------\n\n【77】Individuals exposed to the Delta variant have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition compared to those exposed to other variants. This risk is reduced by 55% among vaccinated individuals, which shows the importance of high vaccination coverage to increase population-level immunity. Our findings suggest that vaccinated cases remain at risk of onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Delta, and therefore it is important to continue to contain spread through testing and isolation, and public health measures to prevent widespread community transmission if significant numbers of at risk persons remain unvaccinated.\n\n【78】6\\.

In Singapore, quarantine of all close contacts, including entry and exit PCR testing, provided the opportunity to determine risk of infection by the Delta variant compared to other variants, vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition, symptomatic or severe COVID-19, and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and symptomatic disease.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This retrospective cohort study included all close contacts between September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Regardless of symptoms, all were quarantined for 14 days with entry and exit PCR testing. Household contacts were defined as individuals who shared a residence with a Covid-19 index case. Secondary attack rates among household close contacts of Delta variant-infected indexes and other variant-infected indexes were derived from prevalence of diagnosed cases among contacts.

Household secondary attack rate among unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts was 25.8% (95% boostrap confidence interval \\[BCI\\] 20.6–31.5%) compared with 12.9% (95%BCI 7.0–20.0%) among other variant-exposed contacts. Unvaccinated Delta-exposed contacts were more likely to be infected than those exposed to other variants (Relative risk 2.01, 95%CI 1.24–3.84). Among Delta-exposed contacts, complete vaccination had a vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% (95%BCI 32.6–75.8%) against acquisition, 64.1% (95%BCI 37.8–85.4%) against symptomatic disease and 100% against severe disease. Among Delta-exposed contacts, vaccination status (adjusted odds ratio \\[aOR\\] 0.33, 95% robust confidence interval \\[RCI\\] 0.17–0.63) and older age of the index (aOR 1.20 per decade, 95%RCI 1.03–1.39) was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition by the contact. Vaccination status of the index was not associated with a statistically-significant difference for contact SARS-CoV-2 acquisition (aOR 0.73, 95%RCI 0.38–1.40).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 Delta acquisition compared with other variants was reduced with vaccination. Close-contacts of vaccinated Delta-infected indexes did not have statistically significant reduced risk of acquisition compared with unvaccinated Delta-infected indexes.\n\n【9】1\\. INTRODUCTION\n----------------\n\n【10】The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) has increased rapidly in many countries including the United Kingdom, United States of America, India and Singapore. Vaccination has been reported to prevent symptomatic disease and hospitalizations related to Delta variant infection. To reduce the spread of disease, it is important also to determine the impact of vaccination on preventing any infection, regardless of symptoms, and the relative risk of onward transmission of disease from vaccinated vs unvaccinated individuals, which remains unknown. As asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals are potential sources for onward transmission, especially in populations that do not have high levels of immunity, understanding vaccine efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 acquisition is essential for transmission risk assessment.\n\n【11】Accurately determining secondary attack rates regardless of symptoms remains challenging as many settings rely on symptom-based SARS-CoV-2 testing. Symptom-based testing will not detect asymptomatic infections and mild non-medically consulted infection. This challenge can be addressed by studies of close contacts with routine SARS-CoV-2 testing regardless of symptoms to detect asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases. As household contacts of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases are likely to be highly exposed to the case and are known to be at high-risk of infection , they are an ideal group to provide estimates of the impact of variants and vaccination on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates.\n\n【12】We examined the impact of the Delta variant and vaccination among household close-contacts of all locally-acquired COVID-19 cases in Singapore, an island city-state in Southeast Asia with 5.8 million people. Since the identification of the first COVID-19 case on Jan 23, 2020, active contact tracing has been conducted to identify all close-contacts of every COVID-19 case. Close-contacts are quarantined for 14 days with routine PCRs conducted at entry to and exit from quarantine since May 2020. Whole genome sequencing is also performed on all local COVID-19 cases with a RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of less than 30. This cohort, where index case-contact pairs were known, provided a unique opportunity to determine secondary attack rates and risk factors for COVID-19 transmission.\n\n【13】2\\. METHODS\n-----------\n\n【14】### 2.1 Case and close contact definitions\n\n【15】This retrospective cohort study included all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 index cases in Singapore issued legally-binding quarantine orders between September 1, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Since January 2, 2020, surveillance for COVID-19 in Singapore has been conducted according to regularly-reviewed Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 guidance. Since July 1, 2020, all persons aged 13 years old and above presenting with symptoms of febrile or non-febrile acute respiratory infection for any duration were actively offered to have a respiratory swab taken for RT-PCR testing. In addition, all close contacts of COVID-19 cases were also mandated to be tested by PCR upon entry and exit from quarantine, ensuring that additional cases are identified for further contact tracing. Physicians are required by law to report all COVID-19 cases to MOH. A confirmed COVID-19 case was defined as positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid by real-time RT-PCR of respiratory specimens.\n\n【16】Contact-tracing was performed by MOH for every diagnosed COVID-19 case. Household close contacts were defined as persons who shared the same residential address as the index case, regardless of duration or proximity of contact. All identified close contacts were placed under legally-binding quarantine for 14 days, during which they were not allowed to leave their residence or assigned location. Persons under quarantine were monitored daily for development of symptoms, and symptomatic contacts were transferred to hospital via a dedicated transport service for COVID-19 testing and clinical evaluation. Regardless of symptoms, all quarantined close contacts were tested for COVID-19 by PCR, upon entry and exit from quarantine. The secondary attack rate was defined as the number of PCR-confirmed cases detected among all household close contacts of the index case.\n\n【17】All confirmed COVID-19 cases were isolated in hospital until MOH-specified discharge criteria were met. All cases of possible COVID-19 reinfection are independently adjudicated by an expert panel comprising specialists in infectious diseases and laboratory medicine.\n\n【18】### 2.2 Detection and identification of SARS-CoV-2 variants\n\n【19】The National Public Health Laboratory started whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 variants routinely since December 2020. WGS was attempted for all SARS-CoV-2 positive cases with a RT-PCR Ct value of less than 30. Variant analysis was performed using Pangolin COVID-19 lineage assigner and CovSurver connected to GISAID to assign and verify lineages to each sequence.\n\n【20】### 2.3 National vaccination programme and vaccination status definitions\n\n【21】By end May 2021, only the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccines (authorised for use in Singapore on December 14, 2020 and February 3, 2021, respectively) had been offered to citizens and long-term residents on a voluntary basis under the national vaccination programme. The vaccination exercise was initiated with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine on December 30, 2020, prioritising healthcare and frontline workers , and was expanded to the community-at-large, starting with seniors aged 70 and above from February 2021 and seniors aged 60 to 69 from end March 2021. As of May 30, 2021, approximately 2.3 million individuals (40% of the population) have received at least the first dose of the vaccine, of whom over 1.7 million individuals (30% of the population) have completed the full vaccination regimen. 73% of eligible seniors aged 60 and above, 72% of eligible persons aged 45 to 59 and 60% of those aged 40 to 44 have received the vaccine or scheduled a vaccination appointment.\n\n【22】Both index cases and close contacts were considered to be partially vaccinated if they had received one vaccine dose before the day the quarantine order was issued, or were within 14 days of the second dose on the day the quarantine order was issued. If more than 14 days had elapsed after their second dose, they were taken to be fully vaccinated.\n\n【23】### 2.4 Epidemiological analysis\n\n【24】Data on the index cases and associated close contacts were obtained from MOH's contact tracing database. For both, demographic information, residential address and vaccination status (i.e. vaccine type, number of doses received and vaccination dates for received doses) were obtained. Additionally, unique national case number, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, WGS-confirmed variant assignment, date of symptom onset, date of hospital admission and reinfection status were obtained for index cases, while start date of quarantine, and if applicable, confirmed COVID-19 status, date of COVID-19 diagnosis and symptom onset, WGS-confirmed variant assignment, whether supplemental oxygen or intensive care were required, and reinfection status were obtained for close contacts. Symptom information was collected via interview by the MOH contact tracers soon after diagnosis while the requirement for supplemental oxygen or intensive care was determined throughout the duration of inpatient care.\n\n【25】Close contacts residing in foreign worker dormitories (as it is difficult to define a household in that setting), those of overseas or imported cases, and those lacking index case information were excluded. The remaining close contacts were linked to community-acquired cases (“community” close contacts), including household close contacts. If multiple linked index cases were listed for a close contact in the national records, the earliest-diagnosed index sharing the same residence as the contact was selected for analysis. It was assumed that all recorded cases in February 2021 and earlier with missing variant status information in the database were infected with variants other than the Delta variant of concern (“non-Delta variant”), as the first detection of the Delta variant in Singapore was in April 2021.\n\n【26】MOH actively investigates every new case for epidemiologically-linked transmission to prior cases and groups cases into transmission clusters which are reported. All cases with individually-assigned variant status in an epidemiologically-linked transmission cluster were found to have identical variant assignment. As such, cases with no individually-assigned variant status were assigned the transmission cluster variant if available.\n\n【27】### 2.5 Statistical analysis and modelling\n\n【28】Until the emergence of the Delta variant, the number of cases during the study period was low, and as a result, there were insufficient numbers of the other variants to analyze them separately. We therefore grouped all non-Delta variants together. Three outcomes were considered: infection, symptomatic disease, and severe disease (defined as either need for supplemental oxygen, and/or intensive care admission), though the small number of contacts with severe infection precluded some analyses of the final endpoint. We characterised contacts by their vaccine status and the variant they were exposed to, to account for potentially different protection against the Delta variant conferred by the vaccines. We adjusted for the age and gender of both index case and contact, the vaccine status of the index case, and the number of days of exposure from symptom onset or notification of the index to his or her isolation in a healthcare facility as these co-variates have prior data supporting possible effects on SARS-CoV-2 acquisition. To accommodate clustering we used generalized estimating equations in the logistic regression and bootstrap at the cluster level to derive relative risks, and hence vaccine effectiveness. In sensitivity analysis, we bootstrapped and adjusted for significant covariates through logistic regression. Statistical analysis was conducted in R. More details are available in the supplementary information.\n\n【29】### 2.6 Ethics\n\n【30】This work was performed as part of the outbreak investigation under the Infectious Diseases Act of Singapore.\n删除5:<u>\n### 2.7 Role of the funding source\n\n【31】The sponsor(s) of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

Vaccinated index cases were not over-represented among the cases with no variant assigned as shown in Supplementary Table 5. Of the remaining 1,001 household close contacts, 753 were linked to 228 unique Delta variant index cases in the household (“Delta contact”), while 248 were linked to 73 unique non-Delta variant index cases (“non-Delta contact”) 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. A breakdown of the PANGO lineage assignment for non-Delta variants are listed in Supplementary Table 1. None of the 301 index cases linked to the household close contacts nor any of the secondary cases identified in this dataset were re-infection cases. 72 (23.9%) Delta index cases received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine before the contact quarantine start date, of which 51 (70.8%) of vaccinated individuals were fully vaccinated with both doses.

DISCUSSION\n--------------\n\n【69】This study examined the impact of the Delta variant and vaccination among known index case-contact pairs in households to determine the secondary attack rates and risk factors for COVID-19 transmission. The household secondary attack rate among unvaccinated contacts exposed to index cases infected with the Delta variant was higher at 25.8% (95%BCI 20.6–31.5%) compared with 12.9% (95%CI 7.0–20.0%) among unvaccinated contacts exposed to other variants. There is a significantly higher risk of infection among unvaccinated close contacts by the Delta variant compared to other variants (RR 2.01, 95%BCI 1.24–3.84). This would explain the rapid and extensive epidemic in India, the first country that reported the Delta variant in late 2020 1 ; other South Asian countries with Delta variant-driven epidemics; and the difficulty in controlling the outbreaks caused by the Delta variant in countries and regions such as Singapore and Australia that have hitherto been successful in containing COVID-19 spread. This could be due to the higher viral load and prolonged viral shedding in persons infected with the Delta variant (Singapore unpublished data), and should be the focus of further studies on SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\n【70】An interesting finding is that older primary cases had more secondary infections than younger cases did (aOR 1.20 per decade, 95%RCI 1.03–1.39), a finding corroborated by prior studies. A study from Korea of 4,048 household clusters determined that SARS-CoV-2 transmission was more common from adults to children than from children to adults. The increased transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from adults compared with children was also supported by studies from Spain and Germany. This is unlike many other respiratory diseases such as influenza, where children and young adults tend to be the conduits of transmission. More studies should be performed to determine the possible causes for this observation—whether older cases have more viral shedding, or increased interaction with household members that facilitate transmission.\n\n【71】Among contacts exposed to the Delta variant, there is a lower risk of being infected by SARS-CoV-2 for fully vaccinated compared to unvaccinated contacts (Relative risk \\[RR\\] 0.44, 95%BCI 0.24–0.67), and lower risk of symptomatic disease in both fully (RR 0.36 \\[95%BCI 0.15–0.62\\]) and partially (RR 0.37 \\[95%BCI 0.13–0.70\\]) vaccinated contacts. The vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% (95%BCI 32.6–75.8%) for PCR-confirmed infections, or 64.1% (95%BCI 37.8–85.4%) against symptoms, provide important information on the overall effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines used in Singapore. While the estimated vaccine effectiveness of 56.4% against Delta variant acquisition (regardless of symptoms) and 64.1% against symptomatic disease is lower than the 88% (95%CI 85.3–90.1) reported for the Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine at preventing symptomatic infection by the Delta variant in England , it is important to note that the household setting is one where vaccine effectiveness estimates are likely to be the lowest, given the context of prolonged close contact between members of the same household. Our estimates show that even for the Delta variant, the mRNA vaccines remain very effective at preventing all infections—both symptomatic and asymptomatic. Asymptomatic infections, if unprevented and undetected, can be the conduits of community transmission for SARS-CoV-2. In addition to preventing infections, vaccinated individuals also have significantly less severe outcomes if infected , although in this study the absence of any severe outcomes in the vaccinated group prevented accurate estimation of the residual risk of severe Covid-19. The estimate of 100% vaccine effectiveness against this outcome should therefore be treated with caution.\n\n【72】Our analysis did not demonstrate a statistically-significant reduction in household contact SARS-CoV-2 acquisition comparing vaccinated index cases with unvaccinated index cases. Our point estimate suggested a possibility of reduced onward transmission and the ability to demonstrate a statistically-significant difference could be affected by the study sample size and index case misclassification. Primary cases who are vaccinated are less likely to experience symptomatic infection , and thus less likely to be tested and diagnosed as index cases. As individuals with more symptoms are associated with increased infectiousness , underdetection of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic vaccinated index cases could result in underestimation of the preventive effect of vaccination on onward transmission to household contacts. In comparison, Harris and colleagues found that the likelihood of household transmission (pre-Delta) was lowered by approximately 40 to 50% in vaccinated index patients , and another study (pre-print) from Guangdong, China, reported that unvaccinated Delta index cases were more likely to transmit infection to their contacts than those who had received two doses of vaccine. If infected cases who are vaccinated remain sources of onward infection, it is important to ensure that testing and isolating of cases, and public health measures to prevent the community spread of COVID-19, remain in place until high levels of immunity from vaccination and/or natural infection is present. Many countries are relaxing measures such as mask-wearing and testing for vaccinated indvidiuals. If these are not in place, infection among vaccinated individuals, especially if asymptomatic or mild, are likely to go undetected and may result in spread to other individuals who are not immune to SARS-CoV-2, resulting in further waves of infection.\n\n【73】This study has some limitations. The risk of household contacts acquiring infections from non-household sources cannot be excluded, but this would be minimal due to the low number of community cases in Singapore during the study period. The index case, which is the first diagnosed COVID-19 infected person in the household may in some cases not be the true primary case of infection. However this scenario would likely be minimized due to aggressive contact tracing and establishment of transmission chains in Singapore since the first diagnosed case, and where possible the assignment of the index case would be dependent on the earliest symptom onset or likely transmission source outside of the household. The older age of vaccinated indexes could have affected the estimates of the preventive effect of vaccination on onward transmission, a confounding which was adjusted for in the logistic regression 删除2:<u>( Table 3 and Supplementary Table 4)</u>.\n\n【74】Contacts’ symptom data was based on interview by MOH contact tracers soon after index case diagnosis and may have resulted in pre-symptomatic individuals (who were asymptomatic at time of interview) being classified as asymptomatic, a misclassification which could affect the estimates of vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease and not the esimates of vaccine effectiveness against acquisition or severe illness. Chronic disease data is not routinely captured in the MOH contact tracing database and hence we were not able to adjust for chronic disease in our risk factor analysis. Multiple null hypothesis significance tests were conducted, based on potential risk factors that were deemed epidemiologically important, and so some caution should be taken in interpreting the results as no correction for multiple testing was attempted. Bonferroni correction for the logistic regression would result in the age of vaccinated indexes not meeting threshold for statistical significance but would not alter the inference with regards to fully vaccinated individuals.\n\n【75】The majority of non-Delta household indexes occurred prior to March 2021 and all the household Delta index cases occurred after March 2021, and there were differences in public measures between these time periods. The main measure potentially affecting household exposures is the increased recommendation for telecommuting 删除2:<u>(Supplementary Table 2)</u>. If there was significantly increased exposure time within the household as a result, this may contribute to over-estimation of the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant but would not be expected to bias the estimates of vaccine effectiveness or determinants of Delta variant transmission.\n\n【76】5\\. CONCLUSION\n--------------\n\n【77】Individuals exposed to the Delta variant have an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 acquisition compared to those exposed to other variants. This risk is reduced by 55% among vaccinated individuals, which shows the importance of high vaccination coverage to increase population-level immunity. Our findings suggest that vaccinated cases remain at risk of onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 Delta, and therefore it is important to continue to contain spread through testing and isolation, and public health measures to prevent widespread community transmission if significant numbers of at risk persons remain unvaccinated.\n\n【78】6\\.

Among the Chinese medical community, additional focus and consideration need to be directed towards the revised Physician's Pledge given that the current occupational environment is not ideal, particularly for junior physicians.\n\n【1】The clause “I WILL ATTEND TO my own health, well-being, and abilities in order to provide care of the highest standard” reflects the importance of physicians’ health, and for the first time it has been written into the Declaration. In China, junior physicians bear a heavy workload and their health status is of concern. More than half of physicians in China are estimated to have experienced to some extent burnout symptoms. Consequently, medical mistakes are inevitable. Therefore, provision of a more flexible working environment and occupational health promotion programmes to junior physicians is important. These provisions not only promote the health of physicians but also benefit the patients.\n\n【2】Another clause, “I WILL GIVE to my teachers, colleagues, and students the respect and gratitude that is their due”, indicates the beneficial relationship that should be established between teachers and students. In China, most senior physicians do not spend enough time communicating with their junior colleagues because of their tremendous clinical workload. This clause calls for mutual respect between teachers and students and highlights the obligation for senior physicians to teach junior colleagues. Furthermore, senior physicians and managers should strive for additional rights and interests for junior doctors; for example, junior physicians in China need 2–4 years of standardised and specialist training, but unsatisfactory training, inefficient practice, low salaries, and few opportunities for promotion are of concern. In light of these issues, the proportion of junior physicians has decreased from 31·3% to 22·6% during the past 10 years. Whether to stay or leave the medical profession is a dilemma for junior physicians in China. The Declaration for the courtesy of junior doctors is a major advance in medical humanities and will draw more attention to the professional development of junior physicians.\n\n【3】We hope the message of the modern-day Physician's Pledge will be widely disseminated and adopted globally. Additionally, we call on various stakeholders, including governments, health-care providers, and patients, to profoundly understand the essence of the pledge and make joint efforts towards addressing the challenges faced by junior physicians in the modern medical profession.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:38:19", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:38:35", "cost": 15.241}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:51", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:38:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:38:19"}

Adaptive immune responses are, however, controlled by a preceding activation of the innate immune system. We investigated whether gliadin, a protein present in wheat flour, could activate an innate as well as an adaptive immune response in patients with coeliac disease.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Duodenal biopsy samples from 42 patients with untreated coeliac disease, 37 treated patients, and 18 controls, were cultured in vitro for 3 h or 24 h, in the presence of either immunodominant gliadin epitopes (pα-2 and pα-9) or a non-immunodominant peptide ( p31–43 ) known to induce small intestine damage in coeliac disease. We also incubated biopsy samples from nine untreated and six treated patients with a non-immunodominant peptide for 3 h, before incubation with immunodominant gliadin epitopes. Different combinations of interleukin-15 or signal transduction inhibitors were added to selected incubations.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Only the non-immunodominant peptide induced rapid expression of interleukin-15, cd83 , cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2, and CD25 by CD3– cells (p=O005 vs medium alone) and enterocyte apoptosis (p<0·0001). Only the non-immunodominant peptide induced p38 MAP kinase activation in CD3– cells. Pre-incubation with the non-immunodominant peptide enabled immunodominant epitopes to induce T-cell activation (p=0·001) and enterocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of interleukin-15 or of p38 MAP kinase controlled such activity.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】A gliadin fragment can activate the innate immune system, affecting the in situ T-cell recognition of dominant gliadin epitopes. Although our findings emphasise the key role of gliadin-specific T cells, they suggest a complex pathogenic situation, and show that inhibition of interleukin-15 or p38 MAP kinase might have the potential to control coeliac disease.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【9】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【10】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【11】One-time access price info\n\n【12】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【13】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【14】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【15】### Subscribe:\n\n【16】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【17】Already a print subscriber?

However, evidence that its antirejection activity is better than that of azathioprine has been provided only by registration trials with an old formulation of ciclosporin and steroid.

We disagree with Jason Boynton and colleagues' assessment (Oct 27, 2018删除2-1:<u>, p 1514</u>) of the evidence we presented. Boynton and colleagues expressed concern that we did not establish causation for the processes through which women are disadvantaged in generating and publishing knowledge. It is outside the scope of a commentary to test for causation, and thus make causal claims. Additionally, the causes of gender disparities are complex and include both distal and proximal factors. This argument is made by Stoet and Geary, in an article that is referenced by Boynton and colleagues both in their Correspondence to _The Lancet_ and elsewhere. Recognising gender as an underlying social structure does not preclude other explanations, such as individual preferences. Understanding how gender influences personal choices is a crucial insight from feminist literature.\n\n【1】Boynton and colleagues also cite evidence of a welcoming atmosphere for women in academic hiring processes. This might be the case in some institutions, specifically where affirmative action and other strategies have been used to address systemic biases—such as gender, ability, race, sexuality, and nationality—in hiring practices. Gender biases in hiring persist and are stronger for jobs historically done by men, such as that of a scientist or professor. The historical exclusion of women from academia makes sexism in this community an unsurprising yet common phenomenon. \n\n【2】Widespread changes in the academic organisation climate might not have kept pace with changes in hiring practices. A growing body of evidence is calling for interventions to reduce gender harassment and violence in academic medicine. Research into sexual harassment and organisation climate highlights the material realities of systemic discrimination. In this context, the need for bias-reducing interventions is even more pressing.\n\n【3】Boynton and colleagues cite a 2008 selective review of academic performance in the USA as evidence that “women are outperforming men on many metrics within academia”. Test scores and grades from early childhood to post-secondary education are not relevant to our argument regarding recognition, career advancement, and publishing in academia.\n\n【4】We did not claim that implicit bias training is an effective intervention for reducing gendered bias within academia, as stated by Boynton and colleagues. We reported on evidence from a prejudice habit-breaking intervention, which included implicit association testing as part of a 2·5-hour workshop within academic departments.\n\n【5】In their objection to interventions to counter (implicit) gender bias, Boynton and colleagues cite evidence from a meta-analysis by Forscher and colleagues. The meta-analysis was designed to understand the relative effectiveness of different procedures to change implicit measures. It includes implicit measures of prejudice (eg, race and gender), as well as consumer preferences, political preferences, self-esteem and self-concept, and other variables. The type of implicit bias and the context of the measurement are important when considering relationships to real-world behaviour change. It is inappropriate to use the results of this meta-analysis as evidence to argue against training to address gender bias. We also note that Boynton and colleagues have expressed similar arguments regarding implicit gender bias elsewhere.\n\n【6】Boynton and colleagues state that “implementing interventions to address issues that have not been verifiably demonstrated (eg, systemic sexism and bias) is inherently problematic”. We strongly disagree with this assertion that systemic sexism and gender bias have not been demonstrated. The question is not if sexism exists, but rather how power structures operate in different contexts, and thus how to intervene to achieve more equitable life chances.\n\n【7】Gender bias is not the only type of social bias that is relevant to academic publishing. As Sharma and Poole state, our Comment was lacking an intersectional lens. Intersectionality—a theory and analytical tool developed by women of colour—has revealed that systemic discrimination arises not only from sexism, but also from ongoing and interlocking experiences of capitalism, classism, heterosexism, and racism. Free choice arguments function to individualise experiences and thus obscure structural inequities, including ableism, colonialism, imperialism, heterosexism, nationalism, racism, and sexism. We welcome further research into gender and other biases in the context of academia, and in academic publishing in particular.\n\n【8】删除9:<u>JC is Executive Editor, _The Lancet_ .

The mean duration between the time of migration and the onset o symptoms was about 5 years, although the range was wide. On the basis of these findings the investigators conclude that SLE is probably not as rare in west Africa as has been reported previously.\n\n【3】The incidence of SLE is recognised as being higher in black people than in white in the USA, and that SLE is common in residents of the Caribbean. resident in the UK is not surprising. These observations suggest that black Africans and those of African descent have an increased genetic susceptibility to this disease. Thus, it is surprising that this disorder has not been reported more frequently in the indigenous population of west Africa.\n\n【4】The apparent rarity of SLE in west Africa could result from a lack of recognition rather than a low incidence, with misdiagnosis of SLE as other systemic illnesses, such as HIV. However, the experience of many physicians who have practised for long periods in well established centres in west Africa with good diagnostic facilities, such as in the Medical Research Council Laboratories in The Gambia, before and since the HIV epidemic, is that SLE is a rare disease in the indigenous population of west Africa. Some west African physicians have suggested that autoimmune diseases are becoming more prevalent in the large urban centres of west Africa than in the past, but that they remain rare in rural populations. However, we are unaware of any studies that document this change.\n\n【5】To conclude that because SLE is prevalent in west Africans who have been resident in the UK for an average of 5 years that SLE must be common in west Africa but underdiagnosed is illogical. Powerful environmental factors may be at work in west Africa, such as malaria, that prevent or limit the onset of the disorder for duration of exposure. The higher frequency of SLE in black Caribbeans who had mostly been born in the UK (54 of 79) than in the west Africans, who had mostly been born outside the UK (14 of 20), is in keeping with this idea.\n\n【6】Detailed field epidemiological studies in west Africa similar to those of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis are needed for SLE.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:33:50", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:33:57", "cost": 7.344}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:51", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:33:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:33:50"}

The first study was based on the use of an in-vivo positron emission tomographic (PET) marker for activated microglia. These activated microglia are important in the brain's immune response to neuronal degeneration. Activation of these cells is accompanied by an increase in the expression of certain receptors (peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites) that can be visualised on PET scans by use of a specific ligand (carbon-11-labelled ( _R_ )- PK11195). Annachiara Cagnin and colleagues measured the binding of \\[ 11 C\\]( _R_ )-PK11195 in controls and patients with AD. In AD this binding was increased in areas (the entorhinal, temporoparietal, and cingulate cortex) that, on histological studies, are areas affected in the AD process. Follow-up of the patients with serial magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) scans over the next 12–24 months showed that the highest areas of binding were associated with areas on MR scans that had the highest rates of atrophy. From this study, there is evidence that inflammation is an early event in the pathogenesis of AD.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

New initiatives include an active programme to match access to health services with the location and needs of the population.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【2】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【3】Already registered?\n\n【4】Log in to existing account\n\n【5】Forgot password?\n\n【6】One-time access price info\n\n【7】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【8】Not yet registered?\n\n【9】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/02 17:46:38", "endTime": "2024/09/02 17:46:45", "cost": 6.756}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:51", "update_time": "2024-09-02 01:46:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 01:46:28"}

The major theme of the past year has been on strengthening the campaign for cheap antiretroviral drugs. This thrust, some critics maintain, has been to the detriment of HIV prevention efforts. Perhaps the most ambitious HIV/AIDS development in the past year has been WHO's focus on the “3 by 5” target—a commitment to provide antiretroviral drugs to 3 million people in developing countries by the end of 2005.\n\n【1】For many the “3 by 5” initiative, if successfully implemented, will bring a longer life. But how useful is this and other antiretroviral-based initiatives to those people with AIDS in the developing world who will die today, tomorrow, or in the very near future? For these people, the stark reality is that it is too late for antiretroviral treatment; what they need, yet rarely receive, is palliative care.\n\n【2】According to this year's UNAIDS/WHO update published on Nov 25, sub-Saharan Africa remains by far the region worst affected by HIV/AIDS. By the end of this year, AIDS will have killed an estimated 2·3 million people in the region. The key role of palliative care in tackling the AIDS pandemic has been acknowledged in the detail of US President George W Bush's proposal for $15 billion over five years as part of an Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. Speaking at a meeting hosted by the UK All-Party Parliamentary Group on AIDS in London earlier this month, Director of the White House Office of National AIDS Policy Joseph O'Neill emphasised that “the people of the United States have acted, and acted boldly, to support palliative care for global HIV/AIDS to the tune of $2·25 billion”.\n\n【3】O'Neill's personal commitment is evident from his involvement with the palliative-care community—for example his co-authorship of a recent survey, the first of its kind, of current practice in HIV/AIDS end-of-life care in sub-Saharan Africa 删除12:<u>( _BMC Public Health_ 2003; **3:** 33)</u>. This survey revealed, perhaps unsurprisingly, significant limitations in, and the pressing need for expansion of, palliative care in this part of the world. One weakness identified in many countries was a lack of government understanding of palliative care and absent national policies. The central role of an enlightened and informed government approach is illustrated in a report on the development and expansion of a model home-based palliative-care programme in Uganda in this week's _Lancet_ 删除2:<u>(see p 1812–13)</u>. Palliative care is now part of the Ugandan government's national health plan and morphine for the control of severe pain has been provided free since 2002. Moreover, a law soon to be passed will allow nurse specialists to prescribe oral morphine.\n\n【4】Good home-based palliative care encompasses not just the patient but also the whole family. On Nov 26, UNICEF's report, _Africa's Orphaned Generations_ , projected that by 2010, 20 million children under the age of 15 will have witnessed the sickness and death of a parent from AIDS. In many cases, the eldest child will have been the sole caregiver for the parent at the end of life. Counselling these children, and equipping them with the skills and drugs necessary to bring some relief to the parent, can help these children cope. Crucially, skilled management of pain and other symptoms also allows the dying parent to help the child. Such help might be as far-reaching as being capable of preparing a will, or as simple as being able to give a hug.\n\n【5】Advocates for the need to tackle the other pressing issues, such as antiretroviral availability, prevention, or vaccine development, may be concerned at a new AIDS cause being championed. The key point, however, is that none of these approaches individually is sufficient, and all must be addressed if HIV/AIDS is to be contained. Home-based palliative care allows access to the family members who are not infected with HIV or terminally ill with AIDS. The provision of tangibly effective care, especially pain relief, helps to break down barriers of mistrust between these communities and “outsiders”. Cheap, effective, and culturally appropriate palliative-care programmes are therefore a powerful tool for reaching vulnerable populations and so ideally should be locked into prevention and treatment programmes.\n\n【6】Palliative care with effective pain relief, and the funding it is starting to attract, presents not a threat but an advantage to more mainstream anti-AIDS activities. We urge all those involved in tackling the HIV/AIDS pandemic to seize this opportunity.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 29 November 2003\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14937-9</u>\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Unfortunately, the pandemic is likely to have far-reaching negative effects on LGBTQ health and wellbeing.\n\n【1】Before COVID-19, LGBTQ youth bore a disproportionate burden of mental health problems, with their sexual and gender identity being risk factors for victimisation, trauma, discrimination, and abuse. Also, LGBTQ youth, especially non-binary and transgender youth, are at a higher risk for depression, suicide, substance use, and anxiety. COVID-19 control measures, such as lockdowns, working from home, school shutdowns, and remote learning, are likely to have exacerbated these mental health disparities. Although knowledge on the long-term impacts of COVID-19 on the mental health of LGBTQ youth is still evolving, preliminary research suggests that LGBTQ youth are disproportionately affected by the pandemic. Moreover, LGBTQ youth who live in unsupportive homes are vulnerable to abuse, do not feel safe to express themselves, or are cut off from supportive peers. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 50% of sexual and gender minority youth in the USA have reported increased anxiety or depressive symptoms. Factors likely to be implicated in such findings are isolation from support systems, absence of family support (only 33% of LGBTQ youth report living in an LGBTQ-affirming home during the pandemic), and disruptions to health services. The lack of family support is especially alarming given LGBTQ youth who experience parental rejection are at increased risk of suicide and depression. Although less is known about transgender youth, research before COVID-19 suggests transgender youth experience higher rates of parental rejection than cisgender youth.\n\n【2】Additionally, youth with intersectional identities, such as Black, Indigenous, and people of colour (BIPOC), people with low socioeconomic status, and homeless LGBTQ youth, are especially vulnerable during the pandemic. BIPOC and low socioeconomic status LGBTQ youth may also have diminished access to services due to barriers resulting from the combination of their sexual and gender identity, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Furthermore, Asian and Pacific Islander LGBTQ youth in the USA may experience an increase in abuse and discrimination given the uptick in anti-Asian rhetoric and hate crimes in the past year. Addressing the disproportionate toll of COVID-19 on LGBTQ youth is therefore of urgent concern.\n\n【3】Crucially, the pandemic has disrupted mental health services at a time when the need for such services has increased, with young people and school-based services being especially affected. LGBTQ youth have been affected by these disruptions. For example, transgender and gender diverse youth report substantially more unmet needs and disruptions in mental health and substance use services than cisgender youth. Additionally, LGBTQ youth and young adults will have reduced access to essential counselling, identity-based resources, and physical and mental health support programmes due to the closures of schools and universities, which often provide such services. Moreover, school-based mental health services in high-income countries are predominantly used by BIPOC, homeless, and low socioeconomic status LGBTQ youth, making school closures especially harmful for intersectional LGBTQ youth. Although the reopening of schools can mean returning to supportive communities and spending less time in isolation or in an abusive or unsupportive home, in-person schooling can also mean returning to school-based trauma for some individuals. Parents, school administrators, teachers, and clinicians must be aware of the heterogeneity in experiences of LGBTQ youth and the impact the return to in-person schooling could have on LGBTQ youth.\n\n【4】Health practitioners, researchers, teachers, policy makers, and community members all have a role in supporting the mental health of LGBTQ youth. First, health practitioners need training on LGBTQ-affirming care and the unique issues LGBTQ youth may be facing due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Training should be intersectional and include topics such as identity development, non-stigmatising language, and the specific concerns and needs of LGBTQ youth. Health providers should continue providing confidential telehealth services for youth who do not have access to in-person services while recognising the potential privacy issues for youth living in unsafe or uncomfortable environments. Second, school leaders and administrators must provide and promote safe, inclusive spaces for LGBTQ youth as they return to school, including the provision of in-person and online mental health services, LGBTQ-affirming education and resources that LGBTQ youth can access (eg virtual communities, text-based mental health support platforms, and local identity-based organisations), and help educate parents and families. Schools with affirming, safe environments empower LGBTQ youth and strengthen resilience. Third, evidence-based policy and interventions should include LGBTQ-specific language and issues and increase access to affordable and affirming services. Addressing structural barriers, including prejudiced and discriminatory institutions and policies, is also essential.\n\n【5】Finally, a knowledge gap on LGBTQ youth issues continues to persist in health research. Studies should be better designed to accurately and comprehensively capture the health and wellbeing of LGBTQ youth. LGBTQ youth mental health is a global issue and research should reflect and investigate the experiences of LGBTQ youth in low-income and middle-income countries. Researchers should collaborate with LGBTQ populations and LGBTQ health experts and provide options to disclose sexual and gender orientation when collecting sociodemographic data. Studies should aim to comprehensively understand the diverse and evolving needs of LGBTQ youth as they navigate the pandemic; better research better informs policies to improve the health and wellbeing of LGBTQ youth. We must create spaces that foster resilience and agency for LGBTQ youth in our communities and institutions. Ultimately, we must engage with LGBTQ youth to design effective, participatory solutions that protect youth from COVID-19-related mental health outcomes and build a better, healthier future for all.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2022 FatCamera/Getty Images</u>\n\n【6】删除9:<u>CKO and FW are supported by the Division of Intramural Research, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, US National Institutes of Health (NIH).

One way to circumvent the first barrier might be to target the host cell pathways that HIV requires for its replication instead of viral proteins. A recent study shows that inhibition of inducible T-cell kinase (ITK; a tyrosine kinase involved in T-cell activation and other cellular processes used by HIV during its infection of T cells) blocks multiple steps of HIV replication, including viral entry and transcription, and virion assembly/release. Thus, ITK might be an ideal target for new anti-HIV drugs. In a second study, researchers describe the synthesis of large amounts of prostratin, a compound that activates latent HIV. Until now, the development of prostratin and related compounds as adjuvants for existing antiretroviral drugs has been slow because they could only be isolated in small amounts from a few plants. The new method means that prostratin and its analogues can now be easily made from renewable sources such as croton seeds.\n\n【2】Poxvirus cell entry\n-------------------\n\n【3】How do poxviruses (large enveloped DNA viruses) enter their host cells? A live cell imaging study suggests that vaccinia virus “tricks” its host cells into internalising it by incorporating phosphatidylserine into its viral membrane. Apoptotic cells have this lipid in their membranes, so the host cells mistakenly recognise the viral particle as a dead cell and engulf it using macropinocytosis (a form of endocytosis that internalises large particles). Macropinocytosis of apoptotic debris suppresses the activation of innate immune responses so this entry route may help poxviruses avoid immune detection during viral spread.\n\n【4】Vaccinia virus uses macropinocytosis and apoptotic mimicry to enter host cells\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2008 Science Photo Library</u>\n\n【5】Pathway to acute lung injury\n----------------------------\n\n【6】Many lung pathogens cause acute respiratory distress syndrome, a severe form of acute lung injury (ALI). Now, researchers report that oxidative stress and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signalling control the severity of ALI. They show, for example, that oxidised phospholipid induces lung injury in mice via TLR4 signalling and that oxidised phospholipid is produced in the lungs of people and animals infected with the H5N1 influenza virus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, and anthrax. Modulation of this key injury pathway might, therefore, prevent ALI in patients infected with these and other lethal lung pathogens.\n\n【7】Hold the antibiotics\n--------------------\n\n【8】Pneumonia, a major cause of death in children under the age of 5 years, is usually treated with antibiotics for between 7 and 14 days. However, a new systematic review suggests that a shorter course of antibiotics might be as effective. Researchers identified three studies involving 5763 children aged 2–59 months in which the efficacy of a 3-day and a 5-day treatment course with the same antibiotic (amoxicillin in two studies, co-trimoxazole in the third) was compared. The rates of clinical cure, treatment failure, and relapse did not differ between the two lengths of treatment.\n\n【9】Susceptibility to malaria\n-------------------------\n\n【10】New research suggests that loss-of-function mutations in the pyruvate kinase gene ( _PKLR_ ) may protect against severe malaria. Erythrocytes isolated from three patients homozygous for such mutations (but not those from two heterozygous relatives) were resistant to invasion in vitro by _Plasmodium falciparum_ parasites. Once infected, however, all these PLKR-deficient erythrocytes were more readily phagocytosed by macrophages than wildtype cells. Thus, PLKR-deficiency might reduce the number of infected erythrocytes that are available to bind within the microvascular beds of vital organs. Future genetic studies will test whether PLKR-deficiency has been selected for in malaria-endemic areas during human evolution.\n\n【11】Sleeping sickness biomarkers\n----------------------------\n\n【12】Early diagnosis of African trypanosomiasis is crucial for effective disease management but currently there are no good diagnostic biomarkers for this disease. Now, however, researchers have examined the temporal responses of mice to infection with _Trypanosoma brucei brucei_ using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic metabolic phenotyping of urine and plasma. Parasite infection, they report, causes reproducible, systemic biochemical effects in the host that can be detected within 1 day of infection. These findings need to confirmed in people but suggest that host metabolic changes could be used to diagnose human trypanosomiasis and to monitor its treatment.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【13】### Publication history\n\n【14】Published: June 2008\n\n【15】### Identification\n\n【16】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70122-1</u>\n\n【17】### Copyright\n\n【18】© 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In Europe and the Americas, WHO data indicate that spread of the omicron variant has resulted in 5–6 times more confirmed COVID-19 cases during the reporting weeks of Jan 10 and Jan 17, 2022, compared with highest peaks reported in previous waves. The rapid spread of omicron is attributed to multiple mutations on the spike protein that might have conferred increased host-cell receptor binding affinity and the increased ability to escape immunity induced by COVID-19 vaccination and previous infection. Host-cell analysis using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins indicated that these mutations might have resulted in the omicron variant being more infectious than the delta (B.1.617.2) variant and other variants of concern. \n\n【1】In _The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health,_ a study by Jeané Cloete and colleagues, published performed in Tshwane District of South Africa, found a rapid increase in paediatric COVID-19-related admissions to hospital (hereafter, hospitalisations) during the 6-week period from Oct 31 to Dec 11, 2021. The rapid increase in hospitalisations was accompanied by widespread community transmission of the omicron variant, as shown by COVID-19 surveillance data from multiple sources and genomic sequencing data. Although the overall number of COVID-19-associated hospitalisations in Tshwane District were lower than in previous waves, admissions among children and adolescents aged 1 years and younger were higher than at any other time during the pandemic. The authors hypothesise that this increase was due to the higher transmission potential of the omicron variant, less frequent facemask wearing among children than adults, and low vaccination rate in the paediatric population, with only children aged 12 years and older being eligible for vaccination at the time of study.\n\n【2】Among hospitalised paediatric patients (aged ≤13 years) with a primary COVID-19 diagnosis, seizures were reported in 19 (31%) of 138 patients, with only a small number having comorbid conditions (eg, epilepsy \\[n=1\\] and cerebral palsy \\[n=1\\]) that explained the seizure manifestations. In a separate multinational study of neurological manifestations by Fink and colleagues, seizures were reported in 108 (8·5%) of 1278 children hospitalised with COVID-19. The study included patients from 30 centres across North and South America. Although Fink and colleagues' study predates the omicron wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, it highlighted that seizures were not previously described as a common manifestation of COVID-19 in children. Whether or not seizures, as reported by Cloete and colleagues, are more common with the omicron variant than with the other variants of concern should be further investigated.\n\n【3】Although several studies have shown that the omicron wave is associated with a lower hospitalisation rate per infection than previous COVID-19 waves, primarily because of milder illness, the number of paediatric patients with omicron in many countries is surpassing the number of paediatric COVID-19 cases seen in those previous waves. The current study, consistent with previous research, shows the possibility that a large increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, even if milder on average, can increase the absolute number of paediatric patients with severe outcomes. These conditions can overwhelm an already strained health-care system, and be further exacerbated during seasonal increases of expected respiratory illness among children.\n\n【4】The emergence and rapid spread of the omicron variant highlights the need to continue to bolster genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, information sharing among global partners, equitable use of COVID-19 vaccination worldwide, and increased vaccine access for paediatric populations. There is a need to investigate clinical manifestations and severity of infection, including risk factors associated with severe paediatric illness, so that both treatment and prevention measures can be improved. Continuing simultaneous application of public health measures during times of high transmission is essential to minimise the burden of illness among children, including vaccine administration for children, prompt testing and isolation of infected individuals, and wider application of preventive measures such as facemask wearing, hand hygiene, cleaning, and ventilation of indoor spaces.\n\n【5】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.

Specifically, the report predicted that if antimicrobial resistance is not addressed, then by 2050, 10 million lives a year and a cumulative US$100 trillion of economic output will be at risk from the rise in drug-resistant infections.\n\n【1】According to the report, research and development into antimicrobial resistance represented less than 5% of venture capital investment in pharmaceutical research and development. Two of the key recommendations to help tackle antimicrobial resistance are the establishment of a Global Innovation Fund for early-stage and non-commercial research into antimicrobial resistance and the introduction of better incentives to promote investment in new drugs and the improvement of existing drugs.\n\n【2】However, there might be resistance to these recommendations, given competing priorities in the context of the ongoing increase in health spending, both on a per-capita basis and as a percentage of gross domestic product. These increases are showing no signs of abating, with populations ageing, medical technology advancing, and more people living with chronic illnesses, leading to concerns over the sustainability of health spending.\n\n【3】Nevertheless, a possible opportunity might be presenting itself, which, if replicated on a global scale, has the potential to not only facilitate much-needed research and development into antimicrobial resistance but could also help address climate change, another major threat to human health.\n\n【4】A bill that will lead the state to divest from fossil fuels was passed in the Irish parliament in July, 2018. Specifically, the bill commits the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (a sovereign investment fund that invests on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in Ireland) to sell its investments in global fossil fuel companies, which were valued at €318 million in June, 2017.\n\n【5】An alternative investment for this money would be the Global Innovation Fund, as suggested in the report. Although this investment might not yield the same return as, or involve greater risk than, alternative investments, it might reduce future health-care costs by helping to ensure an ongoing pipeline of effective antibiotics.\n\n【6】Although the Irish amount on its own would not be sufficient to make a substantial difference, if Ireland's lead was to be followed by other countries, then two major public health issues could be tackled simultaneously. With a little bit of creativity and some political lobbying, this scenario could offer multiple benefits.\n\n【7】删除9:<u>I declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:32:29", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:32:37", "cost": 7.511}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:51", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:32:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:32:29"}

At the World Trade Centre site, both the number and the identities of the dead must be clarified. Numbers will be difficult to establish due to disruption of bodies and the effects of fire. At this stage, we have to conclude that there will be no traces left of some bodies. Subsidiary (but nonetheless important) issues will be whether the investigations will be able to determine if, and how many, people died from inhaling fire and other fumes, or if they drowned from fractured pipes or rescue attempts, or if they died after different periods of survival. Most, however, will have died immediately from massive injuries.\n\n【1】Disaster victim identification protocols have swung into action: relatives and friends of those missing will be providing information about sex, age, height, weight, specific peculiarities (eg, scars, tattoos, circumcision, eye colour, hair features), clothing, or jewellery being worn. Disaster victim protocols require obtaining fingerprint records, if available, and dental records. Teeth are generally quite resistant to trauma and are particularly resistant to fire. Through Interpol, these data will be passed on from overseas. On Sept 14, Interpol launched an “11 September Task Force”, to coordinate international intelligence.\n\n【2】Disaster observations are made in a standard internationally approved format. Limbs and fragments of remains that cannot definitely be related to other sets of incomplete remains must be kept separate. It is in these circumstances that later DNA analysis may facilitate the collection together of an individual's remains and, if necessary, link them to DNA (or RNA) samples from the deceased, or from samples provided by blood relatives (eg, hair from combs).\n\n【3】The exercise of identifying individuals has important social and legal implications that particularly allow the next-of-kin to know for certain the fate of their loved ones. The formal mourning of their passing is obviously an important part of dealing with those catastrophic events. But the Americans have a good record in handling disaster victim identification. Next-of-kin should be reassured that it is difficult to think of any organisations who would be able to handle this situation better.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【4】### Publication history\n\n【5】Published: 22 September 2001\n\n【6】### Identification\n\n【7】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06122-0</u>\n\n【8】### Copyright\n\n【9】© 2001 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, the heterogeneity in our meta-analysis in terms of prevalence reduction cannot be solely attributed to low study quality. The effect of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) control programmes varies significantly, because of a variety of factors, including environmental conditions, water, sanitation, and hygiene, and underlying transmission intensity.\n\n【2】We disagree that our results show an opposite effect of baseline prevalence for _Ascaris lumbricoides_ and hookworm. Our results suggest that baseline prevalence has no effect on _A lumbricoides_ prevalence reduction (OR 2·7, 95% CI 0·03–239·7); whereas for hookworm, higher baseline prevalence results in lower odds of prevalence reduction (0·07, 0·01–0·77). Again, these findings are not necessarily attributable to low study quality, given known differences between the parasites in terms of environmental resilience, drug efficacy, and reinfection rates.\n\n【3】Qin and Zhuang are also concerned about the inclusion of studies with low treatment coverage. Many studies did not report treatment coverage, and of the 34 studies that did, 26 (76·5%) reported coverage greater than the WHO target of 75%. The remaining eight studies had coverage between 29·3% and 72·7%, and were all studies of mass drug administration. This would be expected to bias results comparing mass and targeted approaches towards the null.\n\n【4】We agree that cluster-randomised control trials are needed. We have conducted a pilot trial, and several large-scale trials are currently underway, such as the TUMIKIA trials in Kenya.\n\n【5】We also agree that drug resistance is an important concern, potentially more so when school-based control programmes are expanded to be community wide. Mathematical modelling can be used to investigate these issues in different transmission scenarios, and help guide discussions around optimal approaches. Strategies to decrease selective pressure on resistant phenotypes include drug combinations and alternative anthelmintics, which are important research priorities. Although mass drug administration might eventually interrupt STH transmission, the risk of benzimidazole resistance emerging before this is achieved must be carefully considered.\n\n【6】Finally, the examples presented of benzimidazole toxicity occurred after several weeks of two or three times daily treatment. In the high doses used to treat hydatid disease, the potential for severe toxicity, including hepatic dysfunction and bone marrow suppression, is recognised. However, when used for STH control, in single doses at intervals of 6–12 months, albendazole and mebendazole have been repeatedly shown to be extremely safe, with only transient mild gastrointestinal symptoms occurring in around 1% of treated individuals.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2017 Panos</u>\n\n【7】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:37:30", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:37:50", "cost": 19.314}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:51", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:37:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:37:30"}

National policy makers are now deciding which interventions to implement to achieve these targets. The TB Modelling and Analysis Consortium assessed in its TB Targets exercise how expanding control by an ambitious but feasible degree might affect the targets being achieved in China, India, and South Africa.\n\n【12】In China, sustained improvements in tuberculosis interventions led to a 70% decline in prevalence from 1990 to 2010, and by 2015, tuberculosis incidence had reached 70 cases per 100 000 population. By contrast, in South Africa, where the tuberculosis epidemic has been greatly affected by HIV dynamics, declines in tuberculosis incidence have been seen since only around 2010, and in 2015 incidence was 830 cases per 100 000. India has had relatively stable incidence of 200–300 cases per 100 000 population for the past 15 years, but faces challenges associated with a large and heterogeneous private sector that is used by many patients for diagnosis and care. By expanding government subsidies, India has attempted to improve the quality of tuberculosis care provided in the private sector.\n\n【13】The TB Targets exercise was a modelling study done to assess the hypothetical effects of specific TB interventions and showed that the 2025 targets of the End TB Strategy would not be achieved by implementing any one intervention. In India and China, targets might only be met with aggressive implementation of a comprehensive set of currently available interventions and if new and improved technologies become available. Improvements need to be made in access to high-quality tuberculosis care, diagnosis, multidrug resistance (eg, by replacing smear microscopy with molecular diagnostic techniques), adherence and treatment success rates, active case finding in the general population, and use of isoniazid preventive therapy for people taking antiretroviral therapy. A concurrent economic evaluation found that such expansion was likely to be cost-effective and would avert large numbers of deaths per incremental tuberculosis budget dollar, but might need substantial increases in funding at the time of implementation, which in India and South Africa, would lead to annual tuberculosis service costs more than doubling and rising to 3–4% of current public health financing.\n\n【14】**Research in context**\n\n【15】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【16】WHO's End TB Strategy proposes aggressive action to reduce tuberculosis incidence and mortality. Associated with those goals will be reductions in related out-of-pocket costs and impoverishment, which can be catastrophic when they place excessive economic burden on households. Although the economic burden of tuberculosis on households is known to be high, there is little evidence reported on the effects of financial-risk protection strategies in high-burden settings, such as India and South Africa. The TB Modelling and Analysis Consortium highlighted two reports on the End TB Strategy which suggested through estimation of costs incurred by patients in high-burden settings that substantial improvements in tuberculosis control could be cost-effective.\n\n【17】**Added value of this study**\n\n【18】We used models to estimate reductions in tuberculosis-related catastrophic costs with aggressive expansion of tuberculosis services in India and South Africa from 2016 to 2035. We quantified intervention effects as changes in the number of households incurring catastrophic costs, which were defined as the sum of direct medical and non-medical costs and indirect costs being more than 20% of the total household income. We estimated that improved care for drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis would lead to reductions of up to 19% in India and South Africa, and found that benefits would be greatest in the poorest households. In South Africa, the expansion of access to care through intensified case finding could decrease tuberculosis-related household catastrophic costs by up to 20%.\n\n【19】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【20】Aggressive expansion of tuberculosis services in India and South Africa could alleviate the financial burden on many patients. Nevertheless, improved social protection for people with tuberculosis will still be needed to meet the End TB Strategy target of eliminating catastrophic costs. Our results support efforts to scale up tuberculosis services and moving towards universal health coverage.\n\n【21】The TB Targets exercise suggested that expanding tuberculosis control would substantially reduce costs incurred by patients and thereby also diminish tuberculosis-related household impoverishment. This outcome would be important given the WHO's aim of universal health coverage and the fact that out-of-pocket medical costs are a leading cause of impoverishment in many low-income and middle-income countries. Survey evidence also suggests that in such settings tuberculosis leads to substantial losses in wages and work productivity for the affected individuals and their households.\n\n【22】One of the three goals of the End TB Strategy is that no patient or their household should face catastrophic costs because of tuberculosis. This goal is consistent with WHO having made protection from financial risks and prevention of medical impoverishment key elements of health-system performance and included financial protection in universal health coverage. Given the association between tuberculosis and poverty, and the recommendation to monitor related catastrophic costs, it is essential to understand how different interventions might prevent impoverishment. Traditional cost-effectiveness analysis may be complemented by extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA), which estimates the distributional and financial protection benefits to be gained by resource allocation and, hence, when combined with modeling, can explore the financial protection impact of different tuberculosis interventions.\n\n【23】We developed a mathematical model to assess whether tuberculosis-related household catastrophic costs could be reduced by expansion of tuberculosis interventions in India and South Africa, building on the TB Targets exercise and consistent with ECEA. We compared a subset of interventions highlighted by the TB Targets exercise with a base case derived from the standards of tuberculosis care in these countries at the start of the study.\n\n【24】Methods\n-------\n\n【25】### Study design\n\n【26】We did a modelling study to assess effects of different interventions on catastrophic costs related to tuberculosis in the period 2016–35. We selected India and South Africa for this study because they are both major contributors to the global tuberculosis burden but differ in HIV and tuberculosis epidemiology, approaches to tuberculosis control, mix of public and private health-care provisions, and the availability of data on costs incurred by patients; although the main TB Targets analysis also included China, we only selected India and South Africa because of the criteria specified. India has the largest national tuberculosis burden worldwide and a large private sector providing care to about half of affected individuals. South Africa has the largest tuberculosis burden per person worldwide, and HIV and tuberculosis are closely linked in this country.\n\n【27】### Intervention scenarios\n\n【28】In each country, we consulted extensively with representatives from national tuberculosis programmes to decide on the activities that would be most relevant to assess with existing tools. We selected interventions with clear information on implementation and coverage, and with detailed future scenarios based on a framework of tuberculosis programme activities 删除2:<u>( table 1 删除2-1:<u>, appendix p 2 </u>)</u>. We assessed the effects of improvement in treatment quality for drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africa and India. In India, there are many treatment providers of widely varying qualities, and, therefore, the treatment interventions allowed exploration of achievements if increased proportions of individuals with tuberculosis could access higher-quality care in this country (similar to optimum public sector care). We also assessed expansion of access to care through intensified tuberculosis screening at primary-care clinics in South Africa. In the intervention scenarios, high coverage was reached by 2025 and remained constant for 10 years over 2025–35. The models also considered local policy constraints and system capacities. \n\n【29】Table 1 Intervention scenarios for India and South Africa\n\n|  | **Activities** | **Programme targets** | **Mechanism of action for health effects** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **India** | **India** | **India** | **India** |\n| Improving treatment quality | Improved private-sector quality through provider training, supervision, regulation, and subsidies; retention of patients in care by incentives, nutritional support, and link to social welfare programmes | Initial decrease in patients stopping treatment from 10% to 5% by 2015 for DS-TB and from 11% to 5% by 2020 for MDR-TB; treatment success measured as increases in adherence from 75% to 85% and from 48% to 67%, respectively | Improved retention of patients receiving care leading to increased cure rates |\n| **South Africa** | **South Africa** | **South Africa** | **South Africa** |\n| Expanding access to care | Outreach clinics to underserved areas and symptom screening in primary care | Decrease population without access to care from 5% to zero by 2022 | Reduced duration of infectiousness and mortality risks by improved case detection |\n| Improving treatment quality | Mobile health care, follow-up of patients in the community, counselling on adherence to treatment, and improved MDR-TB staffing | Initial decreases in patients stopping treatment from 17% to 5% by 2021 for DS-TB and from 30% to 15% by 2021 for MDR-TB; treatment success measured as increases in adherence from 76% to 85% and from 52% to 67%, respectively | Improved retention of patients receiving care leading to increased cure rates |\n\n【31】DS-TB=drug-sensitive tuberculosis. MDR-TB=multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【32】In India, we took improvement in quality of treatment to mean that treatment adherence would increase from 75% to 85% for drug-sensitive tuberculosis and from 48% to 67% for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These changes would be achieved in both intervention scenarios through improved quality of private-sector treatment by provider training, supervision, regulation, and subsidies, and provision of patient-retention incentives, nutritional support, and linkage to social welfare programmes. In South Africa, we took improvement in quality of treatment to mean that treatment adherence would increase from 76% to 85% for drug-sensitive tuberculosis and from 52% to 67% for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. These changes would be achieved in both intervention scenarios through provision of mobile health care and follow-up in the community, offering patients adherence counselling and psychosocial support, and tracing of patients to avert care dropout. Additional features to achieve improved treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis would be increased staffing and decentralisation of the electronic register. We took expansion of access to care in South Africa to mean that all individuals seeking care would be screened for symptoms of tuberculosis.\n\n【33】We compared each intervention scenario with a base case, which assumed that coverage and treatment success rates at the start of the study would be maintained at a constant for the period 2016–35. The baseline trends in tuberculosis incidence and mortality projected in the base case were inferred from model calibration with 2012 survey data and past trends from 2000–15. The base case included country standards of care derived from the FIND study in India and the XTEND study in South Africa. \n\n【34】### Calculation of catastrophic costs\n\n【35】We defined catastrophic costs as the sum of direct medical costs (eg, treatment costs), direct non-medical costs (eg, transport and food during visits), and indirect costs (eg, loss of earnings) to the patient exceeding 20% of total annual household income. This definition followed that in WHO's protocol to estimate the proportion of households experiencing tuberculosis-related catastrophic costs. A simplifying assumption was made that each household could have a maximum of one case of tuberculosis.\n\n【36】We calculated household catastrophic costs for each intervention scenario and the base case. Indirect costs were estimated for the time before diagnosis of tuberculosis when patients were not taking treatment and, therefore, reductions due to interventions were quantified as estimated reductions in the time from onset of tuberculosis symptoms to diagnosis 删除2:<u>( table 2 )</u>.\n\n【37】Table 2 Parameters used to estimate catastrophic costs averted\n\n|  |  | **India** | **South Africa** | **References** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Epidemiology** | **Epidemiology** | **Epidemiology** | **Epidemiology** | **Epidemiology** |\n| Cumulative numbers (2016–35) in base case in Harvard model and TIME model | Cumulative numbers (2016–35) in base case in Harvard model and TIME model | Cumulative numbers (2016–35) in base case in Harvard model and TIME model | Cumulative numbers (2016–35) in base case in Harvard model and TIME model | Cumulative numbers (2016–35) in base case in Harvard model and TIME model |\n|  | Treated DS-TB cases | 49 785 000, 32 877 000 | 6 211 000, 5 342 000 |  |\n|  | Treated MDR-TB cases | 851 000, 1 258 000 | 160 000, 318 000 |  |\n|  | Tuberculosis-related deaths | 6 547 000, 8 210 000 | 1 316 000, 1 345 000 |  |\n| Estimated relative risk of tuberculosis, from poorest to richest quintile | Estimated relative risk of tuberculosis, from poorest to richest quintile | 1·00, 0·66, 0·50, 0·28, 0·18 | 1·00, 0·66, 0·57,0·47, 0·17 | , |\n| Estimated relative ratio of health-care use, from poorest to richest quintile | Estimated relative ratio of health-care use, from poorest to richest quintile | 0·18, 0·39,0·59, 0·80, 1·00 | 0·67, 0·75,0·83, 0·92, 1·00 | , |\n| **Direct medical costs to patients** | **Direct medical costs to patients** | **Direct medical costs to patients** | **Direct medical costs to patients** | **Direct medical costs to patients** |\n| Monthly costs (US$) | Monthly costs (US$) | Monthly costs (US$) | Monthly costs (US$) | Monthly costs (US$) |\n|  | DS-TB care (base case) | 61 | 38 | , |\n|  | MDR-TB care (base case) | 61 | 123 | , |\n|  | Improved DS-TB care | 48 | 38 | , |\n|  | Improved MDR-TB care | 48 | 123 | , |\n| Fixed costs (per visit) | Fixed costs (per visit) | 42 | N/A | , |\n| **Direct non-medical and indirect costs to patients** | **Direct non-medical and indirect costs to patients** | **Direct non-medical and indirect costs to patients** | **Direct non-medical and indirect costs to patients** | **Direct non-medical and indirect costs to patients** |\n| Average time from onset to diagnosis in base case in Harvard model and TIME model (months) | Average time from onset to diagnosis in base case in Harvard model and TIME model (months) | 11·9, 20·4 | 9·7, 9·9 |  |\n| Average time from onset to diagnosis with expansion of access to care in Harvard model and TIME model (months) | Average time from onset to diagnosis with expansion of access to care in Harvard model and TIME model (months) | N/A | 6·6, 6·9 |  |\n| Diagnosis cost per month ($) | Diagnosis cost per month ($) | 60 | 66 | , |\n| Funeral costs ($) | Funeral costs ($) | 300 | 1850 | , |\n| Annual income per capita ($) | Annual income per capita ($) | 1600 | 6890 |  |\n| Gini index | Gini index | 0·33 | 0·65 |  |\n| Distribution of annual income per capita by income quintile ($) | Distribution of annual income per capita by income quintile ($) | Distribution of annual income per capita by income quintile ($) | Distribution of annual income per capita by income quintile ($) | Distribution of annual income per capita by income quintile ($) |\n|  | 1 | <750 | <2760 | ·· |\n|  | 2 | 750–1170 | 2760–4530 | ·· |\n|  | 3 | 1170–1640 | 4530–6580 | ·· |\n|  | 4 | 1640–2320 | 6580–9630 | ·· |\n|  | 5 | \\>2320 | \\>9630 | ·· |\n\n【39】DS-TB care implies 6 months of treatment and MDR-TB care implies 24 months of treatment.

Step 1 involved collecting the number of tuberculosis cases and deaths for each intervention and year. In line with the TB Targets exercise, we used two dynamic deterministic compartmental models of tuberculosis transmission, the Harvard model developed by Menzies and colleagues and the model of the TB Impact Model and Estimates group 删除2:<u>( appendix p 1 )</u>. Both models use the following factors to stratify populations: drug-sensitive or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, treatment history for tuberculosis, HIV status, receiving antiretroviral therapy, and CD4 cell count. The Harvard model followed one age group (>15 years) and used Bayesian calibration, whereas the TB Impact Model and Estimates model tracked the whole population and used manual calibration. We used the following model outputs to estimate patient-incurred costs throughout the period 2016–35: the number of tuberculosis cases screened and diagnosed; the numbers of patients with tuberculosis who received treatment for drug-sensitive tuberculosis or for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; time from onset of tuberculosis symptoms to starting treatment; and the number of tuberculosis-related deaths 删除2:<u>( table 2 )</u>. The estimated numbers of tuberculosis cases screened, diagnosed, and treated for drug-sensitive or multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, as estimated by the models for the base case and the intervention scenarios, were distributed across income quintiles by an income distribution analysis. Data for tuberculosis prevalence and health-care use were obtained from the literature. We used case-fatality ratios to allocate tuberculosis-related deaths between people who were treated and those who remained untreated.\n\n【45】In step 2, we used the estimates of direct and indirect costs incurred by patients 删除2:<u>( table 2 )</u>, which were based on an analysis of surveys by Menzies and colleagues 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 3–7 )</u>, to assess the effects of each intervention. These estimates provided the unit cost per model output from the patient's perspective and estimated a mean cost per tuberculosis-affected household. Indirect costs compared with average income were varied by income quintile (–20%, −10%, 0, 10%, 20% in quintiles 1 to 5, respectively), and we included costs for tuberculosis-related deaths (eg, funeral costs ).\n\n【46】In step 3, we assigned an annual income for each tuberculosis-affected household, based on the income distribution defined for each tuberculosis case in step 1, drawn from a simulated γ distribution with parameters based on the country's gross domestic product per capita and Gini index 删除2:<u>( table 2 )</u>. We then determined the size of each household with a Poisson model, with the average size taken from each country's national census (four per household in South Africa and five in India). This approach allowed us to define household annual income in each quintile 删除2:<u>( table 2 )</u> and thus to which income quintile each case of tuberculosis should be assigned.\n\n【47】In step 4, we calculated the number of households incurring catastrophic costs per year and cumulatively in 2016–35, by income quintile. We combined the estimated household income for each quintile with the patient-incurred costs estimated in step 2 删除2:<u>( table 2 )</u>. To obtain the total number of cases of catastrophic costs averted by each intervention scenario, we subtracted the number of households incurring catastrophic costs in the base case from the number in the intervention scenario 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 8–9 )</u>.\n\n【48】### Further sensitivity and scenario analyses\n\n【49】We did three univariate sensitivity analyses to assess the effects of key factors, varying the following factors by 50% above and below baseline values: direct costs, funeral costs, and health-care use 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 24–35 )</u>. Furthermore, we ran a probabilistic sensitivity analysis with Monte Carlo simulations (n=100 000 trials), where time to diagnosis, health-care use, income, and costs to patients were varied simultaneously with truncated normal distributions, with input means extracted from the model outputs and 20% of those means used to calculate SDs. From these data we extrapolated 2·5 and 97·5 percentiles to determine 95% uncertainty ranges.\n\n【50】We did four scenario analyses. First, we varied the burden distribution and assumed that tuberculosis cases were equally distributed across income quintiles (ie, removing the assumption that tuberculosis would occur more in the poor). Second, we varied the distribution of health-care use and assumed equal access to care across each quintile (ie, removing the assumption that the richer patients would seek care more than the poorer patients). Third, we modified the patient-incurred costs by removing costs arising from tuberculosis-related deaths and assuming equal indirect costs across quintiles. Fourth, we changed the catastrophic costs metric by changing the threshold from 20% to 10% or 40% of total household income or by using a different threshold for each quintile (eg, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, and 40%). All costs were expressed in 2014 US$. All analyses were done with RStudio (version 1.0.136).\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【51】The funder had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

We found a substantially higher risk of catastrophic costs being incurred in the bottom 40% of households in each country, among which the prevalence of tuberculosis was highest. In India, 30–40% of all catastrophic costs were estimated to be in the bottom income quintile, and in South Africa the proportion was about 80%.\n\n【54】Table 3 Estimated numbers of households (in thousands) incurring tuberculosis-related catastrophic costs in India\n\n|  | **Total number of households (95% UR)** | **Number of households (95% UR) per income quintile** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Harvard model** | **Harvard model** | **Harvard model** | **Harvard model** | **Harvard model** | **Harvard model** | **Harvard model** |\n| Base case | 20 596 (16 848–24 278) | 8785 (8276–9203) | 5955 (4334–7394) | 4199 (3024–5449) | 1332 (920–1874) | 326 (197–512) |\n| Improvement in DS-TB care | 19 544 (15 976–23 049) | 8357 (7864–8766) | 5638 (4104–7006) | 3979 (2864–5168) | 1261 (871–1775) | 309 (187–486) |\n| Improvement in MDR-TB care | 20 475 (16 753–24 130) | 8739 (8232–9155) | 5917 (4309–7349) | 4171 (3005–5413) | 1324 (915–1860) | 324 (196–509) |\n| **TIME model** | **TIME model** | **TIME model** | **TIME model** | **TIME model** | **TIME model** | **TIME model** |\n| Base case | 21 926 (18 864–24 629) | 6757 (6442–7106) | 7101 (6370–7571) | 5383 (3854–6685) | 2036 (1425–2740) | 649 (493–826) |\n| Improvement in DS-TB care | 20 547 (17 690–23 079) | 6381 (6065–6732) | 6635 (5950–7074) | 5027 (3602–6243) | 1898 (1329–2556) | 605 (459–771) |\n| Improvement in MDR-TB care | 21 790 (18 742–24 485) | 6696 (6378–7049) | 7059 (6327–7526) | 5360 (3839–6659) | 2028 (1419–2731) | 647 (491–824) |\n\n【56】Catastrophic costs are defined as the sum of costs exceeding 20% of total household income.

Without intervention, our base case indicated that tuberculosis-related household catastrophic costs would remain substantial in India and South Africa. Improvements in the quality of care for drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis could reduce this financial burden, but even with aggressive efforts, the End TB Strategy target of no households facing tuberculosis-related catastrophic costs by 2030 would be far from being achieved in either country.\n\n【71】In the base case, the two lowest income quintiles bore most of the catastrophic costs, which is consistent with findings from other studies, for example in Nigeria and Peru. We note, though, that although the gains in financial protection would be greatest in these two quintiles, the reductions would be less than 20%. Other policy actions, therefore, will be needed to reduce tuberculosis incidence and mortality. In India, the interventions included some payments to patients with tuberculosis to lessen the direct costs of accessing care, but these were not sufficiently large to combat the high indirect costs incurred. Tuberculosis is a debilitating illness that lasts long enough to adversely affect earning potential and, therefore, additional support is needed to alleviate these costs if households are to be protected. Based on a framework of tuberculosis programme activities and extensive discussions with national tuberculosis programme representatives, we studied the interventions of improved care for drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and expanded access to care through intensified case finding. Assessment of other interventions, such as expanding existing national social protection schemes for the poorest households and vulnerable populations, however, would be worthwhile, as has been proposed by WHO and partners of the newly established Health and Social Protection Action Research and Knowledge Sharing Network. The interventions we studied were focused on the delivery of core tuberculosis services, but in the future we might consider assessing systemic interventions that could reduce financial costs, such as decentralised care, fees, and transport support. Intervention coverage is only one element among many, including quality and financial architecture of health systems, that can improve care-seeking behaviour and health. The multifaceted benefits of tuberculosis interventions within the context of broader social development are intrinsically important to reductions in illness-related impoverishment. \n\n【72】Our study builds on the substantial work of the TB Targets exercise, including the use of two dynamic models of tuberculosis transmission. Yet, our analysis had several limitations. First, we relied on modelled estimates of tuberculosis incidence and cost inputs and on distributional assumptions. The lack of empirical evidence in these inputs points to the need for expanded data collection. Gathering information on tuberculosis-related costs and time losses for patients and caregivers will be very important. Tracking out-of-pocket expenditure and related catastrophic costs over time could enable testing of the effects of policies in terms of poverty reduction with the existing research platforms of randomised controlled trials or household surveys.\n\n【73】Second, our estimation of tuberculosis-related household catastrophic costs was rudimentary. For example, we did not consider which member of the household was affected (eg, if the main earner had tuberculosis rather than other members of the household, catastrophic costs might have been more likely) because age-stratified tuberculosis incidence was not available from the model outputs. However, how tuberculosis-related income losses by age could be differentiated without adding unnecessary complications and assumptions in the absence of empirical information is unclear. We applied the simplifying assumption of one tuberculosis case per household, whereas the number of cases might be concentrated in specific households, such as those of the poorest and most marginalised populations. Additionally, variation in indirect costs with income has a consequence on public policy valuation (ie, by placing a higher value on time losses among the higher income quintiles than those in the lower quintiles). These effects might make interventions that benefit people in the top quintiles seem to be most cost-effective, which would have implications for equitable access to care. Other elements the models might have included were financial implications related to death (eg, long-term income losses), multiple medical cost inputs (eg, because richer individuals often seek private care), discounting and income growth over time, and the presence of social-protection programmes (eg, paid sick leaves). These adjustments, though, might have led to unnecessary complexity in the findings without providing any additional insight.\n\n【74】Third, we represented financial protection in terms of cases of catastrophic costs averted. Other possible measures could have been cases of poverty or forced borrowing avoided. We chose household catastrophic costs averted because of its simplicity and widespread use, but this approach has some drawbacks, such as exclusion of some individuals through the choice of threshold (eg 20% of total income). We used the sensitivity analyses to try to lessen this effect.\n\n【75】Fourth, while the use of two models was a strength of this study because it allowed us to consider some uncertainty in the model structure, full characterisation of uncertainty in estimates was not possible and, therefore, our findings should be interpreted with caution. Owing to the many unknowns in the intervention scenarios we assessed, we used univariate sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses to assess the effects of key factors, and did a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to determine the 95% uncertainty ranges.\n\n【76】Irrespective of potential limitations, we believe this study has some robust and important findings. First, substantial financial household burden is incurred because of tuberculosis in India and South Africa, with millions of households being affected. Second, improved tuberculosis control through implementation or expansion of selected services, such as those included in our models, could alleviate a notable proportion of that burden and disproportionately benefit the poorest households. Tuberculosis control alone, though, while necessary, will not be sufficient to achieve the End TB Strategy targets because the indirect costs are high. Other social-protection strategies and safety nets actions will be needed to substantially reduce catastrophic costs. In this respect, future work should estimate the additional financial resources needed to eliminate catastrophic costs by 2030, and assess whether governments should cover the full social cost of tuberculosis treatment for at-risk households in India and South Africa. This study has illustrated what financial protection might be achieved with various scenarios, but, importantly, our analysis remains only a stepping stone towards the essential process of involving policy makers and academics, who must make their own assessments of model assumptions so that our findings can best inform the policy dialogues in India and South Africa, particularly regarding feasibility, affordability, and value for money, and reflect the true scenarios of tuberculosis control in the two countries.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【77】SV and AV conceived and initiated the study.

The relevant proven intervention—breastfeeding counselling—is not identified, and mention is made only of breastfeeding, which is not an intervention, and breastfeeding promotion, which by itself lacks effectiveness.\n\n【1】Breastfeeding counselling, in which mothers receive skilled help to optimise practices, and related education dramatically increases rates of initiation and exclusive breastfeeding. Input is needed proactively, antenatally and postnatally, at times when a mother expects it, not just reactively when she experiences difficulties. The more contacts mothers have, the more likely they are to breastfeed. The new WHO child growth standards, which show faster growth in the early months, are based on breastfed children whose mothers received frequent support.\n\n【2】Infant feeding might improve with behavioural and social change, but supportive health-care practices are a prerequisite, and should be a Countdown imperative. Breastfeeding counselling and education can be included with scheduled antenatal care, immunisation, and growth monitoring; and implemented with existing packages such as skilled attendance at delivery, and postnatal and newborn care.\n\n【3】However, infant feeding must be specified as part of the package, appropriate tasks described and taught, and the procedure recorded; if not, care might focus entirely on the mother's health, or on detection and management of newborn illnesses. One cannot assume that, just because there is an opportunity for breastfeeding counselling, anything useful will happen.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflict of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:43:53", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:44:01", "cost": 8.558}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:51", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:44:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:43:53"}

But why are two different names used to refer to these neurotransmitters? The reason for the dual nomenclature lies in the fact that these molecules were first described independently in 1998 by two different research groups.\n\n【1】De Lecea and colleagues, using directional tag PCR subtraction—a method of isolating clones of mRNAs that are enriched in a target tissue compared with a second tissue—isolated a hypothalamus-specific mRNA that encoded the putative precursor of a pair of proteins that shared aminoacid identities with the gut hormone secretin. Owing to the hypothalamic location, and the similarity to the secretins, the group coined the terms hypocretin 1 and hypocretin 2 to describe these proteins.\n\n【2】Meanwhile, Sakurai and colleagues, using a systematic biochemical search for endogenous peptide ligands for multiple orphan G protein-coupled cell surface receptors, also described two proteins derived from a single precursor molecule. These peptides bound to and activated two orphan G protein-coupled receptors but had no structural similarity to known families of regulatory proteins. Owing to the observation that central administration of these peptides to rats stimulated food consumption, the group coined the terms orexin A and orexin B, from the Greek word _orexis_ , meaning appetite.\n\n【3】Nearly 20 years on, the debate around which term to use is still ongoing.

At current levels of health system performance (including access and referral), 6·1 million (44·9%) of these children will be undiagnosed. Between 2020 and 2050, 11·1 million children will die from cancer if no additional investments are made to improve access to health-care services or childhood cancer treatment. Of this total, 9·3 million children (84·1%) will be in low-income and lower-middle-income countries. This burden could be vastly reduced with new funding to scale up cost-effective interventions. Simultaneous comprehensive scale-up of interventions could avert 6·2 million deaths in children with cancer in this period, more than half (56·1%) of the total number of deaths otherwise projected. Taking excess mortality risk into consideration, this reduction in the number of deaths is projected to produce a gain of 318 million life-years. In addition, the global lifetime productivity gains of US$2580 billion in 2020–50 would be four times greater than the cumulative treatment costs of $594 billion, producing a net benefit of $1986 billion on the global investment: a net return of $3 for every $1 invested. In sum, the burden of childhood cancer, which has been grossly underestimated in the past, can be effectively diminished to realise massive health and economic benefits and to avert millions of needless deaths.\n删除4:<u>\n• View related content for this article</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【2】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【3】Already registered?\n\n【4】Log in to existing account\n\n【5】Forgot password?\n\n【6】One-time access price info\n\n【7】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【8】Not yet registered?\n\n【9】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:33:14", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:33:47", "cost": 33.359}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:50", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:33:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:32:54"}

At the end of her preclinical undergraduate years at the University of Cambridge, she studied social and political sciences and sometimes struggled to see a future in medicine. “However, I loved studying political philosophy and social psychology, and I hoped to take these subjects further somehow in my career,” says Johnson, now director of England's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Mental Health Policy Research Unit (PRU).\n\n【1】One reason why she went to the University of Oxford for her clinical medical studies was because it had excellent psychiatry teaching, and she really enjoyed a placement at the Warneford Hospital. She also worked on the student Nightline, a telephone help service for students in distress. After finishing her medical degree she then spent a very happy year at the London School of Economics doing an MSc in Social Psychology, training she describes as “still a big influence.” She did her psychiatry training at the Maudsley Hospital in south London, where she became focused on improving care for people with long-term mental health problems such as psychosis—still one of the most excluded and under-served groups in society. She quickly became involved in research projects at the Institute of Psychiatry, including the PRiSM study of community care models, and a major report on London's mental health services, working with mentor Sir Graham Thornicroft. In 1997, she had an opportunity to join Paul Bebbington, another key mentor, at University College London (UCL). She's been there ever since, obtaining a chair in UCL's Division of Psychiatry soon after returning from maternity leave in 2008.\n\n【2】Johnson explains that many people advised her to try and be an expert in one main area, “advice I completely ignored,” she says. Her career has involved applying rigorous research methods to a variety of questions that seemed a high priority for policy makers, clinicians, and service users at the time. “I've always really enjoyed bringing great researchers from different backgrounds, including early career researchers, together in innovative and collaborative projects,” says Johnson. “These days, working with researchers that have relevant lived experience has also become essential, and really enlivens and enriches our work.”\n\n【3】Major focuses of her work have been on crisis care and her field of clinical practice: early intervention in psychosis. The CORE programme, which she led with long-term collaborator Bryn Lloyd-Evans, helped define and evaluate a clear model of crisis care that has been influential in UK policy and taken up in a number of countries. “A criticism of crisis teams had been that they tend to just assess risk and dispense medication: we hope we've promoted a richer model, including good psychological and social help,” explains Johnson. In the same research programme, a study in The Lancet showed that a self-management intervention delivered by peer support workers was effective in reducing readmissions for people who had used crisis services.\n\n【4】Johnson's current focus is as director of the NIHR Mental Health PRU (alongside co-director Alan Simpson of King's College London), which aims to provide research evidence to inform policy makers. The PRU has provided the evidence for the independent review of the UK Mental Health Act, and is now analysing social interventions in mental health, crisis care models, and service models for complex emotional needs. At the time of writing (May, 2020) the team has dropped everything to provide a rapid response on COVID-19's impact on mental health care, work which includes surveying 2000 UK mental health staff regarding the challenges in delivering care during the pandemic.\n\n【5】Johnson has been developing a programme on loneliness and mental health with her research group, including a newly published feasibility trial that they are keen to take further . She leads the cross-disciplinary Loneliness and Social Isolation in Mental Health Network funded by UK Research and Innovation, which includes people in disciplines ranging from music and architecture to neuroscience and epidemiology and has initiatives to promote research in this area. She also has extensive teaching and supervising roles, leading the UCL MSc courses in Mental Health Sciences that have produced many top graduates now pursuing their own research careers, something she says “gives me great satisfaction”. She also spends a day a week in Camden and Islington NHS Foundation Trust's Early Intervention in Psychosis service, which she helped set up in 2003.\n\n【6】Outside of work she enjoys family life and a good social life with husband Justin Needle, a health policy academic at City, University of London and their son Anton. She belongs to two lively book groups and sings in a chamber choir with high aspirations, called Londinium, which has sadly been suspended by the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n【7】“In the last two years I have worked closely with Sonia through the work of the Mental Health Policy Research Unit and have come to really appreciate her talent,” says Simpson, who is also professor of Mental Health Nursing at King's College London. “She is an excellent leader, able to see the big picture while paying attention to small details that make projects successful. She can juggle multiple projects while ensuring she is inclusive of others and their ideas. Her inclusivity has extended to an impressive level of lived experience involvement in research projects and genuine warmth and generosity in hosting colleagues, friends, and neighbours when it's time for celebrations.”\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2020 Sonia Johnson</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【8】### Publication history\n\n【9】Published: August 2020\n\n【10】### Identification\n\n【11】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30293-5</u>\n\n【12】### Copyright\n\n【13】© 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, our two newer papers 3, 4 do so. They challenge preconceived ideas. We have lost sleep ourselves over how to explain the findings. H F Mizgala and M Schulzer have a common academic reaction to unpalatable findings—that of rejection and accusations of bias. Unlike other studies, however, we have a comprehensive audit trail for anyone committed to validating the MONICA publications. The Manual and quality report are on a public website 删除1:<u>( www.ktl.fi/publications/monica , accessed July 14, 2000)</u>, and data books, minutes of manuscript group meetings, and years of detailed analyses are stored electronically with some two thousand archived e-mail messages bearing witness to the care—not carelessness—with which analyses and interpretations were planned and discussed. The international collaboration achieved by MONICA with limited resources, was a major achievement. We have to satisfy all our collaborators first. Conspiracy, implied by this letter, is foreign to our inclinations, but also expensive. It was not budgeted for.\n\n【2】The MONICA coronary care paper is epitomised by the three figures (particularly figure 3) and data in tables 3 and 4, from which they were derived. The effects are such that no manipulation—what we called sensitivity analyses made an appreciable difference.\n\n【3】We address Mizgala and Schulzer's points sequentially. The initial hypothesis and reasons for extending it were stated in the opening paragraphs of the introduction and the discussion. What was acute coronary care had extended into secondary prevention. We cannot correct for putative confounders that have not been measured (discussion). Classic risk factors await a conjoint analysis. _Lancet_ readers might identify covariates we should reconsider. Initial analyses were done with absolute change in case fatality, but percentage change was substituted to make results compatible with the published paper. This doubled the size of the changes, with no effect on the outcomes. Percentage change in coronary event rates and mortality rates are used because starting values vary by a factor of eight. Absolute change would be dominated by centres with the highest rates. Mizgala and Schulzer misquote derivation of the weighted treatment score, which is from published papers 删除2:<u>删除1:<u>(see methods and appendix \\[ www.ktl.fi/publications/monica/carpfish/appendix.htm , accessed July 14, 2000\\] and discussion)</u></u>, it was the equivalent treatment score that was used for definitive analyses. The explanation of why the risk-factor and coronary-care analyses were not combined—ie, because of incompatibilities of time periods and populations between the two sets of data—is stated in the discussion. The necessarily arbitrary decisions on duration were rigorously tested by sensitivity analysis. And finally, correlation coefficients were used to illustrate relations, aided by an indication of significance 删除2:<u>(table 5)</u>, which was never critical as main study results were based on regression analyses.\n\n【4】We do not understand the correspondents' final sentence.

This knowledge is crucial to planning healthcare services. We updated algorithms defining patients with diagnoses of RA, PsA, and axial SpA in primary care and applied them to describe their incidence and prevalence in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, an electronic health record (EHR) database covering ∼20% of England.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Algorithms for ascertaining patients with RA, axial SpA, and PsA diagnoses validated in primary care EHR databases using Read codes were updated (to account for the English NHS change to SNOMED CT diagnosis coding) and applied. Updated diagnosis and synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug code lists were devised by rheumatologists and general practitioners. Annual incidence/point-prevalence of RA, PsA, and axial SpA diagnoses were calculated from 2004 to 2020 and stratified by age/sex.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Point-prevalence of RA/PsA diagnoses increased annually, peaking in 2019 (RA 0·779% \\[95% confidence interval (CI) 0·773, 0·784\\]; PsA 0·287% \\[95% CI 0·284, 0·291\\]) then falling slightly. Point-prevalence of axial SpA diagnoses increased annually (except in 2018/2019), peaking in 2020 (0·113% \\[95% CI 0·111, 0·115\\]). RA diagnosis annual incidence was higher between 2013-2019 (after inclusion in the Quality and Outcomes Framework, range 49·1 \\[95% CI 47·7, 50·5\\] to 52·1 \\[95% CI 50·6, 53·6\\]/100,000 person-years) than 2004-2012 (range 34·5 \\[95% CI 33·2, 35·7\\] to 40·0 \\[95% CI 38·6, 41·4\\]/100,000 person-years). Increases in the annual incidence of PsA/axial SpA diagnosis occurred following new classification criteria publication. Annual incidence of RA, PsA and axial SpA diagnoses fell by 40·1%, 67·4%, and 38·1%, respectively between 2019 and 2020, likely reflecting the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on their diagnosis.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Recorded RA, PsA, and axial SpA diagnoses are increasingly prevalent in England, underlining the importance of organising healthcare services to provide timely, treat-to-target care to optimise the health of >1% of adults in England.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR300826).\n\n【10】</u>\nKeywords\n--------\n\n【11】*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Psoriatic arthritis\n*   Axial spondyloarthritis\n*   Incidence\n*   Prevalence\n\n【12】**Research in context**\n\n【13】### Evidence before this study\n\n【14】To plan healthcare provision for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) in European countries, it is crucial to know the proportion of their populations diagnosed with these conditions, which age groups are most affected, and how this is changing over time.\n\n【15】We conducted a Pubmed search (until December 2021) to identify systematic literature reviews examining the global incidence and/or prevalence of RA, PsA, and axial SpA. We also searched Pubmed for observational studies examining this in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and The Health Improvement Network, which represent the main primary care electronic health record databases with national coverage available in England.\n\n【16】Four recently published systematic reviews were identified (published in 2018 for PsA and axial SpA, and 2016 and 2020 in RA). These showed considerable heterogeneity in the reported incidence and prevalence of these conditions across studies, which varied by study geography and methodology. Most research focused on RA; there was very limited published data on axial SpA. The systematic reviews demonstrated uncertainty in whether the incidence and prevalence of these conditions has changed over time.\n\n【17】One study examined trends in the incidence and prevalence of RA over time in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD. This reported that the prevalence of patients diagnosed with RA increased from 1990 to 2005, then fell and plateaued between 2007 and 2014. In contrast, incidence rates were high in the early 1990s, falling rapidly, increasing, and then falling and plateauing between 2007 and 2014. Its use of single Read codes to identify patients with RA and inclusion of historical data from the 1990s (when coding practices most likely differed and electronic health record use was less widespread) may explain some of these findings.\n\n【18】### Added value of this study\n\n【19】This study has updated validated algorithms to ascertain patients with diagnoses of the three main forms of inflammatory arthritis in primary care electronic health record databases and applied them in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum (a primary care electronic health record dataset covering approximately 20% of the English population) to generate contemporary data on their annual incidence and point prevalence.\n\n【20】It demonstrates that the prevalence of these three diagnoses has increased by at least 40% between 2004 and 2020. In 2020 >1% of all adults and >2·5% of those aged >65 years had a diagnosis of RA, PsA or axial SpA. Several factors influenced the incidence of coded diagnoses, with the annual incidence of RA diagnoses increasing by at least a quarter after its introduction into the Quality and Outcomes Framework (which reimburses practices for undertaking specific activities in patients with RA), and the incidence of all three conditions falling by ≥38% between 2019 and 2020 (notable for the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic). The introduction of new classification criteria for axial SpA was followed by an increase in its incidence, particularly in women, likely reflecting the change in disease definition to incorporate magnetic resonance imaging (in addition to plain radiograph) identified sacroiliitis. Overall, the updated algorithms we used to ascertain patients with diagnoses of RA, PsA, and axial SpA led to incidence and prevalence estimates broadly consistent with published studies, supporting their use in future research.\n\n【21】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【22】The increasing prevalence of patients diagnosed with RA, PsA, and axial SpA in English primary care between 2004 and 2020 highlights a need to ensure that NHS services are adapted accordingly. Their high prevalence amongst people aged over 65 years underlines the importance of considering older people in service provision.\n\n【23】Introduction\n------------\n\n【24】Inflammatory arthritis groups together conditions causing autoimmune-driven joint inflammation. It has three main forms, comprising rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). These are treated in a similar manner using immunosuppressive treatments, cause long-term pain and disability, and incur substantial personal and societal costs, with an estimated annual cost to the UK economy from sick leave and work-related disability for people with RA alone totalling £1·8 billion. The evidence that early immunosuppressive therapy optimises the outcomes of patients with inflammatory arthritis is considerable. Ensuring that healthcare services are optimised to deliver prompt and appropriate care to patients with RA, PsA, and axial SpA is therefore crucial. Having a detailed understanding of the proportion of the population that are diagnosed with these conditions, and how this varies by age groups and over time is key to informing healthcare delivery.\n\n【25】Several recent systematic literature reviews have examined the global incidence and prevalence of these three conditions. They demonstrate significant heterogeneity across studies in incidence and prevalence estimates, which vary substantially across geographical regions and by study methodology. The pooled prevalence estimates for RA and PsA were 0·46% (67 studies; I 2 \\=99·9%) and 0·13% (28 studies; I 2 \\=99·3%), respectively. Three studies were identified in the systematic review of axial SpA epidemiology; all estimated prevalence by screening people to establish if they met classification criteria, with prevalence estimates ranging from 0·13 to 1·4%. Identified cohort studies examining RA incidence provided conflicting results; some suggested a decline and others an increase over time. Only nine studies were identified that examined PsA incidence; the pooled incidence estimate was 8·26 per 100,000. No studies of axial SpA incidence were identified.\n\n【26】Little data exist on the incidence and prevalence of RA, PsA, and axial SpA and their trends in England. The fragmented nature of English secondary care digital systems - with NHS trusts using a variety of outdated “legacy” systems that are unable to interact with each other - means that primary care electronic health record (EHR) databases are best placed to understand inflammatory arthritis epidemiology. To date, two studies have examined RA and PsA epidemiology in two of the most used UK primary care EHR databases for research, The Health Improvement Network (THIN), and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD. Within CPRD GOLD, an analysis of the incidence and prevalence of patients receiving a Read code suggestive of an RA diagnosis reported that the prevalence increased from 1990 to 2005, then fell and plateaued between 2007 and 2014. Incidence rates were high in the early 1990s, falling rapidly from 74.6 to 35.8 per 100,000, increasing to 52.0 per 100,000, and then falling and plateauing between 2007 and 2014. Its use of single Read codes to identify patients with RA and inclusion of historical data from the 1990s (when data quality and coding practices likely differed to more recent time-periods) may explain some of these findings. Within THIN, 0·19% of the population (aged between 18 and 90 years) had received at least one Read code for PsA at some point between 1994 and 2010 ; the time-trends in prevalence were not examined. To our knowledge, no national data on the incidence and prevalence of patients diagnosed with axial SpA in England exist.\n\n【27】To use primary care EHRs for epidemiological inflammatory arthritis research, it is first crucial to develop methods that reliably define patients with these diagnoses. As primary care inflammatory arthritis diagnosis codes do not always equate with having these conditions studies in GOLD and THIN used algorithms, combining serial diagnosis codes with/without specialist prescriptions. Since their development, NHS coding has changed from Read to SNOMED CT codes, expanding the number of available diagnosis codes. The aim of this study was, therefore, to update previously validated algorithms defining patients with diagnoses of RA, PsA, and axial SpA in primary care EHRs accounting for the change in NHS coding processes and apply these in CPRD Aurum – a large primary care EHR database currently covering approximately 20% of the English population – to generate contemporary data on the incidence and prevalence of patients with diagnoses of these conditions.\n\n【28】Methods\n-------\n\n【29】### EHR database\n\n【30】Aurum contains routinely collected data from GP practices using EMIS Web EHR software. It currently includes data from 1,491 practices, 99% of which are in England.\n\n【31】### Diagnosis codes\n\n【32】89, 6, and 5 Read/SNOMED codes for diagnoses of RA, PsA, and axial SpA, respectively were generated through consensus methods involving consultant rheumatologists (ICS/SH) and GPs (CDM/HT) 删除1:<u>(details in Supplementary Table 1; code lists available in Supplementary Tables 2 to 4 and online at https://www.keele.ac.uk/mrr/codelists/otherdefinitions/ )</u>. Read Codes are a coded thesaurus of clinical terms used in the NHS since 1985 to code diagnoses, patient findings, and procedures in their EHRs. SNOMED CT is an alternative vocabulary for recording diagnoses and other clinical information in EHRs. Since April 2020 all NHS services in England have moved from Read to SNOMED CT codes.\n\n【33】### Diagnosis algorithms\n\n【34】#### RA\n\n【35】The algorithm developed in the General Practice Research Database (CPRD's predecessor) was updated to include SNOMED codes. The original algorithm has a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 86% for an RA diagnosis (in patients with ≥one RA Read code). Prior to algorithm application Read codes are grouped based on RA strength of evidence. Group 1 (“strong” evidence) comprises seropositive/erosive RA codes. Group 2 (“fairly strong” evidence) comprises “RA” codes e.g. RA of knee. Group 3 (“fairly weak” evidence) comprises codes for RA systemic manifestations e.g. Felty's syndrome. Group 4 (“weak” evidence) comprises other codes. The algorithm classifies patients as having RA if they meet one of two criteria: (1) have ≥one RA Read code and ≥one disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) prescription after the first RA code with no alternative DMARD indication (no Read code for an alternative indication for 5 years pre-first DMARD prescription); (2) have: (a) ≥two RA Read codes (on different dates); (b) no alternative diagnosis (alternative inflammatory arthritis type) after the final code; and (c) a code from groups 1/2, as opposed to 3/4.\n\n【36】To update and apply the algorithm, accounting for the move to SNOMED coding, ICS, SH, CDM, and HT allocated Read/SNOMED codes to evidence groups, devised synthetic DMARD product code lists, and identified Read/SNOMED codes for alternative DMARD indications/alternative diagnoses superseding RA 删除2:<u>删除1:<u>(Supplementary Tables 5 and 6; code lists publicly available online at https://www.keele.ac.uk/mrr/codelists/otherdefinitions/ )</u></u>. Biologic/targeted synthetic DMARDs were not considered (secondary care prescribed, and in England require previous synthetic DMARD prescriptions).\n\n【37】#### PsA\n\n【38】As the positive predictive value (PPV) of a single PsA Read code for a GP-confirmed PsA diagnosis is high (85% in THIN), we considered the presence of a single PsA Read/SNOMED code to be evidence for a diagnosis.\n\n【39】#### Axial SpA\n\n【40】Dubreuil et al concluded that two Read codes for ankylosing spondylitis (AS) ≥seven days apart optimised the PPV (88·6%) for identifying patients with a GP-confirmed AS diagnosis in THIN. We applied this in Aurum and also included non-radiographic axial SpA Read/SNOMED codes.\n\n【41】### Study sample\n\n【42】We included patients ever-receiving a Read/SNOMED code for RA, PsA, or axial SpA that were: (a) aged ≥18 years at index date (date of first inflammatory arthritis code), and (b) contributed data to English GP practices in Aurum at any time-point between 01/01/2004 and 31/12/2020.\n\n【43】### Statistical analysis\n\n【44】#### Proportion meeting diagnosis algorithms\n\n【45】The proportion of patients ever-receiving at least one Read/SNOMED code for RA and axial SpA and currently contributing data who fulfilled the algorithms was determined annually.\n\n【46】#### Demographics\n\n【47】In patients ever-meeting the RA algorithm, their age (at end of calendar year) and sex were summarised in each calendar-year they contributed data to using means/proportions. This was repeated for PsA and axial SpA.\n\n【48】#### Incidence and prevalence\n\n【49】Annual incidence of RA diagnosis was calculated per 100,000 person-years at risk (with 95% confidence intervals \\[CI\\]). The denominator was all adults (aged ≥18 years) registered during the calendar-year specified who were never coded as having RA before the 1 st of January of that calendar-year, or in those patients first registered in the preceding calendar-year, within 365 days of registration date. The numerator was patients meeting the RA diagnosis algorithm during that calendar-year. The point-prevalence of RA diagnosis in each calendar-year was calculated with 95% CIs. In each calendar-year, the denominator was all adults (aged ≥18 years) registered on the 31st December of that calendar-year. The numerator was all patients meeting the RA diagnosis algorithm prior to/on the 31st December of that calendar-year. Annual incidence and point-prevalence was further reported stratified by age and sex, and further reported stratified by age in males and females separately (merging age groups containing <5 individuals in line with CPRD requirements). This was repeated for PsA and axial SpA.\n\n【50】To ensure temporal changes in incidence/prevalence were not due to confounding arising from changes in English population age/sex structure, we calculated age- and sex-standardised diagnosis incidence and prevalence for each calendar-year, using the 2020 English population structure as a reference.\n\n【51】#### Frequency of diagnosis codes used in incident diagnoses\n\n【52】Frequency counts for each initial Read/SNOMED code used in patients with an incident diagnosis of RA, PsA, and axial SpA in each calendar year were calculated.\n\n【53】### Statistical programmes\n\n【54】Data management and analysis was conducted in R/Stata/MP version 17.0.\n\n【55】### Patient and public involvement\n\n【56】We are co-designing dissemination messages with a patient advisory group comprising four public contributors with inflammatory arthritis.\n\n【57】### Ethics\n\n【58】CPRD has ethics approval from the Health Research Authority to support research using anonymised patient data. As patients contributing data to CPRD cannot be identified from the data made available to researchers, individual patient consent is not required. The study was approved by the CPRD Research Data Governance Process (ref 20\\_000244; protocol made available to this manuscript's reviewers).\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of funding source\n\n【59】The funders played no role in the writing of the manuscript or the decision to submit it for publication.\n\n【60】</u>\nResults\n-------\n\n【61】### Number of diagnosis codes and proportion meeting diagnosis algorithms\n\n【62】#### RA\n\n【63】The number of patients ever receiving an RA Read/SNOMED code and contributing data in that calendar year increased from 63,781 in 2004 to 107,168 in 2020.

These time-periods are notable for RA's inclusion in the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) in 2013, and England's COVID-19 pandemic (onset March 2020).\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 **Annual incidence and point-prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis diagnoses** .</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【74】Panel A = annual incidence; Panel B = incidence stratified by sex (<5 patients had indeterminate sex recorded and were excluded from this analysis); Panel C = incidence stratified by age-bands (<25: < 25 years; 25-35: ≥25 to <35 years; 35-45: ≥35 to <45 years; 45-55: ≥45 to <55 years; 55-65: ≥55 to <65 years; 65-75: ≥65 to <75 years; >75: ≥75 years); Panel D = overall prevalence; Panel E = prevalence stratified by sex (<5 patients had indeterminate sex recorded and were excluded from this analysis); Panel F = prevalence stratified by age-bands (<25: < 25 years; 25-35: ≥25 to <35 years; 35-45: ≥35 to <45 years; 45-55: ≥45 to <55 years; 55–65: ≥55 to <65 years; 65-75: ≥65 to <75 years; >75: ≥75 years); py = person-years; CI = confidence interval.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【75】Annual incidence of RA diagnosis in females was approximately twice that in males 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 删除2-1:<u>; Supplementary Table 13</u>)</u>.

In patients with an incident PsA diagnosis three codes accounted for most used; all mapped to one SNOMED concept ID (preferred term of “psoriasis with arthropathy”). In 2020, these accounted for 98.8% of initial codes. In people with an incident axial SpA diagnosis, most (>98%) initial codes from 2004 to 2013 were for “ankylosing spondylitis”. From 2014 this declined, with codes for “axial spondyloarthritis” increasingly used (accounting for 31.5% of codes in 2020). Codes for “non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis” were rare but increased over time (accounting for 2.9% of codes in 2020).\n\n【99】Discussion\n----------\n\n【100】This national study, which utilised EHR data from over 1,400 general practices spanning 20% of England and updated validated algorithms defining patients diagnosed with RA, PsA, and axial SpA, has demonstrated an increased annual prevalence of diagnosed inflammatory arthritis, which rose by 42·5%, 96·6%, and 39·5% for RA, PsA, and axial SpA, respectively, between 2004 and 2020. Whilst this has probably arisen, at least in part, from improvements in recognising patients with inflammatory arthritis and better coding practices, the fact that the prevalence has increased most in older age groups suggest that a key driver for the increasing prevalence we observed is that many people diagnosed with these conditions live with them for many years. This has important implications for health services, with rheumatology departments accounting for approximately 9% of the average NHS trust's total medication 2019/2020 spend (due to the widespread prescribing of high-cost biologic drugs to treat inflammatory arthritis) and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) advocating that patients with RA receive advice within 1-working-day of contacting rheumatology services for disease flares/treatment side-effects, alongside comprehensive rheumatology-coordinated annual reviews. Furthermore, the fact that one of these conditions is now a recognised diagnosis in >2·5% of people aged ≥65 years highlights the importance of considering older people in planning inflammatory arthritis healthcare services, and ensuring that the rapid move to digital healthcare does not detrimentally affect them (with older people less likely to have internet access, use the internet, and possess the essential digital skills to access it independently).\n\n【101】We identified three national developments corresponding to time-periods when trends in the annual incidence of new diagnoses changed for the various forms of inflammatory arthritis. First, is RA's 2013 introduction into the QOF component of the GP contract, which aligned with a sustained incidence increase. QOF reimburses practices for specific activities, which for RA included maintaining a register and evaluating cardiovascular/fracture risks. It is recognised that including conditions in QOF affects their diagnosis coding (making it more specific) and prevalence estimates. Our finding may reflect increased efforts by primary care to enter RA diagnosis codes on receiving rheumatologist's letters detailing incident cases, alongside actively searching for patients with unrecorded prevalent RA. Whilst highly-probable this increase is artefactual, the result – better primary care RA diagnosis recording – is likely to lead to better patient outcomes. Second, is the introduction of new PsA and axial SpA classification criteria, which aligned with sustained increases in their annual incidence of new diagnoses. Whilst classification criteria are not diagnostic criteria, in clinical practice physicians often use such criteria to support diagnostic decisions, and both criteria provide a broader concept of what these conditions represent (with ASAS criteria incorporating MRI-demonstrated sacroiliitis, and CASPAR criteria extending the presence of psoriasis to family members). Third, is the COVID-19 pandemic onset, following which a marked reduction in the incidence of all evaluated forms of inflammatory arthritis occurred. Many studies have focused on the pandemic's direct impacts on patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs), demonstrating an increased risk of COVID-19 infection compared to the general population, but few have considered its indirect impacts. Two surveys suggest this is substantial, with 58% of rheumatology healthcare professionals perceiving a longer interval between IRD symptom onset and initial consultation during the pandemic, and a 13·6% reduction in adults with rheumatic diseases being in full-time employment during the pandemic. Our study provides indirect evidence of the pandemic's impact on the national care of people with RA, PsA, and axial SpA, with the marked decline in the annual incidence of new diagnoses at the onset of the pandemic suggesting many cases may have gone undiagnosed during 2020.\n\n【102】In contrast to classification criteria for PsA and axial SpA, we did not observe any clear relationship between the introduction of the 2010 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for RA and changes in the annual incidence of RA diagnoses. Whilst the annual incidence of RA diagnoses was slightly higher in 2011 and 2012 compared to 2010, the increase was minimal; it then markedly increased in 2013 when RA was included in QOF. Our findings in 2011 and 2012 suggest that the updated RA classification criteria did not substantially impact on the rates of incident RA diagnoses, replicating previous research in CPRD GOLD. One potential explanation for these findings is that clinicians were already applying the classification criteria's principles (early diagnosis through considering acute phase response markers, anti-CCP status, and small joint involvement). Alternatively, it may be that they did impact on incidence rates, but this was delayed by several years until 2013, by which point their effect occurred concurrently with the impact of QOF.\n\n【103】We observed a change in the sex distributions of people with diagnoses of PsA and axial SpA over time. The greater increase in the annual incidence of PsA diagnosis in women than men replicates North American and Taiwanese studies but is not easily explainable. The increase in annual incidence of axial SpA diagnosis in women but not men beginning the year after ASAS classification criteria publication (introducing the concept of non-radiographic axial SpA) is consistent with other studies indicating that whilst AS is male-predominant, non-radiographic axial SpA is commoner in women. Our finding of a gradual increase in the frequency of codes for “axial spondyloarthritis” amongst people with incident axial SpA diagnoses (with a corresponding decline in the frequency of codes for “ankylosing spondylitis”) indicate that this broader disease definition is being used in primary care.\n\n【104】We did not include patients with diagnosis codes for both psoriasis and axial SpA in our definition of having a diagnosis of PsA. The issue of how to classify axial involvement in patients with psoriasis is an area of ongoing debate, with uncertainty existing as to whether patients with psoriasis and inflammatory axial disease should be diagnosed as having “PsA with axial involvement” or “axial SpA with psoriasis”. This issue is currently the subject of an international collaborative study (the Axial Involvement in Psoriatic Arthritis \\[AXIS\\] study) whose aim is to develop classification criteria and a unified nomenclature for axial involvement in PsA. However, as primary care coding practices now generally focus on the inputting of inflammatory arthritis codes on receipt of a rheumatology department letter confirming their presence, it would be expected that the coded diagnoses in Aurum would largely match those made on rheumatologists’ letters, with patients assigned a diagnosis of PsA or axial SpA accordingly.\n\n【105】The most recent data on English RA incidence/prevalence is from CPRD GOLD, with an incidence of patients with a Read code suggestive of an RA diagnosis of 38·1/100,000 person-years and point-prevalence of 0·67% reported in 2014. In our study, the incidence of RA diagnoses in 2014 was 50·5/100,000 person-years and point-prevalence 0·713%. Whilst marginally higher, it is well recognised that RA incidence and prevalence estimates vary by methodology, our results are within the range reported, and have expected age and sex distributions (being commoner with increasing age and in females). On a global level, PsA prevalence is well-described, with a systematic literature review and meta-analysis reporting a pooled prevalence of 0·133% (range 0·02% to 0·67%). In England, in the THIN database, 0·19% of the population (aged between 18 and 90 years) had received at least one Read code for PsA at some point. In our study, PsA diagnosis annual point-prevalence ranged from 0·145% to 0·287%. Limited data on English PsA incidence exist. In other countries, PsA incidence ranges from 3·02 to 41·30/100,000 ; our estimated annual incidence in English primary care was 10·8 to 17·2/100,000 person-years. Comparing our axial SpA results to published studies is challenging, as most evaluated AS and those considering the broader concept of axial SpA (including patients with both AS and non-radiographic axial SpA) often estimated prevalence by screening people. These reported an overall AS prevalence of 0·18% and incidence of 0·44 to 15/100,000 person-years, and UK axial SpA prevalence of 0·3%. Whilst our estimates are at the lower end of these statistics, a North American EHR study using similar methods – an algorithm to identify patients with a diagnosis of axial SpA that required serial diagnosis codes – estimated axial SpA prevalence in 2009 to be 0·107%, similar to our English 2009 prevalence (0·09%). Overall, our incidence and prevalence estimates are broadly consistent with published studies, supporting the accuracy of our approach to ascertain patients with diagnoses of RA, PsA, and axial SpA.\n\n【106】Our study's strengths are its systematic approach to determining diagnosis code lists, evaluation of large patient numbers across England (optimising generalisability), and assessment of the three commonest forms of inflammatory arthritis simultaneously. It has several limitations. First, as we could not access unstructured text (generally unavailable for research) or participant's secondary care records we could not be entirely certain patients had inflammatory arthritis. However, we updated previously validated algorithms demonstrated in other primary care EHR databases to perform well at correctly identifying patients with these conditions, our approaches produced incidence/prevalence results broadly consistent with published studies and identified expected age and sex distributions. Second, there was an absence of data on secondary care prescribed biologic and targeted synthetic DMARDs, although as synthetic DMARD prescriptions were only considered in the RA algorithm, and within England it is a prerequisite that patients with RA receive at least two synthetic DMARDs before progressing to receive a biologic/targeted synthetic DMARD, we do not consider this impacted on the RA algorithm's performance. Third, our diagnosis algorithms will inevitably misclassify some people. This is particularly relevant to those with axial SpA, with only 56·6 to 62·7% of people with an axial SpA Read/SNOMED code having a second code after ≥seven days. This is very similar to the proportion (57·1%) in the THIN-based diagnosis algorithm development study. Whilst requiring a second code optimises the PPV, it will inevitably reduce sensitivity and the decision on whether to use this algorithm in future studies of axial SpA depends on their context.\n\n【107】In conclusion, the algorithms we used to ascertain patients with diagnoses of RA, PsA, and axial SpA led to incidence and prevalence estimates broadly consistent with published studies, supporting their use in future research, and demonstrating that the recording of diagnoses of these three conditions is increasingly prevalent in England, particularly in those aged ≥65 years. This latter finding underlines the importance of organising healthcare services in England to provide timely, treat-to-target inflammatory arthritis care to optimise the health of over 1% of adults, in a manner that is acceptable to older people.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【108】ICS, CDM, and KPJ were involved with funding acquisition.

Removal of these tumours results in complete reversal of these biochemical defects. However, because these tumours are small, slow-growing, and frequently situated in unusual anatomical sites, conventional imaging techniques often fail to detect them. Since mesenchymal tumours express somatostatin receptors, we postulated that somatostatin analogues would be able to detect these tumours. We did Indium 111 labeled pentetreotide imaging in seven patients with oncogenic osteomalacia. In five patients, we identified a mesenchymal tumour, and clinical improvement occurred after tumour resection. Our findings suggest that 111 In-pentetreotide imaging effectively detects occult mesenchymal tumours and facilitates surgical treatment of oncogenic osteomalacia.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

For lifelong surveillance to be a reasonable alternative to mastectomy, almost all cancers must be found at the pre-invasive or early invasive stage, when the cure rate is over 90%.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

For decades, Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan—known as the Golden Crescent—dominated the global opium market as a major hub for production and trafficking. However, production shifted to Afghanistan in the 1970s after opium was banned in Turkey and other countries in the Golden Crescent. By 1989, opium had become one of Afghanistan's leading exports, supplying a third of the world's opium. Opium cultivation has been a major contributor to political instability in Afghanistan, fueling violence, civil war, and corruption. Indeed, it has led to the growth of a shadow economy that generates substantial income for criminal networks and insurgent groups and enables them to fund their activities and operate with relative impunity. For example, the Taliban, who initially gained control of Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, allowed warlords to continue opium production in exchange for loyalty and a sizeable yearly opium tax revenue. However, in 2000, they briefly banned it, declaring it “un-Islamic” and harshly penalized farmers who continued to grow the crop. Following the Taliban's collapse in 2001, various hands-on (e.g. poppy crop eradication) and hands-off tactics (e.g. alternative crop incentive schemes) were used by the USA, the UK, and the Afghan government in their war on drugs in the country. However, opium production did not shrink; instead, opium cultivation increased from an average of 60,000 ha between 1994 and 2001 to a record high of 330,000 ha in 2017. In 2021, the opiate economy accounted for up to 14% of Afghanistan's gross domestic product (GDP), making opium cultivation and trade a major economic source. Given that Afghanistan's GDP further contracted in the following year, the opiate economy has likely constituted a larger proportion of its total economy in 2022.\n\n【1】Despite the turmoil, political instability, insurgency across the country, as well as American commitment to a War on Drugs model, the post-Taliban era in Afghanistan was marked by successful implementation of harm reduction measures. In 2003, the Afghan government recognized harm reduction as an important intervention for its National Drug Control Strategy with explicit supportive references in national policy documents. Later, in 2005, the Ministry of Public Health and the Ministry of Counter Narcotics jointly signed a National Harm Reduction Strategy and approved a wide range of harm reduction and treatment programs. The Afghan government continued to support harm reduction as a key strategy in various national policy efforts, including the National Drug Demand Reduction Policy (2012–2016) and the National AIDS Control Program, despite pushback from conservative groups promoting abstinence-based solutions in accordance with Islamic laws pertaining to intoxicants. Indeed, despite a multitude of implementation challenges, needle and syringe programs (NSP), HIV testing and counseling, and opioid agonist therapy (OAT) gained momentum with the support of civil society and international donors. By 2020, 24 NSP and 8 OAT sites were operating across the country. Notably, in 2020, Afghanistan was one of the only countries in the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region with peer naloxone distribution programs, and even managed to maintain the availability of harm reduction services during the COVID-19 pandemic through innovative take-home OAT and harm reduction kits.\n\n【2】In August 2021, the Taliban regained control in Afghanistan, leading to widespread economic and social disruptions. This has resulted in millions of newly displaced individuals, decreased access to critical healthcare services, and a need for humanitarian aid for over half of the population, especially marginalized groups including people who use drugs (PWUD). Following the resurgence of the Taliban, opium cultivation saw an overall rise of 32% (i.e. 56,000 ha), compared to the previous year. However, in April 2022, the Taliban reinstated its pre-2001 policy of criminalizing drug use as a means of enhancing its international credibility. Policies aimed at eradicating opium poppy cultivation have been unsuccessful and repeatedly proven ineffective in various global contexts. The Taliban announced the ban only a few weeks prior to harvest; its timing increased the likelihood that opium farmers, after a long season of investing resources, would refuse to comply. Since the announcement of the opium ban, the price of opium has doubled–from $116/kg in March 2022 to $203/kg in April 2022–and left many of those involved in the opium trade impoverished. These policies may also result in a shift of drug production in Afghanistan from opium to methamphetamine, a fact recognized by the Taliban government when it extended its current opium ban to cover ephedra, a flowering plant that is also an amphetamine precursor, and finally all drugs.\n\n【3】The risk of provoking resistance and domestic backlash seems to have persuaded the Taliban to enforce an incomplete and subjective ban on opium production. However, their all-out war on PWUD is unrelenting. The Taliban has withdrawn support for harm reduction and HIV prevention services and cracked down on PWUD by arresting, detaining, and subjecting them to violent treatment. As of August 2022, there were a limited number of NSP and OAT facilities, with 8 NSP sites and 9 OAT sites in operation, four of which were located within prisons. Moreover, the Taliban has adopted involuntary detoxification as a ‘solution’ to the growing substance use problem in Afghanistan. Crackdown and human rights abuses on homeless and street-based PWUD have been intensified, forcing them into detox without withdrawal support in overcrowded rehabilitation camps. These 45-day detoxification facilities are severely understaffed, inadequately equipped, and currently operating beyond capacity with limited supplies of food and personal hygiene items. These centres also lack any form of mental health support, despite the fact that many Afghan PWUD are struggling with mental health disorders and have suffered immense trauma, due to the loss of their homes, family members, and hope in a country torn apart by conflict, deprivation, and oppression in the past few decades. While the Taliban use their interpretation of Islam to justify denial of life-saving harm reduction services and strictly promote abstinence-based models, evidence from other conservative Muslim-majority countries, such as Malaysia and Iran, have shown abstinence-only treatment models to be ineffective and rather counterproductive by contributing to an increase in drug use prevalence, a shift to more harmful drugs including heroin, widespread stigma towards PWUD, and a transition from smoking to injecting. These countries, therefore, have successfully adopted a harm reduction model by viewing substance use disorders from a health perspective and recognizing harm reduction as an ethical evidence-based social and public health response, grounded in principles of social justice and human rights. The Taliban could learn from the implementation of harm reduction interventions in such Muslim-majority settings which are indeed compatible with the Islamic principles of preserving human life, alleviating suffering, and prioritizing the safety and well-being of individuals.\n\n【4】The recent Taliban takeover in Afghanistan is yet another bitter reminder, after the Russian seizure of Crimea, of the fragility of harm reduction services in the face of political instability. More importantly, the decline of harm reduction efforts in Afghanistan should be viewed as severe regional and global health threats. Criminalizing PWUD coupled with limited access to NSP and OAT, could force them to engage in riskier substance use practices, and transition to injection drug use, exacerbating the spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV and HCV amongst themselves and to the general population. Overcrowded and under-resourced rehabilitation camps and prisons also pose a risk of the spread of infectious diseases beyond Afghanistan's physical borders. COVID-19, HIV, and other pandemics have clearly demonstrated that infectious diseases have a tendency to spread across borders and future infectious outbreaks could easily reach other parts of Central Asia, North Africa, Europe, and beyond. Therefore, the inhumane treatment of PWUD in Afghanistan is a human rights emergency and global health concern, requiring urgent international support and humanitarian aid. These human rights violations must be brought to the negotiating table with the Taliban hand in hand with discussions of Afghanistan's long-term development plans. It is also essential to remind the Taliban that they have a unique opportunity to achieve social and financial prosperity by adopting evidence-based drug policies that prioritize compassionate care and tackling social inequities, instead of relying on the ineffectual and unethical practice of compulsory treatment and incarceration of PWUD.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【5】Conceptualisation: FN.\n\n【6】Supervision: DW, MK.\n\n【7】Writing – original draft: FN, MK.\n\n【8】Writing– review & editing: FN, DW, MK.\n\n【9】Declaration of interests\n------------------------\n\n【10】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:07:37", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:11:59", "cost": 261.914}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:50", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:11:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:07:37"}

We still believe that a subgroup that benefits exists. This idea is not an illusion. Lindbaek and colleagues showed that antibiotics were of great benefit in patients in primary care with acute sinusitis diagnosed by CT scanning (number needed to treat 3). However, the large effect seen for that study could at least partly have been attributable to chance.

A further criticism might be that CT scanning is not a diagnostic tool in primary care.\n\n【2】More diagnostic research in primary care should be done first. Up until now there have been no studies with large numbers on diagnosis of sinusitis with CT scanning, sinus puncture, and clinical signs and symptoms.

To date, China's internet hospitals have not been systematically investigated. We aimed to describe the characteristics and to assess the health-service capacity of China's internet hospitals.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】For this cross-sectional study, we searched Baidu to identify internet hospital up to March 20, 2017, using search terms “Internet hospital”, “web hospital”, or “cloud hospital”. All internet hospitals in mainland China were eligible for inclusion if they have been officially registered.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We identified 68 internet hospitals, of which 43 have been put into use and 25 are under construction. Of the 43 established internet hospitals, 13 (30%) were in hospital information stage, 24 (56%) were in web-ward stage, and six (14%) were in full internet hospital stage. Patients accessed outpatient service delivery via website (n=32, 74·4%), app (n=18, 42%), or by an offline medical consultation facility (n=16, 37%) from the internet hospital. 25 of the internet hospitals (58%) asked doctors to deliver health services at a specific web clinics, whereas 18 hospitals (42%) did not. The consulting methods included video chat (n=26, 61%), telephone (n=8, 19%), and graphic message (n=12, 28%), whereas 13 (30%) internet hospitals do not offer online consultation at present. Only six internet hospitals are included in the coverage of health insurance. The median number of doctors available online was zero (IQR 0–5; range 0–16 492). The median consultation fee was ¥20 (IQR ¥0–200; range ¥0–1000; about US$2·90).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Internet hospitals provide convenient outpatient service delivery. However, many of the internet hospitals are not yet mature, with various issues such as a scarcity of online doctors and incomplete coverage by health insurance. China's internet hospitals are heading in the right direction to improve how health service is effectively provided, but much more remains to be done.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC1000102, 2016YFC1000307) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (81602854).\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】XX, XM, YH, and YC conceived and designed the study.

We analysed notifications from the Irish National Tuberculosis Surveillance System from 2011 to 2021 to examine the direct impact of vaccination cessation on active tuberculosis cases among young children.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did a cross-sectional study to compare tuberculosis age-specific incidence rates (ASIRs) among children aged 0–4 years born during a period of BCG vaccination (January 2007 to March 2015) with those born after BCG vaccination cessation (April 2015 to December 2021). We calculated ASIRs using census population denominators and did a temporal trend analysis of ASIRs using negative binomial regression. Data were anonymised before use in this study so no ethical approval or patient consent was required.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】No significant temporal trend was detected in ASIR by notification year during 2011–21 (incidence rate ratio \\[IRR\\] 0·98; 95% CI 0·85–1·1). However, the temporal trend for cases born during universal vaccination was significantly declining (IRR 0·72 \\[95% CI 0·56–0·93\\]) whereas cases born after vaccination ceased had a non-significant increase (1·4 \\[0·99–1·96\\]). No meningitis cases were reported during universal vaccination compared with one (5%) of 19 cases reported after vaccination ceased. The proportion of cases reported as vaccinated decreased from 58% (11 of 19) during universal vaccination to 21% (four of 19) after vaccination ceased. Six (32%) of 19 cases born after vaccination ceased would have been eligible to receive BCG under a selective programme. No significant difference in the proportion of cases associated with outbreaks was detected across the two periods. Regional ASIRs increased in two eastern regions after vaccination ceased, whereas they declined in the remaining six regions.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Universal BCG cessation has not directly impacted on new tuberculosis cases among children aged 0–4 years. However, timely surveillance is needed to monitor the impact of vaccination cessation. A selective BCG programme might have prevented cases diagnosed in certain risk groups.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Health Service Executive, Ireland.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】SJ did the conceptualisation, methodology, data curation, formal analysis, and writing of the original draft.

This trend has been a key driver for the development of open-access datasets, giving researchers access to local or national data shared by different institutions. Open-access data can be used to train machine learning algorithms on diverse datasets that have been carefully curated, or to test algorithms that have already been trained by researchers elsewhere to assess their performance when applied to new data.\n\n【1】An increasing volume of patient data is being shared in the form of open-access datasets, with reasonable precautions being taken to anonymise the data. For example, numerous datasets are freely available online with thousands of retinal fundus photos, electrocardiograms, or electroencephalograms, which have been used to drive machine learning research in the corresponding specialties. Open-access datasets have largely been a positive force, enabling researchers to access datasets that would be infeasible to create locally.\n\n【2】However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that machine learning algorithms can identify patient characteristics that are completely indiscernible to humans when presented with the same imaging. In ophthalmology, algorithms have identified age, sex, blood pressure, and smoking status from simple fundus photos; in cardiology, algorithms have identified age, sex, COVID-19 status, and diabetes status from electrocardiograms; and in neurology, algorithms have identified specific individuals from electroencephalograms. These tasks go beyond human abilities, which is why clinicians and researchers assumed that these forms of data were anonymous.\n\n【3】For open-access datasets, very limited personally identifiable information should be released and demographic data associated with imaging are often withheld. However, the ability of modern machine learning algorithms to extract personally identifiable data from routine imaging raises questions as to whether existing datasets are truly anonymous. Few methods exist to address this issue, and perhaps the most promising one is the use of synthetic data. The generation of highly realistic synthetic data with artificial intelligence is an area of research that is still in its infancy; however, the quality of the generative algorithms has improved over time, and it is now increasingly possible to replace real datasets with synthetic data. As the rate of releasing open-access datasets continues to accelerate, perhaps we should be rethinking these datasets.\n\n【4】I have honorary research affiliations with NHS England and NHS Improvement and with Moorfields Eye Hospital.

Although we share the authors' concerns regarding research misconduct, our analyses portray the situation differently and encourage taking further in-depth approaches.\n\n【1】To investigate Iran's citation impact, we compared citation counts in Scimago between 1996 and 2014, and found an improvement in Iran's global ranking from 56th to 22nd. Furthermore, using a method explained elsewhere, we assessed Iran's publication performance in biomedical and public health research and our preliminary findings showed that Iran's h-index in these fields was nearly doubled every 5 years between 1996 and 2010, rising from 23 to 82.\n\n【2】Iranian research publication count was low in Scopus during the early years of the period that Rezaee-Zavareh and colleagues studied (1996–2014). Subsequently, the mean number of publications was reduced, and therefore the conclusions based on average citations and h-indices from the whole period were flawed. More importantly, use of citation-based bibliometrics to measure research impact is disputable, let alone its use to assess quality. There is evidence that using journal impact factors for quality assessment should be avoided. It would be better that research growth is assessed by a combination of indices, and not being limited to citations.\n\n【3】We believe in Iran's post-sanctions era existing international collaborations should be strengthened and new ones created to produce high-quality research addressing global challenges. We also hope Iran's improved economy will be accompanied by a stronger research governance that will lead to increased investments in national priorities and will result in a wider impact of research on the country— impacts beyond citations.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2017 iStock</u>\n\n【4】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:07:15", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:07:35", "cost": 19.839}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:50", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:07:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:07:15"}

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been increasingly linked to systemic damage beyond that of the respiratory system. Therefore, identifying additional sites affected by COVID-19 is crucial. Ocular surface abnormalities, including conjunctivitis, are well established manifestations of COVID-19. Marinho and colleagues bring attention to the possibility of retinal involvement in COVID-19. As noted by the authors, the observed retinal findings were subtle. Furthermore, these findings are non-specific and are not expected to have visual consequences for patients.\n\n【1】In this Correspondence, and in future reports, several important details will be crucial in facilitating scientific interpretation and allowing a fuller understanding of the possible association between COVID-19 and retinal findings. Investigators should clearly provide the overall patient sample size. Knowing the total number of adults examined by Marinho and colleagues would be helpful to gauge the prevalence of retinal abnormalities. Describing comorbidities is essential, especially hypertension and diabetes, both of which are commonly associated with the reported retinal findings of microhaemorrhages and cotton wool spots. Even in the absence of comorbidities, further investigation will be needed regarding the basis of the retinal findings and whether these findings reflect more than a systemic inflammatory state. It will be of great interest that future studies provide more robust retinal findings reminiscent of research on non-human coronaviruses, in which retinal abnormalities following infection by select animal coronaviruses reflect a local retinal vasculitis and even viral infection of retinal cells.\n删除4:<u>\n• View related content for this article</u>\n\n【2】删除9:<u>I declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:43:02", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:43:15", "cost": 12.983}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:50", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:43:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:43:02"}

In view of the overall low frequency of stent thrombosis, large sample sizes are needed to accurately estimate treatment differences between stents. We compared the risk of thrombosis between bare-metal and drug-eluting stents.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】For this network meta-analysis, randomised controlled trials comparing different drug-eluting stents or drug-eluting with bare-metal stents currently approved in the USA were identified through Medline, Embase, Cochrane databases, and proceedings of international meetings. Information about study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample characteristics, and clinical outcomes was extracted.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】49 trials including 50 844 patients randomly assigned to treatment groups were analysed. 1-year definite stent thrombosis was significantly lower with cobalt-chromium everolimus eluting stents (CoCr-EES) than with bare-metal stents (odds ratio \\[OR\\] 0·23, 95% CI 0·13–0·41). The significant difference in stent thrombosis between CoCr-EES and bare-metal stents was evident as early as 30 days (OR 0·21, 95% CI 0·11–0·42) and was also significant between 31 days and 1 year (OR 0·27, 95% CI 0·08–0·74). CoCr-EES were also associated with significantly lower rates of 1-year definite stent thrombosis compared with paclitaxel-eluting stents (OR 0·28, 95% CI 0·16–0·48), permanent polymer-based sirolimus-eluting stents (OR 0·41, 95% CI 0·24–0·70), phosphorylcholine-based zotarolimus-eluting stents (OR 0·21, 95% CI 0·10–0·44), and Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents (OR 0·14, 95% CI 0·03–0·47). At 2-year follow-up, CoCr-EES were still associated with significantly lower rates of definite stent thrombosis than were bare-metal (OR 0·35, 95% CI 0·17–0·69) and paclitaxel-eluting stents (OR 0·34, 95% CI 0·19–0·62). No other drug-eluting stent had lower definite thrombosis rates compared with bare-metal stents at 2-year follow-up.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In randomised studies completed to date, CoCr-EES has the lowest rate of stent thrombosis within 2 years of implantation. The finding that CoCr-EES also reduced stent thrombosis compared with bare-metal stents, if confirmed in future randomised trials, represents a paradigm shift.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】The Cardiovascular Research Foundation.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

David Holmes reports.\n\n【1】It's now been just over a year since the Health and Social Care Act was granted Royal assent and passed into law. A lot can happen in a year. The Health Secretary who brought forward the legislation, Andrew Lansley, was supplanted by Jeremy Hunt in a cabinet reshuffle; the Mid Staffordshire care scandal rocked public confidence in the National Health Service (NHS) in England; and only last month the government was forced to withdraw and reconsider regulations governing competition under the new system. But amidst all the drama of the past 12 months, the date of Monday, April 1, has remained fixed on the horizon as the day that the Health and Social Care Act comes into force, and the NHS in England undergoes the most radical transformation in its history. Now, that day has finally arrived.\n\n【2】Patients going into their local general practice or hospital are unlikely to have noticed any big differences on day one, but over the coming months and years the government promises a health revolution based on key structural changes.\n\n【3】The first is a radical overhaul of who decides what health services to buy, or commission, using the NHS budget and, crucially, who they commission those services from. Under the old system the purse strings of the huge NHS budget were held by 152 bodies known as primary care trusts (PCTs), who commissioned services from hospitals and other providers from within the NHS. These PCTs have now been abolished, and are succeeded by 211 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs). These CCGs, which are run as boards, will have responsibility for planning and designing health care within their region, including whether to commission services from within the NHS or from commercial providers. And it is this increased role for competition in the NHS that has sparked the most widespread and vocal opposition.\n\n【4】The government argues that opening services up to competition with the private sector will drive efficiency and lead to better value for taxpayers and better outcomes for patients. But opponents, including almost all the Royal Colleges, argue that unleashing market forces will undermine core NHS services and put patients at risk.\n\n【5】The Lancashire-based general practitioner (GP) David Wrigley recently tabled a resolution at the British Medical Association (BMA) GP Committee that led the BMA to come out against new regulations that would force CCGs to open up all services to competition, contrary to previous government assurances that CCGs would have complete discretion when it came to deciding which services to open up to commercial providers. And Wrigley is adamant that the new commissioning structure will eventually result in the complete privatisation of most NHS services. “The Act opens up the NHS to have its lapsing contracts tendered out, which gives the commercial sector a huge opportunity as they have many more lawyers and accountants ready to bid for contracts as compared to NHS publicly driven organisations”, he says, going on to argue that the reforms “enable many more large commercial companies to pick off contracts and cherry pick the profitable parts of the NHS”.\n\n【6】In an interview with _The Guardian_ newspaper on the day the changes came into effect, the incoming chief of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence David Haslam echoed widely held concerns about the potentially negative effect on continuity of care that a sudden influx of new private care providers could have. “The introduction of the commercial sector in effect parcels up many parts of the NHS and sells them off to the highest bidder”, says Wrigley. “This leads to fragmentation of care by multiple providers. Patients dislike this, as they prefer to have continuity of care. When a patient is young and fit they have less concerns, but when patients have co-morbidities and need to see different departments they prefer care to be delivered by one ‘NHS team’ and not a mish-mash of different providers who don't often talk to each other.”\n\n【7】A lack of transparency about potential conflicts of interests within the new system has also been a point of contention, with a recent investigation by the _British Medical Journal_ finding that more than a third of GPs with decision-making powers on CCG boards have financial interests in private care providers who could potentially be comissioned by their CCG.\n\n【8】Widespread reforms to the NHS came into force on April 1, 2013\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2013 Science Photo Library</u>\n\n【9】Clive Peedell and Richard Taylor co-lead the new National Health Action Party\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2013 Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire/Press Association Images</u>\n\n【10】In fact, the reforms have engendered so much opposition that they have spawned a new political party: the National Health Action Party . Co-led by former doctor and independent Member of Parliament Richard Taylor and clinical oncologist Clive Peedell, the party aims not only to repeal the current government's policies, but also to roll back over two decades of government policy that it says has been too in thrall to neoliberal, market-centric ideology. “In my opinion, the best way to get an understanding as to what has happened is actually to look through a political lens”, Peedell tells _The Lancet_ . “Looking at what New Labour did to the NHS gives the clearest picture of the course that the NHS has been set on. Funding pressure will drive a reduction in core NHS services and a new market for health insurance. Hence we will move to a mixed funding model over a number of years. This has been gradually happening over the last 20–30 years, but Lansley's bill is the catalyst and most crucial step.”\n\n【11】The abolition of the PCTs has also had a major knock-on effect on the structure of public health service delivery and planning in England. Before, public health staff worked mainly within PCTs and the Health Protection Agency, but from April 1 these staff will be moved into Local Authorities or into the newly created executive body Public Health England (PHE) .\n\n【12】Reaction to the changes has been mixed. “I'm not sure that anyone starting with a blank sheet of paper would have designed PHE in its current form and remit, but it does present both opportunities and threats”, explains Robert Aldridge, a public health doctor and research training fellow in epidemiology at University College London. He points to the possibility for public health staff working in Local Authorities to more effectively tackle the social determinants of health; the opportunity for PHE to combine the surveillance, intelligence gathering, and health-improvement functions of public health in one organisation; and the potential to move towards a focus on people rather than specific infectious diseases—particularly relevant for vulnerable groups such as homeless people—as reasons for guarded optimism.\n\n【13】Martin McKee, professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, was quick to praise the leadership team of PHE, which will be headed by Duncan Selbie (profiled in this issue), but expressed “major concerns over its ability to speak with an independent public health voice, which we know from history is extremely important, because public health often has to speak out against powerful vested interests”. In response to the government's recent apparent U-turn on plans to introduce minimum unit pricing on alcohol, the PHE's Selbie, John Newton, and Kevin Fenton took to the pages of _The Independent_ newspaper to set out the PHE's position: the evidence supports minimum pricing. But although Aldridge said he was “delighted to see the new heads of PHE speaking out this week over minimum alcohol pricing”, fears persist that they may have their hands tied in the future.\n\n【14】There are also major uncertainties about what will happen to the public health functions entrusted to local government. “Councillors tend not to be elected based on their interest in health, and councils now have extremely limited powers”, says McKee. “Public health is only as strong as its weakest branches, and public health in local government will, I think, be extremely variable and generally weak. That's going to be a challenge PHE is going to have to face.” For the next 2 years, Local Authority budgets for public health have been ring-fenced, but at a time when almost all Local Authorities in England are facing massive cuts of up to a third of their budgets “there will undoubtedly be pressure for public health money to be directed to areas not determined by public health staff”, says Aldridge.\n\n【15】The uncertainty is also having an effect on frontline staff. “I have anecdotal experience and stories of talented people leaving the discipline over the past 24 months”, says Aldridge. “There has also been a lot of concern about entering the profession from graduates that I have met recently”, he notes, and points to the challenge that PHE faces to ensure that staff spread across Local Authorities, PHE, and other organisations working on public health such as CCGs and NHS England have a common sense of identity and purpose.\n\n【16】Ultimately, says McKee, how much difference PHE can make will probably be determined by factors outside its own control. “The government has pursued policies of austerity that have closed off economic growth, leaving very little money available for Local Authorities. And people's ability to make healthy choices is often a function of their financial circumstances”, he explains. “A lot will depend on how much more damage the government does to the economy.”\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【17】### Publication history\n\n【18】Published: 06 April 2013\n\n【19】### Identification\n\n【20】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60783-7</u>\n\n【21】### Copyright\n\n【22】© 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The horrific mass shooting on March 15, 2021, in which six of eight people killed in three spas in Atlanta, Georgia, were Asian women, has prompted urgent conversations about prejudice against Asian Americans. Organisations including the American Medical Association were swift to underscore that racism, in addition to gun violence, is a public health crisis. The American Psychiatric Association warned that the shooting could compound the trauma and fear already experienced in Asian American communities. 2020 was a year of reckoning around race in the USA and national introspection about the maltreatment of people of colour; 2021 is a year to consider how racism and discrimination, alongside other social determinants, shape the broader context of health. April is National Minority Health Month and an opportunity to draw attention to Asian American health and wellbeing.\n\n【1】The term “Asian American” carries a measure of controversy in trying to define an extraordinary mix of people, cultures, and languages. It is not a matter of semantics, but an issue of representation. Asian Americans include people with ancestry from east Asia, south Asia, southeast Asia, and in some instances Pacific Islanders or Native Hawaiians. Asian Americans constitute about 6·8% of the population of the USA and unlike any other ethnic or racial minority group, about two-thirds are foreign born and have entered the USA in the past 10 years. The largest Asian American subgroups are Chinese (4·2 million), followed by Filipino (3·6 million), Indian (3·3 million, and the fastest growing), Vietnamese (1·9 million), and Korean (1·8 million).\n\n【2】As a predominantly immigrant minority group, Asian Americans can face specific barriers to accessing health care such as residency requirements for Medicaid eligibility (health coverage for low-income Americans) or being more likely to be employed in jobs that do not cover private insurance. Language proficiency can also limit an individual's ability to navigate a challenging health-care system. In relation to educational attainment and income level, immigration status can vastly bifurcate health outcomes.\n\n【3】Providing a comprehensive picture of the health of Asian Americans is complex, challenging, and incomplete. Only in the past decade has research on health outcomes and disparities among Asian Americans gained momentum. Scarce data can routinely obscure or minimise health disparities for ethnic and racial minorities. In a Correspondence, Nancy Krieger and colleagues point to the stunning and continued paucity of ethnic and racial data being collected for COVID-19 vaccination in the USA. In general, Asian Americans have historically been seemingly healthier than other groups and compared with the US general population. For example, overall cancer incidence is lower in Asian Americans than in non-Hispanic White people. However, Asian Americans are at increased risk for liver and stomach cancers and are the only group for whom cancer remains the leading cause of mortality. Type 2 diabetes is more prevalent in Asian Americans as a group (9%) compared with non-Hispanic Whites (7·2%), but it is substantially higher in subgroups of Asian Americans such as Filipino men (15·8%). Understanding such differences could inform the use of prevention or earlier screening strategies.\n\n【4】Tailored public health strategies to improve health equity will be an important means to counter the so-called model minority myth—ie, the expectation of excelling socially and academically. Asian Americans are often portrayed as self-sufficient and resilient, and are the least likely of all ethnic groups to seek mental health treatment. Cultural pressures and feelings of shame or stigma, especially around mental health disorders, treatment for cancer, and previous trauma can be deterrents to seeking help. However, culturally competent care could be improved through some of the solidarity and impact of Asian Americans as health-care providers. About 17% of all US physicians identify as Asian American. Although over-represented in number, increasing visibility and obtaining more leadership positions within health care is an important goal.\n\n【5】Health equity in the US demands recognition of the contributions that immigrants make to society, understanding and provision of appropriate responses to the different needs of groups and individuals, and the dismantling of racism and discrimination against Asian Americans.\n\n【6】删除1-1:<u>For more on **racism-related stress from the model minority myth** see https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/ethnicity-health/asian-american/stress-racism</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2021 RyanJLane/Getty Images</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 03 April 2021\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00769-8</u>\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite this potential opportunity, no smoking cessation programme in any UK emergency department yet exists. This study sought to identify perceived barriers and facilitators for emergency department smoking cessation activity, as well as potential modes of intervention, by exploring staff attitudes.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】16 members of staff from the Emergency Department, Derby NHS Teaching Hospital were purposively sampled to include a spectrum of clinical and non-clinical roles, grades, and employment duration. Semi-structured interviews were conducted within the department, and thematically analysed with dual-coding for validity under an interpretivist paradigm.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Three themes were identified: roles of emergency departments, effects of smoking, and scope for intervention. Effects were described in individual-health and department-management contexts, with belief that reducing patient smoking would benefit both. Health promotion was seen as theoretically part of, and practically achievable within, the emergency department role. Lack of organisational support was a key barrier. Staff practice included occasional ad-hoc smoking cessation activity, but nothing routine. Those who did not incorporate smoking cessation into their practice felt that lack of training and support, rather than time, stopped them from doing so.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Support for emergency department smoking cessation was found in the face of major barriers. Options to address these barriers were suggested, highlighting a willingness to engage. Complex interventions appeared impractical, and no single approach seemed universally applicable to emergency department environments. This study addresses the paucity of evidence around emergency department attitudes towards smoking cessation by providing a unique and in-depth picture of staff in the study department. It also balances clinical and population health viewpoints and has potential to inform promising prevention strategies in the emerging population-focused health-care structures. However, the study might not be generalisable to other emergency departments. Further research exploring patient attitudes would be a valuable next step.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Health Education East Midlands.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

Participants might ignore follow-up, leave town, or take aspartame when instructed to take aspirin. Exclusions before randomisation do not bias the treatment comparison, but they can hurt generalisability. Eligibility criteria for a trial should be clear, specific, and applied before randomisation. Readers should assess whether any of the criteria make the trial sample atypical or unrepresentative of the people in which they are interested. In principle, assessment of exclusions after randomisation is simple: none are allowed. For the primary analysis, all participants enrolled should be included and analysed as part of the original group assigned (an intent-to-treat analysis). In reality, however, losses frequently occur. Investigators should, therefore, commit adequate resources to develop and implement procedures to maximise retention of participants. Moreover, researchers should provide clear, explicit information on the progress of all randomised participants through the trial by use of, for instance, a trial profile. Investigators can also do secondary analyses on, for instance, per-protocol or as-treated participants. Such analyses should be described as secondary and non-randomised comparisons. Mishandling of exclusions causes serious methodological difficulties. Unfortunately, some explanations for mishandling exclusions intuitively appeal to readers, disguising the seriousness of the issues. Creative mismanagement of exclusions can undermine trial validity.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【2】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【3】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【4】One-time access price info\n\n【5】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【6】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【7】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【8】### Subscribe:\n\n【9】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【10】Already a print subscriber?

The so-called war on drugs has contributed to an era of mass incarceration, in which about one in every 100 US citizens, almost all poor, many from racial minority groups and many who use illicit drugs, are currently detained in jails or prisons. The USA not only has the world's highest rate of incarceration, but treats opioid-addicted prisoners very differently from those in prisons in other countries. Unlike other serious chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, or HIV/AIDS, individuals with opioid dependence will often have their medically effective treatment—such as methadone, the standard treatment for opioid dependence—discontinued on incarceration in most US correctional institutions. In a nationally representative survey of 500 US prisons, only 12% reported that individuals who enter custody on a methadone treatment programme are maintained on this programme during their time of incarceration. Furthermore, in the prisons that do not provide methadone, most institutions reported that they have no standard protocol to taper individuals off methadone. Therefore, for the estimated 30 000 individuals on methadone who cycle through a correctional facility each year in the USA, the first days of their detention are spent in the pain and discomfort of physical withdrawal.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended by clinical treatment guidelines for patients with or at high risk of chronic heart failure, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or chronic kidney disease. However, this recommendation only covers a fraction of patients; determining the best treatment for the majority is less clear. Furthermore, response to these treatments can vary between individual patients. Could a precision medicine approach help clinicians and patients choose the right treatment?\n\n【1】In this issue of _The Lancet Digital Health_ , John M Dennis and colleagues developed and validated a treatment selection algorithm using five routinely collected clinical characteristics of adults with type 2 diabetes, to enable selection between SGLT2 and DPP4 inhibitor therapies on the basis of predicted glycaemic response. Using the algorithm, they identified a large patient subgroup that would have greater glycaemic benefit with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy than with DPP4 inhibitor therapy. However, because the overall prevalence or risk of cardiorenal disease in this subgroup was low, only 14·3% would be recommended this treatment. Conversely, of a smaller subgroup identified to benefit more from DPP4 inhibitor therapy, 75% would be recommended SGLT2 inhibitor therapy due to older age and a high prevalence or risk of cardiorenal disease in this group. Thus, the algorithm could be used to better inform discussions between patients and clinicians about the benefit and risks of treatments at an individual level, and tailor treatment accordingly.\n\n【2】Unfortunately, due to the limited number of non-White patients in the real-world and trial cohorts analysed by Dennis and colleagues, they could not evaluate differential treatment effects across ethnicities. Type 2 diabetes disproportionally affects racial and ethnic minorities, and so validating the algorithm in diverse datasets is a vital next step. However, racial and ethnic minorities also have lower treatment access. A recent study from the USA found significantly lower SGLT2 inhibitor prescription rates among non-White racial groups and those of Hispanic ethnicity, probably reflecting racial and ethnic biases in health-care delivery. The value of a treatment selection algorithm is limited unless systemic barriers preventing equitable access to type 2 diabetes treatments are overcome.\n\n【3】Another barrier impeding equitable access to treatments is cost. Novel therapeutics are expensive, and so national and global socioeconomic disparities can render them prohibitive. The datasets included in the study by Dennis and colleagues were all from high-income countries, but more than three in four adults living with diabetes reside in lower-income and middle-income countries. As highlighted in a Comment by Oriana Hoi Yun Yu and Ju-Young Shin, validating the study findings in different geographical populations is important because medication coverage can vary between regions. Additionally, in lower-income and middle-income countries, the cost of diabetic treatments must be substantially lower than in their high-income counterparts to be cost-effective.\n\n【4】Cost also affects the range of patient characteristics that can be integrated into a treatment selection algorithm. For example, a recent review introduced a 5-step roadmap to achieve pharmacological precision medicine in diabetes and highlighted the potential clinical value of identifying genetic loci that might be associated with type 2 diabetes treatment response. With the cost of patient genotyping declining, integration of genetic biomarkers into the treatment selection algorithm developed by Dennis and colleagues could further improve its predictive power.\n\n【5】There is potential for a precision medicine approach to type 2 diabetes treatment selection based on predicted glycaemic benefit, but more work is needed to ensure the treatments are equitable and the findings clinically effective. Treatment selection algorithms must be validated on datasets curated from geographically and ethnically diverse participants, and disparities in access to treatment across ethnicities need to be addressed. More data on the global cost effectiveness of treatments are needed, and generic alternatives should be made available to help drive treatment prices down. Finally, as new evidence emerges, future iterations of treatment selection algorithms should incorporate a broad range of treatment-tailoring variables, and ascertaining whether applying them in practice improves clinical outcomes must be a priority.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2022 Iryna Imago/Shutterstock</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: December 2022\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(22)00217-5</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2022 The Author(s).

The report, _PEPFAR Implementation: Progress and Promise_ , was released on March 30.\n\n【2】Overall, the report gives the 5-year US$15 billion initiative high marks for substantially boosting the amount of money available to fight the pandemic and for rapidly scaling-up treatment and prevention programmes in resource-poor countries, something the report states “many had doubted could be done”.\n\n【3】The IOM report, however, rightly criticises provisions in the 2003 law that authorised PEPFAR which set strict spending levels for different interventions. These budget allocations require that 55% of PEPFAR's funds go to HIV/AIDS treatment, 20% to HIV prevention initiatives (of which 33% must go into abstinence-until-marriage programmes), 15% to palliative care, and 10% to support orphans and vulnerable children. PEPFAR is further constrained by US laws that ban US funding for clean-needle exchange programmes, for programmes that do not explicitly adopt policies opposing sex work and human trafficking, and for reproductive programmes that provide abortion services.\n\n【4】These restrictions, some of which are well intentioned and some of which are based on narrow domestic political considerations, are hampering efforts by local health workers to develop programmes best suited to the epidemics they face in their communities.\n\n【5】When Congress established PEPFAR in 2003, it set ambitious 5-year performance targets for the programme: to provide antiretroviral therapy to 2 million people with HIV/AIDS, to prevent 7 million HIV infections, and to provide care for 10 million people infected with or affected by HIV/AIDS. These performance targets, not arbitrary legislative earmarks, should guide the allocation of PEPFAR funds, the IOM report argues, and PEPFAR-funded programmes should be allowed to adopt the best evidence-based strategies to reach those targets. The report correctly calls for Congress, which must re-authorise PEPFAR this year, to remove such restrictions.\n\n【6】The IOM report also calls for Congress to reconsider the requirement that all generic drugs purchased with PEPFAR funds first be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, including those already approved by WHO. Most global health programmes accept WHO-approved generics. The Congressional requirement for FDA approval has slowed the introduction of life-saving antiretroviral therapies and unnecessarily driven up costs.\n\n【7】The last, and most important, chapter focuses on sustainability. It notes that PEPFAR has already begun the transition from the emergency-relief strategies it implemented in its first years to long-term strategies that focus on building sustainable programmes. The report endorses this transition and calls for it to accelerate. The HIV/AIDS pandemic is exceptional, the report notes, because it is a “long-term crisis \\[that requires\\] both an urgent as well as a sustained and sustainable response”. Systems must be created so that countries grappling with the epidemic can take over the fight themselves, which means the capacity of their health-care systems must be vastly expanded. Training existing health-care workers to provide HIV/AIDS services is not enough; new health-care workers must also be trained.\n\n【8】An effective sustained response requires programmes to attack the social factors that sustain the epidemic, the report notes, in particular the low social status of women and girls. The legislation that established PEPFAR specifically called for US initiatives to support programmes that address the conditions that make women particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, including promoting the empowerment of women in interpersonal situations, encouraging men to be responsible in their sexual behaviour, reducing sexual violence and coercion, improving women's access to paid work and economic resources, and advancement of women's legal rights.\n\n【9】The report concludes with a sad litany that dramatically emphasises the world's failure to adequately respond to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. After a quarter of a century, the pandemic continues to grow largely unabated infecting more than 4 million people in 2006, fewer than a quarter of the 7 million people who need antiretroviral therapy received it, and fewer than one in ten pregnant women with HIV received antiretroviral treatment to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus. This IOM report is timely. It provides valuable guidance and a sobering summary of the challenges ahead, not only to US policymakers but also to everyone who is working to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 07 April 2007\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60536-4</u>\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the cardiovascular disease risk associated with the full spectrum of bloodstream non-HDL cholesterol concentrations. We also created an easy-to-use tool to estimate the long-term probabilities for a cardiovascular disease event associated with non-HDL cholesterol and modelled its risk reduction by lipid-lowering treatment.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In this risk-evaluation and risk-modelling study, we used Multinational Cardiovascular Risk Consortium data from 19 countries across Europe, Australia, and North America. Individuals without prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline and with robust available data on cardiovascular disease outcomes were included. The primary composite endpoint of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was defined as the occurrence of the coronary heart disease event or ischaemic stroke. Sex-specific multivariable analyses were computed using non-HDL cholesterol categories according to the European guideline thresholds, adjusted for age, sex, cohort, and classical modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. In a derivation and validation design, we created a tool to estimate the probabilities of a cardiovascular disease event by the age of 75 years, dependent on age, sex, and risk factors, and the associated modelled risk reduction, assuming a 50% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of the 524 444 individuals in the 44 cohorts in the Consortium database, we identified 398 846 individuals belonging to 38 cohorts (184 055 \\[48·7%\\] women; median age 51·0 years \\[IQR 40·7–59·7\\]). 199 415 individuals were included in the derivation cohort (91 786 \\[48·4%\\] women) and 199 431 (92 269 \\[49·1%\\] women) in the validation cohort. During a maximum follow-up of 43·6 years (median 13·5 years, IQR 7·0–20·1), 54 542 cardiovascular endpoints occurred. Incidence curve analyses showed progressively higher 30-year cardiovascular disease event-rates for increasing non-HDL cholesterol categories (from 7·7% for non-HDL cholesterol <2·6 mmol/L to 33·7% for ≥5·7 mmol/L in women and from 12·8% to 43·6% in men; p<0·0001). Multivariable adjusted Cox models with non-HDL cholesterol lower than 2·6 mmol/L as reference showed an increase in the association between non-HDL cholesterol concentration and cardiovascular disease for both sexes (from hazard ratio 1·1, 95% CI 1·0–1·3 for non-HDL cholesterol 2·6 to <3·7 mmol/L to 1·9, 1·6–2·2 for ≥5·7 mmol/L in women and from 1·1, 1·0–1·3 to 2·3, 2·0–2·5 in men). The derived tool allowed the estimation of cardiovascular disease event probabilities specific for non-HDL cholesterol with high comparability between the derivation and validation cohorts as reflected by smooth calibration curves analyses and a root mean square error lower than 1% for the estimated probabilities of cardiovascular disease. A 50% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol concentrations was associated with reduced risk of a cardiovascular disease event by the age of 75 years, and this risk reduction was greater the earlier cholesterol concentrations were reduced.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Non-HDL cholesterol concentrations in blood are strongly associated with long-term risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We provide a simple tool for individual long-term risk assessment and the potential benefit of early lipid-lowering intervention. These data could be useful for physician–patient communication about primary prevention strategies.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】EU Framework Programme, UK Medical Research Council, and German Centre for Cardiovascular Research.\n\n【10】**Research in context**\n\n【11】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【12】The blood concentrations of non-HDL and LDL cholesterol are accepted as causal cardiovascular risk factors and constitute a cornerstone of cardiovascular disease risk prediction in the general population. The benefit of lipid-lowering interventions for cardiovascular disease risk reduction is proven by mendelian randomisation studies, prospective epidemiological cohort studies, and randomised trials. For the present study, we assessed recommendations made by the European and US guidelines and their underlying references for lipid-lowering strategies in primary prevention. Furthermore, we reviewed the cardiovascular risk calculators as recommended by these guidelines (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation \\[SCORE\\] and Pooled Cohort Equations). We found very little data describing the effect of baseline non-HDL and LDL cholesterol on long-term or even lifetime outcomes. Cardiovascular risk assessment was mainly based on 10-year medium-term follow-up. All identified randomised trials for lipid-lowering intervention in cardiovascular primary prevention did not exceed a follow-up of 7 years and, moreover, especially young individuals were underrepresented in those studies.\n\n【13】**Added value of this study**\n\n【14】To our knowledge, our study provides the most comprehensive analysis of long-term risk for cardiovascular disease related to non-HDL cholesterol and offers an easily applicable tool to assess the long-term probabilities for cardiovascular disease events associated with non-HDL cholesterol. On the basis of a derivation and validation approach to risk prediction, our data provide robust multinational information. By using an up-to-date multinational population-based pooled cohort dataset, we provide a model that calculates the potential benefit of an early lipid-lowering strategy in individuals without prevalent cardiovascular disease across a range of non-HDL cholesterol categories.\n\n【15】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【16】There is evidence for the positive outcomes in lipid-lowering interventions in individuals with cardiovascular disease or those with very high cholesterol concentrations. Our data extend current knowledge and highlight the impact of non-HDL cholesterol on very long-term cardiovascular disease outcomes. A simulation of early reduction of non-HDL cholesterol across a range of lipid concentration categories estimates the risk reduction in the general population. Meeting targets for global reduction of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality will require increased awareness of the value of early cholesterol determination and careful evaluation of potential strategies for reduction of lipid concentrations across the lifespan.\n\n【17】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【18】Numerous studies have provided consistent evidence for a causal relationship between blood cholesterol concentrations and cardiovascular disease. Calculating the concentration of non-HDL cholesterol offers a simple way to analyse the total amount of proatherogenic lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B (apoB). Such proteins include very low-density lipoproteins and their metabolic remnants, intermediate-density lipoproteins, lipoprotein(a), and low-density lipoproteins. Besides estimating cholesterol concentrations contained in LDL particles (LDL cholesterol), the assessment of non-HDL cholesterol calculated as total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol is therefore recommended by current US and European guidelines for cardiovascular risk estimation. The indication for lipid-lowering therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease events in high-risk individuals or for secondary prevention is unequivocal. However, the decision on implementing a lipid-lowering intervention in the primary prevention setting is a major challenge in clinical practice for several reasons. Data on the association between the concentrations of the entire range of bloodstream lipids and very long-term cardiovascular outcomes in the general population are rather sparse. In addition, conventional primary prevention guidelines recommend lipid-lowering intervention on the basis of lipid concentration thresholds and the person's individual 10-year cardiovascular risk. This risk assessment might underestimate or fail to take proper account of the cumulative lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease and lipid-related cardiovascular disease risk, particularly in young adults. Furthermore, increased non-HDL cholesterol blood concentrations early in life seem to be stable over the life course and are predictive for incident cardiovascular disease. Therefore, in this study we aimed to (1) evaluate long-term risk for cardiovascular disease in the population related to non-HDL cholesterol on the basis of existing thresholds of blood lipid concentrations; (2) establish an easily applicable tool to assess the long-term probabilities for cardiovascular disease events associated with non-HDL cholesterol, using a derivation and validation approach; and (3) provide a model indicating the potential benefit of an early lipid-lowering strategy in individuals without prevalent cardiovascular disease.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Study design and participants\n\n【21】In this risk-evaluation and risk-modelling study, we used individual-level data from the Multinational Cardiovascular Risk Consortium 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 2–11 )</u>. Currently, the Consortium comprises data on 524 444 individuals from 44 population-based cohorts across Europe, Australia, and the USA. These include 23 harmonised cohorts from the MONICA Risk Genetics Archiving and Monograph (MORGAM) and Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe (BiomarCaRE) studies and another 21 harmonised, population-based cohorts with the same specifications as defined for the BiomarCaRE and MORGAM projects 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 15–18 )</u>. Of these, we used cohorts that had available data on cardiovascular disease endpoints 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 16–18 )</u>. We excluded data on participants with prevalent cardiovascular disease, defined as a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Detailed information about the study cohorts including the number of individuals with available information for each variable are provided in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 19–27)</u> . Informed consent was obtained if necessary (depending on survey year and local requirement). Detailed information for each cohort is given in the study descriptions 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 2–11 )</u>.\n\n【22】### Procedures\n\n【23】Our outcome measure was the first occurrence of a major cardiovascular event 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 16–18 )</u>. This was assessed in all participating individuals and death of non-cardiovascular-disease cause was used as a competing risk if appropriate. We defined it as a composite endpoint of the first non-fatal or fatal coronary heart disease or ischaemic stroke event. Coronary heart disease was defined as a composite of non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction including unstable angina, coronary death, and coronary revascularisation. Outcomes were measured in each prospective cohort study by standardised follow-up (visit, report, registry information, etc; details are given for each cohort删除2-1:<u>, appendix pp 2–11 </u>). Composite endpoint information for current analyses is provided in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 16–18)</u> . There were no secondary outcomes.\n\n【24】We based our cholesterol threshold concentrations on the treatment-determining cholesterol categories of the 2016 European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention. As recommended by the guidelines, we calculated non-HDL cholesterol thresholds by adding 30 mg/dL to the LDL cholesterol thresholds defined in our cohorts. Our analyses were based on baseline information available for concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. We report threshold concentrations in mmol/L, assuming that 1 mmol/L contains 38·67 mg/dL of LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol (for non-HDL cholesterol, the following categories were used: <100 mg/dL \\[<2·6 mmol/L\\]; 100 to <145 mg/dL \\[2·6 to <3·7 mmol/L\\]; 145 to <185 mg/dL \\[3·7 to <4·8 mmol/L\\]; 185 to <220 mg/dL \\[4·8 to <5·7 mmol/L\\], and ≥220 mg/dL \\[≥5·7 mmol/L\\]). The cutoff between the second and third category differs slightly from the European guidelines. We adapted this cutoff from 130 mg/dL (3·4 mmol/L) to 145 mg/dL (3·7 mmol/L), since the latter is the goal for lipid-lowering therapy recommended for individuals at low risk, who comprise most of our study population.\n\n【25】The following study variables were considered for analysis (but were not endpoints): age, sex, year of examination, body-mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, smoking status, use of cholesterol-lowering medication, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. History of arterial hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and myocardial infarction were defined as they had been documented or self-reported. Antihypertensive medication, lipid-lowering medication, and smoking status were self-reported. For individuals receiving lipid-lowering therapy, baseline concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were inflated by 30% for the analyses, assuming that treatment with statins had a moderate effect on lipid reduction and was initiated late during lifetime. Information about individuals receiving lipid-lowering therapy stratified by survey decades and age is shown in the appendix 删除2:<u>(p 28)</u> .\n\n【26】### Statistical analysis\n\n【27】For each analysis, only individuals with all data available on the relevant variables were used. To investigate the association of non-HDL cholesterol concentrations and time to cardiovascular disease, sex-specific cumulative incidence curves were produced according to the defined baseline non-HDL cholesterol threshold concentrations, with death of non-cardiovascular-disease causes as competing risk, using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were then computed, stratified for cohort and sex. Non-HDL cholesterol was coded as a categorical variable, with the help of dummy variables, using our predefined thresholds and included an interaction term with sex, to obtain sex-specific associations. To examine the association of non-HDL cholesterol across different ages, the models were expanded by adding an interaction between age category (<45, 45–59, and ≥60 years at baseline) and non-HDL cholesterol. Additional Cox regression analyses were done to model the concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol as a continuous variable via cubic splines. All Cox models were adjusted for age (timescale), sex (strata), cohort (strata), and classical cardiovascular risk factors (smoking status, diabetes, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and antihypertensive medication). In a sensitivity analysis, sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) for non-HDL cholesterol as a categorical variable were estimated in each country using models similar to the primary analysis, and the results were pooled using a random-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Further sensitivity analyses include the computation of time-dependent HRs for non-HDL cholesterol to examine deviations from the proportional hazards assumption 删除2:<u>( appendix p 29 )</u>.\n\n【28】To establish a tool to assess the probability of cardiovascular disease by the age of 75 years, we split the whole data randomly into two parts of approximately equal size into derivation and validation datasets. In particular, each single cohort was part of both datasets. Using those observations where the required endpoint and covariate information was available, we developed a model that was calculated on the basis of cause-specific Cox models for cardiovascular disease stratified for sex and cohort. Death from non-cardiovascular-disease causes was added as a competing risk, to account for the fact that an individual dying from such a cause before developing cardiovascular disease will not be able to develop cardiovascular disease. These models used age as the timescale and the same variables as our previous Cox models. Non-HDL cholesterol, BMI, and systolic blood pressure were modelled using cubic splines. The models included an interaction between non-HDL cholesterol and sex. The model computation used the full available follow-up periods but was applied only to individuals aged between 35 and 70 years at baseline to estimate their probability of cardiovascular disease by the age of 75 years. These predicted probabilities were averaged within each combination of sex, non-HDL cholesterol category, age category, and according to whether the number of risk factors present (smoking, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and obesity) was greater than or equal to two, or less than two. We then assumed a reduction of the probabilities and their averages through a 50% or 30% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol, on the basis of the equation 1 – exp(−0·249 + \\[number of years of treatment–5\\] × \\[–0·0152\\]) for the expected proportional risk reduction per mmol/L in LDL cholesterol for a given treatment duration. It was assumed that this equation was also valid for non-HDL cholesterol. Following the methods described by Austin, these average probabilities can then be used to estimate risk differences, numbers needed to treat, and differences in relative risk.\n\n【29】To obtain predicted probabilities from the cause-specific Cox models for each combination of sex and cohort, the respective cause-specific baseline hazard function was estimated by fitting a Weibull curve to age and adjusting for the linear predictor of the Cox model. By using age as the timescale, it is possible to estimate the probability of an event within each combination of sex and cohort for the whole range of ages available in that part of the data. C-indices and smooth calibration curves were calculated for different timeframes separately in the derivation and validation datasets. The calibration curves were based on smoothing pseudo-values calculated with the Aalen-Johansen estimate of cumulative incidence. Tenfold cross-validation was used in these computations.\n\n【30】Sensitivity analyses used time-dependent coefficients that were allowed to change with attained age in the predefined groups (<45, 45–59, and ≥60 years). To calculate the effect of non-HDL cholesterol reduction on cardiovascular risk, we assumed a reduction of baseline non-HDL cholesterol by 30% or 50% (adapted from the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol). On the basis of this reduction, we recalculated the probability of a cardiovascular disease event by the age of 75 years, as in our predictive model. The models and their averaged predictions were calculated in the derivation cohorts and also independently in the validation cohorts, and the discrepancy between the average predictions was compared using the root mean square error. This last step was repeated using the complete dataset, excluding each country in turn and also in the excluded country, thus generating country-specific root mean square errors. The final models and their predictions were computed in the complete dataset. Cumulative incidence curves for specific combinations of variables were produced on the basis of the cause-specific Cox models. Here, we also assumed a 50% reduction in non-HDL cholesterol for the included individuals. Applying this equation for the expected proportional risk reduction for a given treatment duration could yield a non-monotonic curve. Therefore, the resulting curves were forced to remain constant in the event of a decrease.\n\n【31】To compare the discrimination of a model using non-HDL cholesterol with that of a model using LDL cholesterol, additional cause-specific Cox models were computed using age as the timescale, sex and cohort as strata, adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors (smoking status, diabetes, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and antihypertensive medication), and including a sex–lipid variable interaction. All continuous variables, except age, were modelled using cubic splines. Tenfold cross-validation was used when computing the C-indices. The main analyses for non-HDL cholesterol were repeated for LDL cholesterol. All statistical methods were implemented in R statistical software, version 3.6.1.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【32】The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

The predefined thresholds of non-HDL cholesterol concentrations strongly differentiated cardiovascular disease risk, particularly beyond 10 years, even in the lowest cholesterol categories 删除2:<u>( figure 1 )</u>. The cumulative incidence curves showed a stepwise increase of cardiovascular disease events across increasing concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol. 30-year cardiovascular disease event rates were approximately three-to-four times higher in women and men in the highest non-HDL cholesterol category (≥5·7 mmol/L) than those in the lowest category (<2·6 mmol/L; 3253 \\[33·7%\\] _vs_ 262 \\[7·7%\\] in women and 7689 \\[43·6%\\] _vs_ 375 \\[12·8%\\] in men). Multivariable analyses confirmed a strong continuous association of concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol with the sex-specific cardiovascular disease risk. The lowest hazard for cardiovascular disease was found in women and men with the lowest non-HDL cholesterol concentrations, whereas there was a continuous and linear increase for higher non-HDL cholesterol concentrations 删除2:<u>( figure 2 ; the reference value \\[HR 1·0\\] was set as 2·6 mmol/L non-HDL cholesterol in both women and men)</u>.

In the population with non-HDL cholesterol of 3·7–4·8 mmol/L, younger than 45 years, and with at least two risk factors, the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease could hypothetically be reduced from 15·6% (95% CI 14·9–16·6) to 3·6% (3·4–3·8) in women and from 28·8% (28·1–29·5) to 6·4% (6·3–6·6) in men.

On the basis of this association, we derived and validated a tool specific for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors to assess the individual long-term probability of cardiovascular disease by the age of 75 years associated with non-HDL cholesterol. Further, we modelled the potentially achievable long-term cardiovascular disease risk, assuming a 50% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol.\n\n【54】The proatherogenic effects of apoB-containing lipoproteins are largely based on the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaques and by accumulation of these lipoproteins within the arterial intima. Although the measurement of LDL cholesterol can be influenced by increased triglycerides in cardiovascular risk assessment, an appropriate way to estimate the amount of apoB-containing lipoproteins is the determination of non-HDL cholesterol. Therefore, our main analyses are based on non-HDL cholesterol. In line with previous studies, we found a comparable prognostic relevance for non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. A large body of evidence including inherited disorders, genetic and epidemiological studies, and clinical trials leads to the hypothesis that reducing apoB-containing lipoproteins, regardless of the method, should yield a corresponding reduction in cardiovascular events. To intervene early and intensively during the lifespan might even lead to regression of early manifestation of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological studies have shown the association between cholesterol concentration and cardiovascular mortality during long-term follow-up. Furthermore, repeated non-HDL cholesterol testing in 2516 individuals of the Framingham Offspring Study suggested that stable concentrations over the lifetime might represent increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Clinical trials, however, mostly address older (age >60 years for most studies) individuals with prevalent cardiovascular disease or at markedly increased cardiovascular risk and report observations over short follow-up intervals, varying between 2 and 7 years. \n\n【55】Considerable uncertainty exists about the extent to which slightly increased or apparently normal cholesterol concentrations affect lifetime cardiovascular risk and about which thresholds should be used to merit a treatment recommendation, particularly in young people. Our study extends current knowledge because it suggests that increasing concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol predict long-term cardiovascular risk, particularly in cases of modest increase at a young age. Only a few studies have reported the age-dependent association of lipids and cardiovascular disease with focus on young individuals. In our analyses, individuals younger than 45 years showed the strongest HRs for the association of blood lipids with the incidence of cardiovascular disease during long-term follow-up. This effect is probably related to the following considerations: (1) the effect of lifetime accumulation of proatherogenic lipids in the vulnerable period of the fourth and fifth decades of life, (2) the shorter timespan that individuals aged 60 years and older have to achieve the cardiovascular disease endpoint due to their age itself, and (3) the fact that people with prevalent cardiovascular disease are not included in our study and thus individuals who reach the age of 60 without prevalent cardiovascular disease are a population enriched with protective characteristics against the proatherogenic effect of cholesterol. However, although there is a weaker association of non-HDL cholesterol with cardiovascular disease in older individuals (>60 years), these people are at higher absolute risk than young individuals, and so the more modest relative risks represent large absolute risk differences across non-HDL cholesterol categories.\n\n【56】The risk circle tool displays the individual lifetime risk of non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular disease by the age of 75 years that is associated with non-HDL cholesterol and is specific for the burden of age, sex, and risk factor. It also estimates the corresponding risk reduction from lipid-lowering therapies. The risk scores currently used for decision making about lipid-lowering intervention assess only the 10-year cardiovascular risk and therefore underestimate lifetime risk, particularly in young individuals. Pencina and colleagues estimated the 30-year risk of cardiovascular disease in the Framingham Offspring cohort and showed 30-year risks that were up to ten times higher than the projected 10-year risks in young people. Therefore, in young individuals, the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease should constitute the basis of primary prevention. Since the risk factor burden is incorporated as a categorical variable in our model, we cannot provide a weighting among the different risk factors or a quantitative consideration of every single risk factor as do other risk models. Instead, because of its simplicity, our risk circle tool provides an opportunity to estimate lifetime risks based on non-HDL cholesterol in an accessible and easily understood way that can improve physician–patient communication about preventive strategies in clinical practice. The modelled risk reduction is calculated hypothetically and is based on a 50% lipid reduction leading to a decrease of the cumulative burden of non-HDL cholesterol. Since the calculated numbers needed to treat are based on different timeframes for different age ranges, they have to be compared carefully between the different age categories. They have to be interpreted individually for a certain spectrum of ages, sexes, and risk factors to guide decision making on any lipid-lowering intervention. Furthermore, numbers needed to treat might be higher than those we showed in low-risk countries with lower than average cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality.\n\n【57】The following limitations merit consideration. First, due to the population-based longitudinal study design, the endpoint information is mainly based on medical reports or local registers and we cannot exclude misclassification of endpoints for some of the observed effects. However, endpoint information was harmonised on the basis of individual data according to the specification of the MORGAM study, and multivariable analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. Therefore, the best achievable data quality can be assumed for the current analyses. Second, only baseline data of blood lipids were available for current analyses. No information about dynamic changes during follow-up or about the initiation of lipid-lowering therapy, particularly in those individuals with very high blood concentrations, could be considered. However, non-HDL cholesterol concentrations in young individuals are generally stable over the 30-year life course, and not adjusting for changes in risk factors was shown to have little bearing on lifetime cardiovascular disease risk. Third, our cohorts largely included individuals with European ancestry from high-income countries in Europe, North America, and Australia. The generalisability of our findings to other regions or individuals from other racial and ethnic groups is unknown. Finally, the therapeutic benefit of lipid-lowering intervention investigated in our study is based on a hypothetical model that assumes a stable reduction of non-HDL cholesterol. We recognise that making such an assumption posits that treatment effects are sustained over a much longer term than has been studied in clinical trials and that real-world benefits of taking statins are probably lower than those shown in trials because of adherence and side-effects. However, since clinical trials investigating the benefit of lipid-lowering therapy in individuals younger than 45 years during a follow-up of 30 years are not available, our study provides unique insights into the benefits of a potential early intervention in primary prevention. We agree with Hippisley-Cox and colleagues that future research needs to address many related questions, including whether intervention in young people with a high lifetime risk but low 10-year risk would yield greater benefits than late intervention.\n删除4:<u>\n**This online publication has been corrected.

We investigated the cardiovascular disease risk associated with the full spectrum of bloodstream non-HDL cholesterol concentrations. We also created an easy-to-use tool to estimate the long-term probabilities for a cardiovascular disease event associated with non-HDL cholesterol and modelled its risk reduction by lipid-lowering treatment.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In this risk-evaluation and risk-modelling study, we used Multinational Cardiovascular Risk Consortium data from 19 countries across Europe, Australia, and North America. Individuals without prevalent cardiovascular disease at baseline and with robust available data on cardiovascular disease outcomes were included. The primary composite endpoint of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was defined as the occurrence of the coronary heart disease event or ischaemic stroke. Sex-specific multivariable analyses were computed using non-HDL cholesterol categories according to the European guideline thresholds, adjusted for age, sex, cohort, and classical modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. In a derivation and validation design, we created a tool to estimate the probabilities of a cardiovascular disease event by the age of 75 years, dependent on age, sex, and risk factors, and the associated modelled risk reduction, assuming a 50% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of the 524 444 individuals in the 44 cohorts in the Consortium database, we identified 398 846 individuals belonging to 38 cohorts (184 055 \\[48·7%\\] women; median age 51·0 years \\[IQR 40·7–59·7\\]). 199 415 individuals were included in the derivation cohort (91 786 \\[48·4%\\] women) and 199 431 (92 269 \\[49·1%\\] women) in the validation cohort. During a maximum follow-up of 43·6 years (median 13·5 years, IQR 7·0–20·1), 54 542 cardiovascular endpoints occurred. Incidence curve analyses showed progressively higher 30-year cardiovascular disease event-rates for increasing non-HDL cholesterol categories (from 7·7% for non-HDL cholesterol <2·6 mmol/L to 33·7% for ≥5·7 mmol/L in women and from 12·8% to 43·6% in men; p<0·0001). Multivariable adjusted Cox models with non-HDL cholesterol lower than 2·6 mmol/L as reference showed an increase in the association between non-HDL cholesterol concentration and cardiovascular disease for both sexes (from hazard ratio 1·1, 95% CI 1·0–1·3 for non-HDL cholesterol 2·6 to <3·7 mmol/L to 1·9, 1·6–2·2 for ≥5·7 mmol/L in women and from 1·1, 1·0–1·3 to 2·3, 2·0–2·5 in men). The derived tool allowed the estimation of cardiovascular disease event probabilities specific for non-HDL cholesterol with high comparability between the derivation and validation cohorts as reflected by smooth calibration curves analyses and a root mean square error lower than 1% for the estimated probabilities of cardiovascular disease. A 50% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol concentrations was associated with reduced risk of a cardiovascular disease event by the age of 75 years, and this risk reduction was greater the earlier cholesterol concentrations were reduced.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Non-HDL cholesterol concentrations in blood are strongly associated with long-term risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We provide a simple tool for individual long-term risk assessment and the potential benefit of early lipid-lowering intervention. These data could be useful for physician–patient communication about primary prevention strategies.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】EU Framework Programme, UK Medical Research Council, and German Centre for Cardiovascular Research.\n\n【10】**Research in context**\n\n【11】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【12】The blood concentrations of non-HDL and LDL cholesterol are accepted as causal cardiovascular risk factors and constitute a cornerstone of cardiovascular disease risk prediction in the general population.

Our data extend current knowledge and highlight the impact of non-HDL cholesterol on very long-term cardiovascular disease outcomes. A simulation of early reduction of non-HDL cholesterol across a range of lipid concentration categories estimates the risk reduction in the general population. Meeting targets for global reduction of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality will require increased awareness of the value of early cholesterol determination and careful evaluation of potential strategies for reduction of lipid concentrations across the lifespan.\n\n【17】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【18】Numerous studies have provided consistent evidence for a causal relationship between blood cholesterol concentrations and cardiovascular disease. Calculating the concentration of non-HDL cholesterol offers a simple way to analyse the total amount of proatherogenic lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B (apoB). Such proteins include very low-density lipoproteins and their metabolic remnants, intermediate-density lipoproteins, lipoprotein(a), and low-density lipoproteins. Besides estimating cholesterol concentrations contained in LDL particles (LDL cholesterol), the assessment of non-HDL cholesterol calculated as total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol is therefore recommended by current US and European guidelines for cardiovascular risk estimation. The indication for lipid-lowering therapy to prevent cardiovascular disease events in high-risk individuals or for secondary prevention is unequivocal. However, the decision on implementing a lipid-lowering intervention in the primary prevention setting is a major challenge in clinical practice for several reasons. Data on the association between the concentrations of the entire range of bloodstream lipids and very long-term cardiovascular outcomes in the general population are rather sparse. In addition, conventional primary prevention guidelines recommend lipid-lowering intervention on the basis of lipid concentration thresholds and the person's individual 10-year cardiovascular risk. This risk assessment might underestimate or fail to take proper account of the cumulative lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease and lipid-related cardiovascular disease risk, particularly in young adults. Furthermore, increased non-HDL cholesterol blood concentrations early in life seem to be stable over the life course and are predictive for incident cardiovascular disease. Therefore, in this study we aimed to (1) evaluate long-term risk for cardiovascular disease in the population related to non-HDL cholesterol on the basis of existing thresholds of blood lipid concentrations; (2) establish an easily applicable tool to assess the long-term probabilities for cardiovascular disease events associated with non-HDL cholesterol, using a derivation and validation approach; and (3) provide a model indicating the potential benefit of an early lipid-lowering strategy in individuals without prevalent cardiovascular disease.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】### Study design and participants\n\n【21】In this risk-evaluation and risk-modelling study, we used individual-level data from the Multinational Cardiovascular Risk Consortium 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 2–11 )</u>. Currently, the Consortium comprises data on 524 444 individuals from 44 population-based cohorts across Europe, Australia, and the USA. These include 23 harmonised cohorts from the MONICA Risk Genetics Archiving and Monograph (MORGAM) and Biomarker for Cardiovascular Risk Assessment in Europe (BiomarCaRE) studies and another 21 harmonised, population-based cohorts with the same specifications as defined for the BiomarCaRE and MORGAM projects 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 15–18 )</u>. Of these, we used cohorts that had available data on cardiovascular disease endpoints 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 16–18 )</u>. We excluded data on participants with prevalent cardiovascular disease, defined as a history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Detailed information about the study cohorts including the number of individuals with available information for each variable are provided in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 19–27)</u> . Informed consent was obtained if necessary (depending on survey year and local requirement). Detailed information for each cohort is given in the study descriptions 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 2–11 )</u>.\n\n【22】### Procedures\n\n【23】Our outcome measure was the first occurrence of a major cardiovascular event 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 16–18 )</u>. This was assessed in all participating individuals and death of non-cardiovascular-disease cause was used as a competing risk if appropriate. We defined it as a composite endpoint of the first non-fatal or fatal coronary heart disease or ischaemic stroke event. Coronary heart disease was defined as a composite of non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction including unstable angina, coronary death, and coronary revascularisation. Outcomes were measured in each prospective cohort study by standardised follow-up (visit, report, registry information, etc; details are given for each cohort删除2-1:<u>, appendix pp 2–11 </u>). Composite endpoint information for current analyses is provided in the appendix 删除2:<u>(pp 16–18)</u> . There were no secondary outcomes.\n\n【24】We based our cholesterol threshold concentrations on the treatment-determining cholesterol categories of the 2016 European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention. As recommended by the guidelines, we calculated non-HDL cholesterol thresholds by adding 30 mg/dL to the LDL cholesterol thresholds defined in our cohorts. Our analyses were based on baseline information available for concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. We report threshold concentrations in mmol/L, assuming that 1 mmol/L contains 38·67 mg/dL of LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol (for non-HDL cholesterol, the following categories were used: <100 mg/dL \\[<2·6 mmol/L\\]; 100 to <145 mg/dL \\[2·6 to <3·7 mmol/L\\]; 145 to <185 mg/dL \\[3·7 to <4·8 mmol/L\\]; 185 to <220 mg/dL \\[4·8 to <5·7 mmol/L\\], and ≥220 mg/dL \\[≥5·7 mmol/L\\]). The cutoff between the second and third category differs slightly from the European guidelines. We adapted this cutoff from 130 mg/dL (3·4 mmol/L) to 145 mg/dL (3·7 mmol/L), since the latter is the goal for lipid-lowering therapy recommended for individuals at low risk, who comprise most of our study population.\n\n【25】The following study variables were considered for analysis (but were not endpoints): age, sex, year of examination, body-mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, smoking status, use of cholesterol-lowering medication, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. History of arterial hypertension, diabetes, stroke, and myocardial infarction were defined as they had been documented or self-reported. Antihypertensive medication, lipid-lowering medication, and smoking status were self-reported. For individuals receiving lipid-lowering therapy, baseline concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were inflated by 30% for the analyses, assuming that treatment with statins had a moderate effect on lipid reduction and was initiated late during lifetime. Information about individuals receiving lipid-lowering therapy stratified by survey decades and age is shown in the appendix 删除2:<u>(p 28)</u> .\n\n【26】### Statistical analysis\n\n【27】For each analysis, only individuals with all data available on the relevant variables were used. To investigate the association of non-HDL cholesterol concentrations and time to cardiovascular disease, sex-specific cumulative incidence curves were produced according to the defined baseline non-HDL cholesterol threshold concentrations, with death of non-cardiovascular-disease causes as competing risk, using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were then computed, stratified for cohort and sex. Non-HDL cholesterol was coded as a categorical variable, with the help of dummy variables, using our predefined thresholds and included an interaction term with sex, to obtain sex-specific associations. To examine the association of non-HDL cholesterol across different ages, the models were expanded by adding an interaction between age category (<45, 45–59, and ≥60 years at baseline) and non-HDL cholesterol. Additional Cox regression analyses were done to model the concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol as a continuous variable via cubic splines. All Cox models were adjusted for age (timescale), sex (strata), cohort (strata), and classical cardiovascular risk factors (smoking status, diabetes, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and antihypertensive medication). In a sensitivity analysis, sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) for non-HDL cholesterol as a categorical variable were estimated in each country using models similar to the primary analysis, and the results were pooled using a random-effects multivariate meta-analysis. Further sensitivity analyses include the computation of time-dependent HRs for non-HDL cholesterol to examine deviations from the proportional hazards assumption 删除2:<u>( appendix p 29 )</u>.\n\n【28】To establish a tool to assess the probability of cardiovascular disease by the age of 75 years, we split the whole data randomly into two parts of approximately equal size into derivation and validation datasets. In particular, each single cohort was part of both datasets. Using those observations where the required endpoint and covariate information was available, we developed a model that was calculated on the basis of cause-specific Cox models for cardiovascular disease stratified for sex and cohort. Death from non-cardiovascular-disease causes was added as a competing risk, to account for the fact that an individual dying from such a cause before developing cardiovascular disease will not be able to develop cardiovascular disease. These models used age as the timescale and the same variables as our previous Cox models. Non-HDL cholesterol, BMI, and systolic blood pressure were modelled using cubic splines. The models included an interaction between non-HDL cholesterol and sex. The model computation used the full available follow-up periods but was applied only to individuals aged between 35 and 70 years at baseline to estimate their probability of cardiovascular disease by the age of 75 years. These predicted probabilities were averaged within each combination of sex, non-HDL cholesterol category, age category, and according to whether the number of risk factors present (smoking, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and obesity) was greater than or equal to two, or less than two. We then assumed a reduction of the probabilities and their averages through a 50% or 30% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol, on the basis of the equation 1 – exp(−0·249 + \\[number of years of treatment–5\\] × \\[–0·0152\\]) for the expected proportional risk reduction per mmol/L in LDL cholesterol for a given treatment duration. It was assumed that this equation was also valid for non-HDL cholesterol. Following the methods described by Austin, these average probabilities can then be used to estimate risk differences, numbers needed to treat, and differences in relative risk.\n\n【29】To obtain predicted probabilities from the cause-specific Cox models for each combination of sex and cohort, the respective cause-specific baseline hazard function was estimated by fitting a Weibull curve to age and adjusting for the linear predictor of the Cox model. By using age as the timescale, it is possible to estimate the probability of an event within each combination of sex and cohort for the whole range of ages available in that part of the data. C-indices and smooth calibration curves were calculated for different timeframes separately in the derivation and validation datasets. The calibration curves were based on smoothing pseudo-values calculated with the Aalen-Johansen estimate of cumulative incidence. Tenfold cross-validation was used in these computations.\n\n【30】Sensitivity analyses used time-dependent coefficients that were allowed to change with attained age in the predefined groups (<45, 45–59, and ≥60 years). To calculate the effect of non-HDL cholesterol reduction on cardiovascular risk, we assumed a reduction of baseline non-HDL cholesterol by 30% or 50% (adapted from the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol). On the basis of this reduction, we recalculated the probability of a cardiovascular disease event by the age of 75 years, as in our predictive model. The models and their averaged predictions were calculated in the derivation cohorts and also independently in the validation cohorts, and the discrepancy between the average predictions was compared using the root mean square error. This last step was repeated using the complete dataset, excluding each country in turn and also in the excluded country, thus generating country-specific root mean square errors. The final models and their predictions were computed in the complete dataset. Cumulative incidence curves for specific combinations of variables were produced on the basis of the cause-specific Cox models. Here, we also assumed a 50% reduction in non-HDL cholesterol for the included individuals. Applying this equation for the expected proportional risk reduction for a given treatment duration could yield a non-monotonic curve. Therefore, the resulting curves were forced to remain constant in the event of a decrease.\n\n【31】To compare the discrimination of a model using non-HDL cholesterol with that of a model using LDL cholesterol, additional cause-specific Cox models were computed using age as the timescale, sex and cohort as strata, adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors (smoking status, diabetes, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and antihypertensive medication), and including a sex–lipid variable interaction. All continuous variables, except age, were modelled using cubic splines. Tenfold cross-validation was used when computing the C-indices. The main analyses for non-HDL cholesterol were repeated for LDL cholesterol. All statistical methods were implemented in R statistical software, version 3.6.1.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【32】The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

The predefined thresholds of non-HDL cholesterol concentrations strongly differentiated cardiovascular disease risk, particularly beyond 10 years, even in the lowest cholesterol categories 删除2:<u>( figure 1 )</u>. The cumulative incidence curves showed a stepwise increase of cardiovascular disease events across increasing concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol. 30-year cardiovascular disease event rates were approximately three-to-four times higher in women and men in the highest non-HDL cholesterol category (≥5·7 mmol/L) than those in the lowest category (<2·6 mmol/L; 3253 \\[33·7%\\] _vs_ 262 \\[7·7%\\] in women and 7689 \\[43·6%\\] _vs_ 375 \\[12·8%\\] in men). Multivariable analyses confirmed a strong continuous association of concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol with the sex-specific cardiovascular disease risk. The lowest hazard for cardiovascular disease was found in women and men with the lowest non-HDL cholesterol concentrations, whereas there was a continuous and linear increase for higher non-HDL cholesterol concentrations 删除2:<u>( figure 2 ; the reference value \\[HR 1·0\\] was set as 2·6 mmol/L non-HDL cholesterol in both women and men)</u>.

Besides the non-HDL cholesterol category, sex, age, and the baseline number (≤1 _vs_ ≥2) of classical modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (ie, arterial hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking) were incorporated into this model 删除2:<u>( figure 4 )</u>. For example, women with non-HDL cholesterol concentrations between 3·7 and 4·8 mmol/L, younger than 45 years, and with at least two additional cardiovascular risk factors had a 15·6% (95% CI 14·9–16·6) probability of experiencing a non-fatal or fatal cardiovascular disease event by the age of 75 years (28·8%, 28·1–29·5 in men with the same characteristics). The highest long-term risk of cardiovascular disease was seen in individuals younger than 45 years of age.

In the population with non-HDL cholesterol of 3·7–4·8 mmol/L, younger than 45 years, and with at least two risk factors, the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease could hypothetically be reduced from 15·6% (95% CI 14·9–16·6) to 3·6% (3·4–3·8) in women and from 28·8% (28·1–29·5) to 6·4% (6·3–6·6) in men. Further, corresponding numbers of patients needed to treat over the lifespan up to the age of 75 years, and achievable relative risk reduction (RRR) are shown in table 3 .

Additionally, we computed the incidence for cardiovascular disease and the achievable risk reduction due to 50% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol for specific individuals starting at different ages.

On the basis of this association, we derived and validated a tool specific for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors to assess the individual long-term probability of cardiovascular disease by the age of 75 years associated with non-HDL cholesterol. Further, we modelled the potentially achievable long-term cardiovascular disease risk, assuming a 50% reduction of non-HDL cholesterol.\n\n【54】The proatherogenic effects of apoB-containing lipoproteins are largely based on the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaques and by accumulation of these lipoproteins within the arterial intima. Although the measurement of LDL cholesterol can be influenced by increased triglycerides in cardiovascular risk assessment, an appropriate way to estimate the amount of apoB-containing lipoproteins is the determination of non-HDL cholesterol. Therefore, our main analyses are based on non-HDL cholesterol. In line with previous studies, we found a comparable prognostic relevance for non-HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. A large body of evidence including inherited disorders, genetic and epidemiological studies, and clinical trials leads to the hypothesis that reducing apoB-containing lipoproteins, regardless of the method, should yield a corresponding reduction in cardiovascular events. To intervene early and intensively during the lifespan might even lead to regression of early manifestation of atherosclerosis. Epidemiological studies have shown the association between cholesterol concentration and cardiovascular mortality during long-term follow-up. Furthermore, repeated non-HDL cholesterol testing in 2516 individuals of the Framingham Offspring Study suggested that stable concentrations over the lifetime might represent increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Clinical trials, however, mostly address older (age >60 years for most studies) individuals with prevalent cardiovascular disease or at markedly increased cardiovascular risk and report observations over short follow-up intervals, varying between 2 and 7 years. \n\n【55】Considerable uncertainty exists about the extent to which slightly increased or apparently normal cholesterol concentrations affect lifetime cardiovascular risk and about which thresholds should be used to merit a treatment recommendation, particularly in young people. Our study extends current knowledge because it suggests that increasing concentrations of non-HDL cholesterol predict long-term cardiovascular risk, particularly in cases of modest increase at a young age. Only a few studies have reported the age-dependent association of lipids and cardiovascular disease with focus on young individuals. In our analyses, individuals younger than 45 years showed the strongest HRs for the association of blood lipids with the incidence of cardiovascular disease during long-term follow-up. This effect is probably related to the following considerations: (1) the effect of lifetime accumulation of proatherogenic lipids in the vulnerable period of the fourth and fifth decades of life, (2) the shorter timespan that individuals aged 60 years and older have to achieve the cardiovascular disease endpoint due to their age itself, and (3) the fact that people with prevalent cardiovascular disease are not included in our study and thus individuals who reach the age of 60 without prevalent cardiovascular disease are a population enriched with protective characteristics against the proatherogenic effect of cholesterol. However, although there is a weaker association of non-HDL cholesterol with cardiovascular disease in older individuals (>60 years), these people are at higher absolute risk than young individuals, and so the more modest relative risks represent large absolute risk differences across non-HDL cholesterol categories.\n\n【56】The risk circle tool displays the individual lifetime risk of non-fatal and fatal cardiovascular disease by the age of 75 years that is associated with non-HDL cholesterol and is specific for the burden of age, sex, and risk factor. It also estimates the corresponding risk reduction from lipid-lowering therapies. The risk scores currently used for decision making about lipid-lowering intervention assess only the 10-year cardiovascular risk and therefore underestimate lifetime risk, particularly in young individuals. Pencina and colleagues estimated the 30-year risk of cardiovascular disease in the Framingham Offspring cohort and showed 30-year risks that were up to ten times higher than the projected 10-year risks in young people. Therefore, in young individuals, the long-term risk of cardiovascular disease should constitute the basis of primary prevention. Since the risk factor burden is incorporated as a categorical variable in our model, we cannot provide a weighting among the different risk factors or a quantitative consideration of every single risk factor as do other risk models. Instead, because of its simplicity, our risk circle tool provides an opportunity to estimate lifetime risks based on non-HDL cholesterol in an accessible and easily understood way that can improve physician–patient communication about preventive strategies in clinical practice. The modelled risk reduction is calculated hypothetically and is based on a 50% lipid reduction leading to a decrease of the cumulative burden of non-HDL cholesterol. Since the calculated numbers needed to treat are based on different timeframes for different age ranges, they have to be compared carefully between the different age categories. They have to be interpreted individually for a certain spectrum of ages, sexes, and risk factors to guide decision making on any lipid-lowering intervention. Furthermore, numbers needed to treat might be higher than those we showed in low-risk countries with lower than average cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality.\n\n【57】The following limitations merit consideration. First, due to the population-based longitudinal study design, the endpoint information is mainly based on medical reports or local registers and we cannot exclude misclassification of endpoints for some of the observed effects. However, endpoint information was harmonised on the basis of individual data according to the specification of the MORGAM study, and multivariable analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. Therefore, the best achievable data quality can be assumed for the current analyses. Second, only baseline data of blood lipids were available for current analyses. No information about dynamic changes during follow-up or about the initiation of lipid-lowering therapy, particularly in those individuals with very high blood concentrations, could be considered. However, non-HDL cholesterol concentrations in young individuals are generally stable over the 30-year life course, and not adjusting for changes in risk factors was shown to have little bearing on lifetime cardiovascular disease risk. Third, our cohorts largely included individuals with European ancestry from high-income countries in Europe, North America, and Australia. The generalisability of our findings to other regions or individuals from other racial and ethnic groups is unknown. Finally, the therapeutic benefit of lipid-lowering intervention investigated in our study is based on a hypothetical model that assumes a stable reduction of non-HDL cholesterol. We recognise that making such an assumption posits that treatment effects are sustained over a much longer term than has been studied in clinical trials and that real-world benefits of taking statins are probably lower than those shown in trials because of adherence and side-effects. However, since clinical trials investigating the benefit of lipid-lowering therapy in individuals younger than 45 years during a follow-up of 30 years are not available, our study provides unique insights into the benefits of a potential early intervention in primary prevention. We agree with Hippisley-Cox and colleagues that future research needs to address many related questions, including whether intervention in young people with a high lifetime risk but low 10-year risk would yield greater benefits than late intervention.\n删除4:<u>\n**This online publication has been corrected.

We conducted a secondary analysis to determine how these benefits can be optimised, by evaluating the effect of dexamethasone compared to placebo on newborn mortality and severe respiratory distress outcomes at different administration-to-birth intervals, and identifying the interval with the greatest benefits.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】The WHO ACTION-I trial was a multi-country, individually-randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. It was conducted in 29 hospitals across Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. Women with a viable singleton or multiple pregnancy who presented to participating hospitals at a gestational age of 26 weeks 0 days–33 weeks 6 days and who were at risk of imminent preterm birth were eligible. In this secondary analysis, 2638 women and their newborns treated with single course of dexamethasone or placebo were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of dexamethasone versus placebo on neonatal death, stillbirth or neonatal death, and severe respiratory distress at 24 h and at 168 h, by administration-to-birth interval (from 0 through 28 days), adjusting for gestational age at first dose. We used relative risks to identify the administration-to-birth interval with the greatest benefits of dexamethasone compared to placebo on the newborn outcomes.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between 24 December 2017 and 21 November 2019, 2852 women and their 3070 babies were enrolled in the WHO ACTION-I trial; 1332 women (1464 babies) in the dexamethasone group and 1306 women (1440 babies) in the placebo group were included in this secondary analysis. Neonatal mortality risk was lower with increasing time between initiating dexamethasone and birth, achieving peak mortality reduction by days 13 and 14 and then diminishing as the interval approached 28 days, regardless of gestational age at administration. For other outcomes, the overall pattern of risk reduction extending into the second week was consistent with that of neonatal death.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】In women at risk of preterm birth prior to 34 weeks’ gestation, the neonatal benefits of antenatal dexamethasone appear to increase with longer administration-to-birth intervals than previously thought. This knowledge can support clinical assessment and estimation of the risks of adverse preterm newborn outcomes at the time of birth, and the potential benefits of antenatal dexamethasone treatment for a known administration-to-birth interval.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; World Health Organization.\n\n【10】Research in context\n\n【11】### Evidence before this study\n\n【12】We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Global Index Medicus (using search terms and synonyms for “pregnancy” and “corticosteroid” and “duration”), with no date or language restrictions to identify randomised and non-randomised studies where newborn outcomes were reported for different antenatal corticosteroid administration-to-birth intervals. The review identified 59 studies (11 trials and 48 observational studies), largely from high-income country settings, and there was considerable heterogeneity in study populations, administration-to-birth intervals used, and conclusions. It was not possible to identify an optimal interval from existing evidence.\n\n【13】### Added value of this study\n\n【14】To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of an antenatal corticosteroid efficacy trial that has identified further reduction in the relative risk of neonatal mortality with longer dexamethasone administration-to-birth intervals. The relative risk of severe neonatal respiratory distress at 24 h and at 168 h showed similar patterns although not as remarkable as that of neonatal death. This analysis goes beyond previous studies by using administration-to-birth interval as a continuous (rather than categorical) variable, and using multivariate modelling to account for the confounding effects of gestational age and other important maternal and newborn factors. We developed a practical tool for potential clinical application of these findings.\n\n【15】### Implications of all the available evidence\n\n【16】The neonatal mortality reduction benefits from antenatal dexamethasone for women at risk of early preterm birth might be substantially higher with longer administration-to-birth intervals than generally thought, regardless of gestational age at the time of initiating treatment. Our findings question the scientific basis of clinical recommendations that are based upon the premise that ACS are not effective and even harmful after 7 days following initiation of treatment. The new knowledge generated from this study can be used to support clinical assessment and estimation of the risks of adverse preterm newborn outcomes at the time of birth, as well as the potential benefits of ACS treatment for a known administration-to-birth interval (such as in the context of provider-initiated preterm birth).\n\n【17】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【18】Antenatal administration of corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth has been shown to improve outcomes for preterm newborns. The 2020 update of the Cochrane review on efficacy of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) demonstrated that a single course of dexamethasone or betamethasone prior to 34 weeks’ gestation confers significant reductions in neonatal mortality, and severe morbidities, without causing maternal or newborn harms. While previous trials on the efficacy of ACS were largely conducted in high-income countries, the recently published WHO ACTION ( **A** ntenatal **C** orticos **T** eroids for **I** mproving **O** utcomes in preterm **N** ewborn)-I trial, which was conducted in hospitals across five low-resource countries, provide reassurance on the clinical benefits of ACS when used for women at risk of early preterm birth. The trial reported a substantial reduction in the risks of neonatal mortality alone and stillbirth or neonatal mortality, without increasing the risk of maternal or neonatal infection, and thus laid to rest the controversies surrounding the safety and efficacy of ACS in low-resource countries.\n\n【19】Now that the benefits of ACS administration in low-resource countries have been established, there is a need to determine how these benefits can be optimised in clinical practice. One important consideration is the potential relationship between the time interval from administration of ACS to birth and how the interval might affect the neonatal benefits of ACS. In contemporary obstetric practice, it is generally accepted that there is a minimum and a maximum time of in-utero “fetal exposure” to ACS to achieve clinical benefits and avoid harms. While this notion is reasonable from a scientific standpoint (particularly based on findings from animal studies), what constitutes the best (or optimal) time interval to maximise clinical benefits of ACS remains unclear. Several organisations, including WHO, recommend that administration of ACS should target eligible women with a high likelihood of preterm birth within 7 days of starting treatment, but the quality of the underlying evidence is low. Although the timing of provider-initiated preterm birth via labour induction or caesarean section can be reasonably anticipated, accurate prediction of the timing of spontaneously-initiated preterm birth even among those at highest risk is clinically difficult. Hence, adherence to current ACS recommendations regarding administration-to-birth interval remains practically challenging.\n\n【20】Previous studies exploring the association between time from ACS administration-to-birth and newborn health outcomes have generally been inconsistent in their findings. For example, a study in Canada by Melamed et al. reported that maximum benefits were observed when ACS was administered 1–7 days prior to birth. In contrast, an observational study by Norman et al. across several European countries reported that ACS were associated with a rapid decline in infant mortality even over a short period (less than 12 h) between administration and birth. Though the greatest reductions were observed at an interval between 18 and 36 h, the mortality benefits appeared to persist beyond 3 weeks. Other studies from high-income countries have also reported that benefits of ACS are time-related, though the intervals associated with improved outcomes are not consistent across studies. It is unclear whether these variations were the results of heterogeneity in clinical practice protocols, characteristics of the study populations, outcome measures, or inherent biases in the study designs. Many studies had pre-defined an interval between 24 h and 7 days as the “optimal interval” without analysing and reporting the time points associated with greatest risk reductions for specified adverse outcomes, or accounting for important confounders such as gestational age at the time of ACS administration. To address these shortcomings and provide data from low-resource country contexts, we conducted a secondary analysis of the WHO ACTION-I trial to evaluate the effect of dexamethasone compared to placebo on neonatal mortality and severe respiratory morbidity outcomes, by the administration-to-birth interval, in order to identify the interval with the greatest clinical benefits (i.e. an optimal interval).\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Study design and participants\n\n【23】The design of the WHO ACTION-I trial has been described previously in the study protocol and primary findings. In brief, WHO ACTION-I trial was a multi-country, multi-centre, individually-randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial was conducted in 29 secondary and tertiary level hospitals across Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. The trial protocol was approved by ethics committees and regulatory agencies for each country and participating hospital and the WHO Ethics Review Committee and registered prior to commencement (Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number ACTRN12617000476336; Clinical Trials Registry-India number, CTRI/2017/04/008326). The trial was conducted and reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. All participants were randomized between December 2017 and November 2019, and the trial was stopped early due to evidence of benefit. \n\n【24】Women with a viable singleton or multiple pregnancy who presented to participating hospitals at a gestational age of 26 weeks 0 days–33 weeks 6 days and who were identified as being at risk of imminent preterm birth were eligible for inclusion and invited to participate. Imminent preterm birth was defined as planned or expected birth in the next 48 h (either provider-initiated or after preterm prelabour rupture of membranes or spontaneous labour). To be eligible, a woman's gestational age had to be informed by an obstetric ultrasound. Women were not eligible if they had clinical signs of severe infection, suspicion, or evidence of clinical chorioamnionitis, major congenital fetal anomalies, concurrent or recent use of systemic steroids, were participating in another maternal or newborn health trial, or had a contraindication to steroid use. Women were screened at the time of presentation to hospital, and randomised women and their babies were followed up until day 28 after birth, at the hospital or at home. Written informed consent was obtained from every woman prior to randomisation.\n\n【25】For this secondary analysis, we included randomised women (and their newborns) who received a single course of dexamethasone or placebo, had complete data for trial primary outcomes, and who had complete data on time of dexamethasone or placebo administration and time of birth. Women who received a repeat course (and their newborns) were excluded. Hence, the population for this analysis comprised 92.5% of women and 90.2% of babies who participated in the WHO ACTION-I trial.\n\n【26】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【27】In the ACTION-I Trial, site-stratified individual randomization (1:1 ratio) with balanced permuted blocks of 10 were used. Eligible, consenting women were randomly assigned to a course of IM injections of either 6 mg dexamethasone or identical placebo (normal saline) administered every 12 h, to a maximum of four doses, or until hospital discharge or birth, whichever was earlier. Women were eligible for a repeat course if they had not given birth after 7 completed days but still met the eligibility criteria (the repeat course was the same as the initial allocation).\n\n【28】### Outcomes\n\n【29】The ACTION-I trial primary outcomes were neonatal death until 28 completed days of life; stillbirth or neonatal death (any baby death); and a composite outcome for possible maternal bacterial infection (defined as maternal fever or clinically suspected or confirmed infection, for which therapeutic antibiotics were used). Secondary outcomes included maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity outcomes, and process of care outcomes.\n\n【30】For this secondary analysis, the outcomes of interest were neonatal death, stillbirth or neonatal death (i.e. any baby death), severe neonatal respiratory distress within 24 h, and severe neonatal respiratory distress within the first week of birth (168 h). In the ACTION-I trial, severe neonatal respiratory distress was clinically defined based on the composite of fast breathing (respiratory rate ≥70 breaths per minute); and at least one of marked nasal flaring during inspiration, expiratory grunting audible with naked ear, or severe chest in-drawing; and SpO2 less than 90% or use of supplemental oxygen.\n\n【31】### Statistical analysis\n\n【32】The exposure variables of interest for this analysis were the allocated treatments (dexamethasone and placebo). We aimed to assess how selected newborn outcomes varied by administration-to-birth interval, which was defined as the time from administration of the first dose of dexamethasone or placebo until birth. This interval was considered using both categorical and continuous variable approaches. For each outcome, we explored the administration-to-birth time interval which was associated with the greatest benefit of dexamethasone compared to placebo.\n\n【33】We used two different statistical approaches. First, we conducted subgroup analyses stratifying the study population by pre-defined categories of administration-to-birth intervals, and calculated the relative risks of dexamethasone compared to placebo for each newborn outcome and for each interval category. This approach had two important limitations: firstly, the categories of administration-to-birth intervals were pre-defined based on clinical practice considerations and boundaries that were set from previous research. As a result of these limitations, interactions with intervals other than those categories defined _a priori_ might be concealed, and it does not take full advantage of having continuous data for the administration-to-birth interval. It also does not take into account the impact of gestational age (which naturally increases with increasing administration-to-birth interval) on newborn health outcomes – it was evident from this analysis as the relative risks varied considerably depending on the gestational age at time of first dose.\n\n【34】To address these issues, we used a second statistical approach. We created a prediction model based on women receiving dexamethasone or placebo for each of the newborn outcomes of interest, taking into account the administration-to-birth interval as continuous variable, as well as gestational age at first administration. Then, from the predicted risks for the dexamethasone and placebo arms, we estimated the relative risks (RRs) for each outcome by gestational age at first dose to identify the interval with the greatest benefit. We used multivariate logistic regression to create the prediction models for each outcome. First, we fitted a full quadratic polynomial model for each trial arm on time from administration-to-birth and gestational age at first dose (i.e. the model included the linear and quadratic terms for each of these continuous variables and the cross product of the two), plus covariates. The following covariates were ultimately included in the model: gestational age at first dose, whether the preterm birth was spontaneously- or provider-initiated, mode of birth, maternal age, singleton or multiple birth, nulliparity, history of preterm birth, having at least one obstetrical condition present, and whether tocolytics and magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection had been administered. These covariates were all measured at baseline, except for mode of birth.\n\n【35】We used the Lasso strategy for selecting variables and assessed the goodness of fit of several candidate models, using the difference between the log-likelihood of the saturated model and that of the fitted model. For each outcome a reduced model was obtained, keeping only terms that were significant at 10% 删除2:<u>(See Supplementary File S1 for statistical methods on model development)</u>. We assessed whether the added covariates altered the findings on which time interval had the greatest benefits of dexamethasone compared to placebo, with respect to the neonatal outcomes. We also assessed models using either gestational age at first dose or gestational age at birth - the fits and estimated risks were identical. This is due to the linear relationship between these two measures (i.e. gestational age at birth is the sum of gestational age at first dose and the time from first dose to birth).\n\n【36】Using the reduced model, we estimated for each gestational age at first dose the effects of dexamethasone by different administration-to-birth intervals in days up to 28 days from the start of treatment, in order to identify the time interval with the greatest benefits of dexamethasone compared to placebo. Effects of dexamethasone were expressed as relative risks (risks of outcome for infants exposed to dexamethasone compared with those exposed to placebo, with their 95% confidence intervals). To estimate the relative risks with their 95% confidence intervals, we used the Poisson distribution with the log link in the logistic model and then estimated linear combinations corresponding to the relative risks for different values of gestational age at first dose and administration-to-birth intervals. The same analysis was conducted with administration-to-birth intervals in hours up to 24 h from the start of treatment to further elucidate the relative risks of neonatal death at shorter intervals. For each gestational age at first dose, we plotted the relative risks by administration-to-birth intervals, and identified the optimal interval as the time points where greatest impact of dexamethasone (in terms of risk reduction compared to placebo) were observed.\n\n【37】To aid interpretation and develop a tool for potential clinical application of these findings in our study context, we used profiler software (JMP Statistical Discovery Software, version 16.0删除2-1:<u>, Supplementary File S2 </u>) to generate and visualize the predicted risk of an outcome for any combination of the independent variables. The profiler shows the estimated risk and its confidence intervals for particular combinations of gestational age at first dose, administration-to-birth interval, and treatment with dexamethasone or no treatment (i.e. placebo).\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【38】The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

For women receiving dexamethasone, 20.1% (294/1464) had an administration-to-birth interval of ≤6 h, 36.1% (529/1464) had an interval of 24 h–168 h (1 week), and 27.0% (395/1464) had an interval greater than 1 week. When considered as a continuous variable, the distribution of this interval for dexamethasone and placebo arms was very similar, though the placebo group had a slightly shorter administration-to-birth time. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows the number of births and neonatal deaths for each week of gestational age at birth - the highest number of births occurred at 33 weeks (571 babies). Across the preterm period (<37 weeks), the neonatal mortality rate was highest for babies born at 26 weeks (27/35, 77.1%) and lowest for babies born at 36 weeks (2/93, 2.2%). In the analysis population, neonatal death was 20.4% (275/1351) in the dexamethasone arm and 23.8% (317/1331) in the placebo arm, while severe respiratory distress within 168 h was 9.7% (114/1171) and 11.6% (134/1152), respectively.\n\n【45】Table 2 presents relative risks for the newborn outcomes for categories of administration-to-birth interval. While these have not accounted for gestational age at the time of first dose, there is an overall pattern of reduction in the point estimate of the relative risk of each outcome as the administration-to-birth interval increases. Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S1 a present the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of neonatal death in preterm babies exposed to dexamethasone compared to placebo, by administration-to-birth intervals as a continuous variable (from 0 through 28 days) for different gestational ages at first dose (from 26 weeks 0 days through 33 weeks 0 days). Across all gestational ages at first dose, the point estimates for the relative risks were consistently reduced with increasing time from administration-to-birth until days 13 and 14 (i.e. nadir of the curves where the greatest risk reductions were observed), but gradually diminished thereafter and with reversed effects as it approached an administration-to-birth interval of day 28 days. Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S1 b shows the relative risks for neonatal death by administration-to-birth interval for the first 24 h. For all gestational ages at first dose, the relative risks were not indicative of any clinical benefit or suggestive of harm throughout the 24 h following administration.\n\n【46】Table 2 Relative risks and 95% CI of neonatal outcomes comparing dexamethasone with placebo administration, per administration-to-birth interval.\n\n| Administration-to-birth interval | Neonatal death (to 28 days) | Stillbirth or neonatal death (any baby death) | Severe respiratory distress at 24 h | Severe respiratory distress at 168 h |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0–6 h | 1.08 (0.83–1.41) | 1.11 (0.87–1.41) | 0.98 (0.39–2.49) | 1.10 (0.70–1.73) |\n| \\>6–12 h | 0.89 (0.63–1.28) | 1.00 (0.72–1.40) | 0.59 (0.15–2.28) | 1.08 (0.61–1.92) |\n| \\>12–24 h | 1.02 (0.67–1.56) | 1.03 (0.72–1.48) | 0.92 (0.34–2.47) | 0.90 (0.45–1.79) |\n| \\>24 h–1 week | 0.77 (0.60–0.98) | 0.83 (0.68–1.00) | 0.40 (0.20–0.81) | 0.66 (0.44–0.98) |\n| \\>1 week | 0.65 (0.39–1.08) | 0.67 (0.47–0.94) | 0.39 (0.10–1.46) | 0.81 (0.36–1.83) |\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 2 **Relative risks of neonatal mortality in preterm infants exposed to dexamethasone compared to placebo, by administration-to-birth intervals (from 0 through 28 days),** **at different gestational ages of first administration.**</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【48】Supplementary Table S1 c–e show the relative risks by administration-to-birth interval for other outcomes of interest.

For these two scenarios, the modest difference in the risks of neonatal death for the infants born 48 h (2 days) and 14 days from first treatment dose (0.86 versus 0.72, respectively) is attributable to increasing fetal maturity due to increasing gestational age. Panels 3C and 3D show the risks of neonatal death for similar women, but who were treated with antenatal dexamethasone. The difference in neonatal death risks between 48 h (2 days) and 14 days (0.80 versus 0.40, respectively) is more substantial, and attributable to the effects of dexamethasone in addition to increasing fetal maturity as a result of increasing gestational age.\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 3 **Profiler plots of risks of neonatal mortality for infants exposed to antenatal dexamethasone and infants exposed placebo at 26 weeks 0 days gestational age at first administration.** (A) Risk of neonatal death, indicated as P(Neonatal death) with no dexamethasone treatment (i.e. placebo) initiated at 26 weeks 0 days gestation and birth occurring 48 h later, from a multivariate logistic model.

Compared to infants exposed to placebo, we found that neonatal mortality risk further reduced with increasing administration-to-birth interval for infants exposed to a single course of dexamethasone between 26 weeks 0 days and 33 weeks 6 days. While gestational age is a well-known critical mediator of preterm newborn outcomes, the observed relationship was independent of the effects of natural fetal maturation alone. Peak mortality reduction was observed by days 13 and 14, and then diminishing as the interval approached 28 days, irrespective of the gestational age at the time of first treatment dose. The impact of dexamethasone on neonatal mortality reduction during the first 24 h following initiation of treatment is uncertain, although the overall trend is in favour of risk reduction as the interval increases. The observation for clinically assessed severe respiratory distress outcomes is less marked, although the overall pattern of risk reduction as the interval extends into the second week is consistent with that of neonatal death.\n\n【52】While these findings of a strong relationship between dexamethasone administration-to-birth interval and newborn survival is conceptually consistent with previous studies in terms of a beneficial window, it also challenges the generally held view of 24 h to 7 days as the “optimal interval”, and what has been otherwise described as sub-optimal or potentially harmful intervals. Our study suggests that the beneficial window may start sooner than the 24 h threshold and extends through to the end of second week following administration, even in the absence of a second course of ACS treatment.\n\n【53】We conducted a systematic review of randomised and non-randomised studies on the association between different antenatal corticosteroid administration-to-birth intervals and maternal and newborn outcomes (14). The review identified 59 studies (11 trials and 48 observational studies), 39 of which were conducted in high-income country settings. One of the 11 trials was the WHO ACTION-I trial primary analysis, and none of the other 10 trials evaluated ACS administration-to-birth interval as a continuous measure, nor adjusted for the confounding effect of gestational age at time of administration. Findings in the current analysis have not been reported previously in efficacy trials. Three trials reported on neonatal mortality for different categories of ACS administration-to-birth interval - all three were small (ranging from 73 to 208 newborns) and reported no differences in neonatal death across intervals (15–17). Seven trials (with 80–315 newborns) reported that odds of RDS were not different for any ACS administration-to-birth interval (15, 17–22). However, one trial (696 newborns) found reduced odds of RDS at 1–7 days and >7 days with ACS compared to no ACS treatment (23). One other trial (73 newborns) found reduced odds of RDS at ≥8 days compared to no ACS treatment (24).\n\n【54】Large observational studies from Canada and Australia, as well as multi-country studies from other high-resource settings, have explored the relationship between the ACS administration-to-birth interval and newborn outcomes. Comparing findings across these studies is challenging given the differences in enrolled populations, variations in the categories of time intervals used, and use of different ACS regimens. Melamed et al. analysed ACS effectiveness in a Canadian retrospective cohort of 6870 infants born at 24 to <34 weeks, and reported that ACS (usually betamethasone or possibly dexamethasone) had maximum benefit at 1–7 days, while at <24 h or >7 days the odds of neonatal mortality and morbidity were relatively poorer. Conversely, Norman et al. analysed 4594 singletons born at 24–31 weeks across multiple European countries - 78.9% of obstetric units were using betamethasone, 4.9% used dexamethasone and 15.4% used either. They observed significant declines in neonatal mortality at <24 h associated with ACS use. While the greatest reductions in neonatal mortality, severe neonatal morbidity and severe neonatal brain injury were between 24 h and 7 days, the mortality benefits appeared to persist beyond 3 weeks after administration. It is important to note that while these studies suggested that 24 h to 7 days had maximal benefits compared to shorter and longer intervals, they also confirmed that any category of ACS administration-to-birth interval was better than no ACS treatment. The interpretation, therefore, is that the 24 h and 7 days thresholds are arbitrary and not necessarily inflection points outside which ACS is not beneficial or associated with harms. The initial exploration of relative risks of newborn outcomes by categories 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> shows that infants born from >24 h to 1 week after treatment was the only category with point estimates and 95% confidence intervals suggestive of significant benefits for all specified outcomes. This could have led to a similarly erroneous conclusion of benefit being confined to this interval, if subjected to the same type of analysis as previous studies.\n\n【55】The strengths of this study include the use of data from a multi-country, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, in which the administration-to-birth interval was prospectively reported with high precision, and newborn health outcomes were measured robustly and systematically, and there were high event rates for newborn primary outcomes. This secondary analysis included 92% of women and 95% of babies who participated in the original trial. This secondary analysis was anticipated during the design phase of the trial and thus allowed for a proactive collection of accurate data on time of treatment and time of birth. Multiple analytical approaches were used to explore associations between administration-to-birth interval and newborn outcomes. The robustness of the data set for neonatal mortality outcome allowed for construction of a tool that could potentially be applied in the clinical context of the countries where WHO ACTION-I trial was conducted. Nonetheless, we acknowledge several limitations, including that this was a secondary analysis restricted to trial participants who received a single course of dexamethasone or placebo. The analysis relied on a post-randomisation exposure variable (i.e. time from dexamethasone administration to birth) and is therefore prone to confounders which were not systematically captured. The relationships between fetal maturation, time and dexamethasone are complex, and residual confounding, or other unknown factors, may be playing a role. We have a limitation in drawing reliable inferences for the two clinically assessed severe respiratory distress outcomes, as the risk and relative risk estimates for these outcomes have low precision. This might be in part explained by the lower prevalence recorded for these secondary outcomes in the trial population, probably as a result of some degree of under-recognition of newborn respiratory complications based on clinical assessments alone (3). This is in contrast to the prevalence of neonatal mortality, which was the primary outcome upon which the trial sample size estimation was based. There were also fewer observations with longer administration-to-birth intervals, leading to greater uncertainty (wider confidence intervals). A number of other factors related to the analysis population might affect generalizability of these findings, such as the enrolment of women at risk of imminent preterm birth from 26 weeks 0 days–33 weeks 6 days only; that two-thirds of women had a gestational age estimate based on third trimester ultrasound; and that the ACS regimen was IM dexamethasone phosphate. Further validation of these findings in other, high-quality datasets would be useful.\n\n【56】Our study confirms that the window of benefit in terms of neonatal mortality reduction following dexamethasone administration is time bound, but the inflection point and subsequent diminution do not occur until about two weeks following the initiation of treatment. In view of the challenges of accurately predicting the timing of spontaneous preterm birth, this longer optimal administration-to-birth interval provides reassurance regarding the benefits of ACS in situations where anticipated birth occurs after the conventional 7 days’ window. As the mortality risk among infants who were exposed to a single course of dexamethasone is lower for the larger part of 28 days following treatment, administration of a repeat (or “rescue”) course during this period to optimise the administration-to-birth interval might be unnecessary. However, this warrants further investigation, as trials of repeat ACS regimens have thus far used betamethasone only (27).\n\n【57】From a clinical standpoint, clinicians may consider prolonging the time of birth with tocolytics where it is deemed clinically safe, not just for ensuring that all prescribed doses of ACS are administered, but also to optimise the administration-to-birth interval, while continually weighing the balance of benefits of increasing interval against risk of fetal exposure to an adverse intrauterine environment. The tool developed from WHO ACTION-I data could be applied in hospitals in low-resource countries with similar characteristics as in the trial to estimate risks of dexamethasone treatment versus no treatment, in situations where the administration-to-birth interval can be pre-determined with a high degree of certainty, such as in provider-initiated preterm birth. The tool could also be used for support clinical assessment and estimation of the risks of adverse preterm newborn outcomes at the time of birth when all variables, including the administration-to-birth interval, are known.\n\n【58】Our findings call for a review of the 2015 WHO recommendation that suggests that antenatal corticosteroid should only be applied when preterm birth is considered “imminent” within 7 days of starting treatment, which was based on subgroup analysis that is no longer supported in the current updates of Cochrane review underpinning the recommendation. Although the current study does not refute the suggestion that there may be benefit when ACS is administered in situations where birth is anticipated within 24 h, such practice should be the exception rather than the norm, as it is clear from these findings that a minimum number of days following ACS administration is required to maximise benefits and avoid harms.\n\n【59】Further investigation is required on the overarching question of what administration-to-birth interval confers the best clinical outcomes for preterm newborns. We acknowledge that it is methodologically and ethically impossible to randomise women to different administration-to-birth intervals. Therefore, combining existing WHO ACTION-I trial data with similar high-quality data sets on administration-to-birth could be the starting point to strengthen available evidence. Any future studies on this question, including observational studies, should analyse prospectively documented administration-to-birth interval as a continuous measure, and avoid arbitrary cut-offs that tend to hide the nuances in the risks of adverse outcomes within administration-to-birth interval categories. Future research could also benefit from individual patient data meta-analysis to produce more generalisable information and understand whether the observed patterns differ by population subgroups of women at risk of preterm birth. The application of machine learning to large observational and randomised trial data sets to improve prediction of the timing of preterm birth, and individualise risk estimation by time of administration-to-birth interval is long overdue.\n\n【60】In conclusion, this secondary analysis of a multi-country randomised trial indicates that the neonatal mortality reduction benefits from antenatal dexamethasone for women at risk of preterm birth prior to 34 weeks’ gestation may be substantially higher with longer administration-to-birth intervals than previously thought. Risk reduction for important neonatal outcomes tend to continue to increase into the latter part of second week from the start of dexamethasone administration, regardless of gestational age at time of administration.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【61】The concept for this secondary analysis was conceived by O.T.O. and J.P.V. which was developed with G.P.

In this secondary analysis, 2638 women and their newborns treated with single course of dexamethasone or placebo were analysed. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the effect of dexamethasone versus placebo on neonatal death, stillbirth or neonatal death, and severe respiratory distress at 24 h and at 168 h, by administration-to-birth interval (from 0 through 28 days), adjusting for gestational age at first dose.

Neonatal mortality risk was lower with increasing time between initiating dexamethasone and birth, achieving peak mortality reduction by days 13 and 14 and then diminishing as the interval approached 28 days, regardless of gestational age at administration.

The 2020 update of the Cochrane review on efficacy of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) demonstrated that a single course of dexamethasone or betamethasone prior to 34 weeks’ gestation confers significant reductions in neonatal mortality, and severe morbidities, without causing maternal or newborn harms. While previous trials on the efficacy of ACS were largely conducted in high-income countries, the recently published WHO ACTION ( **A** ntenatal **C** orticos **T** eroids for **I** mproving **O** utcomes in preterm **N** ewborn)-I trial, which was conducted in hospitals across five low-resource countries, provide reassurance on the clinical benefits of ACS when used for women at risk of early preterm birth. The trial reported a substantial reduction in the risks of neonatal mortality alone and stillbirth or neonatal mortality, without increasing the risk of maternal or neonatal infection, and thus laid to rest the controversies surrounding the safety and efficacy of ACS in low-resource countries.\n\n【19】Now that the benefits of ACS administration in low-resource countries have been established, there is a need to determine how these benefits can be optimised in clinical practice. One important consideration is the potential relationship between the time interval from administration of ACS to birth and how the interval might affect the neonatal benefits of ACS. In contemporary obstetric practice, it is generally accepted that there is a minimum and a maximum time of in-utero “fetal exposure” to ACS to achieve clinical benefits and avoid harms. While this notion is reasonable from a scientific standpoint (particularly based on findings from animal studies), what constitutes the best (or optimal) time interval to maximise clinical benefits of ACS remains unclear. Several organisations, including WHO, recommend that administration of ACS should target eligible women with a high likelihood of preterm birth within 7 days of starting treatment, but the quality of the underlying evidence is low. Although the timing of provider-initiated preterm birth via labour induction or caesarean section can be reasonably anticipated, accurate prediction of the timing of spontaneously-initiated preterm birth even among those at highest risk is clinically difficult. Hence, adherence to current ACS recommendations regarding administration-to-birth interval remains practically challenging.\n\n【20】Previous studies exploring the association between time from ACS administration-to-birth and newborn health outcomes have generally been inconsistent in their findings. For example, a study in Canada by Melamed et al. reported that maximum benefits were observed when ACS was administered 1–7 days prior to birth. In contrast, an observational study by Norman et al. across several European countries reported that ACS were associated with a rapid decline in infant mortality even over a short period (less than 12 h) between administration and birth. Though the greatest reductions were observed at an interval between 18 and 36 h, the mortality benefits appeared to persist beyond 3 weeks. Other studies from high-income countries have also reported that benefits of ACS are time-related, though the intervals associated with improved outcomes are not consistent across studies. It is unclear whether these variations were the results of heterogeneity in clinical practice protocols, characteristics of the study populations, outcome measures, or inherent biases in the study designs. Many studies had pre-defined an interval between 24 h and 7 days as the “optimal interval” without analysing and reporting the time points associated with greatest risk reductions for specified adverse outcomes, or accounting for important confounders such as gestational age at the time of ACS administration. To address these shortcomings and provide data from low-resource country contexts, we conducted a secondary analysis of the WHO ACTION-I trial to evaluate the effect of dexamethasone compared to placebo on neonatal mortality and severe respiratory morbidity outcomes, by the administration-to-birth interval, in order to identify the interval with the greatest clinical benefits (i.e. an optimal interval).\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Study design and participants\n\n【23】The design of the WHO ACTION-I trial has been described previously in the study protocol and primary findings. In brief, WHO ACTION-I trial was a multi-country, multi-centre, individually-randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial was conducted in 29 secondary and tertiary level hospitals across Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. The trial protocol was approved by ethics committees and regulatory agencies for each country and participating hospital and the WHO Ethics Review Committee and registered prior to commencement (Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number ACTRN12617000476336; Clinical Trials Registry-India number, CTRI/2017/04/008326). The trial was conducted and reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. All participants were randomized between December 2017 and November 2019, and the trial was stopped early due to evidence of benefit. \n\n【24】Women with a viable singleton or multiple pregnancy who presented to participating hospitals at a gestational age of 26 weeks 0 days–33 weeks 6 days and who were identified as being at risk of imminent preterm birth were eligible for inclusion and invited to participate. Imminent preterm birth was defined as planned or expected birth in the next 48 h (either provider-initiated or after preterm prelabour rupture of membranes or spontaneous labour). To be eligible, a woman's gestational age had to be informed by an obstetric ultrasound. Women were not eligible if they had clinical signs of severe infection, suspicion, or evidence of clinical chorioamnionitis, major congenital fetal anomalies, concurrent or recent use of systemic steroids, were participating in another maternal or newborn health trial, or had a contraindication to steroid use. Women were screened at the time of presentation to hospital, and randomised women and their babies were followed up until day 28 after birth, at the hospital or at home. Written informed consent was obtained from every woman prior to randomisation.\n\n【25】For this secondary analysis, we included randomised women (and their newborns) who received a single course of dexamethasone or placebo, had complete data for trial primary outcomes, and who had complete data on time of dexamethasone or placebo administration and time of birth. Women who received a repeat course (and their newborns) were excluded. Hence, the population for this analysis comprised 92.5% of women and 90.2% of babies who participated in the WHO ACTION-I trial.\n\n【26】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【27】In the ACTION-I Trial, site-stratified individual randomization (1:1 ratio) with balanced permuted blocks of 10 were used. Eligible, consenting women were randomly assigned to a course of IM injections of either 6 mg dexamethasone or identical placebo (normal saline) administered every 12 h, to a maximum of four doses, or until hospital discharge or birth, whichever was earlier. Women were eligible for a repeat course if they had not given birth after 7 completed days but still met the eligibility criteria (the repeat course was the same as the initial allocation).\n\n【28】### Outcomes\n\n【29】The ACTION-I trial primary outcomes were neonatal death until 28 completed days of life; stillbirth or neonatal death (any baby death); and a composite outcome for possible maternal bacterial infection (defined as maternal fever or clinically suspected or confirmed infection, for which therapeutic antibiotics were used). Secondary outcomes included maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity outcomes, and process of care outcomes.\n\n【30】For this secondary analysis, the outcomes of interest were neonatal death, stillbirth or neonatal death (i.e. any baby death), severe neonatal respiratory distress within 24 h, and severe neonatal respiratory distress within the first week of birth (168 h). In the ACTION-I trial, severe neonatal respiratory distress was clinically defined based on the composite of fast breathing (respiratory rate ≥70 breaths per minute); and at least one of marked nasal flaring during inspiration, expiratory grunting audible with naked ear, or severe chest in-drawing; and SpO2 less than 90% or use of supplemental oxygen.\n\n【31】### Statistical analysis\n\n【32】The exposure variables of interest for this analysis were the allocated treatments (dexamethasone and placebo). We aimed to assess how selected newborn outcomes varied by administration-to-birth interval, which was defined as the time from administration of the first dose of dexamethasone or placebo until birth. This interval was considered using both categorical and continuous variable approaches. For each outcome, we explored the administration-to-birth time interval which was associated with the greatest benefit of dexamethasone compared to placebo.\n\n【33】We used two different statistical approaches. First, we conducted subgroup analyses stratifying the study population by pre-defined categories of administration-to-birth intervals, and calculated the relative risks of dexamethasone compared to placebo for each newborn outcome and for each interval category. This approach had two important limitations: firstly, the categories of administration-to-birth intervals were pre-defined based on clinical practice considerations and boundaries that were set from previous research. As a result of these limitations, interactions with intervals other than those categories defined _a priori_ might be concealed, and it does not take full advantage of having continuous data for the administration-to-birth interval. It also does not take into account the impact of gestational age (which naturally increases with increasing administration-to-birth interval) on newborn health outcomes – it was evident from this analysis as the relative risks varied considerably depending on the gestational age at time of first dose.\n\n【34】To address these issues, we used a second statistical approach. We created a prediction model based on women receiving dexamethasone or placebo for each of the newborn outcomes of interest, taking into account the administration-to-birth interval as continuous variable, as well as gestational age at first administration. Then, from the predicted risks for the dexamethasone and placebo arms, we estimated the relative risks (RRs) for each outcome by gestational age at first dose to identify the interval with the greatest benefit. We used multivariate logistic regression to create the prediction models for each outcome. First, we fitted a full quadratic polynomial model for each trial arm on time from administration-to-birth and gestational age at first dose (i.e. the model included the linear and quadratic terms for each of these continuous variables and the cross product of the two), plus covariates. The following covariates were ultimately included in the model: gestational age at first dose, whether the preterm birth was spontaneously- or provider-initiated, mode of birth, maternal age, singleton or multiple birth, nulliparity, history of preterm birth, having at least one obstetrical condition present, and whether tocolytics and magnesium sulfate for fetal neuroprotection had been administered. These covariates were all measured at baseline, except for mode of birth.\n\n【35】We used the Lasso strategy for selecting variables and assessed the goodness of fit of several candidate models, using the difference between the log-likelihood of the saturated model and that of the fitted model. For each outcome a reduced model was obtained, keeping only terms that were significant at 10% 删除2:<u>(See Supplementary File S1 for statistical methods on model development)</u>. We assessed whether the added covariates altered the findings on which time interval had the greatest benefits of dexamethasone compared to placebo, with respect to the neonatal outcomes. We also assessed models using either gestational age at first dose or gestational age at birth - the fits and estimated risks were identical. This is due to the linear relationship between these two measures (i.e. gestational age at birth is the sum of gestational age at first dose and the time from first dose to birth).\n\n【36】Using the reduced model, we estimated for each gestational age at first dose the effects of dexamethasone by different administration-to-birth intervals in days up to 28 days from the start of treatment, in order to identify the time interval with the greatest benefits of dexamethasone compared to placebo. Effects of dexamethasone were expressed as relative risks (risks of outcome for infants exposed to dexamethasone compared with those exposed to placebo, with their 95% confidence intervals). To estimate the relative risks with their 95% confidence intervals, we used the Poisson distribution with the log link in the logistic model and then estimated linear combinations corresponding to the relative risks for different values of gestational age at first dose and administration-to-birth intervals. The same analysis was conducted with administration-to-birth intervals in hours up to 24 h from the start of treatment to further elucidate the relative risks of neonatal death at shorter intervals. For each gestational age at first dose, we plotted the relative risks by administration-to-birth intervals, and identified the optimal interval as the time points where greatest impact of dexamethasone (in terms of risk reduction compared to placebo) were observed.\n\n【37】To aid interpretation and develop a tool for potential clinical application of these findings in our study context, we used profiler software (JMP Statistical Discovery Software, version 16.0删除2-1:<u>, Supplementary File S2 </u>) to generate and visualize the predicted risk of an outcome for any combination of the independent variables. The profiler shows the estimated risk and its confidence intervals for particular combinations of gestational age at first dose, administration-to-birth interval, and treatment with dexamethasone or no treatment (i.e. placebo).\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【38】The funders of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

For women receiving dexamethasone, 20.1% (294/1464) had an administration-to-birth interval of ≤6 h, 36.1% (529/1464) had an interval of 24 h–168 h (1 week), and 27.0% (395/1464) had an interval greater than 1 week. When considered as a continuous variable, the distribution of this interval for dexamethasone and placebo arms was very similar, though the placebo group had a slightly shorter administration-to-birth time. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows the number of births and neonatal deaths for each week of gestational age at birth - the highest number of births occurred at 33 weeks (571 babies). Across the preterm period (<37 weeks), the neonatal mortality rate was highest for babies born at 26 weeks (27/35, 77.1%) and lowest for babies born at 36 weeks (2/93, 2.2%). In the analysis population, neonatal death was 20.4% (275/1351) in the dexamethasone arm and 23.8% (317/1331) in the placebo arm, while severe respiratory distress within 168 h was 9.7% (114/1171) and 11.6% (134/1152), respectively.\n\n【45】Table 2 presents relative risks for the newborn outcomes for categories of administration-to-birth interval. While these have not accounted for gestational age at the time of first dose, there is an overall pattern of reduction in the point estimate of the relative risk of each outcome as the administration-to-birth interval increases. Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S1 a present the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of neonatal death in preterm babies exposed to dexamethasone compared to placebo, by administration-to-birth intervals as a continuous variable (from 0 through 28 days) for different gestational ages at first dose (from 26 weeks 0 days through 33 weeks 0 days). Across all gestational ages at first dose, the point estimates for the relative risks were consistently reduced with increasing time from administration-to-birth until days 13 and 14 (i.e. nadir of the curves where the greatest risk reductions were observed), but gradually diminished thereafter and with reversed effects as it approached an administration-to-birth interval of day 28 days. Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S1 b shows the relative risks for neonatal death by administration-to-birth interval for the first 24 h. For all gestational ages at first dose, the relative risks were not indicative of any clinical benefit or suggestive of harm throughout the 24 h following administration.\n\n【46】Table 2 Relative risks and 95% CI of neonatal outcomes comparing dexamethasone with placebo administration, per administration-to-birth interval.\n\n| Administration-to-birth interval | Neonatal death (to 28 days) | Stillbirth or neonatal death (any baby death) | Severe respiratory distress at 24 h | Severe respiratory distress at 168 h |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 0–6 h | 1.08 (0.83–1.41) | 1.11 (0.87–1.41) | 0.98 (0.39–2.49) | 1.10 (0.70–1.73) |\n| \\>6–12 h | 0.89 (0.63–1.28) | 1.00 (0.72–1.40) | 0.59 (0.15–2.28) | 1.08 (0.61–1.92) |\n| \\>12–24 h | 1.02 (0.67–1.56) | 1.03 (0.72–1.48) | 0.92 (0.34–2.47) | 0.90 (0.45–1.79) |\n| \\>24 h–1 week | 0.77 (0.60–0.98) | 0.83 (0.68–1.00) | 0.40 (0.20–0.81) | 0.66 (0.44–0.98) |\n| \\>1 week | 0.65 (0.39–1.08) | 0.67 (0.47–0.94) | 0.39 (0.10–1.46) | 0.81 (0.36–1.83) |\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 2 **Relative risks of neonatal mortality in preterm infants exposed to dexamethasone compared to placebo, by administration-to-birth intervals (from 0 through 28 days),** **at different gestational ages of first administration.**</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【48】Supplementary Table S1 c–e show the relative risks by administration-to-birth interval for other outcomes of interest.

For these two scenarios, the modest difference in the risks of neonatal death for the infants born 48 h (2 days) and 14 days from first treatment dose (0.86 versus 0.72, respectively) is attributable to increasing fetal maturity due to increasing gestational age. Panels 3C and 3D show the risks of neonatal death for similar women, but who were treated with antenatal dexamethasone. The difference in neonatal death risks between 48 h (2 days) and 14 days (0.80 versus 0.40, respectively) is more substantial, and attributable to the effects of dexamethasone in addition to increasing fetal maturity as a result of increasing gestational age.\n删除4:<u>\nFig. 3 **Profiler plots of risks of neonatal mortality for infants exposed to antenatal dexamethasone and infants exposed placebo at 26 weeks 0 days gestational age at first administration.** (A) Risk of neonatal death, indicated as P(Neonatal death) with no dexamethasone treatment (i.e. placebo) initiated at 26 weeks 0 days gestation and birth occurring 48 h later, from a multivariate logistic model.

Compared to infants exposed to placebo, we found that neonatal mortality risk further reduced with increasing administration-to-birth interval for infants exposed to a single course of dexamethasone between 26 weeks 0 days and 33 weeks 6 days. While gestational age is a well-known critical mediator of preterm newborn outcomes, the observed relationship was independent of the effects of natural fetal maturation alone. Peak mortality reduction was observed by days 13 and 14, and then diminishing as the interval approached 28 days, irrespective of the gestational age at the time of first treatment dose. The impact of dexamethasone on neonatal mortality reduction during the first 24 h following initiation of treatment is uncertain, although the overall trend is in favour of risk reduction as the interval increases. The observation for clinically assessed severe respiratory distress outcomes is less marked, although the overall pattern of risk reduction as the interval extends into the second week is consistent with that of neonatal death.\n\n【52】While these findings of a strong relationship between dexamethasone administration-to-birth interval and newborn survival is conceptually consistent with previous studies in terms of a beneficial window, it also challenges the generally held view of 24 h to 7 days as the “optimal interval”, and what has been otherwise described as sub-optimal or potentially harmful intervals. Our study suggests that the beneficial window may start sooner than the 24 h threshold and extends through to the end of second week following administration, even in the absence of a second course of ACS treatment.\n\n【53】We conducted a systematic review of randomised and non-randomised studies on the association between different antenatal corticosteroid administration-to-birth intervals and maternal and newborn outcomes (14). The review identified 59 studies (11 trials and 48 observational studies), 39 of which were conducted in high-income country settings. One of the 11 trials was the WHO ACTION-I trial primary analysis, and none of the other 10 trials evaluated ACS administration-to-birth interval as a continuous measure, nor adjusted for the confounding effect of gestational age at time of administration. Findings in the current analysis have not been reported previously in efficacy trials. Three trials reported on neonatal mortality for different categories of ACS administration-to-birth interval - all three were small (ranging from 73 to 208 newborns) and reported no differences in neonatal death across intervals (15–17). Seven trials (with 80–315 newborns) reported that odds of RDS were not different for any ACS administration-to-birth interval (15, 17–22). However, one trial (696 newborns) found reduced odds of RDS at 1–7 days and >7 days with ACS compared to no ACS treatment (23). One other trial (73 newborns) found reduced odds of RDS at ≥8 days compared to no ACS treatment (24).\n\n【54】Large observational studies from Canada and Australia, as well as multi-country studies from other high-resource settings, have explored the relationship between the ACS administration-to-birth interval and newborn outcomes. Comparing findings across these studies is challenging given the differences in enrolled populations, variations in the categories of time intervals used, and use of different ACS regimens. Melamed et al. analysed ACS effectiveness in a Canadian retrospective cohort of 6870 infants born at 24 to <34 weeks, and reported that ACS (usually betamethasone or possibly dexamethasone) had maximum benefit at 1–7 days, while at <24 h or >7 days the odds of neonatal mortality and morbidity were relatively poorer. Conversely, Norman et al. analysed 4594 singletons born at 24–31 weeks across multiple European countries - 78.9% of obstetric units were using betamethasone, 4.9% used dexamethasone and 15.4% used either. They observed significant declines in neonatal mortality at <24 h associated with ACS use. While the greatest reductions in neonatal mortality, severe neonatal morbidity and severe neonatal brain injury were between 24 h and 7 days, the mortality benefits appeared to persist beyond 3 weeks after administration. It is important to note that while these studies suggested that 24 h to 7 days had maximal benefits compared to shorter and longer intervals, they also confirmed that any category of ACS administration-to-birth interval was better than no ACS treatment. The interpretation, therefore, is that the 24 h and 7 days thresholds are arbitrary and not necessarily inflection points outside which ACS is not beneficial or associated with harms. The initial exploration of relative risks of newborn outcomes by categories 删除2:<u>( Table 2 )</u> shows that infants born from >24 h to 1 week after treatment was the only category with point estimates and 95% confidence intervals suggestive of significant benefits for all specified outcomes. This could have led to a similarly erroneous conclusion of benefit being confined to this interval, if subjected to the same type of analysis as previous studies.\n\n【55】The strengths of this study include the use of data from a multi-country, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, in which the administration-to-birth interval was prospectively reported with high precision, and newborn health outcomes were measured robustly and systematically, and there were high event rates for newborn primary outcomes. This secondary analysis included 92% of women and 95% of babies who participated in the original trial. This secondary analysis was anticipated during the design phase of the trial and thus allowed for a proactive collection of accurate data on time of treatment and time of birth. Multiple analytical approaches were used to explore associations between administration-to-birth interval and newborn outcomes. The robustness of the data set for neonatal mortality outcome allowed for construction of a tool that could potentially be applied in the clinical context of the countries where WHO ACTION-I trial was conducted. Nonetheless, we acknowledge several limitations, including that this was a secondary analysis restricted to trial participants who received a single course of dexamethasone or placebo. The analysis relied on a post-randomisation exposure variable (i.e. time from dexamethasone administration to birth) and is therefore prone to confounders which were not systematically captured. The relationships between fetal maturation, time and dexamethasone are complex, and residual confounding, or other unknown factors, may be playing a role. We have a limitation in drawing reliable inferences for the two clinically assessed severe respiratory distress outcomes, as the risk and relative risk estimates for these outcomes have low precision. This might be in part explained by the lower prevalence recorded for these secondary outcomes in the trial population, probably as a result of some degree of under-recognition of newborn respiratory complications based on clinical assessments alone (3). This is in contrast to the prevalence of neonatal mortality, which was the primary outcome upon which the trial sample size estimation was based. There were also fewer observations with longer administration-to-birth intervals, leading to greater uncertainty (wider confidence intervals). A number of other factors related to the analysis population might affect generalizability of these findings, such as the enrolment of women at risk of imminent preterm birth from 26 weeks 0 days–33 weeks 6 days only; that two-thirds of women had a gestational age estimate based on third trimester ultrasound; and that the ACS regimen was IM dexamethasone phosphate. Further validation of these findings in other, high-quality datasets would be useful.\n\n【56】Our study confirms that the window of benefit in terms of neonatal mortality reduction following dexamethasone administration is time bound, but the inflection point and subsequent diminution do not occur until about two weeks following the initiation of treatment. In view of the challenges of accurately predicting the timing of spontaneous preterm birth, this longer optimal administration-to-birth interval provides reassurance regarding the benefits of ACS in situations where anticipated birth occurs after the conventional 7 days’ window. As the mortality risk among infants who were exposed to a single course of dexamethasone is lower for the larger part of 28 days following treatment, administration of a repeat (or “rescue”) course during this period to optimise the administration-to-birth interval might be unnecessary. However, this warrants further investigation, as trials of repeat ACS regimens have thus far used betamethasone only (27).\n\n【57】From a clinical standpoint, clinicians may consider prolonging the time of birth with tocolytics where it is deemed clinically safe, not just for ensuring that all prescribed doses of ACS are administered, but also to optimise the administration-to-birth interval, while continually weighing the balance of benefits of increasing interval against risk of fetal exposure to an adverse intrauterine environment. The tool developed from WHO ACTION-I data could be applied in hospitals in low-resource countries with similar characteristics as in the trial to estimate risks of dexamethasone treatment versus no treatment, in situations where the administration-to-birth interval can be pre-determined with a high degree of certainty, such as in provider-initiated preterm birth. The tool could also be used for support clinical assessment and estimation of the risks of adverse preterm newborn outcomes at the time of birth when all variables, including the administration-to-birth interval, are known.\n\n【58】Our findings call for a review of the 2015 WHO recommendation that suggests that antenatal corticosteroid should only be applied when preterm birth is considered “imminent” within 7 days of starting treatment, which was based on subgroup analysis that is no longer supported in the current updates of Cochrane review underpinning the recommendation. Although the current study does not refute the suggestion that there may be benefit when ACS is administered in situations where birth is anticipated within 24 h, such practice should be the exception rather than the norm, as it is clear from these findings that a minimum number of days following ACS administration is required to maximise benefits and avoid harms.\n\n【59】Further investigation is required on the overarching question of what administration-to-birth interval confers the best clinical outcomes for preterm newborns. We acknowledge that it is methodologically and ethically impossible to randomise women to different administration-to-birth intervals. Therefore, combining existing WHO ACTION-I trial data with similar high-quality data sets on administration-to-birth could be the starting point to strengthen available evidence. Any future studies on this question, including observational studies, should analyse prospectively documented administration-to-birth interval as a continuous measure, and avoid arbitrary cut-offs that tend to hide the nuances in the risks of adverse outcomes within administration-to-birth interval categories. Future research could also benefit from individual patient data meta-analysis to produce more generalisable information and understand whether the observed patterns differ by population subgroups of women at risk of preterm birth. The application of machine learning to large observational and randomised trial data sets to improve prediction of the timing of preterm birth, and individualise risk estimation by time of administration-to-birth interval is long overdue.\n\n【60】In conclusion, this secondary analysis of a multi-country randomised trial indicates that the neonatal mortality reduction benefits from antenatal dexamethasone for women at risk of preterm birth prior to 34 weeks’ gestation may be substantially higher with longer administration-to-birth intervals than previously thought. Risk reduction for important neonatal outcomes tend to continue to increase into the latter part of second week from the start of dexamethasone administration, regardless of gestational age at time of administration.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【61】The concept for this secondary analysis was conceived by O.T.O. and J.P.V. which was developed with G.P.

Whereas its first conference held in April, 2012, focused specifically on overtreatment, the emphasis this time was on understanding the drivers and consequences of overuse, underuse, and misuse of health care. The ultimate goal is to achieve a just, effective, affordable, and above all humane health-care system that puts patients and people at its centre. Such a movement and campaign, led by US physicians, health-care workers, civil society, and religious leaders is inspiring and timely, especially because the USA has the world's most expensive health-care system with relatively poor outcomes. Where markets lead, care is often influenced by monetary considerations with unnecessary medical tests and ineffective treatments that might even cause harm to patients. Other countries, the UK included, should take note.\n\n【1】At the conference, Bernard Lown himself, who is Chairman Emeritus of the Lown Institute and won the Nobel Peace prize for International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War in 1985, gave an impressive passionate and thoughtful speech. He argued strongly that we should restore humanism into medicine and regain the lost art of listening to, and having compassion with, patients. Currently, we have a hospital-centred sickness system driven by financial incentives—this is a broken system. The money saved by curbing overtreatment should be invested into preventive medicine and palliative care. Medicine should be a calling not a business—the selection and education of medical students needs to reflect this.\n\n【2】With finite resources, changing demographics, and an increasing burden of non-communicable diseases, a new patient-centred strategy with integration of prevention and care and with a stronger role of community-based care is universally critical. In a forthcoming Series, _The Lancet,_ in partnership with the Lown Institute, will examine the extent and consequences of unnecessary care. In the meantime, those who agree should sign the Lown Institute's declaration of principles for right care to start nothing short of a health-care revolution.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2013 Ira Wyman/Sygma/Corbis</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【3】### Publication history\n\n【4】Published: 14 December 2013\n\n【5】### Identification\n\n【6】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62644-6</u>\n\n【7】### Copyright\n\n【8】© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

About 3·8 million deaths occur every year in babies younger than 28 days—of which 99% are in the developing world—and deaths in the first month of life account for 42% of deaths in children younger than 5 years. Before 2000, few organisations paid much attention to neonatal mortality. Since that year, several organisations have come to address the problem, including foundations, UN agencies, bilateral development agencies, governments of low-income countries, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This wave of attention is surprising: there was no sudden increase in the number of babies dying or swift spread of a virus that alarmed citizens of rich countries. The emergence of attention to newborn survival in a short period of time presents an interesting study in how global health issues attract priority. In this paper, I examine the processes and factors behind the emergence of attention. I also identify challenges that proponents of newborn survival could face in advancing priority. In doing so, I aim to contribute to inquiry concerning how and why some global health issues attract attention, and what this means for the sustainability of priority.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【1】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【2】Already registered?\n\n【3】Log in to existing account\n\n【4】Forgot password?\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Not yet registered?\n\n【8】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:39:50", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:40:28", "cost": 38.461}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:49", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:40:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:39:50"}

For example, in Lithuania the prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, defined as resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, has reached 23%. Moreover, theoretical modelling by Blower and Supervie raised the possibility for exponential progression of MDR tuberculosis to extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, defined as MDR tuberculosis plus resistance to a fluoroquinolone and an injectable aminoglycoside. That progression would discourage efforts to develop fluoroquinolones better suited for tuberculosis. We briefly consider tuberculosis surveillance status and then address potential problems with moxifoxacin as an antituberculosis agent.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【1】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【2】Already registered?\n\n【3】Log in to existing account\n\n【4】Forgot password?\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Not yet registered?\n\n【8】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:40:14", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:40:32", "cost": 17.617}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:49", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:40:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:40:14"}

Our objective was not to preferentially emphasise or detract from any particular aspect of tuberculosis control. Clearly, control of drug-resistant tuberculosis requires a multifaceted approach addressing socioeconomic factors, education, preventive strategies, early and rapid diagnosis, initiation of effective treatment, and social and sex-based issues, amongst others. Although all these are important, including the points raised by Helen Cox and colleagues, there is also the issue of appropriate care for patients discharged into the community who are therapeutically destitute (patients for whom there are no further therapeutic options because of very high grade resistance) within the context of the South African National TB Programme. We have previously raised our concerns regarding community-based transmission. In particular, we need a coordinated national strategy in South Africa that combines home-based care with long-term community stay facilities, and appropriate palliative care facilities. The reality is that such facilities are virtually non-existent in South Africa and there is an urgent need to provide such facilities until more effective drug regimens and interventions are available.\n\n【1】Although there are many priorities including protection of health-care workers, we believe an important area of emphasis should be strengthening of the national tuberculosis programme and trialling and introducing an effective regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. As Cox and colleagues point out, we do not have effective drugs to deal with the problem and thus introduction of newer drug regimens for tuberculosis, including drug-resistant tuberculosis, remain a major priority.\n\n【2】删除9:<u>I declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:34:02", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:34:14", "cost": 12.268}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:49", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:34:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:34:02"}

Ted Alcorn reports.\n\n【1】On March 10, nearly 32 years to the day since China's National Population and Family Planning Commission (NPFPC) was established to oversee the world's largest, longest-standing population control programme, the country's leaders announced plans to dissolve it into the Ministry of Health. 4 days later, the National People's Congress rubber-stamped the proposal and the commission ceased to exist, leaving the future of the country's fertility policy in doubt.\n\n【2】The NPFPC once held powerful influence, formulating and administering the so-called one-child policy that limits most Chinese families to a single child, and those in rural areas or those qualifying for other exceptions, to two. According to government calculations, the policy has prevented more than 400 million births, and while independent demographers dispute that measure, there is no doubt it has reshaped millions of lives. Last week, the UK's _Financial Times_ reported that in the past 40 years Chinese doctors have done 336 million abortions and 196 million sterilisations.\n\n【3】Many observers forecast a change in China's fertility policy this year following the country's once-in-a-decade leadership transition, but the disappearance of the commission caught some by surprise. “I think the significance of abolishing the family planning commission—even under the face of a merger—has not been fully appreciated”, says Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center in Beijing. “This is a very strong signal.”\n\n【4】Wang says that by closing the commission that promulgated the policy, the government has taken more decisive action than if it had altered the policy itself. He quoted a Chinese proverb: “They are taking the fuel from under the fire.”\n\n【5】Some say change is overdue. For years, economists and demographers have argued that by constraining the size of the next generation, the country's fertility policy has contributed to a grave demographic imbalance that will emerge in the coming decades as the country's elderly outstrip its labour force.\n\n【6】Public opinion, which always tilted against the policy, was further inflamed last June when a woman in the seventh month of pregnancy was forced to have an abortion, and her story was widely circulated by outraged Chinese internet users.\n\n【7】China's top leaders were quick to dial back speculation that the bureaucratic reforms presaged a relaxation of the fertility policy. “I don't see there is any necessary link between the two”, said Vice-Minister of Health Huang Jiefu. He emphasised that the merged ministry would be more efficient than its predecessors, integrating reproductive health services that had formerly been delivered in parallel by the health and family planning systems.\n\n【8】There are indications that the commission retains influence. The incoming health minister, Li Bin, directed the NPFPC from 2008 to 2011. And an official of the central government affirmed that local cadres will continue to be sanctioned for failing to meet population growth targets in their jurisdictions. Until these incentives are removed, the state's grip on the population's fertility will remain in place.\n\n【9】But the reorganisation almost certainly diminishes the influence that the NPFPC had as an independent commission. It was a large bureaucracy with more than 500 000 employees but the health ministry is 15 times larger, with a 2011 budget of CNY79 billion (US$12 billion) that exceeds the commission's one-hundredfold.\n\n【10】The merger also removes the NPFPC's policy functions to a separate ministry, the National Development and Reform Commission, which is not known to favour strict population control. Yanzhong Huang, Council on Foreign Relations, NY, USA, says: “On the one hand this will undermine the bureaucratic capacity of the family planning commission, and on the other, you're going to see this resistance to policy change also being eroded at the policy-making level.”\n\n【11】The Chinese Government's adherence to the one-child policy reflects a deeply held belief about the relation between population and prosperity. “A lot of people are really wedded to this policy and, rationally or irrationally, they believe it has contributed to China's economic growth”, says Joan Kaufman, director of the Columbia University Global Center for East Asia, NY, USA.\n\n【12】When the policy is finally dismantled, reformers may rely on that same logic to take it apart. David Lampton, director of China studies at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies, Washington DC, USA, points out that in the context of a diminishing workforce, population growth may promote economic growth. “Now they can reject the policy, in a sense, by affirming the need for economic growth and new people coming into the workforce. So it's the same argument but absolutely reversed in terms of the policy.”\n\n【13】Yadan Ouyang, a freelance journalist based in China, contributed research for this World Report\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2013 Ted Alcorn</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【14】### Publication history\n\n【15】Published: 23 March 2013\n\n【16】### Identification\n\n【17】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60697-2</u>\n\n【18】### Copyright\n\n【19】© 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Based on the findings of the meta-analysis, in March, 2018, the WHO Guideline Development Group issued a supplement to its guidelines for drug-resistant tuberculosis, which recommends addition of levofloxacin to rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for 6 months, and discourages use of streptomycin. In light of these data, we would like to bring attention to the situation of isoniazid resistance in India, a country with a high burden of tuberculosis.\n\n【1】According to the first national antituberculosis drug resistance survey in India (2014–16), the incidence of isoniazid resistance is 11% in new tuberculosis cases and 25% in previously treated cases. In the same survey, INH-R tuberculosis was identified in 3·85% of new cases and 7·61% of previously treated cases. These figures translate into a large number of patients with INH-R tuberculosis in India. The diagnosis of INH-R tuberculosis in India is the biggest challenge affecting its control because the cartridge-based, nucleic-acid amplification test used in India's national programme does not identify isoniazid resistance. The revised national tuberculosis control programme (RNTCP) in India, which is the largest tuberculosis control programme in the world, recommends 3–6 months of therapy with kanamycin, levofloxacin, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide (intensive phase), followed by treatment with levofloxacin, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide for 6 months (maintenance phase); thus making the treatment duration 9–12 months. The conflicting recommendations from WHO and the RNTCP have created confusion, and the increasing prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in new (2·7% for levofloxacin and 2·6% for moxifloxacin) and previously treated (3·75% for levofloxacin and 4% for moxifloxacin) cases of tuberculosis further complicates the situation.\n\n【2】Although the methods used by Fregonese and colleagues in their meta-analysis were strong, WHO considers the evidence to be of very low quality. Most of the studies that contributed data to the metaanalysis were observational, and a large number of studies were excluded because of limited data availability. As acknowledged by the authors, these limitations reduced the quality of the meta-analysis. However, Fregonese and colleagues' study is a milestone in our journey to optimising the treatment of tuberculosis, although we still have a long way to go, at least in the case of India. The need for second-line injectables in the treatment of INH-R tuberculosis, as recommended by RNTCP, is not supported by sufficient evidence and might not be feasible. Based on the data from this meta-analysis, RNTCP needs to reassess its treatment recommendation for INH-R tuberculosis.\n删除4:<u>\n**This online publication has been corrected.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of switching to a single-tablet regimen of darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide versus continuing a regimen of boosted protease inhibitor, emtricitabine, and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】EMERALD was a phase-3, randomised, active-controlled, open-label, international, multicentre trial, done at 106 sites across nine countries in North America and Europe. HIV-1-infected adults were eligible to participate if they were treatment-experienced and virologically suppressed (viral load <50 copies per mL for ≥2 months; one viral load of 50–200 copies per mL was allowed within 12 months before screening), and patients with a history of virological failure on non-darunavir regimens were allowed. Randomisation was by computer-generated interactive web-response system and stratified by boosted protease inhibitor use at baseline. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to switch to the open-label study regimen or continue the control regimen. The study regimen consisted of a fixed-dose tablet containing darunavir 800 mg, cobicistat 150 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, and tenofovir alafenamide 10 mg, which was taken once per day for 48 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with virological rebound (confirmed viral load ≥50 copies per mL or premature discontinuations, with last viral load ≥50 copies per mL) cumulative through week 48; we tested non-inferiority (4% margin) of the study regimen versus the control regimen in the intention-to-treat population.删除1-2:<u> This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT02269917.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】The study began on April 1, 2015, and the cutoff date for the week 48 primary analysis was Feb 24, 2017. Of 1141 patients (763 in the study group and 378 in the control group), 664 (58%) had previously received five or more antiretrovirals, including screening antiretrovirals, and 169 (15%) had previous virological failure on a non-darunavir regimen.

We monitored the expression of ABO-type antigens on the vascular endothelial cells of the cardiac allograft for 44 months, using monoclonal antibodies for immunohistology.

Although these questions remain important for future research, past thinkers might offer relevant answers.\n\n【1】Beginning in the 1960s, Brazilian philosopher Paulo Freire led an education movement to confront illiteracy throughout the world. He believed that education is often passively framed as an act of teachers depositing information into students, as if the students were empty accounts to be filled. He called this approach the banking system of education—an oppressive and dehumanising method that has no consideration for sociocultural realities that shape lives. Instead, Freire taught communities to read using familiar words and open questions that encouraged people to critically question the world around them, an act he described as developing a critical consciousness.\n\n【2】If we replace students with patients and educators with clinicians, we might see that the banking system of education is common in medicine. We often hope that health behaviours can change given the right piece of information or intervention. Similar to the Editorial, Freire would encourage us to see that the reason this approach does not work is that health information is often provided via a method that encourages people to act in ways disconnected from their realities.\n\n【3】Health literacy is an inherently political project that will require us to look beyond the boundaries of our discipline.

You had told me that the procedure was useful, since it helped discover breast cancer early and increased the chance of cure. The press repeatedly echoed that opinion. 6 years ago, my mammogram was equivocal. It was probably nothing but you told me to undergo a control mammography 6 months later. It was a long wait, oscillating between fear and hope. My family suffered with me in silence. The control mammogram showed the same abnormality. As I could not handle the pressure any longer, I opted for biopsy. Good news came after a very difficult week's waiting: no malignant cells were found. You told me that false-positive mammograms are not rare. Relief, however, lasted only a few months. Repeat mammography showed that the abnormality was still there, and I forced you to admit that false-negative biopsies also exist. Because the anxiety generated by uncertainty was unbearable, I considered mastectomy. I thought that my unfortunate experience was the price that had to be paid for saving many people. Now I see in the media that there is no real evidence that mammography is useful, which means that all my suffering was useless.

Consensus conferences informed us that between the age of 50 years and 69 years, a 30% breast-cancer mortality reduction would be expected from systematic mammography screening.

But the influenza epidemic of 1918–19 that followed the war was never once mentioned, although it took the lives of more than twice as many people as the fighting: the world's worst epidemic since the Black Death of 1347–51. For unclear reasons, “the flu outbreak registered hardly at all in the Western imagination” until the 1970s, writes Philip Alcabes. Today, as we face our fears of its future recurrence in a new form, the 1918 pandemic is a familiar event. _Dread_ , Alcabes's challenging book about epidemics, has in a sense been written to explain this astonishing change in reputation.\n\n【2】_Dread_ is both reassuring and discomforting. Although Alcabes believes that there is no particular reason to expect another epidemic of influenza on the scale of 1918, he bluntly warns, on the basis of past epidemics, “Whatever disease causes the next great outbreak, we won't see it coming.”\n\n【3】The Black Death, which claimed perhaps 25 million victims, was wholly unanticipated. Surprisingly, medieval Europe had been free of plague for almost 600 years before the Black Death arrived from Asia via trade with the Near East. While the biology of its spread is generally agreed, still unclear is why the outbreak turned out so lethal. Having sketched the history of plague from antiquity to the industrial revolution, Alcabes explores the outbreak of cholera, first in colonial India in 1817, thereafter in Europe and his native USA. Then he launches into the effect of 19th-century germ theory on our perception of epidemics. For all the theory's explanatory power, Alcabes worries that germs, like genes, oversimplify disease, so that we underplay the importance of complex social conditions.\n\n【4】At every turn, Alcabes focuses on the interactions of individuals, communities, governments, medical professionals, the drug industry, and the media in redefining the historical meaning of “epidemic”. In an excellent epilogue, “The risk-free life”, aimed especially at his risk-averse fellow Americans, Alcabes criticises alarmist reactions based on vested interest. “The _possible_ epidemic is rich in potential for managing the public”, he wryly remarks—not to speak of financial opportunities.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【5】### Publication history\n\n【6】Published: 18 July 2009\n\n【7】### Identification\n\n【8】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61317-9</u>\n\n【9】### Copyright\n\n【10】© 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, major advances have been made with the introduction of new drugs and novel interventional approaches such as cardiac resynchronisation therapy. However, there is a need for further improvement, especially considering the projection for increases in heart failure prevalence caused by ageing of the population. Longer survival of patients with cardiac diseases, an effect of modern life-extending treatments, such as primary angioplasty for myocardial infarction and implantable defibrillators for prevention of sudden cardiac death, also contributes to the need for more effective therapies for heart failure.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【1】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【2】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【3】One-time access price info\n\n【4】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【5】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【6】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

The MRC trial compares surgery alone with chemotherapy plus surgery, whereas the INT 0123 compares two doses of radical radiation (50 _vs_ 64 Gy), all patients having received chemotherapy.\n\n【3】Although in INT 0123 the higher dose of radiation had no advantage, it provided an opportunity to compare results with the MRC trial.

However, people with mental illness can also be victims of violence. We aimed to assess how often victims of homicide are current mental health patients and their relationship to the perpetrators.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In a national consecutive case-series study, we obtained data for victims and perpetrators of all confirmed homicides between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2005, in England and Wales. We requested information about contact with mental health services in the 12 months before the homicide for all victims and perpetrators. For victims and perpetrators who had contact with mental health services in the 12 months before homicide, we sent questionnaires to the clinician responsible for the patient's care.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】1496 victims of confirmed homicide died between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2005, in England and Wales. Patients with mental illness were more likely to die by homicide than were people in the general population (incidence rate ratio 2·6, 95% CI 1·9–3·4). 90 homicide victims (6%) had contact with mental health services in the 12 months before their death. 213 patients with mental illness were convicted of homicide in the same 3 year period. 29 of 90 patient victims were killed by another patient with mental illness. In 23 of these 29 cases, the victim and perpetrator were known to each other, and in 21 of these cases, the victims and perpetrators were undergoing treatment at the same National Health Service Trust. In these 29 cases in which patient victims were killed by another patient with mental illness, alcohol and drug misuse (19 victims \\[66%\\], 27 perpetrators \\[93%\\]) and previous violence (7 victims \\[24%\\], 7 perpetrators \\[24%\\]) were common in both victims and, particularly, perpetrators. In seven of the 29 cases in which the victim was killed by another patient with mental illness, both victim and perpetrator were diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The high risk of patients with mental illness being victims of homicide is an important antistigma message, although this risk partly comes from other patients with mental illness; overall, the risk of patients committing homicide is greater than the risk of being a victim of homicide. Identification and safeguarding of patients at risk of violence should be prominent in clinical risk assessment.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【11】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【12】Already registered?\n\n【13】Log in to existing account\n\n【14】Forgot password?\n\n【15】One-time access price info\n\n【16】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【17】Not yet registered?\n\n【18】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:13:38", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:16:07", "cost": 149.398}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:48", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:16:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:13:38"}

Strategies to prevent transfusion need to be recognised and appropriately evaluated. The findings showed that preoperative iron infusion did not reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions; however, we disagree with the conclusion drawn that preoperative iron should not be recommended.\n\n【1】Despite not selecting patients specifically for iron deficiency, Richards and colleagues showed efficacy of intravenous iron at improving haemoglobin concentration by the time of surgery (mean difference 4·7 g/L, 95% CI 2·7–6·8), and at 8 weeks and 6 months following intervention. The almost identical mean rates of transfusion at 30 days between the two groups (0·65 \\[SD 1·3\\] in the placebo group _vs_ 0·61 \\[1·3\\] in the iron group) despite no difference in bleeding volumes, suggests a difference in transfusion practice. Although a large number of centres improved the study generalisability, it might also increase heterogeneity. Transfusion rates are known to be highly variable among centres—often dependent on local practice and individual clinician decisions rather than the patients’ clinical state. For example, if a decision to transfuse is made on the intraoperative rate of blood loss rather than an estimate of red cell mass, then optimising the haemoglobin will not impact the transfusion decision at all. There was no reported standardised transfusion protocol; therefore, any benefit from iron therapy might be obfuscated by the heterogeneity in clinical decision making about the transfusion. Having a uniform approach to transfusion might be the preferred approach to reduce red blood cell use; however, it should not be the only goal of iron therapy.\n\n【2】Patient blood management aims to improve (numerous and varied) patient outcomes through the optimisation of red cell mass and minimisation of blood loss. In this sense, the study by Richards and colleagues has shown a benefit. Somewhat surprisingly, increased haemoglobin was not associated with improved postoperative fatigue and there was a significant reduction in readmissions in the first 8 postoperative weeks (risk ratio 0·61, 95% CI 0·40–0·91). Richards and colleagues are right to suggest that much of the benefit shown in the study could be preserved by intrahospital iron therapy; however, without a standardised approach to transfusion, it should not be concluded that improving preoperative red cell mass cannot improve the need for blood transfusion.\n\n【3】Further preoperative and postoperative studies noting the haemoglobin and iron status are required. Ideally, adequate time for the intravenous iron to have a therapeutic response should be allowed before surgery, which we understand can be difficult in patients requiring urgent surgery.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2019 Peter Dazeley/Getty Images</u>\n\n【4】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:09:16", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:09:27", "cost": 10.898}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:48", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:09:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:09:16"}

Since variola virus had no natural reservoir other than humans, the eradication of the virus by use of highly effective vaccines against orthopoxviruses was irreversible. However, other orthopoxviruses have reservoirs in wildlife, such as cowpox virus (in voles), taterapox virus (in African gerbils), and monkeypox virus (in small mammals), do have the potential to spill into the human population and facilitate a restart of the genetic adaptation of the virus to the human host, which once resulted in variola virus. This adaptation is possible by the unique genomic make up of orthopoxviruses and their ability to jumpstart evolution by use of gene loss, rather than by progressive mutation as seen in SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【1】Within orthopoxviruses, a genetic core of about 120 000 base pairs is highly conserved and thought to code for basic viral functions; however, towards the termini the orthopoxvirus genome is plastic, and large regions can be readily deleted 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. These regions contain genes related to host adaption. Orthopoxviruses like variola virus that have adapted to a specific host species tend to lose many terminal host-restriction genes during adaptation 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>, allowing them to spread more easily or cause more severe disease. This loss could optimise both the spread (eg, by droplet-related transmission) via enhanced systemic infection and disease severity.\n删除4:<u>\n• View related content for this article</u>\n\n【2】Circulating monkeypox virus might be undergoing adaption for the human host, so we must keep its genetic changes under tight surveillance so as to be prepared when sudden epidemiological changes and prevent the emergence of a variola virus epigone. This surveillance, however, will require a conceptual shift from observing lone single nucleotide polymorphisms, as with SARS-CoV-2 variants, towards watching closely for the integrity and stability of the monkeypox virus genomic termini. Therefore, the constant sequencing of full monkeypox virus genomes is of utmost importance to detect not only single nucleotide polymorphisms but any intragenic frameshifts or premature stop codons, that might indicate initial signals of gene loss. This surveillance, however, requires the highest-quality genomic data and careful annotation. Currently many sequences from the ongoing outbreak are erroneous or do not have annotation, which makes it difficult to establish useful genomic characterisation.\n\n【3】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>\n\n【4】删除1-1:<u>For **WHO's monkeypox outbreak situation update** see https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2022-DON393</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nSupplementary Material\n----------------------\n删除4:<u>\n*   Download .pdf (.16 MB)</u>\n\n【5】    Help with pdf files\n\n【6】    Supplementary appendix</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:25:20", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:26:12", "cost": 52.39}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:48", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:26:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:25:19"}

We included acutely ill infants aged younger than 1 year admitted to hospital within 10 days or less of illness onset during two influenza seasons (2015–16 and 2016–17) in Albania, Jordan, and Nicaragua, and over a continuous 34 week period (2015–16) in the Philippines. We assessed the frequency of influenza virus infections by real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) and serology. The main study outcome was seroconversion, defined as convalescent antibody titres more than or equal to four-fold higher than acute sera antibody titres, and convalescent antibody titres of 40 or higher. Seroconverison was confirmed by haemagglutination inhibition assay for influenza A viruses, and by hemagglutination inhibition assay and microneutralisation for influenza B viruses.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between June 27, 2015, and April 21, 2017, 3634 acutely ill infants were enrolled, of whom 1943 were enrolled during influenza seasons and had complete acute-convalescent pairs and thus were included in the final analytical sample. Of the 1943 infants, 94 (5%) were influenza-positive by both rRT-PCR and serology, 58 (3%) were positive by rRT-PCR-only, and 102 (5%) were positive by serology only. Seroconversion to at least one of the influenza A or B viruses was observed among 196 (77%) of 254 influenza-positive infants. Of the 254 infants with influenza virus, 84 (33%) only had non-respiratory clinical discharge diagnoses (eg, sepsis, febrile seizures, dehydration, or other non-respiratory viral illness). A focus on respiratory diagnoses and rRT-PCR-confirmed influenza underdetects influenza-associated hospital admissions among infants by a factor of 2·6 (95% CI 2·0–3·6). Findings were unchanged when syndromic severe acute respiratory infection criteria were applied instead of clinical diagnosis.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】If the true incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospital admissions among infants is at least twice that of previous estimates, this substantially increases the global burden of severe influenza and expands our estimates of the preventive value of maternal and infant influenza vaccination programmes.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

A vaccination campaign was held in the world's largest refugee camp in Cox's Bazaar, Bangladesh where almost 900,000 Rohingya (Forcibly Displaced Myanmar Nationals or FDMN) people reside. Within four months, 86% of FDMN above 55 years of age had been vaccinated, which is a remarkable feat. What lessons can we learn from this campaign that has seen a high uptake of vaccination in a marginalised population with a history of limited health seeking behaviour?\n\n【1】The WHO played a major role in the campaign by citing the importance of refugee populations in receiving vaccinations and lobbied the Bangladeshi government to revise the vaccination plan to include the FDMN as an objective group. Although around 130,000 vaccines were specifically earmarked for distribution among the FDMN in March 2021, it was not until August that the first vaccine was administered. The failure to hit this target could be majorly attributed to lack of supply. Bangladesh was due to receive 12 million doses in early 2021 through the COVAX initiative, but by May 2021 the country had not received a single dose. These shortages led to fears that Bangladesh would prioritise the limited number of available vaccines and the promises to vaccinate refugees would not be materialised. However, the WHO advocated the countries with surplus doses to donate to COVAX and for manufacturers to boost supplies to the COVAX manufacturing facilities. This led to an upscaling of supply and Bangladesh has now seen over 190 million doses delivered through COVAX and bilateral donations. Increasing the supply to Bangladesh has been vital in vaccination of FDMN and the global community must continue to support schemes like COVAX in delivering doses to low-income and middle-income countries, where 85% of refugees are hosted, so that they need not prioritise their vaccines to the detriment of displaced populations.\n\n【2】Over 150 states have adopted COVID-19 vaccine strategies to include refugees—but inclusion in policy does not always translate into equitable access. Marginalised groups are more likely to experience barriers in accessing healthcare, which in turn leads to vaccine hesitancy. Prior to the pandemic, studies reflected vaccine hesitancy among FDMN, with resistance from religious leaders and gender barriers being the main contributing factors. These issues, paired with a general mistrust of local health systems, must be overcome to ensure adequate vaccine uptake in marginalised communities. To resolve this, governments need to invest in qualitative research aiming to understand the needs of the culturally and linguistically unique displaced communities. Engagement with community leaders ahead of vaccination campaigns has been vital in Cox's Bazaar, as well as educational programmes combatting identified misinformation among the FDMN. For example, information gathered from initial community-level consultations was used develop to outreach programmes sensitive to the thoughts and feelings of the FDMN. Vaccination centres were supported by Rohingya volunteers, who had a key role in communicating health messages, liaising with community leaders, and accompanying older people to vaccination centres. The inclusion of the Rohingya people themselves in vaccine outreach programmes helped to foreground cultural consideration whilst tackling vaccine hesitancy.\n\n【3】Marginalised groups remain vulnerable to the threat of COVID-19 and the world-wide community must ensure displaced populations will not be left behind in the global vaccination drive. The vaccine programme for the FDMN in Cox's Bazaar illustrates how equitable vaccine access and culturally sensitive vaccine outreach programmes contributes to overall success of global vaccination efforts.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【4】AMA conceptualised and wrote the paper.\n\n【5】Declaration of interests\n------------------------\n\n【6】None.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:40:06", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:40:39", "cost": 32.724}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:48", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:40:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:40:06"}

We aimed to identify the causes of non-malarial acute fever in patients in rural Laos.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】For this prospective study, we recruited 1938 febrile patients, between May, 2008, and December, 2010, at Luang Namtha provincial hospital in northwest Laos (n=1390), and between September, 2008, and December, 2010, at Salavan provincial hospital in southern Laos (n=548). Eligible participants were aged 5–49 years with fever (≥38°C) lasting 8 days or less and were eligible for malaria testing by national guidelines.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】With conservative definitions of cause, we assigned 799 (41%) patients a diagnosis. With exclusion of influenza, the top five diagnoses when only one aetiological agent per patient was identified were dengue (156 \\[8%\\] of 1927 patients), scrub typhus (122 \\[7%\\] of 1871), Japanese encephalitis virus (112 \\[6%\\] of 1924), leptospirosis (109 \\[6%\\] of 1934), and bacteraemia (43 \\[2%\\] of 1938). 115 (32%) of 358 patients at Luang Namtha hospital tested influenza PCR-positive between June and December, 2010, of which influenza B was the most frequently detected strain (n=121 \\[87%\\]). Disease frequency differed significantly between the two sites: Japanese encephalitis virus infection (p=0·04), typhoid (p=0·006), and leptospirosis (p=0·001) were more common at Luang Namtha, whereas dengue and malaria were more common at Salavan (all p<0·0001). With use of evidence from southeast Asia when possible, we estimated that azithromycin, doxycycline, ceftriaxone, and ofloxacin would have had significant efficacy for 258 (13%), 240 (12%), 154 (8%), and 41 (2%) of patients, respectively.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Our findings suggest that a wide range of treatable or preventable pathogens are implicated in non-malarial febrile illness in Laos. Empirical treatment with doxycycline for patients with undifferentiated fever and negative rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and dengue could be an appropriate strategy for rural health workers in Laos.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Wellcome Trust, WHO–Western Pacific Region, Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n【10】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【11】Increased use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in Laos has shown that many individuals with suspected malaria are not infected with _Plasmodium falciparum_ or _Plasmodium vivax_ . Although the incidence of falciparum malaria is falling, transmission is heterogeneous between regions, with higher incidence in the south than in the north. Therefore, a major clinical question paradoxically arises as malaria diagnosis improves: what are the main diagnoses among febrile patients without malaria and how should these individuals be treated?\n\n【12】What treatment patients without malaria receive at all levels of health care in rural Laos is left to health workers to decide. However, few diagnostic facilities or data are available to identify the pathogens responsible, or their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, to guide these decisions. A wide range of infectious diseases have been described from Laos, including typhoid, scrub typhus ( _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ ), murine typhus ( _Rickettsia typhi_ ), _Neorickettsia sennetsu_ , dengue, leptospirosis, Japanese encephalitis virus, and influenza. However, most of these data are from Vientiane where no malaria transmission takes place. In malaria-endemic regions of Laos, village health volunteers are trained to undertake rapid diagnostic tests for malaria and to give antimalarial drugs to patients who test positive. Most results are negative, thus information is needed to develop algorithms to manage febrile patients with no malaria. To be effective, such algorithms should take into account heterogeneity in incidence and epidemiology of infectious disease across a country, because to base empirical treatment on a country-wide protocol could reduce effectiveness. We therefore did a prospective investigation of the causes of acute fever in patients tested for malaria in northern and southern Laos.\n\n【13】Methods\n-------\n\n【14】### Study design and participants\n\n【15】We did this prospective study at Luang Namtha provincial hospital in northwest Laos between May 2, 2008, and Dec 28, 2010, and at Salavan provincial hospital in southern Laos between Sept 5, 2008, and Dec 26, 2010. The hospitals are roughly 770 km apart. Luang Namtha has 60 beds and serves a population of about 145 000 individuals from the highlands of the China–Burma border. Salavan has 70 beds and serves a population of about 332 000 from the western slopes of the Annamite mountains 删除2:<u>( figure 1 )</u>. We recruited inpatients and outpatients aged 5–49 years who gave written informed consent; were eligible for malaria rapid diagnostic testing or microscopy by Lao national guidelines; had no obvious causes of fever (abscess or severe diarrhoea) that would indicate that there was no need for malaria testing; and whose fever had lasted for 8 days or less with an admission tympanic temperature of 38°C or more. We chose, with restricted resources, to recruit patients aged 5–49 years because 75% of Lao patients with malaria are within this age range. Clinicians at both hospitals recorded clinical features of patients at admission and results of routine laboratory investigations in a case record form. Radiological investigations were scarcely available and are not included here. We defined acute encephalitis syndrome as occurring “in a person of any age, at any time of year, with the acute onset of fever and either a change in mental status (including symptoms such as confusion, disorientation, coma, or inability to talk) or new onset of seizures (excluding simple febrile seizures) or both”. We defined meningitis as a patient with “sudden onset of fever (>38·5°C rectal or 38·0°C axillary) and one of three other signs: neck stiffness, altered consciousness, or other meningeal sign”.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Map of Laos showing location of Vientiane and the study sites in Luang Namtha and Salavan provinces</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【16】Written informed consent was obtained from all recruited patients or responsible guardians. Ethics approval was obtained from the Lao National Ethics Committee for Health Research and the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee.\n\n【17】### Samples and transport\n\n【18】We requested that all patients provide three blood spots on 903 filter paper (Whatman, Maidstone, UK), and for those aged 5–15 years, 2 mL of whole blood for each of two blood cultures, 3 mL of EDTA blood, and 3 mL of clotted blood. The equivalent volumes for patients older than 15 years were 5 mL of whole blood for each of two blood cultures, 5 mL of EDTA blood, and 5 mL of clotted blood. At 7–14 days' follow-up after discharge, we requested an additional 3 mL of clotted blood for convalescent serology. From May, 2010, nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from all consenting patients at Luang Namtha. Samples were packaged in plastic screw-capped tubes with paper wadding, which in turn were kept in double-skinned locked metal boxes 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>.\n\n【19】### Laboratory assays\n\n【20】We tested for _Plasmodium_ spp, _Leptospira_ spp _, O tsutsugamushi, R typhi,_ spotted-fever-group rickettsia, causes of community bacteraemia, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis virus, and, for the last 6 months at Luang Namtha, influenza 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. We did not test for tuberculosis or HIV. We followed manufacturer's instructions unless otherwise stated. We did Giemsa-stained malaria smears and plasmodium lactate-dehydrogenase-based immunochromatographic tests (ICT Malaria Combo Cassette Test; ICT Diagnostics, Cape Town, South Africa) for all patients. Full blood counts were done when possible at Salavan (ABX Micros 60 Hematology Analyzer, Horiba ABX, Japan) and Luang Namtha (Mindray BC 3000 Hematology Analyzer, Mindray Medical Instrumentation, NJ, USA). We identified positive blood cultures with conventional techniques and antibiotic susceptibility by disc diffusion with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute criteria. We did rickettsial culture by inoculation of buffy coat onto Vero and L929 cells with incubation for 6–8 weeks, and speciation by immunofluorescence assay and PCR. We undertook leptospiral culture with the clot remaining after centrifugation of clotted blood, with Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris medium. Rickettsial and leptospiral culture began in August, 2009, representing 16 months of the study.\n\n【21】We used dengue and Japanese encephalitis virus ELISAs (Panbio, Brisbane, Australia) to detect dengue NS1, anti-dengue IgM and IgG, and anti-Japanese encephalitis virus IgM 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. Immunofluorescence assays were done for antibodies, in dried blood-spot elutes, against _O tsutsugamushi_ and _R typhi_ . We defined a positive result as an IgM or IgG titre of 1:400 or more. We regarded leptospiral microscopic agglutination tests as positive if serum showed a titre of 1:400 or more or if paired sera showed a four-fold rise.\n\n【22】We extracted nucleic acids and did all PCRs in duplicate on a Rotor-Gene 3000 or 6000 (Qiagen, Germany) for real-time PCR and a DNA Engine (MJ Research, Canada) for conventional PCR. We based detection of dengue virus on the single-step TaqMan real-time PCR assay. For _Plasmodium_ spp, we used a nested conventional PCR assay targeting the ssrRNA gene, with distinguishing of _P falciparum_ from _P vivax_ . For _Leptospira_ species, we used a TaqMan real-time PCR assay, detecting the _Leptospira rrs_ gene.\n\n【23】We used three probe-based real-time PCR assays to detect _O tsutsugamushi_ (47 kDa _htrA_ gene), _Rickettsia_ genus (17 kDa gene), and _R typhi_ ( _ompB_ gene). We regarded _Rickettsia_ genus 17 kDa real-time PCR-positive samples, and _R typhi ompB_ real-time PCR-negative samples as _Rickettsia_ spp, which subsequently underwent a panel of nested conventional PCR assays targeting the 17 kDa, _gltA, ompB, ompA,_ and _sca4_ genes. For positive amplicons, DNA sequencing was done by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea), followed by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches of GenBank. We collected nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs at Luang Namtha from June, 2010, to December, 2010. The National Centre for Laboratory and Epidemiology did influenza real-time PCR with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention primers and probes for the influenza virus (H1N1, H3N2, pandemic H1N1 2009, H5N1, and influenza B).\n\n【24】We classified patients' diagnoses in two ways. First, the more conservative, and probably more accurate approach, using only diagnoses based on culture (ie, blood, rickettsial, and leptospiral culture), antigen detection (dengue NS1), and PCR ( _Plasmodium_ spp, _O tsutsugamushi, R typhi_ , spotted-fever-group _Rickettsia_ spp, _Leptospira_ spp, and dengue) plus, potentially less reliably, anti-Japanese encephalitis virus IgM ELISA. Second, we used all available tests (ie, the above plus _O tsutsugamushi_ and _R typhi_ immunofluorescence assay and dengue IgM and IgG ELISAs, which are likely to have lower specificity). Concordance between duplicate PCR assays was high 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>, except for _R typhi_ because of the difficulties in distinguishing _R typhi_ from the spotted fever group. We analysed the association between patient symptoms, signs, and laboratory features for each aetiological diagnosis 删除2:<u>(see statistical analysis)</u>.\n\n【25】### Antibiotic use and effectiveness\n\n【26】At Luang Namtha, we recorded patients' use of antibiotics before admission. We derived a rough estimation of the therapeutic effectiveness by consensus among the authors, with use of evidence from Laos as much as possible 删除2:<u>( appendix p 55 )</u>. For many pathogens the evidence base is inadequate to provide robust evidence, with confidence intervals, of efficacy or effectiveness.\n\n【27】### Statistical analysis\n\n【28】We analysed data with SPSS and Stata (both version 10). We compared normally distributed data with Student's _t_ test, and non-normally distributed data with the Mann-Whitney U test. We compared categorical data with χ 2 and Fisher's exact tests. To predict factors associated with cause, we included all significant variables from the univariable analysis in a multivariable logistic regression model using a backward stepwise approach; we retained significant variables in the final models. We checked the fit of models with the Hosmer-Lemeshow or Pearson's goodness-of-fit tests.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【29】The sponsors of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.

The frequency of anti- _R typhi_ IgM and IgG was lower than that for _O tsutsugamushi,_ which is consistent with evidence that murine typhus is a more urban disease than scrub typhus. Because mild scrub typhus responds rapidly to oral doxycycline treatment in Vientiane, these data suggest that accessible and inexpensive doxycycline (about Lao Kip \\[LAK\\]–10 000, roughly US$1·2, for a 7-day course of 14 tablets) might be an appropriate intervention. Leptospirosis was also an important cause of non-malarial fever in Laos, especially in the north. We would expect mild disease to respond well to oral doxycycline. Unlike scrub typhus, we would also expect mild forms to respond to oral and parenteral penicillins and cephalosporins. Acute encephalitis syndrome and meningitis are important considerations because empirical treatment for undifferentiated fever might not be effective for these severe syndromes.\n\n【59】Dengue is clearly an important cause of fever outside the few major Lao urban centres, and vector control and training in management of fluid balance are likely to be key interventions. New rapid diagnostic tests for the detection of dengue NS1 have high specificity and sensitivity and are likely to be helpful for diagnosis of dengue at local hospitals. Japanese encephalitis virus was also an important cause of fever, and vaccines are available with an effectiveness of more than 80% after just one dose. With an assumption of this level of effectiveness, a vaccine for Japanese encephalitis virus could reduce the frequency of patients developing undifferentiated fever by about 5%. These data, and those describing Japanese encephalitis virus as an important cause of encephalitis in Laos, suggest that vaccination is likely to reduce the incidence of not only encephalitis, death, and disability, but also undifferentiated fever and the resultant key economic issues of health-care expenditure and loss of work. Vaccination is due to start in Laos in 2013.\n\n【60】With the advent of affordable and accurate rapid diagnostic tests for dengue, on the basis of detection of dengue NS1 and anti-dengue IgM and IgG antibodies, empirical antibiotic treatment for those with negative dengue and malaria results might be a cost-effective option 删除2:<u>( panel )</u>. Furthermore, with the exception of typhoid, the main treatable fevers were not caused by pathogens diagnosed in conventional microbiology laboratories, but could be diagnosed by combinations of antigen rapid diagnostic tests and simple molecular assays, such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays. Hence, intensive widespread investment in expensive conventional facilities for microbiological culture facilities might not be appropriate.\n\n【61】Panel\n\n【62】**Research in context**\n\n【63】**Systematic review**\n\n【64】As described in , we searched PubMed in English from Jan 1, 1986 to June 9, 2011, with the keywords “Cambodia” or “Lao PDR” (and “Laos”) or “Viet Nam” (and “Vietnam”) or “Myanmar” (and “Burma”) or “Thailand” or “Yunnan Province” (of the People's Republic of China), coupled separately with individual search terms for diseases: “rickettsial infections” (search terms: “rickett\\*”, “scrub typhus”, “murine typhus”, “spotted fever group rickett\\*”), “leptospirosis”, “typhoid fever”, “dengue”, “melioidosis”, and “Japanese encephalitis”. For Laos we also searched the grey literature in medical libraries in Vientiane and discussed with local physicians. No studies exist that examine the diversity of bacterial and viral pathogens in one population. Through the above search we identified the potential causes of fever in Laos and the diagnostic and treatment options. Our study adds substantially to the fragmented data previously available and gives the first objective evidence of the causes of fever, when malaria tests are negative, in communities in mainland Asia.\n\n【65】**Interpretation**\n\n【66】Our findings show that a wide range of treatable or preventable pathogens are the cause of fever in patients in rural Laos who present with malaria-like syndromes, but do not have malaria. With exclusion of influenza, the top five diagnoses, when only one aetiological diagnosis per patient was made, were dengue, scrub typhus, Japanese encephalitis virus, leptospirosis, and bacteraemia. Forthcoming Japanese encephalitis vaccination in Laos is likely to reduce the incidence of undifferentiated fever in addition to encephalitis. Significant differences in disease frequency between the two sites, for dengue, typhoid, Japanese encephalitis virus, malaria, and leptospirosis, have important implications for empirical therapy and emphasise the importance of heterogeneity in disease epidemiology within countries. The study suggests that empirical treatment with doxycycline or azithromycin in patients with undifferentiated fever, without malaria, might be a clinically appropriate strategy for reducing morbidity and mortality in rural Laos and elsewhere in mainland southeast Asia. Further cost-effectiveness analysis, including use of rapid diagnostic tests for dengue, would be important to inform policy. More discussion is needed about strategies to build clinically useful and cost-effective country-appropriate laboratory diagnostics to inform treatment and surveillance in rural southeast Asia.\n\n【67】Although described in fleas in Laos and in one patient at Mahosot Hospital who seroconverted, our study describes detection of _Rickettsia felis_ with molecular techniques for the first time in patients from Laos. _R felis_ has been described at the Thailand and Burma border, but not as far as we are aware in Burma, Vietnam, China, or Cambodia.\n\n【68】Other potential uninvestigated infectious causes of undifferentiated fever in Laos include Epstein-Barr virus; hepatitis A, B, C, and E viruses; mycoplasma; cytomegalovirus; hantaviruses; enterovirus; chikungunya; _Coxiella burnetii_ ; _Brucella_ spp; _Neorickettsia sennetsu; Bartonella_ ; filaria; and diverse respiratory viruses. As suggested in Cambodia, 50% of cases of influenza B would not have been identified by surveillance for influenza-like illness. At several Cambodian clinics, causes identified for 38% of febrile patients (fever <10 days, aged >2 years) were mainly influenza, dengue, malaria, and typhoid. In Papua, Indonesia, the main causes of fever (any age, negative malaria slide) were leptospirosis, rickettsioses, typhoid, and dengue.\n\n【69】Our study has important limitations. First, we did not include diagnosis of urinary tract infections, hepatitis viruses, HIV, and tuberculosis because such diagnosis was only possible in a few patients. At least in Luang Namtha, HIV prevalence is very low. Second, we did not examine cerebrospinal fluid because such investigations are not possible outside of Vientiane. Third, we did not include patients younger than 5 years or older than 49 years, so generalisability is somewhat restricted. Fourth, in the difficult logistical environment of rural Laos, follow-up was not possible for all patients. Fifth, IgM and IgG anti-dengue antibodies could represent previous infections and not the cause of the presenting illness. Three patients with anti-Japanese encephalitis virus IgM were also dengue PCR-positive, which is suggestive of either mixed infections, ELISA cross-reactivity, or sequential Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue infections. Because we did only 6 months of influenza diagnosis for Luang Namtha, the true importance of influenza will be underestimated. Sixth, the non-incubated transport of blood culture bottles for 24 h before venting and incubation will reduce growth of fastidious organisms such as _Haemophilus influenzae_ ; however, _S typhi_ seemed to tolerate these conditions. Indeed, a greater diversity of pathogens is apparent in blood cultures in Vientiane, presumably because of rapid incubation. Seventh, antibiotic use before presentation can underestimate the frequency of cultured pathogens from patients with community-acquired bacteraemia. Eighth, at both hospitals diagnosis of malaria took place during the planning stage of the study, but incidence fell. Ninth, because only a minority of febrile patients would be expected to attend a provincial hospital, selection bias is an important consideration in interpretation of these results. However, in 2009, only 100 (3%) of 2991 patients in all of Luang Namtha, and 2457 (7%) of 33 785 in Salavan were diagnosed with falciparum malaria by microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests (unpublished). More patients were admitted at Salavan than at Luang Namtha, which probably indicates different admission policies. Finally, the disease-specific mortality will be underestimated, with no follow-up data for a substantial number, and because patients are usually taken home to die rather than dying in hospital.\n\n【70】Detection of one or more pathogens is fraught with difficulties if diagnostic techniques that rely on antibody detection or have interspecies cross-reactivity are used. The presence of several pathogens is much more certain if they are grown in culture or shown by specific antigen or nucleic acid detection, or by seroconversion. The sparse data available for the longevity of specific serum IgM for diseases such as scrub typhus, murine typhus, leptospirosis, and Japanese encephalitis suggest that these immunoglobulins might be detectable for months or perhaps years. Hence, assays based on detection of these IgM antibodies are at risk of being interpreted as mixed infection when they represent previous symptomatic or asymptomatic infection. However, mixed infections of common pathogens, especially for individuals with similar household and occupational exposure, are likely to be frequent.\n\n【71】A further neglected issue in national treatment guidelines is heterogeneity of causes of fever across a country due to environmental and human factors. Despite being a small country, differences in the cause of disease between north and south Laos are marked. Dengue and malaria were significantly more frequent at Salavan than at Luang Namtha, and leptospirosis, Japanese encephalitis virus, and typhoid were significantly more frequent at Luang Namtha. In view of the very high soil densities of _B pseudomallei_ in Salavan, the incidence of this pathogen is likely to be underestimated in the south. How the effect of policies for treatment of empirical fever will be affected by such heterogeneity needs further investigation.\n\n【72】The relatively high estimated effectiveness of doxycycline results from the high incidence of typhus and leptospirosis, whereas the low estimated effectiveness of ofloxacin is a consequence of its probably low or zero efficacy for typhus and leptospirosis and the low incidence of bacteraemia. The intermediate effectiveness of ceftriaxone results from its efficacy against leptospirosis, which was quite common. The relatively low estimated effects need to be assessed in the context of an extensive diagnostic investigation only giving an aetiological diagnosis for 41% of patients. Doubt remains about the effect of azithromycin for murine typhus and community-acquired bacteraemia, and concerns exist about engenderment of azithromycin resistance. However, if 3 days of azithromycin were effective for these pathogens, this drug might be more effective than doxycycline. Because village health volunteers have only about 2 weeks' training and rural Laos faces economic difficulties, empirical treatment algorithms need to be simple and inexpensive. Addition of another antibiotic, such as ofloxacin, in regions with an increased incidence of bacteraemia such as typhoid, needs detailed cost-effectiveness analysis. The estimated effectiveness of these antibiotics in Salavan was lower than that in Luang Namtha, because of the higher incidence of dengue in Salavan.\n\n【73】Differentiation of patients with different diagnoses, either at the bedside or when all data were analysed, was difficult. A CRP rapid diagnostic test, with a cutoff of 5 mg/L, might identify patients with a bacterial illness and those likely to respond to doxycycline 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. Although many patients unlikely to respond to doxycycline would be treated, without expected therapeutic benefit but with risk of adverse effects, few patients likely to respond to doxycycline would be missed by such a strategy. With an assumption that the consequences of no treatment of patients are severe, but the risks and expense of unnecessary antibiotic treatment are moderately low, a diagnostic cutoff to give higher sensitivity at the expense of reduced specificity might be acceptable.\n\n【74】The low proportions of patients who received appropriate treatments for laboratory confirmed typhus and leptospirosis would be increased by empirical doxycycline treatment for undifferentiated fever, especially for those with a negative dengue rapid diagnosis test. Cost-effectiveness analysis of pathogen-specific diagnostics, of CRP, and of other potential severity markers such as procalcitonin is required to inform strategies. Assessment of tests and strategies for both population-wide estimates of incidence and prevalence to inform clinical algorithms, and patient-specific information at the point of care are needed. In the long term, the strengthening of provincial-level, and then district-level, hospitals with an affordable, Lao-appropriate mix of methods for accurate diagnosis of treatable or preventable infectious diseases will hopefully improve understanding of the geographical diversity of pathogens and their optimum treatment.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【75】MM, VC, RP, PD, SI, PS, GS, KP, BH, SDB, CEM, FvS, XdL, IJG, EMC, AC, DB, and PNN designed the study; MM, VC, RP, PD, SI, PS, GS, KP, and PNN undertook clinical aspects of the study; JC-V, AD-P, DHP, RP, JT, NT, AC, PP, BS, KP, MD, DP, BH, SX, PK, SDB, CEM, SBC, M-AB, AC, XdL undertook the laboratory assays.

The report used a new definition of avoidable mortality that combined preventable deaths (mainly neoplasms) and deaths from conditions that were amenable to treatment (mainly cardiovascular disease) and was standardised to the European population. Premature mortality resulted in an average loss of 23 years of life for adults and 72 years for children, in whom accidental injury was the leading cause of death. 60% of the avoidable mortality was in males. The value of such data is the ability to identify areas for improvement, such as men's health, and to monitor future performance.\n\n【1】Avoidable mortality shows strong regional disparities. A point also emphasised in a quality standard on Suspected cancer published by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on June 30, which found variation in referral rates for cancer that could not be explained by epidemiological differences. To reduce premature mortality, NICE recommends that general practitioners and practice nurses have rapid, direct access to endoscopy and imaging for patients with suspected cancer. By reducing the time to investigation and by providing a written, culturally sensitive explanation of why the referral has been made and its importance, NICE hopes that patients will have a better experience, care will be safer, and treatment more effective.\n\n【2】Taken together, these reports show the importance of primary care grounded in a strong tradition of clinical acumen and patient communication: precious skills that have been under-recognised in previous health service reforms. However, in a health system pressed to capacity on all sides, general practitioners and their staff will need appropriate support for the extended responsibilities and deeper integration of services that the changes entail. Above all, the new pathways must be shown to benefit patients, most of whom will not have cancer and may yet require specialist referral for differential diagnoses.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2016 Ian Hooton/Science Photo Library</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【3】### Publication history\n\n【4】Published: 09 July 2016\n\n【5】### Identification\n\n【6】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)31021-2</u>\n\n【7】### Copyright\n\n【8】© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The Texas-based neuroscientist and writer is in London to talk about his latest book, and over a hefty pasta lunch, he tells me that he invented this twist on agnosticism to mull over the different possibilities the universe holds. Eagleman's stance mirrors that of his childhood hero Carl Sagan, the astrophysicist, whose genius for popularising science Eagleman adored while growing up in New Mexico (his mother was a biology teacher and his father a physician). “Science lives too often in the confines of university walls”, says Eagleman, which is why his new book _Incognito_ deconstructs the neuroscience that underpins human behaviour by delving into the influence that our murky subconscious has on our free will. The snap decisions that seemingly pop fully formed out of our brain, he argues, actually arise from a complicated tug of war between our conscious and subconscious selves.\n\n【1】In Eagleman's own brain, his neuroscientist persona time-shares with his writer avatar. A literature undergraduate, Eagleman was seriously thinking about going to film school before he decided on a PhD in neuroscience at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston. His 2009 book, _Sum_ , a collection of fictional musings on what an afterlife might look like, is a sort of manifesto for Possibilianism. _Incognito_ is more down-to-earth, but Eagleman's prose remains poetic. When our brain interprets nerve signals to construct vision, he writes: “your brain is in the dark but your mind constructs light”.\n\n【2】All of this prodigious writing—his other books include _Why The Net Matters_ and _Wednesday Is Indigo Blue: Discovering the Brain of Synesthesia_ —happens at night, however. During the day, Eagleman runs a laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine that studies how our brain constructs reality, for example, by studying time perception. His team found that the reason it feels like time slows down before a terrifying event—a car crash, say—is because the brain seems to store memories of these moments more densely than usual. This neural trickery may also have implications for understanding fragmented cognition in schizophrenia and autism.\n\n【3】According to Eagleman, the future is bionic. His next book, _Livewired_ , looks at brain plasticity. “We should be building machines that are not hardware or software but ‘liveware’ that learns how to optimise things. Eyes and ears and fingertips are like ‘plug and play’ peripheral devices that evolution has figured out. Why not plug in infrared and ultraviolet vision, or stock market and weather data?” he asks. “Our perception of the world will be so different in 50 years; we've already seen \\[a revolution\\] with the Internet, but just wait until we see it with biology.”\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2011 Agapito Sanche</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【4】### Publication history\n\n【5】Published: 04 June 2011\n\n【6】### Identification\n\n【7】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(11)60797-6</u>\n\n【8】### Copyright\n\n【9】© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The pandemic has also had substantial indirect effects on levels of poverty and child malnutrition which appear to have fallen hardest on young girls. In some areas of civil conflict, the pandemic has increased the power of armed non-state groups that threaten girls' access to education and other public goods. Several of these groups, such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and Boko Haram in Nigeria, routinely threaten girls' education, at times even conducting acid attacks, kidnappings, and killings of young girls and their families. The pandemic has also destabilised the security situation in ways that have expanded the exploitation of young girls in the sex trade and as child soldiers, as was seen in Boko Haram's use of girls as young as 7 years as suicide bombers. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been far-reaching, but its impact on the health and wellbeing of young girls in areas of conflict and political instability deserves focused, urgent attention.\n删除4:<u>\n• View related content for this article</u>\n\n【2】删除9:<u>PHW was a contributor to the _Lancet_ Series on Women's and Children's Health in Conflict Settings.

Therapies directed at the eosinophilic phenotype reduce asthma exacerbations in adults, but few data are available in children and diverse populations. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms that underlie exacerbations either being prevented by, or persisting despite, immune-based therapies are not well understood. We aimed to determine whether mepolizumab, added to guidelines-based care, reduced the number of asthma exacerbations during a 52-week period compared with guidelines-based care alone.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial done at nine urban medical centres in the USA. Children and adolescents aged 6–17 years, who lived in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbourhoods and had exacerbation-prone asthma (defined as ≥two exacerbations in the previous year) and blood eosinophils of at least 150 cells per μL were randomly assigned 1:1 to mepolizumab (6–11 years: 40 mg; 12–17 years: 100 mg) or placebo injections once every 4 weeks, plus guideline-based care, for 52 weeks. Randomisation was done using a validated automated system. Participants, investigators, and the research staff who collected outcome measures remained masked to group assignments. The primary outcome was the number of asthma exacerbations that were treated with systemic corticosteroids during 52 weeks in the intention-to-treat population. The mechanisms of treatment response were assessed by study investigators using nasal transcriptomic modular analysis.

We screened 390 individuals, of whom 335 met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled. 290 met the randomisation criteria, were randomly assigned to mepolizumab (n=146) or placebo (n=144), and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. 248 completed the study. The mean number of asthma exacerbations within the 52-week study period was 0·96 (95% CI 0·78–1·17) with mepolizumab and 1·30 (1·08–1·57) with placebo (rate ratio 0·73; 0·56–0·96; p=0·027). Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 42 (29%) of 146 participants in the mepolizumab group versus 16 (11%) of 144 participants in the placebo group.

Jupille was later memorialised by a statue that can still be seen on the grounds of the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Meister's fate was more tragic; employed for years as gatekeeper at the Institute, when ordered by German soldiers in 1940 to open Louis Pasteur's crypt, he refused and committed suicide.\n\n【2】Some have observed that Jean-Baptiste and Josef were doubly fortunate in that both received and survived treatment by Pasteur, since at the time they were vaccinated animal tests were inconclusive and the nature of postexposure protection was not understood. The certainty of death in both cases would seem to justify premature experimentation. However, the research imperative, fuelled equally by a commitment to progress and the persistence of hope in desperate circumstances, can easily tip the balance away from the best interests of research participants toward the pursuit of knowledge for the sake of others. Maintaining this balance in paediatric research is the theme of _Ethics and Research with Children: A Case-Based Approach_ , in which contributors present cases to illustrate ethical challenges in paediatric research on healthy, at risk, and seriously ill children.\n\n【3】The book achieves its ambitious stated purpose: a text for students of medical and research ethics; a handbook for members of institutional review boards, paediatric investigators, pharmaceutical industry sponsors, and government officials; a resource for clinicians whose patients and their parents may ask about clinical trials; and a guide for parents and children thinking about taking part in clinical research. The cases with which each chapter begins are sufficiently lengthy to provide details and dialogue with the nuance and ambiguity one finds in actual practice, and the questions that follow the ethical analysis and discussion require deliberation of legitimate competing claims. A particular strength of this volume lies in its clarity about the inherent tension between the goals of clinical care and research, which often become blurred by investigators, research participants, their families, and institutional review boards.\n\n【4】Meister's mother took her son to Pasteur after being told by her physician that although Pasteur was a scientist and not a doctor he would know what to do. This illustrates the perception of research as “best hope” therapy, in that there was no treatment for rabies in 1885. “Last hope” trials refer to investigational therapies given to individuals who have received but not responded to standard treatments. In both types of trials the continuum between research and therapy may be attenuated, particularly if, unlike Josef's case, the treating physician is also the investigator. Thus, it is vital in all cases to understand and communicate distinctions between the goals of clinical care and research.\n\n【5】What should the investigator do, for example, when an individual who refuses conventional therapy for a rare disorder wishes to take part in a clinical trial of an investigational treatment designed to be given in conjunction with conventional therapy? In their chapter on eligibility criteria and personal treatment choice, contributors Benjamin Wilford and Fabio Candotti note that as a matter of clinical ethics, the patient and family's wishes would most likely be respected, even if such a decision contravened medical recommendations. In research, however, the primary objective is not to benefit individuals. While the compassionate use exception can be made for specific cases, revisions to the research protocol should only be made when “the justification \\[is\\] robust enough to be generalizable for all similar subjects”. Thus, the risk that parents may find acceptable for their child in the clinic can only be justified in research when it can be shown that other children in the study will not be asked to assume an unfavourable risk–benefit ratio.\n\n【6】Although the term consent is often applied to paediatric research, its use is imprecise. This book carefully considers parental permission and child assent, noting not only the need to go beyond the consent form in assuring that both have occurred, but also the importance of understanding the difference between legal authorisation and moral responsibility. Assume, for example, that the rabies vaccination was ready for human use but still investigational by today's standards when 16-year-old Jean-Baptiste was brought to Pasteur, and that the teenager adamantly refused the series of inoculations. Would his status as a minor at law be sufficient in and of itself to override his wishes? Would it make a difference if he had a chronic life-shortening illness as opposed to a life-threatening injury sustained in the course of an otherwise healthy life?\n\n【7】Myra Bluebond-Langner, Amy DeCicco, and Jean Belasco present a lengthy case and rich commentary to illustrate the insufficiency of regulatory definitions of informed consent to capture “the social roles and relations of parents and children”, and the “reality of an ethical relation of trust and reliance by the parents and the child upon the physician (whether investigator or not)”. Just as paediatric research generally must balance the best interests of research participants with the social benefit of science, so should the notion of assent find its equilibrium between those cases where children are wronged by exclusion from, or misrepresentation about, the research, and those in which they shoulder decisional burdens they should not be asked to carry.\n\n【8】The ethical challenges in paediatric research rest in part on our understanding that physiologically, developmentally, emotionally, and in myriad other ways children are not merely miniature adults. If, in an attempt to protect them from potential risks of human research, we develop treatments for children by extrapolating results from adult studies, we may actually impose harm. However, inclusion of children as research participants requires ethical considerations over and above those usually applied in the clinic or in the arena of research on adults. Moreover, as in all such research, no matter how carefully protocols are designed or how thoroughly preliminary tests are done, the question “who goes first?” is particularly sobering in paediatric studies.\n\n【9】In his 1970 essay _Philosophical Reflections on Experimenting with Human Subjects_ , Hans Jonas described the destructive trade-off that results from a notion of progress unmoored from human good: “Let us all remember that a slower progress in the conquest of disease would not threaten society … but that society would indeed be threatened by the erosion of those moral values whose loss, possibly caused by too ruthless a pursuit of scientific progress, would make its most dazzling triumphs not worth having.” By combining interesting cases, sensitive analysis, and thought-provoking questions the contributors to this book extend Jonas's legacy by reminding us that while childhood diseases will not be allayed without research, paediatric ethics depends, as Kodish reminds us, on “genuine respect for children and their best interests … even if it requires that such respect come at the expense of progress against childhood diseases”.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【10】### Publication history\n\n【11】Published: 28 May 2005\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66602-0</u>\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Users self-sample for chlamydia and gonorrhoea using a vulvovaginal swab (female users) or a urine sample (male), with or without pharyngeal or rectal swabs. At the time of audit SH:24 provided chlamydia home treatment in 66% SH:24 areas; 90% of users in these areas choose this option. 75% of users diagnosed with chlamydia receive home treatment; 25% are ineligible because of patient choice, unavailability of online treatment, or complex infection. We aimed to evaluate treatment outcomes in SH:24 users diagnosed with chlamydia.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Clinical records of users with a positive chlamydia result in January, 2018, were reviewed. Treatment was categorised as confirmed if home treatment was dispatched or if clinic attendance was confirmed by partner clinics via the shared clinical record. Individuals whose treatment was unconfirmed were sent a follow-up SMS requesting treatment status. Analysis was carried out in Microsoft Excel 2016.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of 7079 tests, 415 (5·9%, 95% CI 5·3–6·4), were chlamydia positive; 260 (62·7%) were in female users and 155 (37·3%) in male users. The median age of users with positive tests was 23 years (IQR 20–27). Treatment status was confirmed in 331 of 415 users (79·8%, 95% CI 75·5–83·5) and unconfirmed in 84 (20·2%, 16·5–24·5), but after follow-up SMS a further 30 users confirmed receiving treatment (361 \\[87·0%, 83·3–90·0\\]), and 54 (13·0%, 10·0–16·7) had treatment unconfirmed.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Receipt of treatment was confirmed in 87% of SH:24 users with chlamydia; this proportion is similar to results in genitourinary medicine settings but higher than those in primary care. A major advantage of the SH:24 model is rapid turnaround: 98% of users receive results within 72 h of the sample reaching the laboratory, and home treatment is received within 24 h. By comparison, results can take 1–2 weeks in traditional services. Rapid treatment reduces the infectious period and can decrease onward transmission. Our results also indicate that home chlamydia treatment is highly acceptable to service users. Follow-up SMS can support ascertainment of treatment status in users of an online service.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】None.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

First, the role of central heating seems to be over-interpreted by Yamato and Fujikawa. In fact, we just objectively presented the finding that “ _central heating may be a modifier for temperature-related AAD risk and burden_ ”, but not stated “ _central heating reduces risks of AAD_ ”. In the discussion section, we suggested potential protective effect of central heating as one of the possible explanations for the differential effects of TCN on AAD in heating and non-heating period. Although the differential effects might be not only due to central heating, but also related to other factors, the potentially critical role of indoor heating cannot be overlooked. Second, there seems to be some misunderstanding by Yamato and Fujikawa on the effect of TCN in winter. It is not like they stated that “ _negative TCN did not significantly increase relative AAD risk”_ , negative TCN in fact significantly increases relative AAD risk in the linear function 删除2:<u>(Table 1)</u>, and the exposure-response curve in Figure 4e also presents a marginally significant association in winter in cities without central heating. We acknowledge that in cities without central heating, the association between negative TCN and AAD is weaker in magnitude in winter than in other seasons. The lower risk observed in winter suggests that some personal protective procedures might also play a role in mitigating the harmful effect of negative TCN. Of note, although central heating is not provided in cities without central heating in China, personal protective procedures such as air conditioning and underfloor heating are widely used in winter in these cities.\n\n【2】As Yamato and Fujikawa mentioned, we found there is an association between increased AAD onset and negative TCN in cities with central heating. Exactly because the significant association in non-heating periods and the non-significant association in heating period, we assumed that central heating might modify the association between TCN and AAD onset. Nevertheless, we have never stated that the significant association occurred during non-heating period is an effect of central heating.\n\n【3】Another concern Yamato and Fujikawa raised is whether sudden drops in temperature are associated with increased AAD onset during non-heating seasons. The independent effects of negative TCN on cardiovascular diseases have been widely reported in previous studies. In our study, we also found negative TCN was independently associated with increased AAD onset in non-heating seasons after adjustment for ambient temperature and other potential confounders. In the discussion section, we speculate that the deleterious effects of sudden drops in temperature on AAD might be attributed to its impacts on the autonomic nervous, and subsequent effects on evaluated blood pressure. Yamato and Fujikawa suggest that it is unclear whether the negative association between temperature and blood pressure also applies during the non-heating season, particularly in summer. They cited a study by Kang et al. which reported that above a certain limit, increased temperature was associated with elevated blood pressure in warm season. However, a large number of previous studies consistently found that low temperature was associated with evaluated blood pressure, while very few studies have reported a positive association between temperature and blood pressure no matter in summer or not. Besides, the exposure-response curves in most previous studies showed that temperature decrease was associated with increased blood pressure even in high temperature ranges (e.g. higher than 25 °C), which are more likely to occur in summer. Moreover, in the study by Kang et al. the fact that increased temperature was associated with elevated blood pressure above a certain limit was observed only in a few climatic zones (temperature monsoon zone and temperature continental zone), while in subtropical zone, increased temperature was associated with decreased blood pressure across all temperature ranges. In our study, however, a large proportion of cases are located in subtropical zone, but not in temperature monsoon zone nor temperature continental zone. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that temperature drop might increase blood pressure in our study population regardless of whether in summer or not.\n\n【4】We agree with Yamato and Fujikawa that the summer increases in nighttime blood pressure might not be due to temperature. However, summer increases in nighttime blood pressure only present the circadian rhythms of the blood pressure, but not the association between temperature and blood pressure. Our focus is the association between temperature and blood pressure for a person in the same calendar year, month, day of week, and **same hour of day** , thus the circadian rhythms can be automatically controlled.\n\n【5】Therefore, we think TCN is independently associated with AAD onset but not just a confounding factor in non-heating period in the current study. Because TCN might also be a confounding factor in the association between temperature and AAD onset, we have controlled for TCN in the main analyses.\n\n【6】Declaration of interests\n------------------------\n\n【7】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【6】Declaration of interests", "content": "【0】Author response: effect of temperature changes between neighboring days on acute aortic dissection in non-heating periods\nWe are pleased to respond to Noriyuki Yamato and Tatsuya Fujikawa for their comments on our recent study about the effects of temperature changes between neighboring days (TCN) on acute aortic dissection (AAD) in non-heating periods.\n\n【1】Yamato and Fujikawa suggest that it is debatable whether central heating reduces risks of AAD induced by negative TCN, because they think negative TCN does not significantly increase relative AAD risk not only in heating periods in cities with central heating, but also in winter in cities without central heating.

We believe that they might have overstated their conclusions and suggest a more cautious interpretation of the study findings.\n\n【1】In agreement with other studies, Slater and colleagues report a significant reduction in observed pain scores in infants given sucrose compared with placebo. An intriguing observation was the absence of any difference in nociceptive pathway activity in infants who received sucrose or placebo. On this basis, Slater and colleagues conclude that oral sucrose is ineffective for pain relief in infants, and discourage its routine use in infants.\n\n【2】We disagree that the documented cortical measures are a reliable surrogate of perceived pain in infants. The WHO definition of pain refers to the subjective and emotional experience being of primary importance. Our access to infants' emotions is through their behaviour. The fact that “pain pathway nerves” are active during procedures in infants who are calm after sucrose is not unexpected. We disagree that a reduction in clinical observation scores should not be interpreted as pain relief.\n\n【3】Limitations of the study include the small sample size and that electrophysiological monitoring was limited in spatial and temporal domains. The effect of sucrose on neural pathways of the brain relevant to emotional responses to pain was not investigated. Whether a blunting of the behavioural response to pain reduces the adverse effects of nociceptive pathway activation remains to be determined.\n\n【4】Substantial media interest has been generated, questioning the safety of sucrose administration on the developing brain. There is no evidence that sucrose has long-term negative effects. We agree with Slater and colleagues that every effort should be made to minimise nociceptive pathway activation in infants.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2011 Science Photo Library</u>\n\n【5】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:39:34", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:39:47", "cost": 13.282}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:48", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:39:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:39:34"}

It was the first country to fund the GAVI Alliance, and is still the second largest donor after the Gates Foundation. Norway is publicly committed in a way that larger nations are not to the Millennium Development Goal of cutting child deaths (MDG4). Much of this is credited to the leadership of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, who has made the drive for improved global health central to Norway's foreign policy.\n\n【1】It is a personal crusade but, Stoltenberg says, pointing out that Norway is the seventh largest donor to the UN, it is one that comes naturally to Norwegians. “We feel we have a moral obligation, being a rich country, to do what we can do to fight poverty and work for a more just world”, he says. “There is very broad support for that in Norway. It is partly because we have a long tradition going back to the missionaries—it grows out of cultural and historical tradition in Norway. On the one hand, we have the Christian missionaries who collected money for poor people in other countries and, on the other hand, we have the Labour movement—the trade union movement. There is a strong and long tradition of national solidarity. Even when Norway was among the poorest countries in Europe, the Norwegian unions collected money to give aid to people in other countries.”\n\n【2】This background of Christian and socialist philanthropy is something Stoltenberg shares with his close ally on global health and development, the UK's Prime Minister Gordon Brown: “We work very closely with Gordon Brown. He is a champion—he is a world leader in putting development on the agenda. It is very stimulating to meet a world leader devoting so much time and energy to the question of global health and reducing poverty.” Naturally Stoltenberg, an economist, also shares with Brown an enthusiasm for new financial mechanisms designed to channel more aid to developing countries. “They get on very well. They collaborate closely”, says Tore Godal, executive secretary of GAVI from 1999 to 2004 and now Stoltenberg's special adviser. “They are both doers. If they engage, something gets done.”\n\n【3】Stoltenberg gives three reasons why MDG4 is important to him. First, as a father, he appreciates the simple, life-saving efficiency of immunisation. “In Norway as in all other rich countries, it is a normal thing to do to go to the health centre and immunise your child”, he says. “I have done that with my two children and it is a modern miracle. They have some injections or drops and then your child is protected against diseases.” Then, as an economist, he knows that keeping children well is cost-effective and benefits an entire nation. “I have seen how much you can achieve with very small amounts of money. Also reducing child mortality is important to promote economic growth and development. Healthy children participate in the development of a country and parents spend less time on nursing sick and dying children and more on creating income.” Third, he wants to support an issue where something tangible can be achieved. “As politicians we are addressing a lot of problems that are almost impossible to solve, but when it comes to child mortality it is very straightforward and easy to measure. You see the progress and you see the results. It is stimulating.”\n\n【4】Stoltenberg is also working to make the UN a more effective force for development and for attaining the MDGs. He was co-chair of a high level panel for the UN, which delivered recommendations on reform last year. Gareth Thomas, International Development Minister in the UK Government, says he thinks Stoltenberg is “a great force for good within the UN system. He is very committed to the UN and has been a real ally for Gordon Brown in helping the UN development system work better together to improve health in developing countries.”\n\n【5】Stoltenberg was academically brilliant: he got the best-ever degree in economics from the University of Oslo. He was born, in 1959, into a leading Norwegian political family—his father, Thorvald Stoltenberg, is a former Foreign Minister. By his mid-20s, Jens Stoltenberg was leader of the Workers Youth League. Despite this background, he decided to leave politics and joined the central bureau of statistics as a researcher in 1989. But another famous Norwegian politician dedicated to global health, Gro Harlem Brundtland, who later became head of WHO, persuaded him to join her government in 1990 as state secretary at the Ministry of the Environment. He served as Minister of Trade and then Minister of Finance before becoming Prime Minister himself in 2000. His party lost badly at the polls in 2001, but came back in 2005 to form a coalition government. Stoltenberg became Prime Minister for the second time on Oct 17, 2005.\n\n【6】Stoltenberg says his interest in improving global child health began in 2000. He was influenced by three people: Brundtland, his chief of staff Jonas Gahr Støre, who served with Brundtland at WHO, and Godal, who also worked closely with Brundtland at WHO before moving to GAVI. “I think that he has been extraordinary in being able to build up such a commitment in relation to GAVI and now in relation to MDG4 and 5 and putting so much in the way of resources behind it from the government”, says Godal. Moreover, he has carried the Norwegian people with him, adds Godal. “People spontaneously clap when he speaks about getting children in the third world vaccinated. People see it not as politics but as a kind of cause. It is something close to his heart.”\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【7】### Publication history\n\n【8】Published: 22 September 2007\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61463-9</u>\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We tested whether the QOF was associated with reduced population mortality.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We used population-level mortality statistics between 1994 and 2010 for the UK and other high-income countries that were not exposed to pay-for-performance. The primary outcome was age-adjusted and sex-adjusted mortality per 100 000 people for a composite outcome of chronic disorders that were targeted by the QOF. Secondary outcomes were age-adjusted and sex-adjusted mortality for ischaemic heart disease, cancer, and a composite of all non-targeted conditions. For each study outcome, we created a so-called synthetic UK as a weighted combination of comparison countries. We then estimated difference-in-differences models to test whether mortality fell more in the UK than in the synthetic UK after the QOF.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Introduction of the QOF was not significantly associated with changes in population mortality for the composite outcome (−3·68 per 100 000 population \\[95% CI −8·16 to 0·80\\]; p=0·107), ischaemic heart disease (−2·21 per 100 000 \\[–6·86 to 2·44\\]; p=0·357), cancer (0·28 per 100 000 \\[–0·99 to 1·55\\]; p=0·679), or all non-targeted conditions (11·60 per 100 000 \\[–3·91 to 27·11\\]; p=0·143).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Although we noted small mortality reductions for a composite outcome of targeted disorders, the QOF was not associated with significant changes in mortality. Our findings have implications for the probable effects of similar programmes on population health outcomes. The relation between incentives and mortality needs to be assessed in specific disease domains.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】None.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

Using data from US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) between 1988 and 2014, we examined the cardiovascular and renal burdens in adults with prediabetes over time and compared patterns with other glycaemic status groups.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We analysed cross-sectional survey data from non-pregnant adults aged 20 years and older from the NHANES survey periods 1988–94, 1999–2004, 2005–10, and 2011–14. We defined diagnosed diabetes as patients' self-report that they had been previously diagnosed by a physician or health professional; among those with no self-reported diabetes, prediabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentration of 100–125 mg/dL (5·6–6·9 mmol/L) or an HbA 1c of 5·7–6·4% (39–47 mmol/mol); undiagnosed diabetes as an FPG of 126 mg/dL (7·0 mmol/L) or higher or an HbA 1c of 6·5% (48 mmol/mol) or higher; and normal glycaemic status as an FPG of less than 100 mg/dL (5·6 mmol/L) and an HbA 1c of less than 5·7% (39 mmol/mol). We repeated the analyses using varying definitions of prediabetes (FPG 110–125 mg/dL \\[6·1–6·9 mmol/L\\] or HbA 1c 5·7–6·4% \\[39–47 mmol/mol\\], FPG 110–125 mg/dL \\[6·1–6·9 mmol/L\\] or HbA 1c 6·0–6·4% \\[42–47 mmol/mol\\], and FPG 100–125 mg/dL \\[5·6–6·9 mmol/L\\] and HbA 1c 5·7–6·4% \\[39–47 mmol/mol\\]). For each group over time, we estimated the prevalences of hypertension and dyslipidaemia; and among individuals with those conditions, we estimated the proportions who had been treated and who were achieving care goals. By glycaemic group, we estimated those who were current, former, and never smokers; mean 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease (using estimators from the Framingham Heart Study, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), and the ACC/AHA ASCVD guidelines); albuminuria (median and albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥30 mg/g), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR; mean and <60 mL/min per 1·73m 2 ); and prevalence of myocardial infarction and stroke. For all estimates, we calculated predicted changes between 1988–94 and 2011–14 using logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and race or ethnic group.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We obtained data for 27 971 eligible individuals. In 2011–14, in the population of adults with prediabetes, 36·6% (95% CI 32·8–40·5) had hypertension, 51·2% (47·0–55·3) had dyslipidaemia, 24·3% (21·7–27·3) smoked; 7·7% (6·8–8·8) had albuminuria; 4·6% (3·7–5·9) had reduced eGFR; and 10-year cardiovascular event risk ranged from 5% to 7%. From 1988–94 to 2011–14, adults with prediabetes showed significant increases in hypertension (+9·7 percentage points \\[95% CI 5·4–14·0\\]); no change in dyslipidaemia; decreases in smoking (−6·4 percentage points \\[–10·7 to −2·1\\]); increased use of treatment to lower blood pressure (54·2% \\[49·0–59·3\\] to 81·4% \\[76·7–85·3\\], +27·2 percentage points \\[20·5–33·8\\] p<0·0001) and to reduce lipids (6·6% to 40·2%, +33·6 percentage points \\[30·2–37·0\\], p<0·0001); and increased goal achievements for blood pressure (25·8% to 62·0%, +36·2 percentage points \\[30·7–41·8\\], p<0·0001) and lipids (1·0% to 32·8%, +31·8 percentage points \\[29·1–34·4, p<0·0001\\]). People with prediabetes also showed decreases in cardiovascular risk (ASCVD −1·9 percentage points \\[–2·5 to −1·3\\] to UKPDS −2·7 \\[–3·5 to −1·9\\], p<0·0001); but no change in prevalence of albuminuria, reduced eGFR, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Prevalence and patterns were consistent across all prediabetes definitions examined. Compared with adults with prediabetes, adults with diagnosed diabetes showed much larger improvements in cardiovascular and renal risk treatments, apart from smoking, which did not decline.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Over 25 years, cardiovascular and renal risks and disease have become highly prevalent in adults with prediabetes, irrespective of the definitions used. Identification of people with prediabetes might increase the opportunity for cardiovascular and renal risk reduction.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】None.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

The management of COVID-19 is now downgraded from Class A to Class B in accordance with the country's law on infectious diseases prevention and treatment. There is no more centralised quarantine, close contact tracing, or mass nucleic acid testing. China now enters a new phase of the COVID-19 response.\n\n【1】The end of the zero-COVID-19 policy reminds us to reflect on its gains and losses. Beyond all doubts, the dynamic zero-COVID-19 policy has protected the most vulnerable populations from five global COVID-19 waves and avoided widespread infections with the original strain and the delta variant. Its border closure policy blocked, or at least postponed, the entry of variants from abroad. It also won precious time for the whole society to be better prepared for high infection rates in the population. Nevertheless, the zero-COVID-19 policy also had some disadvantages: a low number of infections among the population resulted in a low level of natural immunity compared with other countries; a lack of urgency to get vaccinated fostered vaccine hesitancy; stringent border measures halted international cooperation; policies such as frequent mass testing and quarantine treatment have disrupted people's life and work, as well as increased the financial burden on government; and other diseases have been neglected due to an excessive focus on COVID-19. Moreover, the abrupt lockdowns in several cities last year in response to outbreaks of the omicron variant exposed the adverse effects of the stringent zero-COVID-19 policy, such as family separations, food supply shortages, and impaired access to medical care.\n\n【2】In this new phase of the pandemic, China is facing unprecedented challenges, as well as opportunities for strengthening its public health systems. The domestic impact of the shift from the strict policy is immediate—people are going through an abrupt outbreak of COVID-19 before life returns to normal. Despite the small number of reported cases, there are signs of a sharp rise in recent infections nationwide and the actual number could be much larger than the official data due to the change in testing requirements. According to a recent preprint , the infection incidence might have already peaked in Beijing on Dec 11, 2022. A model developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projects over 300,000 deaths in China in the coming months, and more than a million over the course of 2023 after the policy shift. In fact, hospitals are already overwhelmed due to the increased numbers of people with fever attending clinics, and anti-fever drugs were out of stock for weeks. Large numbers of medical staff are infected while still going to work sick, staying on the frontline, and coping with the surge in patients with fever. Long-term, China will face looming challenges such as the health burden of post-COVID-19 condition (also known as long COVID).\n\n【3】Hopefully, the following efforts might help to address these challenges. A modelling study posted on medRxiv suggests the combined effect of vaccination (≥85% coverage of the fourth dose as a booster) and antiviral treatment (≥60% coverage) could substantially reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality as China transitions from dynamic-zero to normality. China is on the way to achieve these targets. The government is speeding up the booster vaccinations, especially for the older population. It has also started administering a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose. Antiviral drugs are now allocated at hospitals and primary medical care centres in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, with the daily output increased by more than four times in late December compared with early December. China has always wanted to strengthen its primary health-care system. Now, by promoting a tiered diagnosis and treatment system, expanding internet-based medical services, and allocating medical resources to the primary health-care centres, there is a good opportunity to let people get used to and build trust in primary health-care systems such as community hospitals and online medical services, instead of the over-reliance on top-grade hospitals.\n\n【4】From a global perspective, China's reopening has been welcome, but has also led to some concerns. Several countries are setting inbound travel restrictions targeting only Chinese travellers, owing to concerns about the sufficiency and adequacy of Chinese data on COVID-19 infections. China can do better in co-operating with the global community to overcome the pandemic by sharing information in a more timely, open, and transparent manner. Clinical data on the current COVID-19 situation, medical treatment, and vaccination, as well as research findings of the transmissibility, severity, vaccine escape of variants and antiviral resistance, and vaccine effectiveness should be made available. Data reporting should also be as consistent as possible, and in this respect, China is encouraged to change its COVID-19 death definition in line with the WHO recommendation to accurately calculate excess deaths. With the end of the zero-COVID-19 policy in China, nationwide coordination is more important than ever amid the continuing global fight against the pandemic.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【5】### Publication history\n\n【6】Published: January 2023\n\n【7】### Identification\n\n【8】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanwpc.2023.100702</u>\n\n【9】### Copyright\n\n【10】© 2023 The Author(s).

This gap is notable in the current UK policy context defined by over a decade of austerity, rising income insecurity, and an increase in health inequalities. Underpinned by theories related to participatory, deliberative, and economic democracy, particularly those concerned with democratic innovations, this scoping Review investigates how, when, and where participatory and deliberative processes have been used to influence socioeconomic policy over the past 15 years in the UK and how this influence might inform any so-called democratic rejuvenation moving forward.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This Review, presenting the interim findings, is structured in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute's guidance for conducting systematic scoping reviews and applies the PRIMSA-Scoping Review checklist. Key search terms included “public policy”, “economic policy”, “income insecurity”, “poverty”, “public participation” “decision-making”, and “democratic innovation”. Searches were conducted in EconLit, SOC Index, Sociological Abstracts, and MedLine, as well as grey literature sources, including BASE database, government, third sector, and thinktank websites for articles related to participatory and deliberative processes (informed by theories of associative and direct democracy as well as Fung's Democracy Cube of public participation) in socioeconomic policy making in the UK, in English, from January, 2007, until June, 2022. A combined framework of democratic goods and typology of interventions to tackle health inequalities were applied for analysis.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】14 articles were included in the final review (three peer-reviewed and 11 grey literature) with a concentration of results in Scotland (six articles) and in local government (five articles). Interim findings suggest a multiplicity of activities exist under the banner of participatory and deliberative processes; however, there are few, if any, examples that influence typically closed macro socioeconomic policy making and instead disperse participatory decision-making across less empowered spaces.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Ambitions for a democratic rejuvenation to tackle the upstream socioeconomic drivers of health inequalities require critical reflection on the locus of decision-making power, as well as the fractured and challenging nature of participatory policy making.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】This study is part of a PhD studentship with the Medical Research Council and Chief Scientist Office, Social and Public Health Sciences Research Unit at the University of Glasgow.

Wolf then explores how this nerve might affect not just orgasm but a wider sense of wellbeing and creativity. Ranging over scientific research, literary texts, and healing therapies, Wolf argues that sexually intimidating behaviour towards women, as well as bad sex, inhibit the chemicals (she singles out dopamine) that trigger pleasure and relaxation, profoundly affecting the complex neurogenital network that is our sexual apparatus.\n\n【1】Plenty of commentators have criticised Wolf's simplifications. One neurotransmitter rarely has one effect, and while stress can affect the function of the vagina, it can also affect any other organ. Why, then, Wolf's uncritical focus on the supposed neuroscience of the vagina? Wolf aims, I think, to address wider questions about female sexuality. She notes the semantic confusion in general discourse over female genitalia and underlines the silence and shame that exists in some arenas around both female genitalia and female sexual agency. Her aim throughout is to underscore that misogyny, aggression, and violence can have profound effects: on the body, on the mind, on feelings of entitlement to pleasure.\n\n【2】These are all pressing issues, ones it can still be difficult to voice and have heard. And Wolf's insistence on neuroscience as a vital language for speaking about them in fact reveals this very difficulty. The oversimplified scientific material in Wolf's book figures rhetorically to suggest that we have new and important scientific data to bolster the case against misogyny—the implicit premise being that we need scientific data to do this work. In suggesting this, Wolf reflects what is in fact a sort of enthralment to the apparently objective and definitive nature of scientific techniques of visualisation such as neuroimaging. Although most scientists are cautious not to extrapolate inappropriately from individual pieces of research, and also underscore the difference between a biological factor (eg, a neurotransmitter) affecting and one determining a phenomenon (eg, pleasure), nonetheless many commentators suggest that phenomena—whether pleasure, creativity, or disease—cannot be taken wholly seriously until a technique of visualisation proves to us that they are real. And this tendency primes a great many to read more than is warranted into scientific studies, out of a fear that, without this visual translation, a phenomenon is just speculative.\n\n【3】Good scientific research into sexual function and pleasure—research that avoids assuming societal norms about gender roles—is important. But it is problematic to believe that we need scientific data to ground all questions of intensely political, ethical, and social importance, such as whether misogyny and violence are acceptable. Wolf's book appears to embrace neuroscientific data out of a feeling that, finally, we have concrete proof of why misogyny is harmful. But it would still be ethically urgent to understand that women's pleasure is important, that sex should be attuned to individual preferences, that aggression towards women is unacceptable, irrespective of whether any scientific data helped us to visualise misogyny's harms. The fact that research might show us how violence has physical effects on the body and brain shouldn't be why we urge non-violence and respect towards women.\n\n【4】Wolf is also deeply uncritical about the terminology that currently surrounds sex, in particular, sexual dysfunction and sex “addiction”. She blithely reiterates views of female sexuality as intensely emotional and complex, and male sexuality as straightforwardly mechanical: a widespread cultural script—artfully invoked by pharmaceutical companies that market drugs for sexual problems—characterised by clunky generalisations that are problematic. Moreover, Wolf uncritically cites statistics about the prevalence of “female sexual dysfunction” that have previously been called into question by such writers as Ray Moynihan and Barbara Mintzes in their book _Sex, Lies, and Pharmaceuticals: How Drug Companies Plan to Profit from Female Sexual Dysfunction_ . And her lack of critical engagement with ideas about gender and what masculinity and femininity amount to, results in a text that is uncomfortably prescriptive about the kinds of sex and relationships women should have. It is important not to recoil from exploring—in as many ways as possible—the complexities of sexual pleasure and sexual distress in women. All the more so, given that for women a sense of entitlement to pleasure is often in question, precisely because of the aggression to which they are all too frequently subject. I applaud Wolf in addressing these issues; it's her methods that are the problem.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【5】Katherine Angel is the author of _Unmastered: A Book On Desire, Most Difficult To Tell_ (Penguin/Allen Lane, 2012).\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: 20 April 2013\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60872-7</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Brian Owens reports.\n\n【1】Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institutes of Health's (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has won the 2016 Global Health Award from Canada's Gairdner Foundation for his work on HIV/AIDS.\n\n【2】Fauci is “one of the towering figures in understanding the natural history of HIV”, John Dirks, president of the Gairdner Foundation, tells _The Lancet_ . Fauci is being given the award for his important fundamental research on the virus, as well as his leadership of NIAID over the past three decades where he contributed to the development of new treatments, and worked on combating AIDS around the world, especially in Africa. “Without him, we would not have made the overwhelming progress that we have made”, says Dirks.\n\n【3】Fauci was one of the first scientists to begin studying AIDS. He was studying how the immune system is regulated when the first American cases surfaced in 1981, and immediately changed the direction of his research to focus on the new disease. “I foresaw that even though we didn't know what the virus was, we were just seeing the tip of the iceberg”, says Fauci. “I had an ominous feeling it would explode into something huge for global health.”\n\n【4】Fauci took on the role of Director of NIAID in 1984 largely so he could expand the institute's efforts on AIDS, at a time when the US Government was being criticised for ignoring the epidemic. But he maintained his own laboratory and remains active in research. One of his most important research contributions was the discovery that even when the disease seemed to be clinically latent, the virus was still active in the lymph nodes and continued to prey on the immune system. “That discovery helped develop the framework for how treatment must take place”, says Dirks. “That it must be vigorous and long term.”\n\n【5】It was through his leadership of NIAID that many of today's drugs to treat HIV/AIDS were developed. He established the HIV/AIDS programme at the institute and led the largest research effort on the disease in the world, which succeeded in turning around the AIDS epidemic through the discovery of drugs and treatments that could suppress the virus to the point where people could live normal lives. “All of the clinical trials that were done in collaboration with industry have NIAID fingerprints on them”, says Fauci.\n\n【6】The treatments that Fauci's NIAID helped develop have revolutionised the way that HIV/AIDS is dealt with over the past few decades. Dirks recalls working in Vancouver when the HIV epidemic was gripping the west coast in the 1980s and 1990s, with wards full of terminally ill patients with AIDS, whereas now very few people are admitted to hospital as inpatients, instead mostly attending clinics as chronic patients. “The whole clinical picture is different today”, says Dirks. “He turned AIDS, in most places, into a chronic disease.”\n\n【7】But perhaps the part of his work that had the biggest impact on the world was his leadership of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), launched by President George W Bush in 2003. Fauci describes the programme, which focuses on preventing and treating HIV in southern Africa, as “probably the most important public health endeavour for a single disease in history”, and says it has been credited with saving more than 7 million lives. In addition, says Dirks, PEPFAR has provided mentorship and training to build scientific capacity in Africa in immunology and infectious diseases.\n\n【8】Although Fauci has won many accolades for his work on HIV/AIDS, including a US Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Lasker Award, he says the Gairdner Award is particularly meaningful to him because of its global focus. “I have a passion for global health that has driven my research efforts”, Fauci says. “Infectious disease knows no boundaries.”\n\n【9】“Even though he may work from a perch in the NIH in the US, there is a full global dimension to everything he has done”, agrees Dirks.\n\n【10】HIV research is also the focus of another of the Gairdner Foundation's awards this year. The Canada Gairdner Wightman Award is being given to Frank Plummer, a microbiologist at the University of Manitoba and former scientific director of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, for his research on HIV transmission in Africa and his work at NML on influenza, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Dirks says the overlap between the two awards is just a coincidence, but there are parallels between the two winners. “Plummer's leadership at NML has been substantive, in that sense he is much like Fauci”, says Dirks. “They happen to be very complementary.”\n\n【11】Anthony Fauci\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2016 Gairdner Foundation</u>\n\n【12】Frank Plummer\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2016 Katia Pershin</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【13】### Publication history\n\n【14】Published: March 23, 2016\n\n【15】### Identification\n\n【16】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30050-2</u>\n\n【17】### Copyright\n\n【18】© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional surveillance of its precursor condition (Barrett's oesophagus) entails endoscopy every 2 years, but it still misses many cancers. Thus, identifying biomarkers to detect this cancer at an early stage is of paramount importance. The _PIGA_ gene mutation assay is a novel way of detecting DNA damage. With this assay, we indirectly investigated mutations to the _PIGA_ gene as a biomarker for cancer development.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Blood-based cell lines were exposed to physiological doses of refluxate constituents (mimicking the natural exposure to these noxious chemicals) and frequency of _PIGA_ mutants was measured. Subsequent ex-vivo analysis of blood was undertaken in patients attending endoscopy with symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. _PIGA_ analysis of erythrocytes and leucocytes was performed and results correlated with histopathological analysis of oesophageal biopsy samples and detailed lifestyle records.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】In-vitro investigations confirmed the carcinogenicity of bile salts to blood-based cell lines (103 mutants per 10 6 cells in bile-treated cells _vs_ 13·3 mutants per 10 6 in controls; p=0·02). In the ex-vivo erythrocyte analysis of 121 patients with reflux symptoms, confounding variables such as smoking and increasing age were associated with higher frequencies of the _PIGA_ mutation. The mutant frequency was almost four times higher in 23 patients with oesophageal cancer than in 42 healthy controls (58 mutants per 10 6 _vs_ 13 mutants per 10 6 ; p=0·002), and more than twice as high as those with non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus (n=43, mutant frequency 22 mutants per 10 6 ; p=0·033). Patients on chemotherapy (n=8) had a mutant frequency over 24 times higher than that in healthy controls (180 mutants per 10 6 , p<0·0001). Lymphocytes of patients with high-grade dysplasia and oesophageal adenocarcinoma were almost three times more sensitive to mutation after challenge with 300 μM of the bile salt deoxycholic acid than low-risk patients (ie, those with reflux and those with non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus) (p=0·002).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The application of this simple, blood-based assay in people with gastro-oesophageal reflux demonstrated greater levels of DNA damage in patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma than in patients with Barrett's oesophagus or reflux alone. The _PIGA_ gene mutation assay has the potential to be a biomonitoring tool in both Barrett's oesophagus and other premalignant conditions.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University R&D fund, Tenovus.\n\n【10】Poster 62\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【11】HH devised the project, undertook sample acquisition, sample analysis, statistical analysis, and interpretation.

The standard of care is 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab, but the optimum duration of treatment is unknown. We compared 2 years of treatment with trastuzumab with 1 year of treatment, and updated the comparison of 1 year of trastuzumab versus observation at a median follow-up of 8 years, for patients enrolled in the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in 5102 patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. The comparison of 2 years versus 1 year of trastuzumab treatment involved a landmark analysis of 3105 patients who were disease-free 12 months after randomisation to one of the trastuzumab groups, and was planned after observing at least 725 disease-free survival events.

However, conclusive data are lacking for the efficacy and safety of colchicine for treatment of multiple recurrences of pericarditis.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We did this multicentre, double-blind trial at four general hospitals in northern Italy. Adult patients with multiple recurrences of pericarditis (≥two) were randomly assigned (1:1) to placebo or colchicine (0·5 mg twice daily for 6 months for patients weighing more than 70 kg or 0·5 mg once daily for patients weighing 70 kg or less) in addition to conventional anti-inflammatory treatment with aspirin, ibuprofen, or indometacin.

Adverse effects and discontinuation of study drug occurred in much the same proportions in each group. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal intolerance (nine patients in the colchicine group vs nine in the placebo group) and hepatotoxicity (three vs one). No serious adverse events were reported.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Colchicine added to conventional anti-inflammatory treatment significantly reduced the rate of subsequent recurrences of pericarditis in patients with multiple recurrences. Taken together with results from other randomised controlled trials, these findings suggest that colchicine should be probably regarded as a first-line treatment for either acute or recurrent pericarditis in the absence of contraindications or specific indications.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Azienda Sanitaria 3 of Torino (now ASLTO2).\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

It is important to add discussion on the extent to which high rates of drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis, now emerging in many resource-poor regions of the world, are jeopardising pre-existing tuberculosis control measures. If we are to have any hope of stemming the global pandemic, emphasis needs to be placed on the freeing up of resources globally to address drug resistance, and to bring treatment options to infected patients.\n\n【2】In our experience in Uzbekistan, drug-resistant forms of the disease have a major effect on our ability to run an effective DOTS programme, as noted in other parts of the former Soviet Union. In areas where the pool of patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis comprises more than a quarter of all smear-positive patients, a DOTS programme alone is unlikely to succeed in reaching the WHO target of 85% in terms of treatment success. Frieden and colleagues note that DOTS programmes in the Russian Federation are only reaching a 68% cure rate. Failure to reach this target will not result in the necessary decline in tuberculosis incidence, thus prolonging epidemics.\n\n【3】In this context, to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis effectively, and hence have any hope of stemming the ongoing tuberculosis epidemic, resources need to be made available to ensure that patients with multidrug-resistant disease are detected and provided with alternative treatment regimens. Unfortunately, routine drug susceptibility testing, specialist laboratory services, complicated drug regimens, and treatment centres are not likely to be an affordable option for the resource-poor countries with the bulk of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the foreseeable future. Owing to the lack of laboratory infrastructure in Uzbekistan, and central Asia as a whole, Médecins Sans Frontieres had to fly out all sputum samples to a laboratory in Germany just to gauge the extent of the problem in this region. The difficulties and costs involved in doing such a survey might well mask the extent of the drug-resistance problem globally.\n\n【4】In response to the high level of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in Uzbekistan, Médecins Sans Frontieres is now implementing a pilot DOTS-Plus programme under the auspices of WHO's Green Light Committee. This pilot programme aims to demonstrate the feasibility of DOTS-Plus in this setting, given adequate resources and technical support. The pilot programme will treat an initial cohort of 100 patients over 3 years. The pilot programme includes the establishment of a specialist laboratory capable of drug susceptibility testing and a large investment in training of local staff.\n\n【5】However, the DOTS-Plus pilot programme will cover only about 100 patients of the 800 who would be diagnosed with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis every year if drug susceptibility testing was available for all presenting tuberculosis patients. Pilot programmes are therefore just a start. The scale of the problem in the rest of Uzbekistan, and the rest of the former Soviet Union, can only be imagined.\n\n【6】In such settings, in which the presence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis is a major barrier to tuberculosis control, and in which local resources do not permit the provision of essential services such as adequate laboratory and treatment facilities, international resources must be mobilised to offer these patients a treatment option where a treatment option exists.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/02 18:09:26", "endTime": "2024/09/02 18:12:11", "cost": 165.201}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:47", "update_time": "2024-09-02 02:12:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 02:09:26"}

This condition is experienced by 3·7% of children and up to 9·2% of adults in the world, with a higher prevalence in certain populations, such as people who have Williams' syndrome or autism spectrum disorders. Hyperacusis-associated problems are many, including fear, pain, avoidance behaviours, and impairments to quality of life, such as reduced ability to work. For children with hyperacusis, the classroom can be particularly challenging, and strategies are needed to ensure their wellbeing and educational needs are met. Richard S Tyler and colleagues proposed a framework for categorising hyperacusis according to features of the experience, suggesting that loudness, annoyance, fear, and pain are important defining characteristics. For many, hyperacusis is also isolating, with thousands turning to Facebook and other social media for information and support. Clinical assessment of hyperacusis includes sound-based tolerance tests and questionnaires to measure the effect it has on an individual's life. Treatment approaches include sound and cognitive behaviour therapies, although no formal clinical practice guidance currently exists.\n\n【1】The Hyperacusis Priority Setting Partnership (PSP) was established to identify the questions about hyperacusis that are the most important to health-care professionals and people with lived experience of hyperacusis (patients and their parents). The PSP included people with lived experience of hyperacusis; health-care professionals who specialise in clinical and cognitive psychology, audiology, and otolaryngology; researchers; and representatives from organisations involved in supporting people with hyperacusis, funding research, and communicating science.\n\n【2】Using James Lind Alliance methods, the PSP started with two surveys. In the first, 312 respondents worldwide submitted 2370 research questions, termed uncertainties. Of these respondents, 179 were people with lived experience and 86 were health-care professionals, of whom one also had hyperacusis. 38 respondents were either parents, carers, family members, friends, or teachers. Submitted questions were verified as unanswered in the research literature. Questions were processed and narrowed down to 85, which were listed in a second survey. In the second survey, 327 participants voted for their individual priorities. From the 28 questions that received the most representative votes, ten research priorities were agreed upon during the final workshop that involved 21 participants, held July, 2018, in Nottingham, UK 删除2:<u>( panel )</u>. The top ten research priorities for hyperacusis focus on treatment, cause, mechanism, prevalence, and health-care provider knowledge and training. These priorities provide an important platform for researchers, funding bodies, and the health-care sector to ensure that future research focuses on questions that are important to health-care practitioners and people with lived experience of hyperacusis.\n\n【3】Panel\n\n【4】**Top ten research priorities for hyperacusis**\n\n【5】*   1\n\n【6】    What is the most effective treatment approach for hyperacusis in children?\n\n【7】*   2\n\n【8】    What is the prevalence of hyperacusis in a general population and other specific populations (eg, people with autism, mental health issues, learning disabilities, or hearing loss)?\n\n【9】*   3\n\n【10】    Are there different meaningful types of hyperacusis?\n\n【11】*   4\n\n【12】    What is the essential knowledge and training required for health professionals to appropriately refer or effectively manage hyperacusis?\n\n【13】*   5\n\n【14】    Which treatment approaches are most effective for different types or severities of hyperacusis?\n\n【15】*   6\n\n【16】    Is hyperacusis due to physical or psychological issues or is it a combination of both?\n\n【17】*   7\n\n【18】    Which psychological therapy (eg, counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, or mindfulness) is most effective for hyperacusis?\n\n【19】*   8\n\n【20】    What management approach for hyperacusis is most effective for adults and children with autism?\n\n【21】*   9\n\n【22】    What is the best way of using sound in therapy for hyperacusis?\n\n【23】*   10\n\n【24】    Which self-help interventions are effective for hyperacusis?\n\n【25】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.

John Zarocostas reports from Geneva.\n\n【1】“It is time for countries to transition from emergency mode to managing COVID-19 alongside other infectious diseases”, declared WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on May 5, 2023, shortly after he had accepted the advice of the Emergency Committee to end the COVID-19 public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Tedros had declared COVID-19 a PHEIC on Jan 30, 2020.\n\n【2】The decision to end the emergency was welcomed by global health leaders. “I think it was a very smart move. Tedros was right to end the PHEIC. No disease should be in a chronic state of emergency that goes on for years and years, because that dilutes the power of calling an emergency in the first place. Its saps public trust in governments or WHO in calling an emergency”, Lawrence Gostin, Professor of Global Health Law at Georgetown University (Washington, DC, USA), told _The Lancet_ . “The world has moved on from COVID-19, and so, there would have been social and political costs for WHO if it dragged the COVID PHEIC out too long.” With the PHEIC now over, what happens next?\n\n【3】When the PHEIC was declared in 2020, recommendations were included to support countries with weaker health systems; accelerate the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; review preparedness plans; identify gaps and evaluate the resources needed to identify, isolate, and care for people with COVID-19; and prevent transmission. Foremost, the PHEIC also required enhanced surveillance by WHO members and, as stipulated by the International Health Regulations (IHR), to report to WHO the outbreak and the evolution of the disease in their countries. Actions undertaken also included the procurement and distribution of scarce supplies of personal protective equipment, COVID-19 test kits, vaccines, medicines, and other medical equipment.\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2023 Long Visual Press/Getty Images</u>\n\n【4】WHO says that it is switching its focus towards the management of the disease as an established and ongoing health issue, and it has unveiled a roadmap to integrate COVID-19 surveillance and response activities into routine health programmes. On May 5, WHO said that state parties to the IHR should maintain reporting of mortality and morbidity data, as well as variant surveillance information to WHO.\n\n【5】The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), first established in April, 2020, to accelerate the development and production of, and equitable access to, COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines, will continue. COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX)—the vaccines pillar of ACT-A that has so far delivered almost 2 billion vaccine doses to 146 countries—will continue to provide funded doses and delivery support throughout 2023, in line with demand. A spokesperson of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance told _The Lancet_ that COVAX does not expect any changes in the prices it pays for its procured doses for 2023, which are fixed as per the Advance Purchase Agreement contract.\n\n【6】Partners in ACT-A are evaluating ways to ensure countries have access to COVID-19 tools until the end of 2025, and to maintain the ability to relaunch and collaborate on a large scale if COVID-19 surges again.\n\n【7】The main thing, as one senior WHO health diplomat says, “is not to make the error of shutting down quickly”. Some of the partners, including The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and UNICEF have resources, or long-term contracts in place, to continue until the end of 2025.\n\n【8】As for the role of ACT-A in the longer term, some experts are of the view that there is no need to set up a new mechanism similar to the ACT-A for pandemic preparedness. Mohga Kamal-Yanni, Policy Co-Lead for the People's Vaccine Alliance, told _The Lancet_ : “the moral of the story is that you don’t need a new body. Rather, the changes that need to happen to ensure equitable assess are the governments themselves have to commit to sharing doses of vaccines, medicines, or whatever.”\n\n【9】The WHO Director-General will continue to authorise the use of the emergency use listing (EUL) procedure, a risk-based mechanism for assessing and listing unlicensed vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics with the aim of expediting the availability of these products to people affected by a public health emergency. The procedure has been often used during the pandemic, for example to make available mRNA vaccines and the first two in-vitro diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2. The termination of PHEIC, WHO officials said, should not affect access to vaccines and diagnostics that have already received an EUL, and state parties will be able to access these vaccines and diagnostics, provided the manufacturers continue production.\n\n【10】In terms of vaccination policy, WHO has recommended that countries integrate COVID-19 vaccination into other immunisation programmes and maintain efforts to increase COVID-19 vaccination coverage for all people in the high-priority groups.\n\n【11】Tedros has cautioned that the worst thing any country could do now is to use the news of the end of PHEIC “as a reason to let down its guard, to dismantle the systems it has built”. He has decided for the first time to use a provision of the IHR to develop long-term standing recommendations for countries on how to manage COVID-19. Didier Houssin, Chair of the Emergency Committee, told a news conference on May 5, that standing recommendations will allow “to better integrate risk assessment and risk management concerning COVID-19 in the broader framework of pandemic preparedness and response”.\n\n【12】David Heymann, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (London, UK), told _The Lancet_ : “If standing recommendations are added to the IHR, it would seem they could be aimed at highly transmissible respiratory infections in general as preparedness for a future epidemic or pandemic of respiratory disease, and that excerpts from some of the excellent WHO guidelines for high transmission respiratory infections would be more useful as standing recommendations than specific guidelines for COVID-19, which are already available from WHO advisory groups.”\n\n【13】“There might also be consideration about more equitable distribution of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics when they become available during, and/or as preparedness, for future outbreaks, but this may not be within the scope of the IHR, and may, in fact, be covered in an eventual \\[pandemic\\] treaty.”\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>\n删除4:<u>\nCopyright © 2023 Fabrice Corfrini/Getty Images</u>\n\n【14】The decision to invoke this IHR provision, Gostin and others noted, was highly appropriate and helps underscore that although the PHEIC is over, the global threat remains. “This virus will continue to cause waves. What we are hopeful of is that we have the tools in place to ensure that the future waves do not result in more severe disease, do not result in waves of death”, said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO Technical Lead on COVID-19.\n\n【15】Tedros is well placed to use the upcoming 2023 World Health Assembly (starting on May 21) and other major upcoming global gatherings to muster the necessary political and diplomatic support to finalise talks on a global pandemic accord and to revise the IHR—both viewed as necessary for strengthening global health security against future threats. Tedros believes the first-hand experience of the unprecedented pandemic “will be enough to drive the negotiations forward and have a good outcome by May, 2024”.\n\n【16】Suerie Moon, Co-Director of the Global Health Centre at the Graduate Institute Geneva (Geneva, Switzerland), told _The Lancet_ that it is difficult to predict how long it will take to conclude the IHR amendments and the pandemic instrument process. “In my view, they’re politically interlinked, so if one drags on, the other may very well drag on.”\n\n【17】Moon and other health experts tracking the talks point out that some issues, such as diversification of production for vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics, have already marshalled substantial support. “I think the political commitment to diversification of production remains very high. I think people feel shocked. What's happened has not been forgotten in the countries that are left the furthest behind, and by that I mean sub-Saharan Africa in particular, and some other parts of the world.”\n\n【18】Ellen ‘t Hoen, Director of Medicines Law & Policy, told _The Lancet_ that the political processes to address more equity and diversification of production are in full motion and will not stop because of the end of the PHEIC. “A lot of the issues of expanding production, the transfer of technology, and the creation of mRNA hubs in sub-Saharan Africa, all of that is part of the talks”, she noted. But Hoen said what she is worried about the language in a final pandemic accord. In the area of questions on intellectual property rights, she noted: “The language is very weak. All the core themes are there, but the actual duties and obligations are very weak.”\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【19】### Publication history\n\n【20】Published: 20 May 2023\n\n【21】### Identification\n\n【22】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)01003-6</u>\n\n【23】### Copyright\n\n【24】© 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the case definition for severe malaria leaves a crucial question unanswered.\n\n【1】The definition of severe malaria in malaria-endemic regions with high prevalence of asymptomatic parasitaemia and comorbid conditions remains contentious. The heterogeneity of disease transmission in these settings might have been partly overcome by the application of a parasite density threshold, but the case definition for severe malaria would have been substantially improved by excluding children with meningitis, bacteraemia, and pneumonia. Inclusion of these children in the analysis could confound the interpretation of the results. The innate antimicrobial activity of artesunate might have contributed to its superior efficacy over quinine, which has only antiparasitic activity.\n\n【2】Given that as many as 20% of children with severe malaria could be bacteraemic, and the absence of efficacy data in patients with exclusive malaria parasitaemia with symptoms, the question of the true efficacy of this agent in severe malaria could still be open. For practical implementation, it would now be important to address the question of whether artesunate be used as a sole agent in the management of “severe malaria” in patients who may have malaria parasitaemia with undiagnosed bacteraemia.\n\n【3】删除9:<u>I declare that I have no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:31:12", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:33:30", "cost": 138.082}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:47", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:33:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:31:12"}

Although the study findings bode well for both eventual effectiveness in select populations and broader-spectrum protection, the report suggests that vaccination of women with previous HPV 16 or 18 infection might actually increase their risk of high-grade cervical disease—an observation strikingly consistent with reports on the quadrivalent HPV vaccine.\n\n【1】Although each trial's finding was attributed to imbalances in the baseline characteristics of the vaccine and placebo groups, the biological phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease should be considered. These clinical trials include thousands of vaccinees previously exposed to HPV 16 or 18; those women could be studied further with appropriate comparison groups. Cross-protection data in Paavonen and colleagues' study suggest that such investigations should include women with baseline HPV 31, 33, or 45.\n\n【2】What if HPV vaccination were contraindicated for women and girls previously infected? It might be argued that, in ideal settings, increased disease risk in a minority of vaccinees would be managed by the safety net of continued cervical cancer screening. Or perhaps HPV testing could precede vaccination. For developing nations, where a vaccine is most needed, such logic disintegrates. Furthermore, restricting vaccinations to prepubescent girls might be particularly prudent in the developing world. Young or old, a woman's previous infection risk can be difficult to ascertain, particularly in cases of unacknowledged rape or other sexual molestation.\n\n【3】Although the global eradication of HPV infection is a noble goal, we currently have neither sufficient evidence nor the requisite understanding of the immunology of HPV infection to suggest HPV vaccination for all.\n\n【4】I have received funding for unrelated (viral hepatitis) contractual research from GlaxoSmithKline and from Merck.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:34:30", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:34:41", "cost": 10.518}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:47", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:34:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:34:30"}

The choice of a screening test in countries or regions that plan to initiate new programmes should be based on the comparative performance characteristics of the test, costs, technical requirements, the degree of development of laboratory infrastructure, what is possible within the local health-care infrastructure, and awareness and perceptions within the community.\n\n【2】The study from rural Thailand (March 8删除2-1:<u>, p 814</u>), showing that a single-visit approach with visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid wash (VIA) and immediate cryotherapy seems safe, acceptable, and feasible, is important. However, the fairly low specificity of VIA, possibly related to high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), does raise the possibility of overtreatment. Another unknown factor is how well VIA works when genital schistosomiasis is prevalent. Standardised initial training and continuing education programmes, including supervision and mechanisms for quality control, will need to be developed if wide-scale VIA screening is to be introduced, and there is no study to show that a VIA screening programme reduces cervical-cancer incidence and mortality. The same accounts for other VIA methods that use magnification devices, visual inspection after the application of Lugol's iodine, or human papilloma virus (HPV) DNA testing, all proposed alternative cervical-cancer prevention screening tests. Moreover, to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of different screening tests and approaches in reducing mortality from cervical cancer in low-resource settings, formal modelling with country-specific costs should be undertaken.\n\n【3】Given the record of viral vaccines as a cost-effective approach for prevention of life-threatening infections, an effective vaccine directed against the major oncogenic HPV types could have a tremendous effect on the global burden of cervical cancer, especially if made available to developing countries. Results of trials with L1 virus-like particles (VLP) have shown safety, excellent tolerability, and high immunogenicity, and the findings of a randomised controlled trial of an HPV type-16 VLP vaccine indicate reduced incidence of both HPV-16 infection and HPV-16 related cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. However, vaccine candidates under assessment are mainly targeting HPV types 16 and 18, which account for most cases of cervical cancer in industrialised countries. Limited epidemiological data suggest that a much wider variety of HPV types are involved in the pathogenesis of cervical neoplasia in developing countries. All these HPV types should be considered in the development of multivalent vaccine preparations capable of inducing an immune response to various HPV types. Since this option is unlikely to be very profitable, public-sector commitment and spending is needed. The fact that HPV infection is an STI could pose an obstacle to the acceptance of a prophylactic HPV vaccine. Positioning an STI vaccine raises sensitive social issues, especially when targeted to adolescents to ensure protection before the onset of sexual activity. Meanwhile, effective HPV vaccines are not yet available, and even if developed the initial effect of prophylactic HPV vaccines will be delayed for 10–20 years, while the existing infections continue to progress to cancer.\n\n【4】Hence there are several approaches to cervical cancer prevention, and their assessment should be comprehensive and coordinated to address short-term and long-term public-health benefits in different programme settings.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:43:42", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:43:48", "cost": 5.142}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:47", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:43:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:43:39"}

The potential role of HIV therapeutic vaccines as part of an HIV cure is under consideration. Our aim was to assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of Vacc-4×, a peptide-based HIV-1 therapeutic vaccine targeting conserved domains on p24 Gag , in adults infected with HIV-1.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Between July, 2008, and June, 2010, we did a multinational double-blind, randomised, phase 2 study comparing Vacc-4× with placebo. Participants were adults infected with HIV-1 who were aged 18–55 years and virologically suppressed on cART (viral load <50 copies per mL) with CD4 cell counts of 400 × 10 6 cells per L or greater. The trial was done at 18 sites in Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to Vacc-4× or placebo. Group allocation was masked from participants and investigators. Four primary immunisations, weekly for 4 weeks, containing Vacc-4× (or placebo) were given intradermally after administration of adjuvant. Booster immunisations were given at weeks 16 and 18. At week 28, cART was interrupted for up to 24 weeks. The coprimary endpoints were cART resumption and changes in CD4 counts during treatment interruption. Analyses were by modified intention to treat: all participants who received one intervention. Furthermore, safety, viral load, and immunogenicity (as measured by ELISPOT and proliferation assays) were assessed. The 52 week follow-up period was completed in June, 2011. For the coprimary endpoints the proportion of participants who met the criteria for cART resumption was analysed with a logistic regression model with the treatment effect being assessed in a model including country as a covariate.删除1-2:<u> This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00659789.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】174 individuals were screened; because of slow recruitment, enrolment stopped with 136 of a planned 345 participants and 93 were randomly assigned to receive Vacc-4× and 43 to receive placebo. There were no differences between the two groups for the primary efficacy endpoints in those participants who stopped cART at week 28. Of the participants who resumed cART, 30 (34%) were in the Vacc-4× group and 11 (29%) in the placebo group, and percentage changes in CD4 counts were not significant (mean treatment difference −5·71, 95% CI −13·01 to 1·59). However, a significant difference in viral load was noted for the Vacc-4× group both at week 48 (median 23 100 copies per mL Vacc-4× _vs_ 71 800 copies per mL placebo; p=0·025) and week 52 (median 19 550 copies per mL _vs_ 51 000 copies per mL; p=0·041). One serious adverse event, exacerbation of multiple sclerosis, was reported as possibly related to study treatment. Vacc-4× was immunogenic, inducing proliferative responses in both CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The proportion of participants resuming cART before end of study and change in CD4 counts during the treatment interruption showed no benefit of vaccination. Vacc-4× was safe, well tolerated, immunogenic, seemed to contribute to a viral-load setpoint reduction after cART interruption, and might be worth consideration in future HIV-cure investigative strategies.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Norwegian Research Council GLOBVAC Program and Bionor Pharma ASA.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Infectious Diseases_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

Will this push more patients to seek medical help abroad? Pelle Neroth reports.\n\n【1】Several European Court of Justice (ECJ) rulings could throw European health care into disarray, by allowing Europeans to travel abroad freely for health care, without prior authorisation, and to charge the cost of this treatment back to their own health systems.\n\n【2】More and more continental Europeans are taking advantage of the rulings to enjoy health care abroad. It represents an enormous, exciting expansion of patients' rights and consumer choice. For fundholders, however, the prospects are mixed: on the one hand, it represents an opportunity to save money, if patients go abroad to countries where health care is cheaper. On the other, it represents a loss of control, as fundholders cannot monitor the standards of foreign care providers, nor can they control the conditions or frequency under which the care is sought.\n\n【3】It is the sort of “Anglo-saxon” freedom that, had the issue been part of the French referendum debate on the constitution, would probably have resulted in an even more emphatic “non”. The French would have realised they face competition not only from “Pawel the Polish plumber”—the mythical hate figure of the no-campaign for the cheap labour competition he represented—but “Pawel the Polish surgeon”.\n\n【4】Ironically, for a time in which European politics is consumed by the ramifications of the French and Dutch referendums, this freedom has nothing to do with the proposed EU constitution because ECJ rulings are always binding on all member states.\n\n【5】These new health-care freedoms have arisen out of several ECJ cases involving EU nationals seeking care in other EU countries during the past few years. Following refusals from national health-care systems to reimburse care enjoyed abroad, the ECJ determined that national health-care providers who don't pay up are acting as a barrier to free competition to provide services—a basic EU right. However, in order to allow national social-security systems some control over their budgets, any hospital care sought abroad still has to be preauthorised. In the UK, this means patients must still get the green light from a consultant and their primary-care trust to receive treatment abroad, a situation that is very similar to the current E112 scheme for which authorisations to go abroad are rarely granted.\n\n【6】That still leaves free dentistry, spectacles, and other possible day-care treatments available abroad without authorisation, for which the cost can be charged back to the NHS up to the level equivalent to UK rates. Crucially, authorisation for hospital care cannot be refused if the national health-care system cannot show that care can be provided domestically within a reasonable waiting time.\n\n【7】This provision is sure to provoke dispute. The NHS, for instance, is likely to argue for a reference point of what are reasonable waiting times based on the national average. The ECJ has ruled that the patient's medical condition must be the only factor of consideration.\n\n【8】The impact could be revolutionary: it sets out European-wide standards irrespective of national targets for what health-care systems have to achieve, because if national health providers don't meet these standards, they risk being charged for sending the patient abroad for health care.\n\n【9】From the point of view of health systems, the spectre of even less control looms on the horizon. There is no European statute legislation on this issue, and rulings are advancing based on ad-hoc decisions of the ECJ. The conservative MEP John Bowis recently wrote a report for the European parliament urging the European Commission—the policy-writing body of the EU—to make a framework proposal on patient mobility to rein in what he describes as the ECJ's “rampantly activist instincts”.\n\n【10】In the absence of statute rules on this area of medicine, there are fears that the ECJ may define very narrowly what is unreasonable waiting time, or reduce the definition of what is hospital care to overnight stays, so that daytime visits to foreign hospitals do not require authorisations. Bowis has even suggested the ECJ may abolish all authorisation requirements, even for hospital care. He admits that the Commission's failure to spell out exactly what patients rights are—it cannot reverse ECJ rulings, but can define a limit against further extension of patients' rights—could arise because people don't want to draw attention to the ECJ rulings by enshrining it in legislation.\n\n【11】Bowis said: “One or two member states are really trying to hide this, pretending that nothing is happening.” One senses he is being diplomatic, and that one of these states is the UK.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【12】### Publication history\n\n【13】Published: 25 June 2005\n\n【14】### Identification\n\n【15】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66760-8</u>\n\n【16】### Copyright\n\n【17】© 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This comparison comes from Appendix 3 to the Bank's statement of its Booster Program, which failed to clarify that the number for 1996 refers only to the first 6 months of the year. The Bank has since corrected this statement. The numbers cited come from table 2 of our analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the project. The data on cases in the table end at mid-1996 because the data on costs end at that time.\n\n【1】Attaran and colleagues do not recognise that the estimates of cases prevented and deaths averted are based on the fact that incidence had been increasing rapidly every year from 1975 to 1989, and on the assumption that, in the absence of the Brazilian government programme, incidence would have continued to increase at the same rate. Our projection is conservative compared with the estimated incidence derived from more detailed state-by-state studies added up over the country.\n\n【2】Attaran and colleagues also miss two other important features of our analysis. First, the Brazil programme targeted falciparum malaria. As a consequence, as figure 1 in our analysis shows, the reversal of the epidemic was more marked for falciparum malaria than for all cases together, and that reversal dates from 1992. Second, it is more urgent to avert deaths than morbidity—and that is what the programme did. Preventing a death saves about 250 times as many disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as preventing a non-fatal case, so the deaths averted by the programme account for 93% of the total DALY gain.

Tom knew that his father had lost their property and carried that embarrassment with him (spontaneous dull aching). In the scene, a bailiff was in the parlour to liquify assets (the touch on the irritated nerve). These descriptions will ring familiar to many patients today, but we have only recently discovered their neurobiological mechanisms. Understanding the mechanisms should help with the diagnosis and thus treatment of radiating pain symptoms that are present in most cases of cervical and lumbar radiculopathies, repetitive motion disorders, and complex regional pain syndromes, conditions that more often than not have no sign of nerve injury.\n\n【2】Both sensory experiences alluded to in the quote can be explained by the effects of nerve inflammation, called neuritis. During neuritis, chemical and mechanical stimuli of the affected nerve lead to the generation of nociceptor action potentials (and pain). The presence of inflammation and constituent inflammatory mediators leads to tonic discharge, predicted to be perceived as a spontaneous dull ache. Mechanical stimulation of the inflamed nerve also leads to nociceptor discharge, predicted to be perceived as a touch on the irritated nerve. The common mechanism of these axonal changes appears to be the interference of axoplasmic transport, which is the mechanism by which sensory transductive channels are conveyed to the receptive terminals of neurons. During neuritis, the accumulation of these channels occurs on the axon, creating ectopic receptive fields. Both perceptions would be felt distally to the inflamed site.\n\n【3】These changes form the basis for some of our nerve-related clinical tests, such as the straight-leg raise. This test mechanically stimulates the sciatic nerve. Radiating pain evoked by the straight-leg raise is almost certainly due to axonal mechanical sensitivity. In these patients, palpating or tapping the nerve (Tinel's test) will cause radiating symptoms as well. Including focal neuritis as a diagnostic possibility could refine the treatment approaches for many patients with radiculopathies, repetitive motion disorders, and complex regional pain syndromes, and others who present with symptoms that are suspicious of nerve damage but who do not have definite findings upon routine examination.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>We declare no competing interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/02 17:40:46", "endTime": "2024/09/02 17:41:43", "cost": 56.895}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:47", "update_time": "2024-09-02 01:41:44", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 01:40:46"}

He was of Haitian origin and had emigrated to the USA when he was 24 years old. A physical examination, an electrocardiogram (ECG), a full blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic profile showed no abnormalities. However, a transthoracic echocardiogram showed a 3 cm × 2 cm echolucent lesion in the apex of the left ventricle 删除2:<u>( figure ; video 1 )</u>. The patient did not report having a fever or any other systemic problems, but he had been to Haiti 5 months earlier. A cardiac MRI showed a solitary, avascular lesion located in the anterior wall of the left ventricle 删除2:<u>( figure ; video 2 )</u>; this lesion had no communication with the left ventricular cavity and was non-fatty and cystic. No pericardial or valvular abnormalities were seen. A CT scan of the heart confirmed the lesion was cystic and without any calcification; the coronary arteries were normal and, importantly, were not compressed by the mass. CT scans and MRIs of the head, chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no further cysts in any other organs. Serum serology by western blot testing for antibodies against specific IgG glycoproteins was negative for _Echinococcus granulosus_ and _Trypanosoma cruzi_ but positive for _Taenia solium_ . The patient was then treated for 2 weeks with oral albendazole 400 mg twice a day. He reported no further symptoms and the lesion was no longer visible on a further transthoracic echocardiogram 删除2:<u>( figure ; video 3 )</u> repeated 1 week after completing the treatment; a repeat cardiac MRI showed that the lesion had decreased considerably in size. Cysticercosis is endemic in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The disease can develop after consuming foods contaminated with faeces that contain _T solium_ eggs shed from a human carrier. The brain, skeletal muscle, and subcutaneous tissue are involved most frequently; isolated cardiac cysticercosis is rare. The need for concomitant treatment with steroids—particularly in neurocysticercosis—has been much debated because of concerns about seizures and worsening neurological symptoms on the initiation of anthelmintic therapy. In cases of isolated cardiac cysticercosis, there is no consensus for the routine use of steroids. In our patient, given that there was only mild oedema around the solitary lesion, the ECG was normal, and because he was on a cardiac monitor in hospital when albendazole was started, we were able to keep him under observation. Furthermore, it is of note that in other inflammatory cardiac conditions—such as pericarditis—steroids have been linked to increased relapse and recurrence. The rapid response to anthelmintic therapy in this case—reassuringly confirmed on repeat imaging—shows that in select cases, such as this one, albendazole may be used without steroids, with close clinical and cardiac monitoring and serial imaging.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure Cystic larva of pork tapeworm in the heart</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【1】(A) Transthoracic echocardiogram shows an echolucent lesion (arrowhead) in the apex of the LV.

The aim of this study was to estimate the effectiveness of the preoperative 1-h pad test with pessary insertion as a predictor of the need for a mid-urethral sling after prolapse surgery.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】206 patients with advanced prolapse who did not self-report urinary incontinence were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. Exclusion criteria included previous or concomitant anti-incontinence surgery. Before pelvic prolapse surgery, a urinary stress test, the 1-hour pad test, and uroflowmetry were done, along with prolapse reduction. The primary outcome was postoperative de-novo urinary incontinence. The median follow-up was 31 months (range 12–48 months). All participants were informed about the procedures and signed informed consent forms. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, China.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of 206 patients, 45 (22%) had evidence of occult stress urinary incontinence preoperatively, 62 (30%) showed de-novo urinary incontinence postoperatively, and only 13 (6%) opted for mid-urethral slings. Patients with occult stress urinary incontinence had a higher de-novo urinary incontinence rate after surgery than had patients without occult stress urinary incontinence (53·3% _vs_ 23·6%; p=0·0001). Occult stress urinary incontinence (hazard ratio \\[HR\\] 4·19 \\[95% CI 1·99–8·86\\]; p=0·0001) and concomitant hysterectomy (HR 2·86 \\[1·02–7·99\\]; p=0·044) were identified as independent risk factors of de-novo urinary incontinence. We used a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess the effectiveness of the preoperative 1-h pad test. The area under the curve was 0·816 (SD 0·085, 95% CI 0·649–0 ·983); the cutoff value was 1·9 g (sensitivity 80·0%; specificity 83·9%).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The preoperative 1-h pad test with prolapse reduction is feasible for screening of occult stress urinary incontinence, and a result of more than 1·9 g might be a practical indicator of a need for mid-urethral slings after pelvic prolapse surgery.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】None.\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】LZ was involved in project development.

As stated in the Discussion, we concur with Chiolero and Kaufman that there is a potential for confounders of mediator-outcome relation to affect the proportion of excess risk mediated (PERM). However, this confounding leads to an overestimation of PERM, not an underestimation as suggested by Chiolero and Kaufman. For example, if family history of coronary heart disease increases the hazard of chronic heart disease by a factor of 1·5 conditional on BMI and mediators, and if the prevalence of the family history of coronary heart disease in hypertensive individuals is 57% for those with normal weight, 53% for those who are overweight, and 50% in the obese individuals, (data from the MultiEthnic Study of Atherosclerosis), the PERM would be 24% (95% CI 14–31) for overweight and 25% (95% CI 13–33) for obesity using the bias formula from VanderWeele, as opposed to 31% (95% CI 26–36) for overweight and 31% (95% CI 27–35) for obesity in our main analysis. This difference happens because, among hypertensive individuals, if overweight or obesity is not the cause of hypertension, the chance that family history of coronary heart disease is present is increased. There is a negative correlation between exposure and the unmeasured confounder in hypertensive individuals. As judged by overlapping CIs nonetheless, the two sets of PERMs were not significantly different.\n\n【1】In an ongoing analysis, we have found that including dietary factors and physical activity as potential mediator-outcome confounders does not change the estimated PERM for coronary heart disease (unpublished data).\n\n【2】The re-analysis of ERFC cohorts by Wormser and colleagues to account for time-varying mediators such as blood pressure is a valuable addition to the data on the mediated effects of BMI. Because their table did not provide uncertainty intervals for PERMs, we calculated uncertainty intervals using a correlation coefficient of 0·95 between the age-sex-smoking-adjusted and fully-adjusted relative risks; this correlation coefficient was obtained by bootstrapping of the two sets of relative risks in our paper. The resulting uncertainty intervals are presented in the table , and show that the estimated PERMs for usual levels of risk factors for coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease are not significantly different from those for baseline levels in the ERFC. This conclusion would hold even for an unusually low correlation of 0·50 between the two sets of relative risks. Further, even despite the differences in the cohorts included (eg, more Asian cohorts in our study) and with slightly different mediators (eg, HDL-cholesterol was not included in our analyses) the PERMs are statistically indistinguishable between the two pooling studies. Nonetheless, incorporating time-varying measures of mediators is an important direction in research, which deserves more attention, as is the case for time-varying confounding by common determinants of mediators and cardiovascular disease such as diet and physical activity. Conventional regression-based methods can not handle this type of analysis and more advanced methods such as inverse-probability weighting of marginal structural models or use of the parametric g-formula should be explored in future research.\n\n【3】Table HRs and excess risks per 5 kg/m 2 higher BMI mediated by baseline and usual levels of biological mediators\n\n|  | **HR adjusted for age, sex, and smoking (95% CI)** | **Further adjusted for biological mediators** **(95% CI)** | **PERM (%, 95% CI)** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Coronary heart disease** | **Coronary heart disease** | **Coronary heart disease** | **Coronary heart disease** |\n| Baseline levels | 1·32 (1·24–1·41) | 1·12 (1·06–1·18) | 63% (39–77%) |\n| Usual levels | 1·32 (1·24–1·41) | 1·08 (1·02–1·14) | 75% (47–92%) |\n| **Ischaemic stroke** | **Ischaemic stroke** | **Ischaemic stroke** | **Ischaemic stroke** |\n| Baseline levels | 1·22 (1·13–1·31) | 1·07 (0·99–1·14) | 68% (50–76%) |\n| Usual levels | 1·20 (1·11–1·31) | 1·01 (0·94–1·08) | 95% (79–101%) |\n| **Cardiovascular disease** | **Cardiovascular disease** | **Cardiovascular disease** | **Cardiovascular disease** |\n| Baseline levels | 1·26 (1·19–1·33) | 1·08 (1·03–1·12) | 69% (41–86%) |\n| Usual levels | 1·26 (1·19–1·34) | 1·03 (0·99–1·08) | 88% (57–106%) |\n\n【5】HR=hazard ratio.

Despite decades of intense research there remains a paucity of clinically effective non-vascular neuroprotective measures. We present data supporting the theory that parallel pathways of ATP and glutamate excitotoxicity operate during ischaemia, which require the cooperation of both astrocytes and neurons, and that concomitant blockade of both pathways at the receptor level provides synergistic neuroprotection by preventing both astrocyte and neuronal death during the initial phase of a severe ischaemic insult.\n\n【2】Investigations were carried out with primary neuron and astrocyte cell cultures obtained from embryonic mice. Astrocytes and neurons expressed a range of functional P2 and glutamate receptors. 90 min of oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD), used to simulate ischaemia, induced significant release of glutamate from both monocultures of neurons or astrocytes while astrocytes alone were responsible for ATP release. OGD induced significant amounts of both astrocyte and neuronal death, with neuronal death being enhanced in the presence of astrocytes. In co-cultures of astrocytes and neurons AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptor antagonist prevented only neuronal death, whereas broad-spectrum P2 receptor antagonists were significantly protective of both neurons and astrocytes. Astrocytes and neurons were also protected by a selective P2Y1 receptor antagonist. Combining AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and P2 receptor antagonists, even at greatly reduced concentrations, was significantly protective of all cell types during OGD.\n\n【3】These results provide further evidence for the existence of both ATP and glutamate mediated excitotoxicity during ischaemia in the brain and highlight the important role of astrocytes in this process. Furthermore, the synergistic protective effect of inhibiting both pathways suggests that future effective neuroprotective strategies may benefit from a multipronged approach aimed at the large number of cell death pathways known to lead to eventual cell death and dysfunction.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【4】None.\n\n【5】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: 27 February 2013\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60551-6</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Systematic reviews indicate that interventions can increase short-term physical activity levels. However, long-term health benefits require sustained physical activity increases and systematic review evidence from interventions with objective measures of physical activity beyond 12 months is lacking. This review aimed to identify and describe randomised trials in adults with objective physical activity measures and follow-up beyond 12 months and evaluate the extent to which intervention effects are sustained beyond 12 months\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and ASSIA between Jan 1, 2000, and April 16, 2018, restricting our search to publications in English, with a combination of the key search terms “physical activity”, “objective physical activity measures”, and “randomised controlled trial”. We included trials reporting long-term effects (≥12 months) on objective physical activity (step count and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) with community-based participants, aged 18 years and older, without specific medical conditions. Studies in which control participants received physical activity interventions were excluded. Two independent reviewers completed data extraction. We did meta-analyses using random effects models and at different follow-up points. Outcomes were daily step counts and weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity. This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42017075753.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Of the 17 233 unique records identified by our search, we included nine studies in the review and five in the meta-analyses. Interventions included individual walking programmes, group-based sessions, and a school volunteering programme. Follow-up ranged from 12 months to 4 years. The age range of participants was 18–89 years. We observed physical activity increases at 12 months for intervention group participants versus control participants in steps per day (mean difference 554 steps, 95% CI 384–724, p<0·0001; 2446 participants in four studies) and weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (35 min, 27–43; p<0·0001; 2647 participants in four studies). This increase was sustained up to 4 years for both steps per day (494 steps, 251–738; p<0·0001; 1944 participants in four studies) and weekly minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (25 min, 13–37; p<0·0001; 1458 participants in three studies).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】We found evidence of physical activity intervention effects beyond 12 months, sustained up to 4 years for both steps per day and minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, with important implications for potential long-term health benefits. However, few physical activity interventions with objective measures had follow-up beyond 12 months.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】None\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【10】CW, UARC, RF, DGC, and TH conceived the work and did the analysis.

Using the data that we had available to us, our study looked at the socio-demographic factors which would be expected to be associated with violence based on what we know from the general population. We included education and military rank, both of which are related to socioeconomic status and to deprivation to some extent. We did not have another measure of deprivation but we suspect that other measures of socio-economic disadvantage in addition to education and rank would have had only a marginal additional effect.\n\n【1】In response to the concerns about the method used to classify participants in a combat or non-combat role, and the assertion that medical personnel are often deployed in a combat role, we would like to make some clarifications. Medics are not deployed in a combat role. The Geneva Convention specifically prevents medical personnel from using lethal force other than to protect themselves or their patients. Being in a combat role is not the same as being deployed in a forward area. However to take account of the possible discrepancy between the roles that military personnel have on deployment and their trade description, we used participants' own description of their role on deployment and not the trade description derived from their cap badge. The questionnaire asked participants to select their main duty on deployment from a list of 20 roles. If a participant ticked both combat and any other duty, combat trumped all others. The classification of role in modern Armed Forces is difficult and neatly dividing all deployed participants into two groups if anything will underestimate rather than overestimate the true difference due to combat exposure.\n\n【2】We shared the concern about attrition in a cohort study. Hence we linked all the participants from the beginning of the cohort study with their official criminal records. Therefore, we had no loss to follow-up. But bias could still arise through non-response to the questionnaire at the beginning of the study. The variables that are associated with non-response are younger age, male gender, and lower rank, which are also associated with violence. But we weighted our analysis for response rate to account for these factors. If such adjustment was not entirely effective non-response would have given an underestimation of violence\n\n【3】Unfortunately the information provided by the Police National Computer records did not provide information on the context in which the violence post-deployment occurred. With regard to Wood and colleagues' observations about behavioural change in military personnel following deployment, in particular increased nightclub attendance, we reiterate that we did not find that deployment per se was associated with increased risk of violence. Our analyses of the effect of combat role and exposure to traumatic events on subsequent violent offending involved only those who had been deployed. Therefore all participants in these analyses, according to Wood and colleagues' observations, would have been more likely to attend nightclubs more frequently, and this would not help to explain the increase in violent offending associated with combat role or traumatic events on deployment.\n\n【4】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflicts of interest other than those disclosed in the original paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:14:00", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:14:07", "cost": 6.803}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:46", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:14:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:13:59"}

According to WHO, 57 countries in the developing world have severe shortages of health workers. The agency estimates that 4 million additional doctors, nurses, midwives, and public-health workers are needed to address the health needs in these nations.\n\n【1】But what chance have such initiatives, if wealthy nations continue to hire doctors, nurses, and other health professionals from poorer nations? The latest example is a little-noticed provision put into an immigration bill that just passed the US Senate that removes limits on the number of nurses who can enter the USA to work. During the past 10–12 years, more than 50 000 foreign nurses have immigrated to the USA, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. Nevertheless, the shortage of qualified nurses in the USA continues unabated, with the American Hospital Association reporting 118 000 current vacancies, a number the government expects to increase to a staggering 800 000 by 2020. Strangely, Americans who wish to train as nurses are being turned away from nursing schools that cannot find teaching staff. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, more than 32 000 students were refused entry into baccalaureate level nursing programmes in 2005 because there is no one to teach them—not surprising, since a new graduate working in a clinical setting can earn a higher starting salary than a faculty nurse with a master's or doctoral degree.\n\n【2】Developed countries have long looked upon the developing world as a nearly limitless source of willing labour to fill this gap, as does the US Senate, apparently. Most of the countries from which the nurses come are facing extremely serious public-health problems, including epidemics of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, and, thus, they can scarcely afford to lose health workers. The disparity is even more disheartening when considering the degree of need. Only 10% of the global burden of disease is concentrated in the Americas, but 37% of all health professionals work there. Africa, with 24% of the global burden of disease, employs only 3%. A UN report reinforces that this brain drain of health workers is effectively subsidising care in the rich world. Clearly, further migration of workers will be disastrous for developing countries. And while some African countries are demanding a subsidy for nurses they supply, the Senate bill does not provide for any such compensation.\n\n【3】Some wealthy countries have taken steps to discourage or eliminate the practice of poaching nurses. In 2001, the UK's Department of Health adopted a code of practice that promotes “ethical recruitment” and restricts recruitment from 150 developing countries, including many in Africa and Asia. But there is evidence that the code is routinely ignored.\n\n【4】Diana Mason, editor of the _American Journal of Nursing_ , said the main problem here is the “primary moral issue of draining these countries of their much-needed nursing resources and further undermining their healthcare infrastructure and the health of their people (and thus their economies)”. In the USA, a guaranteed supply of nurses from abroad means that hospitals do not have to raise nurses' wages and improve their working conditions; likewise, universities will feel no pressure to raise nursing faculty salaries. She pointed to a recent report by the Institute for Women's Policy Research, Solving the Nursing Shortage through Higher Wages , which suggests that the nursing shortage continues as a result of collusion among hospital administrators to keep wages down and of longstanding gender-based wage discrimination.\n\n【5】For a problem of this scope, the Senate appears to be airily applying a Band-aid to a gaping wound. Instead of implementing what amounts to a morally problematic and expensive temporary fix to a problem that is not new, Congress should be creating ways to fund and strengthen the nursing infrastructure in the USA, thereby developing a local workforce. Higher wages, better working conditions, and support for teaching positions are, in the long term, more effective, and possibly even more cost-effective, solutions. At the very least, the bill should ensure compensation to all countries who supply nurses. The immigration bills passed by the House are substantially different from that passed by the Senate. A joint House-Senate committee will soon meet to attempt to hammer out compromise legislation. Changing the provision on the nursing workforce should be on its agenda.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: 03 June 2006\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68776-X</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the study strongly supports the use of immunosuppression in systemic sclerosis, several limitations are to be noted.\n\n【1】First, a cross-over design after only 6 months' treatment with so few patients is exceedingly difficult to interpret definitively for either toxicity or efficacy. Second, the endpoints of Rodnan skin score and forced vital capacity have substantial serial test variability and other studies require more robust differences to prove effect in a potentially toxic therapy. Third, follow-up of only 24 months is too brief to determine durable response or effects on organ failure or death. There were no deaths in either treatment group, which is very unusual in severe systemic sclerosis and suggests either insufficient duration of follow-up or selection of patients with less severe disease. Moreover, meaningful improvements in severe systemic sclerosis have been reported beyond 24 months after HSCT.\n\n【2】As Burt and colleagues note, the multicentre ASTIS and SCOT trials are currently maturing to reach sufficient follow-up and numbers of patients to address these concerns. The findings of these trials will be crucial for determination of standards of care in systemic sclerosis, since HSCT for autoimmune diseases requires compelling data with sufficient numbers of patients and detailed long-term outcomes to change practice. And practising physicians and decision makers might require greater evidence of clinical benefit to change practice habits than investigators think. \n\n【3】删除9:<u>We declare that we have no conflicts of interest.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 14:33:50", "endTime": "2024/09/03 14:33:59", "cost": 9.307}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:46", "update_time": "2024-09-02 22:33:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 22:33:50"}

Nevertheless, with eight national teams from the Americas competing in the tournament plus their accompanying supporters, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has taken the extraordinary step of issuing a health advisory notice to travellers to the World Cup.\n\n【1】Visitors to Germany are warned by PAHO to be certain that they are immunised against measles because of the outbreak that has been going on in North Rhine-Westphalia since February this year. This state has had around 1400 cases of measles, the largest outbreak in Germany since notification became mandatory in 2001. Three cities in the state—Cologne, Dortmund, and Gelsenkirchen—will host World Cup games, and six teams from the Americas will play in these cities. PAHO also wants health-care workers in the Americas to be aware of the possibility of measles importation. A recent measles outbreak in Venezuela—the first in 4 years—began with the importation of a case from Spain.\n\n【2】An effective vaccine against measles has been available for more than 40 years. Globally, the number of reported measles cases has fallen from over 4 million in 1980 to around 500 000 in 2004. These are considerable underestimates of the actual number of people affected by measles, which is probably around 30 million per year. In 2003 the World Health Assembly resolved to half measles deaths by the end of 2005 compared with 1999 levels. The vehicle set up to achieve this goal is the Measles Initiative, a collaboration between several organisations including WHO and UNICEF, which has focused its efforts on the 47 low-income countries that account for 98% of global measles deaths. Progress has been impressive, with measles deaths falling from 871 000 in 1999 to 454 000 in 2004, a reduction of 48%, with 500 million children worldwide receiving measles vaccine between these dates.\n\n【3】The greatest burden of measles is in sub-Saharan Africa (216 000 deaths in 2004) and south Asia (202 000). Yet the disease continues to splutter on in parts of the world that are wealthy enough to not require international aid to support prevention efforts. In 1994 the PAHO nations agreed to eliminate measles virus from their region by 2000. They did not quite achieve this target, but indigenous measles transmission was interrupted in November 2002. The 108 measles cases reported in the Americas in 2004 were all related to importation. By contrast, the WHO European region—with a population almost exactly the same as that of the PAHO region—reported 29 503 measles cases in 2004, and measles deaths are estimated at 4850 in 2003. Europe is a great exporter of measles: 37% of measles cases imported into the USA during 1993–2001 and 21% of all Canadian cases during 1999–2001 were linked to Europe, and 50% of cases imported into European Union (EU) countries are from other EU countries. But despite being the home of a nasty little epidemic, it was not until 2002 that WHO Europe implemented a plan for measles elimination by 2010. The plan was revised in 2005 to include the goal of rubella elimination by 2010.\n\n【4】Although all 52 European region member states have adopted a routine two-dose childhood measles vaccination schedule, current outbreaks have been reported in Denmark, Greece, Spain, Sweden, and Ukraine, in addition to Germany. Italy has a particularly poor recent record, with more than 9000 cases in 2002 and almost 11 000 in 2003, although the number fell to around 600 in 2004. The official rate of measles vaccination among German children at school entry is 93%, but the accuracy of this figure has been questioned because only children presenting their vaccination cards are counted and immunisation is often given too late. In addition, because only 66% of children receive the second dose of vaccine many are left without effective immunity to measles. Although German law requires health authorities to provide information on vaccination, 50% of parents questioned in a survey said they were insufficiently informed on the topic.\n\n【5】During the current outbreak in North Rhine-Westphalia, public-health officials have been urged to offer vaccination to all school students without measles immunity, but action has been hesitant. Germany is one of the European nations that has undertaken to eliminate measles from the continent by 2010. Unless German authorities and those elsewhere in Europe start to take measles seriously now, that target will not be met and Europe will continue to be the unnecessary exporter of a preventable infection.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: July 2006\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70496-0</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

She had attended 50 funerals in 1 year, many of which were for suicides related to alcohol abuse. She was also concerned about the one in four babies born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in the region, which she regarded as a particular disaster for an oral-based culture. After consultation with other women and their community Elders, the group made two films, _Yajilarra_ (to dream) and _Marulu_ (precious, worth nurturing, see webvideo ), about how alcohol was destroying their lives through violence and crime. In 2009 they presented _Yajilarra_ to the UN in New York and to the Australian Government. The result of their amazing initiative was that alcohol restrictions were introduced in the area: no drinks over 2·7% alcohol content could be sold in takeaways. The move was not universally popular, as the film depicts, but after the restrictions were introduced domestic violence fell by 43% and alcohol-related presentations to hospital were reduced by 55%—success indeed. The restrictions have now been taken up by some other rural communities.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【1】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【2】Already registered?\n\n【3】Log in to existing account\n\n【4】Forgot password?\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】Not yet registered?\n\n【8】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:34:12", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:34:16", "cost": 4.258}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:46", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:34:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:34:12"}

The baby was not in respiratory distress. A transposition of the great arteries was diagnosed by echocardiography; we did a balloon atrial septostomy via the umbilical vein, to allow oxygenated blood to reach the systemic circulation. 3 days after birth, we observed abdominal distension. Abdominal percussion was tympanic. Transillumination indicated that the baby was likely to have a pneumoperitoneum 删除2:<u>( figure )</u>—which was confirmed by abdominal radiography. Emergency surgical exploration showed a localised necrotising enterocolitis, with several gut perforations: the baby required an ileocaecal resection, and a distal ileostomy. The necrotising enterocolitis may have been caused by emboli released from the atrial septum or the umbilical vein, during the septostomy, or by the hypoxaemia caused by the transposition of the great arteries. Transillumination is widely used by pediatricians to detect pneumothoraces, particularly when rapid aspiration must be done, or radiography is unavailable. As demonstrated here, transillumination can also assist in the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【3】### Publication history\n\n【4】Published: 13 October 2007\n\n【5】### Identification\n\n【6】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61576-1</u>\n\n【7】### Copyright\n\n【8】© 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

They admit that casecontrol studies merely identify associations, not causal links, which could be the case in their study.\n\n【2】Since 87% of participants were older than 70 years, the use of statins in this population was probably affected by many factors, including state of health, quality of life, and prognosis. Healthy people in their 70s will not be denied statins. Indeed treatment in such individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events has a low number needed to treat, which suggests cost effectiveness. Nearly all guidelines advise caution in prescribing statins to people with noncardiovascular diseases that impair prognosis for a healthy life. A person who has dementia is much less likely than someone without to be prescribed statins. In Jick and colleagues' study, only 12 (4·2%) of 284 cases were receiving statins, compared with 100 (9·3%) of 1080 controls. The proportion of people receiving statins is strikingly low among cases and fairly low even in the controls.\n\n【3】Many randomised prospective trials of statins shed light on the effect of these drugs on the development of dementia. Jick and colleagues should nevertheless be congratulated on highlighting an important imbalance in the prescription of statins. If it is confirmed, what should be debated is whether statins should or should not be withheld from people with dementia.\n\n【4】BMYC and CRK are council members of the Institute of Cardiovascular Science and Medicine, University of Hong Kong.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 15:01:46", "endTime": "2024/09/03 15:04:20", "cost": 154.206}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:46", "update_time": "2024-09-02 23:04:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 23:01:46"}

Nonetheless, existing global, national, and subnational data provide some key opportunities for testing associations between gender norms and health. Using innovative approaches to analysing proxies for gender norms, we generated evidence that gender norms impact the health of women and men across life stages, health sectors, and world regions. Six case studies showed that: (1) gender norms are complex and can intersect with other social factors to impact health over the life course; (2) early gender-normative influences by parents and peers can have multiple and differing health consequences for girls and boys; (3) non-conformity with, and transgression of, gender norms can be harmful to health, particularly when they trigger negative sanctions; and (4) the impact of gender norms on health can be context-specific, demanding care when designing effective gender-transformative health policies and programmes. Limitations of survey-based data are described that resulted in missed opportunities for investigating certain populations and domains. Recommendations for optimising and advancing research on the health impacts of gender norms are made.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nThis article is available free of charge.\n\n【2】Simply log in to access the full article, or register for free if you do not yet have a username and password.\n\n【3】Already registered?\n\n【4】Log in to existing account\n\n【5】Forgot password?\n\n【6】One-time access price info\n\n【7】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【8】Not yet registered?\n\n【9】Register for free</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "lancet", "batch_name": "20230817", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/03 10:05:08", "endTime": "2024/09/03 10:05:22", "cost": 13.745}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-02 01:37:46", "update_time": "2024-09-02 18:05:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-02 18:05:08"}

Born Oct 6, 1939, in Bolton, UK; died of pneumonia while undergoing treatment for mantle cell lymphoma aged 63 years in Edinburgh, UK, on April 1, 2003\n\n【2】David Horrobin's career was shaped by the study, early on, of prolactin. In 1969, just out of internship, he was appointed professor of medical physiology at the then-new medical school in Nairobi, Kenya, a country he had fallen in love with during 4 months spent as a member of the Flying Doctor Service in medical school. While there, he was mesmerised by a lecture by prolactin researcher Howard Bern, a distinguished zoologist at the University of California at Berkeley. Horrobin set out to study the hormone, first on himself. “I started the investigation by injecting prolactin into myself and found that, just as in salmon, it helped to regulate the kidneys and to keep salt and water in balance, especially in difficult conditions”, he would later write in his book _The Madness of Adam and Eve_ , which was shortlisted for the Aventis Science Book of the Year in 2002. “Moreover, I and the male colleagues into whom I injected the hormone, developed a transient male version of premenstrual syndrome!”\n\n【3】This work, Horrobin wrote, sparked his interest in three areas: how ancient man managed salt and water in East Africa; schizophrenia research, because all antipsychotic drugs at the time stimulated release of prolactin; and fats, because prolactin stimulates the release of essential fatty acids from cells. In 1972, he returned to the UK to become a reader in medical physiology at the University of Newcastle, where he studied essential fatty acids and prostaglandins. In 1975, he became professor of medicine at the University of Montreal, Canada, where he became involved in the study of lipids, but was unable to obtain grants for his research from mainstream sources. That experience led him to begin an analysis of the peer-review system, which led to a series of incisive articles in journals, including _JAMA_ , _The Lancet_ , and _Trends in Pharmacological Sciences_ .\n\n【4】Horrobin left academia in 1979 to found Efamol, a small pharmaceutical company that later changed its name to Scotia and became one of the first biotechnology companies to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. He remained at Scotia until 1997, developing therapies based on lipid biochemistry and photodynamic methods, including Epogam, which received approval for use in atopic eczema in 1988. But his heart remained in psychiatric research, and in 1997 he left to found a new company, Laxdale, based in Stirling, Scotland, which develops treatments for psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n【5】The common thread of Horrobin's diverse interests and accomplishments, a former student and then colleague of more than 30 years, Mehar S Manku, told _The Lancet_ , was “his boldness and energy to face up to critics and push on to provide provisions and ambience to express ideas, openly and freely. He was a naturalist, scientist, and a medical doctor with a commitment to discovering simple drugs for complex diseases.”\n\n【6】Horrobin also personally invested in the future of biomedical research, drawing on his own experience of mantle cell lymphoma to call for changes in the conduct and design of clinical trials in a Personal paper in _The Lancet_ earlier this year 删除12:<u>( _Lancet_ 2003; **361** : 695–97)</u>. He was also concerned that inefficiencies in drug development could lead to active compounds being missed—for example, he was critical of the way “that the assays for therapeutic activity were conducted in a wholly artificial environment on microplates, which bore no relationship to the physiological environment”, according to Manku.\n\n【7】Horrobin attended King's College School in Wimbledon, London, then Balliol College, Oxford University. He led the Oxford University Expedition to Nepal to study human blood groups and then interrupted his course to complete a DPhil in neurophysiology, earning his BM BCh in 1968. He would eventually write, or coauthor, some 800 articles and serve as founder and editor of _Medical Hypotheses_ and of _Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes, and Essential Fatty Acids_ . He enjoyed fishing off the western coast of the Isle of Harris, reading, and writing poetry, and is survived by his wife Sherri, his mother Betty, his brother Peter, his children, Cathra and Steven, and three grandchildren.\n\n【8】Despite his strong work ethic, Horrobin's sense of humour shined. In _The Madness of Adam and Eve_ , he wrote about receiving a call in Kenya from the US ambassador to that country, asking if he could organise an audience for the lecture by Bern, which would figure so prominently in his career. Horrobin and Mohamed Hyder, the professor of zoology, “were the only academics around but we ensured Howard's audience by collecting cleaners, catering, and office staff into the main lecture theatre. Mohamed and I were the only two people who understood Howard's lecture. Only 10 years later, to his great amusement, did I tell Howard what had happened.”\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【9】### Publication history\n\n【10】Published: 19 April 2003\n\n【11】### Identification\n\n【12】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13046-2</u>\n\n【13】### Copyright\n\n【14】© 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We estimated the pediatric asthma incidence and corresponding economic losses attributable to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in urban areas in China.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in 2019 were estimated separately with a source-specific model validated by measurements from different studies, and NO 2 exposure after restricting emissions indoor (from cooking or second-hand smoking) and outdoor (to meet WHO interim targets and air quality guideline) were projected. Disease burden of NO 2 \\-attributable new-onset pediatric asthma were estimated based on NO 2 exposure, concentration-response function from a meta-analysis, and number of pediatric asthma populations. Economic impacts were estimated based on the costs of pediatric asthma in China.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】In China, NO 2 is associated with an estimated 637,000 (95% uncertainty interval 358,000–851,000) new pediatric asthma cases and 1,358 million (674–2145) RMB economic losses in urban areas in 2019. 296,000 (222,000–523,000) new pediatric asthma cases would be prevented each year by restricting NO 2 emissions indoor, i.e. switching from using gas stoves to electic stoves for cooking. 393,000 (119,000–463,000) new pediatric asthma cases would be prevented each year when outdoor air meets the air quality guideline for NO 2 (< 10 µg/m 3 ).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Restricting both indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions are necessary to reduce pediatric asthma incidence in urban areas.

Epidemiological studies have reported a significant association between ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), recognized as a proxy of traffic-related air pollution, and pediatric asthma, the most common chronic disease among children worldwide. There are also evident sources of NO 2 indoor even in areas with no use of solid fuels and kerosene, i.e. NO 2 produced during the combustion of tobacco and gaseous fuels. Latest study has demonstrated the comparable contributions of NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in the air people breath. However, no studies focused on the disease burden of NO 2 from indoor sources, let alone the health benefits of restrictions on indoor NO 2 emissions.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】The uniqueness of this study is estimating the disease burden attributable to exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources separately; and comparing the health benefits of restricting indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions. We focused on urban areas in China, where facing serious air pollution of NO 2 both indoor and outdoor. NO 2 is estimated to attribute to hundreds of thousands of pediatric asthma cases in Chinese urban areas in 2019, with significantly contributions of NO 2 from both indoor and outdoor sources. The cost associated with asthma of each child with asthma is equivalent to about 5% per capita disposable income in China. The reduction of pediatric asthma cases by restricting indoor NO 2 emissions, i.e. switching from using gas stoves to electric stoves for cooking, is comparable to the burden reduction when outdoor air meets WHO air quality guideline issued in 2021.\n\n【17】### Implications of the available evidence\n\n【18】This study demonstrates the importance of restricting indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions to reduce the disease burden attributable to NO 2 , typically in pediatric asthma incidence. The measurements to restrict indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions, i.e. switching from using gas stove to electric stove for cooking and switching the traditional fossil energy vehicles to new energy vehicles, reflect the demand to adjust the energy consumption structure. These actions may be a win–win opportunity for countries facing both climate change and air pollution challenges.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Air pollution is one of the top five risk factors for disease burden around the world according to the latest estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. Reducing disease burden attributed to air pollution is also a key indicator of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, as well as Goal 11 for sustainable cities and communities. Long-term exposure to high levels of air pollutions would lead to a variety of non-communicable diseases, particularly for children. Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children worldwide, with rising incidences in developing economies. While air pollution control measures have been haphazardly effective in controlling particulate matter exposures, anthropogenic sources of NO 2 mainly derived from include on-road and non-road transportation tailpipe emissions may not correlate with particulate matter control measures. There are recent advancements in our understanding of NO 2 and onset of allergic diseases. Epidemiological studies have provided evidences of the associations between air pollutants and new-onset asthma in children. The evidence for other air pollutants (e.g. fine particulate matter) is mixed except for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). Epidemiological studies in Europe, North America, Japan, China, Korea have consistently shown a significant positive association between NO 2 and pediatric asthma incidence. Achakulwisut et al. have linked NO 2 with about 4·0 million annual number of new pediatric asthma cases in 194 countries. And China has been estimated to have the most considerable national burdens of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma, with 760,000 new cases per year and more than 50% of the cases occurring in urban areas.\n\n【21】The World Health Organization (WHO) issued new Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) on Sept 22, 2021 (WHO AQG 2021), setting AQG for NO 2 of annual averaged concentration of 10 μg/m 3 and applied for both indoor and outdoor air. NO 2 is usually thought of as a proxy of traffic-related air pollution. Whereas there are also evident sources of NO 2 indoor, i.e. NO 2 produced during combustion processes indoors, such as cooking (i.e. gas combustion) and smoking (i.e. tobacco combustion), even in areas without using solid fuels and kerosene. Urban areas are typical areas with heavy traffic and do not use solid fuels and kerosene, especially in urban China where the population density is extremely high. Our latest study figured out indoor sources contribute ∼33% to human exposure to NO 2 in Chinese urban. Despite the importance of indoor sources in NO 2 exposure, to the best of our knowledge, no studies focus on the disease burden of NO 2 from indoor sources, let alone the policies to restrict NO 2 emitted indoors. This is unique compared with those previous studies focused on outdoor NO 2 . The formulation of policies to restrict the NO 2 produced indoor, such as implementing a smoking ban and using electric stoves for cooking, may well be an essential initiative to reduce the disease burden attributable to NO 2 exposure.\n\n【22】In this study, we estimated the number of pediatric asthma cases and corresponding economic losses attributable to exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in Chinese urban areas in 2019. We further projected and compared the health benefits and corresponding economic benefits of policies on restricting the NO 2 emissions indoor and outdoor.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Overview\n\n【25】We first generated the concentration of children exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in urban areas in China in 2019 from a previous modeling study (boys and girls in 6 age groups, i.e. 0–0·5 y, 0·5–1 y, 1-2 y, 3–6 y, 7–11 y, 12–17 y, from 330 Chinese cities). We estimated the NO 2 exposure after restricting NO 2 emissions from indoor and outdoor sources. We then explored pediatric asthma incidence attributable to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources for urban areas in China in 2019. We projected the reduction of pediatric asthma incidence after restrictions on NO 2 emissions. We also estimated the economic burden associated with NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence with the cost of illness methods. The methodology framework is shown in Figure 1 . The uncertainty interval (UI) of the results was obtained by Monte Carlo method.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Methodology framework.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【26】### Exposure to NO 2 from different sources in 2019\n\n【27】For human exposure to outdoor sources, it is the sum of exposure to outdoor originated NO 2 indoor when people stay indoors and exposure to outdoor NO 2 directly when people stay outdoor. Human exposure to indoor sources is the exposure to NO 2 emitted from gas combustion during cooking and tobacco combustion during smoking. The concentration of NO 2 exposure is defined as the average concentration of NO 2 in the air people breathe during the studied period, reporting in µg/m 3 . We estimated the concentration of human exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in Chinese urban areas in 2019 based on a validated source-specific model in our previous study. The model and its validation were detailed in the appendix ( **Note S1** and **Figure S1** ). The annual average concentration of human exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources for children of 6 age groups (i.e. 0–0·5, 0·5–1, 1-2, 3–6, 7–11, 12–17 years old) and two genders (boys and girls) and exposure to second-hand smoke or not (from smoking and non-smoking households) in urban areas in 330 Chinese cities in 2019 were provided in Table S13 in Hu and Zhao. Mean and standard deviation in Table S13 in Hu and Zhao indicates the intra-population variability distribution of NO 2 exposure.\n\n【28】The annual average concentration of NO 2 exposure from cooking, second-hand smoking and outdoor sources were represented by the parameters _Ccooking, CSHS_ and _Cambient_ , respectively. _Ccooking_ and _Cambient_ in 2019 were provided as IEC (indoor source exposure concentration) and OEC (outdoor source exposure concentration) for non-smoking households in Table S13 in Hu and Zhao. _CSHS_ for people from smoking households in 2019 was calculated with the following equation:\n\n【29】C S H S \\= C i n d o o r , s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d − C c o o k i n g\n\n【30】(1)\n\n【31】where _Cindoor,smoking household_ is the annual average concentration of people from smoking households exposed to NO 2 from indoor sources. _Cindoor,smoking household_ in Chinese urban areas in 2019 was provided as IEC for smoking households in Table S13 in Hu and Zhao. The annual average concentration of human exposure to NO 2 from all sources were represented by _Cexp. Cexp_ for people from non-smoking households were the sum of _Ccooking_ and _Cambient_ and it is the sum of _Ccooking, CSHS_ and _Cambient_ for people from smoking households.\n\n【32】The proportion of the contribution of cooking, second-hand smoke, and outdoor sources in NO 2 exposure for a population of specific age groups (6 age groups, i.e. 0–0·5, 0·5–1, 1-2, 3–6, 7–11 and 12–17) and sex groups (boys and girls) in specific cities (330 Chinese cities) were calculated with the following equations:\n\n【33】P S a m b i e n t \\= C a m b i e n t ¯ C c o o k i n g ¯ \\+ C a m b i e n t ¯ \\+ P S H S × C S H S ¯\n\n【34】(2)\n\n【35】P S c o o k i n g \\= C c o o k i n g ¯ C c o o k i n g ¯ \\+ C a m b i e n t ¯ \\+ P S H S × C S H S ¯\n\n【36】(3)\n\n【37】P S S H S \\= P S H S × C S H S ¯ C c o o k i n g ¯ \\+ C a m b i e n t ¯ \\+ P S H S × C S H S ¯\n\n【38】(4)\n\n【39】_PS_ is the proportion of the contribution of different sources in NO 2 exposure, the subscripts _ambient, cooking_ and _SHS_ of _PS_ are the outdoor sources, cooking, and second-hand smoke. C a m b i e n t ¯ , C c o o k i n g ¯ , and C S H S ¯ are the mean of _Cambient, Ccooking_ , and _CSHS_ , respectively. _PSHS_ is the proportion of the population exposed to second-hand smoke. The details of calculation of _PSHS_ were provided in the appendix ( **Note S2** ). The value of _PS_ in 2019 were shown in appendix ( **Figure S2** ).\n\n【40】### NO 2 exposure after restrictions\n\n【41】The restrictions on indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions included a smoking ban, switching from using a gas stove to electric stove for cooking, and reducing NO 2 emitted outdoor. To see the scope for health benefits from these policies, we projected the scenarios where these policies were 100% achieved ( **Table S1** in appendix):\n\n【42】*   smoking ban (SB): no people smoking, to reduce the NO 2 produced by tobacco combustion during smoking ( _PSHS_ \\=0; _Ccooking_ and _Cambient_ were equal to that in 2019);\n\n【43】*   switching from using a gas stove to electric stove for cooking (EC): all residents using electric stove for cooking in Chinese urban areas, to reduce the NO 2 produced by gas combustion during cooking ( _Ccooking_ \\=0; _Csmoking_ and _Cambient_ were equal to that in 2019);\n\n【44】*   reducing NO 2 emitted outdoor: the outdoor air meets the WHO interim targets (IT) and AQG for annual NO 2 concentration issued in 2021 ( _Ccooking_ and _Csmoking_ were equal to that in 2019). The _Cambient_ when IT1, IT2, IT3 and AQG were calculated by\n\n【45】    C a m b i e n t \\= { C a m b i e n t i n 2019 f o r O u t d o o r c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n 2019 ≤ T a r g e t T a r g e t × f e x p f o r O u t d o o r c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n 2019 \\> T a r g e t\n\n【46】    (5)\n\n【47】in which _Target_ is the target concentration of NO 2 outdoor, and it is 40 μg/m 3 (IT1), 30 μg/m 3 (IT2), 20 μg/m 3 (IT3), or 10 μg/m 3 (AQG) in this study. _fexp_ is the exposure factor. When outdoor NO 2 enters the indoor environment, some of the NO 2 will be removed by indoor surfaces due to deposition or chemical reaction, resulting in a lower concentration of outdoor-originated NO 2 in indoor environment compared with the concentration of NO 2 outdoor. Besides, there exist variations of outdoor activities, respiratory rate, building ventilation and indoor activities between different populations. _fexp_ is a parameter to modify human exposure to ambient NO 2 considering building ventilation, air exchange rate between indoor and outdoor environments, indoor surface removal due to deposition or chemical reaction, duration of outdoor activities and respiratory rate for different populations. The _fexp_ of NO 2 in 31 provinces in China was used in this study and they were estimated and verified in our previous study ( **Table S3** in appendix). In Eq. (5) , we assumed the concentration of ambient NO 2 will remain the same as that in 2019 for areas where outdoor concentration in 2019 could meet the target. The study by Shi et al. indicate the rural-to-urban migration may increase the emissions of NO 2 outdoor in urban areas in China, resulting in extra environmental pressure. Considering the combining effect of other anthropogenic emission reductions, we think those areas may be some insensitive and thus our assumption is reasonable.\n\n【48】### Concentration-response relationships\n\n【49】The risks of pediatric asthma associated with long‐term exposure to NO 2 have been described using concentration‐response relationships. Khreis et al. reviewed 41 studies published between 1999 and 2016 (20 studies from Europe, 11 from North America, five from Japan, three from China, one from South Korea, and one from Taiwan) to identify meta-analyses of epidemiological studies on ambient NO 2 and pediatric asthma. Following their approach, relative risks ( _RR_ ) of pediatric asthma incidence attributable to ambient NO 2 were determined using the following equation:\n\n【50】R R \\= { 1 f o r C ≤ L C R R 0 C − L C Δ C 0 f o r C \\> L C\n\n【51】(6)\n\n【52】where _RR_ is the relative risk, representing the ratio of the probability of developing asthma for children exposed to NO 2 to the probability of developing pediatric asthma for children in a comparison group. A comparison group was the group exposed to NO 2 at the low-concentration threshold ( _LC_ ), below which there is no risk of pediatric asthma development. _RR0_ represents the change in relative risk for per unit concentration increase ( _△C0_ ). _C_ is the concentration of ambient NO 2 . Khreis and colleagues reported an _RR_ of 1·26 per 10 ppb ambient NO 2 (95% uncertainty interval \\[UI\\] 1·10–1·37) and assumed LC at 2 ppb (0–5) (1ppb NO 2 \\= 0·487 μg/m 3 NO 2 ).\n\n【53】Theoretically, _RR_ should be related to the NO 2 exposure, i.e. the concentration of exposure to NO 2 from both indoor and outdoor sources, as opposed to ambient concentration. So we multiply the reciprocal of the exposure factor ( _1/fexp_ ) by the annual average concentration of human exposure to NO 2 ( _Cexp_ ) to obtain the equivalent ambient concentration. Therefore, we related _RR_ to the concentrations of NO 2 exposure using the following equation:\n\n【54】R R \\= { 1 f o r C ≤ L C R R 0 C e x p / f e x p − L C Δ C 0 f o r C \\> L C\n\n【55】(7)\n\n【56】### NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence\n\n【57】We estimated the number of new-onset pediatric asthma cases attributable to long-term exposure to NO 2 from outdoor source, cooking and second-hand smoke in Chinese urban areas in 2019, and we further projected the reduction of the number of new pediatric asthma cases in the scenarios after restricting NO 2 emissions.\n\n【58】The number of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to human exposure to NO 2 from specific sources ( _ANs_ ) was determined by the proportion of contribution of specific sources in NO 2 exposure ( _PSs_ ), the population attributable fraction of NO 2 exposure and incidences of pediatric asthma ( _PAF_ ), the incidence of pediatric asthma ( _IR_ ), and the population of children ( _N_ ). _PAF_ refers to the proportion of incidence in a population that can be attributed to a certain risk factor, i.e. NO 2 exposure in this study. The new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure from specific sources in Chinese urban areas were calculated with the following equation as that applied in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study in 2019 :\n\n【59】A N s \\= ∑ g ( P S s × P A F g × I R g × N g )\n\n【60】(8)\n\n【61】where the subscript _s_ represents the source of PM 2.5 and it is _ambient, cooking_ , or _SHS_ in this study; the subscript _g_ represents the population with specific age and sex in specific city. The group-specific population size of children ( _N_ ) in Chinese urban areas in 2019 was calculated based on the urban population of each city in 2019 ( **Table S2** in appendix) and the age and gender composition of children of the population of each province ( **Table S5** in appendix). The age-, sex- and province-specific incidence of pediatric asthma ( _IR_ ) for residences in Chinese urban areas in 2019 ( **Table S4** in appendix) was calculated using the age- and sex-specific incidence of pediatric asthma in China in 2019 and the ratio of provincial and regional incidence of pediatric asthma. _PAF_ for the population _g_ was calculated by\n\n【62】P A F g \\= R R g ¯ − 1 R R g ¯\n\n【63】(9)\n\n【64】R R g ¯ \\= ( 1 − P S H S , g ) × R R g , n o n − s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ \\+ P S H S , g × R R g , s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯\n\n【65】(10)\n\n【66】where R R g ¯ is the average relative risk for the population _g_ in 2019, and R R g , s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ and R R g , n o n − s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ are the average _RR_ for people from smoking and non-smoking households in the population _g_ . R R g , s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ in 2019 was calculated based on the annual average concentration of exposure to NO 2 ( _Cexp_ ) for people from smoking households in 2019 and concentration-response relationships of long‐term NO 2 exposure and incident of pediatric asthma ( Eq. (7) ). R R g , n o n − s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ in 2019 was calculated based on _Cexp_ for people from non-smoking households in 2019 and Eq. (7) . The value of _RR_ in 2019 were shown in appendix ( **Table S9** ).\n\n【67】The reductions of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to human exposure to NO 2 from specific sources ( _RANpo_ ) were calculated with the following equations :\n\n【68】R A N p o \\= ∑ g ( P I F p o , g × I R g × N g )\n\n【69】(11)\n\n【70】P I F p o , g \\= R R g ¯ − R R p o , g ¯ R R g ¯\n\n【71】(12)\n\n【72】where _PIF_ is potential impact fraction, referring to the proportion reduction in the incidence in a population when a certain risk factor change, i.e. human exposure to NO 2 in this study. R R p o , g ¯ is the average relative risk for the population _g_ under the scenarios _po_ after restrictions on NO 2 emissions and _po_ is SB, EC, IT1, IT2, IT3 or AQG in this study. R R p o , g ¯ were calculated based on NO 2 exposure ( _Cexp_ ) after restrictions and concentration-response relationships of long‐term exposure to NO 2 and asthma incident in children ( Eq. (7) ). The value of _RRpo_ were provided in appendix ( **Table S9** ).\n\n【73】### Economic losses\n\n【74】In this study, the cost of illness methods was applied to monetize the health effects of NO 2 from direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include the direct costs of treatment and hospitalization related to pediatric asthma. Indirect costs include the reduction in the income due to absence from work for childcare. The total cost in 2019 or reduction of total cost after restrictions on NO 2 emissions ( _Cost_ ) is defined as:\n\n【75】C o s t \\= ( C o s t d \\+ G D P p × T ) × ( A N o r R A N )\n\n【76】(13)\n\n【77】where _Costd_ is the per capita direct costs, _GDPp_ is a daily average of per capita Gross Domestic Product, and _T_ is the per capita treatment and hospitalization days. The age- and sex-specific per capita directs cost and the per capita treatment and hospitalization days was from the China Medical Insurance Research Association database ( **Table S6** in appendix). The _GDPp_ in 330 Chinese cities was from the China city statistical year book-2020 ( **Table S2** in appendix).\n\n【78】### Uncertainty analysis\n\n【79】We applied a two-stage Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the mean and 95% uncertainty interval (95% UI) of the new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure and corresponding economic loss or benefits. The two stages reflected the intra-population variability distribution (human exposure to NO 2 ), and the uncertainty distribution (the concentration-response function, baseline pediatric asthma incidence, direct cost, and the treatment and hospitalization days), respectively. We first performed 2000 iterations at variability stage (i.e. human exposure to NO 2 ) and 1000 iterations at uncertainty stages (i.e. the concentration-response function) to obtain 2000 × 1000 _RR_ s for each population, respectively. We averaged the variability stage to obtain 1000 population-level _RR_ s, and further calculated 1000 population-level _PAF_ and _PIF_ . We further performed 1000 iterations for other uncertainties (i.e. base line pediatric asthma incidence, directs cost, and the treatment and hospitalization days) to obtain new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 and corresponding economic loss or benefits, and reported their mean and 95% UI, i.e. the 2·5th–97·5th percentile of their values in the 1000 uncertainty runs. Finally, we tested the robustness of the model by performing 250 times of Monte Carlo simulations and calculating the error of those 250 simulations. The result showed that the error was within 5%, indicating 2000 × 1000 runs were sufficient to quantify the uncertainty of the projected results.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of funding source\n\n【80】The funding source of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the manuscript.

NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources is associated with 166 thousand (91–223) and 471 thousand (266–628) new pediatric asthma cases in urban areas in China in 2019, respectively, accounting for 74% and 26% of pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 a)</u>. Cooking is the most important indoor source of NO 2 in urban areas, accounting for 25% (161 thousand (88–216) cases) of pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 Estimates of number of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) in urban areas in 2019 (a) number of new pediatric asthma cases from different sources of NO 2 in 2019 (b) number of new pediatric asthma cases in 330 Chinese cities, and (c) percentage of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence from indoor sources to total NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence in 330 Chinese cities.

Shanghai (a municipality), Chongqing (a municipality), and Zhengzhou (the capital of Henan province) are the top three cities with the greatest number of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma cases, with 26·1 thousand (15·1–36·8), 24·2 thousand (13·8–35·6) and 14·1 thousand (9·1–18·4), respectively. Figure 2 **c** shows the percentage of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence from indoor sources to total NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence (hereinafter referred to “the percentage of contribution from indoor sources”) in 330 Chinese cities. The percentage of contribution from indoor sources is higher in cities in the north and northwest of China, where people open their windows less frequently and spend less time outdoors. The top three cities with the highest percentage of contribution from indoor sources are Hegang (67%), Yichun (65%), and Heihe (64%) in Heilongjiang province.\n\n【85】In general, the incidence of pediatric asthma is highest in the youngest age group and decreases with age, and it is higher in boys than girls. Our estimation support this point ( **Table S10** in appendix), with the largest number of new asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure in the youngest age group (less than six years old, 386 thousand (220–521) cases) and a higher number of new cases for boys (385 thousand (212–522) cases) than girls (252 thousand (142–388) cases). However, the number of new asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure is not significantly different between the age groups 7–11 years old and 12–17 years old (7–11 years old, 128 thousand (72–171) cases; 12–17 years old, 123 thousand (62–167) cases). The percentage of contribution from indoor sources is higher for children aged 12–17 years old (31%) than other age groups (less than six years old, 25%; 7–11 years old, 26%), and it is higher for boys (28%) than girls (26%).\n\n【86】### The health benefits of policies on restricting NO 2 emissions\n\n【87】The reduction of the burden of new pediatric asthma associated with NO 2 after restricting the NO 2 emissions is shown in Figure 3 a. Outdoor air meeting the WHO AQG 2021 is projected to be the scenarios with the largest reduction of new pediatric asthma cases, with reductions of 62% (393 thousand (222–523) cases) of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure in 2019. The burden reduction of new pediatric asthma cases by switching from using a gas stove to the electric stove for cooking (EC) is on a par with restricting the NO 2 emissions in outdoor air to meet WHO interim targets 3 (IT3), with reductions of 46% (296 thousand (119–463) cases) and 44% (278 thousand (148–382) cases) of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure in 2019. The smoking ban has little effect on the number of pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 , with a reduction of 2% (16 thousand (-2–44) cases). The percentage of reduction of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence after restricting the indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions to total NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence in 2019 in 330 Chinese cities are shown in Figure 3 b and 3 c, respectively. Pediatric asthma incidences are estimated to be reduced effectively by restrictions on outdoor NO 2 emissions in cities with high population density, such as cities in eastern China. While restrictions on indoor NO 2 emissions effectively reduce pediatric asthma incidences in most areas of China, especially in cities in northern China with more than 80% reductions of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 3 Burden reductions of number of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 by restrictions on NO 2 emissions.

The per capita cost of pediatric asthma is higher in cities with high per capita Gross Domestic Product, such as Shenzhen (4380 (2630–5960) RMB), Beijing (3620 (2220–4940) RMB), and Shanghai (3510 (2150–4740) RMB) ( **Figure S4** ). Pediatric asthma attributable to NO 2 is estimated to cause 1358 million (674–2145) RMB economic losses in Chinese urban areas in 2019. Shanghai was the city with the highest economic losses at 92·7 million (45·1–155·1) RMB. NO 2 from cooking, second-hand smoking, and outdoor source are associated with 323 million (161–513) RMB, 11 million (6–17) RMB, and 1024 million (505–1617) RMB economic losses 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The restrictions on indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions in urban China would reduce the economic loss from pediatric asthma by up to 594 million (228–1052) and 867 million (427–1364) RMB, respectively 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Shanghai would be the city with the most reductions of economic loss from pediatric asthma under both restrictions on indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions.\n\n【90】Table 1 The economic losses due to pediatric asthma attributable to NO 2 in Chinese urban areas \\[mean (95% UI) in million RMB\\].\n\n| Sources of NO 2 | In 2019 | Reductions after restrictions on NO 2 emissions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Outdoor** | **Outdoor** | 1024 (505, 1617) | **IT1** | 209 (79, 365) |\n| **Outdoor** | **Outdoor** | 1024 (505, 1617) | **IT2** | 398 (177, 663) |\n| **Outdoor** | **Outdoor** | 1024 (505, 1617) | **IT3** | 629 (297, 1011) |\n| **Outdoor** | **Outdoor** | 1024 (505, 1617) | **AQG** | 867 (427, 1364) |\n| **Indoor** | **Cooking** | 323 (161, 513) | **EC** | 594 (228, 1052) |\n| **Indoor** | **Smoking** | 11 (6, 17) | **SB** | 42 (1, 114) |\n| **Total** | **Total** | 1358 (674, 2145) |  |  |\n\n【92】a IT, the outdoor air meets the World Health Organization interim target for NO 2 , IT1 = 40 μg/m 3 , IT2 = 30 μg/m 3 , IT3 = 20 μg/m 3 ;\n\n【93】b AQG, the outdoor air meets the World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline for NO 2 , AQG = 10 μg/m 3 ;\n\n【94】c EC, using electric stoves for cooking, under the condition of all residents using electric stoves for cooking in Chinese urban areas;\n\n【95】d SB, smoking ban, under the condition of no people smoking.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【96】Discussion\n----------\n\n【97】Our results show that a large number of pediatric asthma cases in Chinese urban areas in 2019 were attributable to NO 2 , with significant contributions from both indoor and outdoor sources. The cost of each child with asthma is equivalent to about 5% of per capita disposable income in China. The reduction of pediatric asthma cases and its corresponding economic losses by restricting indoor NO 2 emissions is comparable to the burden reduction when outdoor air meets WHO AQG 2021 (i.e. the annual NO 2 concentration lower than 10 μg/m 3 ). The restrictions on indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions are of the essence in reducing pediatric asthma incidence in urban China. The unique approach of this study is estimating the disease burden attributable to exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources separately, and comparing the health benefits of restricting indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions.\n\n【98】NO 2 is an oxidizing gas associated with oxidative stress in asthma morbidity. Studies have identified associations between NO 2 and increased airway responsiveness, airway inflammation, and enhanced responses to allergen. Two latest studies have shown NO 2 \\-attributable new pediatric asthma cases at 4·0 million in 2015 and 1·9 million in 2019 globally. The incidence of new pediatric asthma associated with NO 2 exposure in China in both studies (260 (120–340) per 100 000 children in 2015 and about 129 per 100,000 children in 2019, respectively) are lower than that in our study (360 (202-482) per 100 000 children per year), but similar to the scenario when indoor sources of NO 2 were completely restricted in our study (194 (109–260) per 100 000 children per year). The biases between our results and those of previous studies reflects the serious impact of NO 2 from indoor source on the assessment of NO 2 \\-attributable asthma incidence in children.\n\n【99】_Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan_ was implemented in China in 2013, aiming to reduce the concentration of ambient air pollutants. But the concentration of ambient NO 2 has not decreased significantly in recent years, with the annual average concentration only reduced by 5% from 29·3  g m −3 in 2015 to 27·7 μg m −3 in 2019. Ambient NO 2 is traffic-related air pollution associated with the combustion of gasoline and diesel in vehicles. Transportation contributes up to 80% of ambient NO 2 in urban areas. Population growth, extensive urbanization, and wealth creation have combined to create ever-increasing traffic volumes in urban areas in China, making it increasingly difficult to reduce ambient NO 2 pollution. Studies have shown that replacing the traditional fossil energy vehicles with new energy vehicles would lead to substantial reductions of ambient NO 2 (30–80%) in most of China. General Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued _the Development Plan for New Energy Vehicle Industry (2021–2035)_ on November 2, 2020, to increase the new energy vehicles quotas in total vehicle production, aiming at peaking fossil fuels consumption of land transport by 2030. This policy would bring benefits in terms of reduce ambient NO 2 concentrations in China.\n\n【100】Despite the policies on developing new energy vehicles, it might be decades before the ambient NO 2 meet the WHO AQG 2021. Prior to this time point, restricting NO 2 from indoor sources would reap health benefits efficiently, especially in reducing pediatric asthma incidence in Chinese urban areas. Switching from using a gas stove to the electric stove for cooking to reduce the NO 2 produced by gas combustion is a vital strategy to restrict NO 2 emissions indoors. With the popularity of induction cookers and ceramic cooktops in China in recent years, the acceptability of electric stoves in Chinese families has been increasing year by year. However, using gas stoves for cooking is still mainstream in households in Chinese urban areas. It is necessary to encourage the use of electric stoves for cooking in Chinese urban areas. The government may need to provide some preferential policies to increase the utilization rate of electric stoves. The increase in the utilization rate of electric stoves is accompanied by the increase in demand for electricity and a decrease in demand for gas in residence. The urban energy system needs to be adjusted accordingly to meet the new demand for energy.\n\n【101】The measures for restriction on NO 2 emissions from indoor and outdoor reflect the demand to adjust the energy consumption structure of residences and transportations in Chinese urban areas, respectively. Traditional energy consumption is accompanied by greenhouse gas emissions. China pledged to achieve the goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 at the 2019 Climate Action Summit. Developing new energy and constructing new electrical power systems, including the power systems for transportation and residences, are important measures to achieve this goal. These actions may be a win-win opportunity for not only China but also other developing countries which are facing both climate change and air pollution challenges.\n\n【102】Several limitations exist in our approach. First, we applied the concentration-response function from a meta-analysis of studies in multiple countries around the world to estimate the NO 2 \\-attributable burden of pediatric asthma incidence in urban areas in China. The relative risk from east Asia weighted 22·8% in the meta-analysis. Our sensitivity analysis using the pooled relative risk from studies in east Asia showed a low uncertainty ( **Figure S3** in appendix). It should be noted that NO 2 from indoor cooking is mixed with other air pollutants from burning oil, heating ingredient and stirring ingredient. Applying the coefficient of concentration-response function from ambient NO 2 for the indoor part may introduce some uncertainties. However, NO 2 is produced from gas combustion during cooking and it can be reduced by changing the type of energy to cook (i.e. switching from gas to electricity), and this is different from those pollutants produced from burning oil, heating ingredient or stirring ingredient. Therefore, other pollutants produced during cooking are not necessarily accompanied by the emission of NO 2 . As our aim was to analyze the disease burden attributable to NO 2 itself, rather than the disease burden associated with all the air pollutants from cooking, the concentration-response function from ambient NO 2 is still applicable to this study. Secondly, we estimated exposure to NO 2 from two main indoor sources, i.e. cooking and second-hand smoke. Another indoor source of NO 2 , wall-mounted gas boiler, was not considered in this study. The wall-mounted gas boilers are equipped with enclosed combustors and exhaust ducts, which emit negligible NO 2 indoors compared to cooking and smoking. Due to central heating systems in northern China, the wall-mounted gas boilers were mainly used in families in southern China. Studies have shown the low usage of wall-mounted gas boilers in south China. So the contribution of wall-mounted gas boiler to NO 2 exposure is too low to affect the incidence of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence in this study. Thirdly, we estimated the incidence of pediatric asthma associated with an annual average exposure of NO 2 , while the time period of changes in NO 2 exposure may also influence the incidence and introduce uncertainties. Zhu et al. studied temporal variations of short-term associations between NO 2 concentrations and emergency department visits in Shanghai, China, in 2008–2019. They found the associations of emergency department visits and NO 2 remained stable over the study period. This evidence means that effects on pediatric asthma incidence for NO 2 may also remain stable over time, and we expect more direct evidence in future studies.\n\n【103】Despite these limitations, our results showed that indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions are associated with the disease burden of pediatric asthma incidence in households without using solid fuels and kerosene. The implementation of the policies on developing clean and alternative energy vehicles has brought hope for reducing ambient NO 2 pollution in the future. We call on individuals to use the electricity for cooking instead of gas to reduce exposure to NO 2 from indoor sources. The government may need to adjust the energy structure of residences to meet the new demand for energy. These measurements on restrictions of NO 2 emissions, i.e. developing new energy vehicles and switching from gas stove to electric stove, support clean energy consumption and aid in achieving climate change mitigation.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【104】**Ying Hu** designed the study and planned the analysis, performed the model analysis, analyzed the results, interpreted the results, validated and completed all figures, and drafted the manuscript. **John S.

We estimated the pediatric asthma incidence and corresponding economic losses attributable to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in urban areas in China.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in 2019 were estimated separately with a source-specific model validated by measurements from different studies, and NO 2 exposure after restricting emissions indoor (from cooking or second-hand smoking) and outdoor (to meet WHO interim targets and air quality guideline) were projected. Disease burden of NO 2 \\-attributable new-onset pediatric asthma were estimated based on NO 2 exposure, concentration-response function from a meta-analysis, and number of pediatric asthma populations. Economic impacts were estimated based on the costs of pediatric asthma in China.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】In China, NO 2 is associated with an estimated 637,000 (95% uncertainty interval 358,000–851,000) new pediatric asthma cases and 1,358 million (674–2145) RMB economic losses in urban areas in 2019. 296,000 (222,000–523,000) new pediatric asthma cases would be prevented each year by restricting NO 2 emissions indoor, i.e. switching from using gas stoves to electic stoves for cooking. 393,000 (119,000–463,000) new pediatric asthma cases would be prevented each year when outdoor air meets the air quality guideline for NO 2 (< 10 µg/m 3 ).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Restricting both indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions are necessary to reduce pediatric asthma incidence in urban areas.

Epidemiological studies have reported a significant association between ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), recognized as a proxy of traffic-related air pollution, and pediatric asthma, the most common chronic disease among children worldwide. There are also evident sources of NO 2 indoor even in areas with no use of solid fuels and kerosene, i.e. NO 2 produced during the combustion of tobacco and gaseous fuels. Latest study has demonstrated the comparable contributions of NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in the air people breath. However, no studies focused on the disease burden of NO 2 from indoor sources, let alone the health benefits of restrictions on indoor NO 2 emissions.\n\n【15】### Added value of this study\n\n【16】The uniqueness of this study is estimating the disease burden attributable to exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources separately; and comparing the health benefits of restricting indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions. We focused on urban areas in China, where facing serious air pollution of NO 2 both indoor and outdoor. NO 2 is estimated to attribute to hundreds of thousands of pediatric asthma cases in Chinese urban areas in 2019, with significantly contributions of NO 2 from both indoor and outdoor sources. The cost associated with asthma of each child with asthma is equivalent to about 5% per capita disposable income in China. The reduction of pediatric asthma cases by restricting indoor NO 2 emissions, i.e. switching from using gas stoves to electric stoves for cooking, is comparable to the burden reduction when outdoor air meets WHO air quality guideline issued in 2021.\n\n【17】### Implications of the available evidence\n\n【18】This study demonstrates the importance of restricting indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions to reduce the disease burden attributable to NO 2 , typically in pediatric asthma incidence. The measurements to restrict indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions, i.e. switching from using gas stove to electric stove for cooking and switching the traditional fossil energy vehicles to new energy vehicles, reflect the demand to adjust the energy consumption structure. These actions may be a win–win opportunity for countries facing both climate change and air pollution challenges.\n\n【19】Introduction\n------------\n\n【20】Air pollution is one of the top five risk factors for disease burden around the world according to the latest estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. Reducing disease burden attributed to air pollution is also a key indicator of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, as well as Goal 11 for sustainable cities and communities. Long-term exposure to high levels of air pollutions would lead to a variety of non-communicable diseases, particularly for children. Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children worldwide, with rising incidences in developing economies. While air pollution control measures have been haphazardly effective in controlling particulate matter exposures, anthropogenic sources of NO 2 mainly derived from include on-road and non-road transportation tailpipe emissions may not correlate with particulate matter control measures. There are recent advancements in our understanding of NO 2 and onset of allergic diseases. Epidemiological studies have provided evidences of the associations between air pollutants and new-onset asthma in children. The evidence for other air pollutants (e.g. fine particulate matter) is mixed except for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). Epidemiological studies in Europe, North America, Japan, China, Korea have consistently shown a significant positive association between NO 2 and pediatric asthma incidence. Achakulwisut et al. have linked NO 2 with about 4·0 million annual number of new pediatric asthma cases in 194 countries. And China has been estimated to have the most considerable national burdens of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma, with 760,000 new cases per year and more than 50% of the cases occurring in urban areas.\n\n【21】The World Health Organization (WHO) issued new Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) on Sept 22, 2021 (WHO AQG 2021), setting AQG for NO 2 of annual averaged concentration of 10 μg/m 3 and applied for both indoor and outdoor air. NO 2 is usually thought of as a proxy of traffic-related air pollution. Whereas there are also evident sources of NO 2 indoor, i.e. NO 2 produced during combustion processes indoors, such as cooking (i.e. gas combustion) and smoking (i.e. tobacco combustion), even in areas without using solid fuels and kerosene. Urban areas are typical areas with heavy traffic and do not use solid fuels and kerosene, especially in urban China where the population density is extremely high. Our latest study figured out indoor sources contribute ∼33% to human exposure to NO 2 in Chinese urban. Despite the importance of indoor sources in NO 2 exposure, to the best of our knowledge, no studies focus on the disease burden of NO 2 from indoor sources, let alone the policies to restrict NO 2 emitted indoors. This is unique compared with those previous studies focused on outdoor NO 2 . The formulation of policies to restrict the NO 2 produced indoor, such as implementing a smoking ban and using electric stoves for cooking, may well be an essential initiative to reduce the disease burden attributable to NO 2 exposure.\n\n【22】In this study, we estimated the number of pediatric asthma cases and corresponding economic losses attributable to exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in Chinese urban areas in 2019. We further projected and compared the health benefits and corresponding economic benefits of policies on restricting the NO 2 emissions indoor and outdoor.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】### Overview\n\n【25】We first generated the concentration of children exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in urban areas in China in 2019 from a previous modeling study (boys and girls in 6 age groups, i.e. 0–0·5 y, 0·5–1 y, 1-2 y, 3–6 y, 7–11 y, 12–17 y, from 330 Chinese cities). We estimated the NO 2 exposure after restricting NO 2 emissions from indoor and outdoor sources. We then explored pediatric asthma incidence attributable to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources for urban areas in China in 2019. We projected the reduction of pediatric asthma incidence after restrictions on NO 2 emissions. We also estimated the economic burden associated with NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence with the cost of illness methods. The methodology framework is shown in Figure 1 . The uncertainty interval (UI) of the results was obtained by Monte Carlo method.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Methodology framework.</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download Hi-res image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【26】### Exposure to NO 2 from different sources in 2019\n\n【27】For human exposure to outdoor sources, it is the sum of exposure to outdoor originated NO 2 indoor when people stay indoors and exposure to outdoor NO 2 directly when people stay outdoor. Human exposure to indoor sources is the exposure to NO 2 emitted from gas combustion during cooking and tobacco combustion during smoking. The concentration of NO 2 exposure is defined as the average concentration of NO 2 in the air people breathe during the studied period, reporting in µg/m 3 . We estimated the concentration of human exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources in Chinese urban areas in 2019 based on a validated source-specific model in our previous study. The model and its validation were detailed in the appendix ( **Note S1** and **Figure S1** ). The annual average concentration of human exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources for children of 6 age groups (i.e. 0–0·5, 0·5–1, 1-2, 3–6, 7–11, 12–17 years old) and two genders (boys and girls) and exposure to second-hand smoke or not (from smoking and non-smoking households) in urban areas in 330 Chinese cities in 2019 were provided in Table S13 in Hu and Zhao. Mean and standard deviation in Table S13 in Hu and Zhao indicates the intra-population variability distribution of NO 2 exposure.\n\n【28】The annual average concentration of NO 2 exposure from cooking, second-hand smoking and outdoor sources were represented by the parameters _Ccooking, CSHS_ and _Cambient_ , respectively. _Ccooking_ and _Cambient_ in 2019 were provided as IEC (indoor source exposure concentration) and OEC (outdoor source exposure concentration) for non-smoking households in Table S13 in Hu and Zhao. _CSHS_ for people from smoking households in 2019 was calculated with the following equation:\n\n【29】C S H S \\= C i n d o o r , s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d − C c o o k i n g\n\n【30】(1)\n\n【31】where _Cindoor,smoking household_ is the annual average concentration of people from smoking households exposed to NO 2 from indoor sources. _Cindoor,smoking household_ in Chinese urban areas in 2019 was provided as IEC for smoking households in Table S13 in Hu and Zhao. The annual average concentration of human exposure to NO 2 from all sources were represented by _Cexp. Cexp_ for people from non-smoking households were the sum of _Ccooking_ and _Cambient_ and it is the sum of _Ccooking, CSHS_ and _Cambient_ for people from smoking households.\n\n【32】The proportion of the contribution of cooking, second-hand smoke, and outdoor sources in NO 2 exposure for a population of specific age groups (6 age groups, i.e. 0–0·5, 0·5–1, 1-2, 3–6, 7–11 and 12–17) and sex groups (boys and girls) in specific cities (330 Chinese cities) were calculated with the following equations:\n\n【33】P S a m b i e n t \\= C a m b i e n t ¯ C c o o k i n g ¯ \\+ C a m b i e n t ¯ \\+ P S H S × C S H S ¯\n\n【34】(2)\n\n【35】P S c o o k i n g \\= C c o o k i n g ¯ C c o o k i n g ¯ \\+ C a m b i e n t ¯ \\+ P S H S × C S H S ¯\n\n【36】(3)\n\n【37】P S S H S \\= P S H S × C S H S ¯ C c o o k i n g ¯ \\+ C a m b i e n t ¯ \\+ P S H S × C S H S ¯\n\n【38】(4)\n\n【39】_PS_ is the proportion of the contribution of different sources in NO 2 exposure, the subscripts _ambient, cooking_ and _SHS_ of _PS_ are the outdoor sources, cooking, and second-hand smoke. C a m b i e n t ¯ , C c o o k i n g ¯ , and C S H S ¯ are the mean of _Cambient, Ccooking_ , and _CSHS_ , respectively. _PSHS_ is the proportion of the population exposed to second-hand smoke. The details of calculation of _PSHS_ were provided in the appendix ( **Note S2** ). The value of _PS_ in 2019 were shown in appendix ( **Figure S2** ).\n\n【40】### NO 2 exposure after restrictions\n\n【41】The restrictions on indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions included a smoking ban, switching from using a gas stove to electric stove for cooking, and reducing NO 2 emitted outdoor. To see the scope for health benefits from these policies, we projected the scenarios where these policies were 100% achieved ( **Table S1** in appendix):\n\n【42】*   smoking ban (SB): no people smoking, to reduce the NO 2 produced by tobacco combustion during smoking ( _PSHS_ \\=0; _Ccooking_ and _Cambient_ were equal to that in 2019);\n\n【43】*   switching from using a gas stove to electric stove for cooking (EC): all residents using electric stove for cooking in Chinese urban areas, to reduce the NO 2 produced by gas combustion during cooking ( _Ccooking_ \\=0; _Csmoking_ and _Cambient_ were equal to that in 2019);\n\n【44】*   reducing NO 2 emitted outdoor: the outdoor air meets the WHO interim targets (IT) and AQG for annual NO 2 concentration issued in 2021 ( _Ccooking_ and _Csmoking_ were equal to that in 2019). The _Cambient_ when IT1, IT2, IT3 and AQG were calculated by\n\n【45】    C a m b i e n t \\= { C a m b i e n t i n 2019 f o r O u t d o o r c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n 2019 ≤ T a r g e t T a r g e t × f e x p f o r O u t d o o r c o n c e n t r a t i o n i n 2019 \\> T a r g e t\n\n【46】    (5)\n\n【47】in which _Target_ is the target concentration of NO 2 outdoor, and it is 40 μg/m 3 (IT1), 30 μg/m 3 (IT2), 20 μg/m 3 (IT3), or 10 μg/m 3 (AQG) in this study. _fexp_ is the exposure factor. When outdoor NO 2 enters the indoor environment, some of the NO 2 will be removed by indoor surfaces due to deposition or chemical reaction, resulting in a lower concentration of outdoor-originated NO 2 in indoor environment compared with the concentration of NO 2 outdoor. Besides, there exist variations of outdoor activities, respiratory rate, building ventilation and indoor activities between different populations. _fexp_ is a parameter to modify human exposure to ambient NO 2 considering building ventilation, air exchange rate between indoor and outdoor environments, indoor surface removal due to deposition or chemical reaction, duration of outdoor activities and respiratory rate for different populations. The _fexp_ of NO 2 in 31 provinces in China was used in this study and they were estimated and verified in our previous study ( **Table S3** in appendix). In Eq. (5) , we assumed the concentration of ambient NO 2 will remain the same as that in 2019 for areas where outdoor concentration in 2019 could meet the target. The study by Shi et al. indicate the rural-to-urban migration may increase the emissions of NO 2 outdoor in urban areas in China, resulting in extra environmental pressure. Considering the combining effect of other anthropogenic emission reductions, we think those areas may be some insensitive and thus our assumption is reasonable.\n\n【48】### Concentration-response relationships\n\n【49】The risks of pediatric asthma associated with long‐term exposure to NO 2 have been described using concentration‐response relationships. Khreis et al. reviewed 41 studies published between 1999 and 2016 (20 studies from Europe, 11 from North America, five from Japan, three from China, one from South Korea, and one from Taiwan) to identify meta-analyses of epidemiological studies on ambient NO 2 and pediatric asthma. Following their approach, relative risks ( _RR_ ) of pediatric asthma incidence attributable to ambient NO 2 were determined using the following equation:\n\n【50】R R \\= { 1 f o r C ≤ L C R R 0 C − L C Δ C 0 f o r C \\> L C\n\n【51】(6)\n\n【52】where _RR_ is the relative risk, representing the ratio of the probability of developing asthma for children exposed to NO 2 to the probability of developing pediatric asthma for children in a comparison group. A comparison group was the group exposed to NO 2 at the low-concentration threshold ( _LC_ ), below which there is no risk of pediatric asthma development. _RR0_ represents the change in relative risk for per unit concentration increase ( _△C0_ ). _C_ is the concentration of ambient NO 2 . Khreis and colleagues reported an _RR_ of 1·26 per 10 ppb ambient NO 2 (95% uncertainty interval \\[UI\\] 1·10–1·37) and assumed LC at 2 ppb (0–5) (1ppb NO 2 \\= 0·487 μg/m 3 NO 2 ).\n\n【53】Theoretically, _RR_ should be related to the NO 2 exposure, i.e. the concentration of exposure to NO 2 from both indoor and outdoor sources, as opposed to ambient concentration. So we multiply the reciprocal of the exposure factor ( _1/fexp_ ) by the annual average concentration of human exposure to NO 2 ( _Cexp_ ) to obtain the equivalent ambient concentration. Therefore, we related _RR_ to the concentrations of NO 2 exposure using the following equation:\n\n【54】R R \\= { 1 f o r C ≤ L C R R 0 C e x p / f e x p − L C Δ C 0 f o r C \\> L C\n\n【55】(7)\n\n【56】### NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence\n\n【57】We estimated the number of new-onset pediatric asthma cases attributable to long-term exposure to NO 2 from outdoor source, cooking and second-hand smoke in Chinese urban areas in 2019, and we further projected the reduction of the number of new pediatric asthma cases in the scenarios after restricting NO 2 emissions.\n\n【58】The number of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to human exposure to NO 2 from specific sources ( _ANs_ ) was determined by the proportion of contribution of specific sources in NO 2 exposure ( _PSs_ ), the population attributable fraction of NO 2 exposure and incidences of pediatric asthma ( _PAF_ ), the incidence of pediatric asthma ( _IR_ ), and the population of children ( _N_ ). _PAF_ refers to the proportion of incidence in a population that can be attributed to a certain risk factor, i.e. NO 2 exposure in this study. The new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure from specific sources in Chinese urban areas were calculated with the following equation as that applied in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study in 2019 :\n\n【59】A N s \\= ∑ g ( P S s × P A F g × I R g × N g )\n\n【60】(8)\n\n【61】where the subscript _s_ represents the source of PM 2.5 and it is _ambient, cooking_ , or _SHS_ in this study; the subscript _g_ represents the population with specific age and sex in specific city. The group-specific population size of children ( _N_ ) in Chinese urban areas in 2019 was calculated based on the urban population of each city in 2019 ( **Table S2** in appendix) and the age and gender composition of children of the population of each province ( **Table S5** in appendix). The age-, sex- and province-specific incidence of pediatric asthma ( _IR_ ) for residences in Chinese urban areas in 2019 ( **Table S4** in appendix) was calculated using the age- and sex-specific incidence of pediatric asthma in China in 2019 and the ratio of provincial and regional incidence of pediatric asthma. _PAF_ for the population _g_ was calculated by\n\n【62】P A F g \\= R R g ¯ − 1 R R g ¯\n\n【63】(9)\n\n【64】R R g ¯ \\= ( 1 − P S H S , g ) × R R g , n o n − s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ \\+ P S H S , g × R R g , s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯\n\n【65】(10)\n\n【66】where R R g ¯ is the average relative risk for the population _g_ in 2019, and R R g , s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ and R R g , n o n − s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ are the average _RR_ for people from smoking and non-smoking households in the population _g_ . R R g , s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ in 2019 was calculated based on the annual average concentration of exposure to NO 2 ( _Cexp_ ) for people from smoking households in 2019 and concentration-response relationships of long‐term NO 2 exposure and incident of pediatric asthma ( Eq. (7) ). R R g , n o n − s m o k i n g h o u s e h o l d ¯ in 2019 was calculated based on _Cexp_ for people from non-smoking households in 2019 and Eq. (7) . The value of _RR_ in 2019 were shown in appendix ( **Table S9** ).\n\n【67】The reductions of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to human exposure to NO 2 from specific sources ( _RANpo_ ) were calculated with the following equations :\n\n【68】R A N p o \\= ∑ g ( P I F p o , g × I R g × N g )\n\n【69】(11)\n\n【70】P I F p o , g \\= R R g ¯ − R R p o , g ¯ R R g ¯\n\n【71】(12)\n\n【72】where _PIF_ is potential impact fraction, referring to the proportion reduction in the incidence in a population when a certain risk factor change, i.e. human exposure to NO 2 in this study. R R p o , g ¯ is the average relative risk for the population _g_ under the scenarios _po_ after restrictions on NO 2 emissions and _po_ is SB, EC, IT1, IT2, IT3 or AQG in this study. R R p o , g ¯ were calculated based on NO 2 exposure ( _Cexp_ ) after restrictions and concentration-response relationships of long‐term exposure to NO 2 and asthma incident in children ( Eq. (7) ). The value of _RRpo_ were provided in appendix ( **Table S9** ).\n\n【73】### Economic losses\n\n【74】In this study, the cost of illness methods was applied to monetize the health effects of NO 2 from direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include the direct costs of treatment and hospitalization related to pediatric asthma. Indirect costs include the reduction in the income due to absence from work for childcare. The total cost in 2019 or reduction of total cost after restrictions on NO 2 emissions ( _Cost_ ) is defined as:\n\n【75】C o s t \\= ( C o s t d \\+ G D P p × T ) × ( A N o r R A N )\n\n【76】(13)\n\n【77】where _Costd_ is the per capita direct costs, _GDPp_ is a daily average of per capita Gross Domestic Product, and _T_ is the per capita treatment and hospitalization days. The age- and sex-specific per capita directs cost and the per capita treatment and hospitalization days was from the China Medical Insurance Research Association database ( **Table S6** in appendix). The _GDPp_ in 330 Chinese cities was from the China city statistical year book-2020 ( **Table S2** in appendix).\n\n【78】### Uncertainty analysis\n\n【79】We applied a two-stage Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the mean and 95% uncertainty interval (95% UI) of the new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure and corresponding economic loss or benefits. The two stages reflected the intra-population variability distribution (human exposure to NO 2 ), and the uncertainty distribution (the concentration-response function, baseline pediatric asthma incidence, direct cost, and the treatment and hospitalization days), respectively. We first performed 2000 iterations at variability stage (i.e. human exposure to NO 2 ) and 1000 iterations at uncertainty stages (i.e. the concentration-response function) to obtain 2000 × 1000 _RR_ s for each population, respectively. We averaged the variability stage to obtain 1000 population-level _RR_ s, and further calculated 1000 population-level _PAF_ and _PIF_ . We further performed 1000 iterations for other uncertainties (i.e. base line pediatric asthma incidence, directs cost, and the treatment and hospitalization days) to obtain new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 and corresponding economic loss or benefits, and reported their mean and 95% UI, i.e. the 2·5th–97·5th percentile of their values in the 1000 uncertainty runs. Finally, we tested the robustness of the model by performing 250 times of Monte Carlo simulations and calculating the error of those 250 simulations. The result showed that the error was within 5%, indicating 2000 × 1000 runs were sufficient to quantify the uncertainty of the projected results.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of funding source\n\n【80】The funding source of the study had no role in the study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the manuscript.

NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources is associated with 166 thousand (91–223) and 471 thousand (266–628) new pediatric asthma cases in urban areas in China in 2019, respectively, accounting for 74% and 26% of pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure 删除2:<u>( Figure 2 a)</u>. Cooking is the most important indoor source of NO 2 in urban areas, accounting for 25% (161 thousand (88–216) cases) of pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 2 Estimates of number of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) in urban areas in 2019 (a) number of new pediatric asthma cases from different sources of NO 2 in 2019 (b) number of new pediatric asthma cases in 330 Chinese cities, and (c) percentage of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence from indoor sources to total NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence in 330 Chinese cities.

Shanghai (a municipality), Chongqing (a municipality), and Zhengzhou (the capital of Henan province) are the top three cities with the greatest number of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma cases, with 26·1 thousand (15·1–36·8), 24·2 thousand (13·8–35·6) and 14·1 thousand (9·1–18·4), respectively. Figure 2 **c** shows the percentage of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence from indoor sources to total NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence (hereinafter referred to “the percentage of contribution from indoor sources”) in 330 Chinese cities. The percentage of contribution from indoor sources is higher in cities in the north and northwest of China, where people open their windows less frequently and spend less time outdoors. The top three cities with the highest percentage of contribution from indoor sources are Hegang (67%), Yichun (65%), and Heihe (64%) in Heilongjiang province.\n\n【85】In general, the incidence of pediatric asthma is highest in the youngest age group and decreases with age, and it is higher in boys than girls. Our estimation support this point ( **Table S10** in appendix), with the largest number of new asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure in the youngest age group (less than six years old, 386 thousand (220–521) cases) and a higher number of new cases for boys (385 thousand (212–522) cases) than girls (252 thousand (142–388) cases). However, the number of new asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure is not significantly different between the age groups 7–11 years old and 12–17 years old (7–11 years old, 128 thousand (72–171) cases; 12–17 years old, 123 thousand (62–167) cases). The percentage of contribution from indoor sources is higher for children aged 12–17 years old (31%) than other age groups (less than six years old, 25%; 7–11 years old, 26%), and it is higher for boys (28%) than girls (26%).\n\n【86】### The health benefits of policies on restricting NO 2 emissions\n\n【87】The reduction of the burden of new pediatric asthma associated with NO 2 after restricting the NO 2 emissions is shown in Figure 3 a. Outdoor air meeting the WHO AQG 2021 is projected to be the scenarios with the largest reduction of new pediatric asthma cases, with reductions of 62% (393 thousand (222–523) cases) of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure in 2019. The burden reduction of new pediatric asthma cases by switching from using a gas stove to the electric stove for cooking (EC) is on a par with restricting the NO 2 emissions in outdoor air to meet WHO interim targets 3 (IT3), with reductions of 46% (296 thousand (119–463) cases) and 44% (278 thousand (148–382) cases) of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure in 2019. The smoking ban has little effect on the number of pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 , with a reduction of 2% (16 thousand (-2–44) cases). The percentage of reduction of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence after restricting the indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions to total NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence in 2019 in 330 Chinese cities are shown in Figure 3 b and 3 c, respectively. Pediatric asthma incidences are estimated to be reduced effectively by restrictions on outdoor NO 2 emissions in cities with high population density, such as cities in eastern China. While restrictions on indoor NO 2 emissions effectively reduce pediatric asthma incidences in most areas of China, especially in cities in northern China with more than 80% reductions of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 exposure.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 3 Burden reductions of number of new pediatric asthma cases attributable to NO 2 by restrictions on NO 2 emissions.

The per capita cost of pediatric asthma is higher in cities with high per capita Gross Domestic Product, such as Shenzhen (4380 (2630–5960) RMB), Beijing (3620 (2220–4940) RMB), and Shanghai (3510 (2150–4740) RMB) ( **Figure S4** ). Pediatric asthma attributable to NO 2 is estimated to cause 1358 million (674–2145) RMB economic losses in Chinese urban areas in 2019. Shanghai was the city with the highest economic losses at 92·7 million (45·1–155·1) RMB. NO 2 from cooking, second-hand smoking, and outdoor source are associated with 323 million (161–513) RMB, 11 million (6–17) RMB, and 1024 million (505–1617) RMB economic losses 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. The restrictions on indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions in urban China would reduce the economic loss from pediatric asthma by up to 594 million (228–1052) and 867 million (427–1364) RMB, respectively 删除2:<u>( Table 1 )</u>. Shanghai would be the city with the most reductions of economic loss from pediatric asthma under both restrictions on indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions.\n\n【90】Table 1 The economic losses due to pediatric asthma attributable to NO 2 in Chinese urban areas \\[mean (95% UI) in million RMB\\].\n\n| Sources of NO 2 | In 2019 | Reductions after restrictions on NO 2 emissions |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Outdoor** | **Outdoor** | 1024 (505, 1617) | **IT1** | 209 (79, 365) |\n| **Outdoor** | **Outdoor** | 1024 (505, 1617) | **IT2** | 398 (177, 663) |\n| **Outdoor** | **Outdoor** | 1024 (505, 1617) | **IT3** | 629 (297, 1011) |\n| **Outdoor** | **Outdoor** | 1024 (505, 1617) | **AQG** | 867 (427, 1364) |\n| **Indoor** | **Cooking** | 323 (161, 513) | **EC** | 594 (228, 1052) |\n| **Indoor** | **Smoking** | 11 (6, 17) | **SB** | 42 (1, 114) |\n| **Total** | **Total** | 1358 (674, 2145) |  |  |\n\n【92】a IT, the outdoor air meets the World Health Organization interim target for NO 2 , IT1 = 40 μg/m 3 , IT2 = 30 μg/m 3 , IT3 = 20 μg/m 3 ;\n\n【93】b AQG, the outdoor air meets the World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline for NO 2 , AQG = 10 μg/m 3 ;\n\n【94】c EC, using electric stoves for cooking, under the condition of all residents using electric stoves for cooking in Chinese urban areas;\n\n【95】d SB, smoking ban, under the condition of no people smoking.\n删除4:<u>\n*   Open table in a new tab</u>\n\n【96】Discussion\n----------\n\n【97】Our results show that a large number of pediatric asthma cases in Chinese urban areas in 2019 were attributable to NO 2 , with significant contributions from both indoor and outdoor sources. The cost of each child with asthma is equivalent to about 5% of per capita disposable income in China. The reduction of pediatric asthma cases and its corresponding economic losses by restricting indoor NO 2 emissions is comparable to the burden reduction when outdoor air meets WHO AQG 2021 (i.e. the annual NO 2 concentration lower than 10 μg/m 3 ). The restrictions on indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions are of the essence in reducing pediatric asthma incidence in urban China. The unique approach of this study is estimating the disease burden attributable to exposure to NO 2 from indoor and outdoor sources separately, and comparing the health benefits of restricting indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions.\n\n【98】NO 2 is an oxidizing gas associated with oxidative stress in asthma morbidity. Studies have identified associations between NO 2 and increased airway responsiveness, airway inflammation, and enhanced responses to allergen. Two latest studies have shown NO 2 \\-attributable new pediatric asthma cases at 4·0 million in 2015 and 1·9 million in 2019 globally. The incidence of new pediatric asthma associated with NO 2 exposure in China in both studies (260 (120–340) per 100 000 children in 2015 and about 129 per 100,000 children in 2019, respectively) are lower than that in our study (360 (202-482) per 100 000 children per year), but similar to the scenario when indoor sources of NO 2 were completely restricted in our study (194 (109–260) per 100 000 children per year). The biases between our results and those of previous studies reflects the serious impact of NO 2 from indoor source on the assessment of NO 2 \\-attributable asthma incidence in children.\n\n【99】_Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan_ was implemented in China in 2013, aiming to reduce the concentration of ambient air pollutants. But the concentration of ambient NO 2 has not decreased significantly in recent years, with the annual average concentration only reduced by 5% from 29·3  g m −3 in 2015 to 27·7 μg m −3 in 2019. Ambient NO 2 is traffic-related air pollution associated with the combustion of gasoline and diesel in vehicles. Transportation contributes up to 80% of ambient NO 2 in urban areas. Population growth, extensive urbanization, and wealth creation have combined to create ever-increasing traffic volumes in urban areas in China, making it increasingly difficult to reduce ambient NO 2 pollution. Studies have shown that replacing the traditional fossil energy vehicles with new energy vehicles would lead to substantial reductions of ambient NO 2 (30–80%) in most of China. General Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued _the Development Plan for New Energy Vehicle Industry (2021–2035)_ on November 2, 2020, to increase the new energy vehicles quotas in total vehicle production, aiming at peaking fossil fuels consumption of land transport by 2030. This policy would bring benefits in terms of reduce ambient NO 2 concentrations in China.\n\n【100】Despite the policies on developing new energy vehicles, it might be decades before the ambient NO 2 meet the WHO AQG 2021. Prior to this time point, restricting NO 2 from indoor sources would reap health benefits efficiently, especially in reducing pediatric asthma incidence in Chinese urban areas. Switching from using a gas stove to the electric stove for cooking to reduce the NO 2 produced by gas combustion is a vital strategy to restrict NO 2 emissions indoors. With the popularity of induction cookers and ceramic cooktops in China in recent years, the acceptability of electric stoves in Chinese families has been increasing year by year. However, using gas stoves for cooking is still mainstream in households in Chinese urban areas. It is necessary to encourage the use of electric stoves for cooking in Chinese urban areas. The government may need to provide some preferential policies to increase the utilization rate of electric stoves. The increase in the utilization rate of electric stoves is accompanied by the increase in demand for electricity and a decrease in demand for gas in residence. The urban energy system needs to be adjusted accordingly to meet the new demand for energy.\n\n【101】The measures for restriction on NO 2 emissions from indoor and outdoor reflect the demand to adjust the energy consumption structure of residences and transportations in Chinese urban areas, respectively. Traditional energy consumption is accompanied by greenhouse gas emissions. China pledged to achieve the goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2050 at the 2019 Climate Action Summit. Developing new energy and constructing new electrical power systems, including the power systems for transportation and residences, are important measures to achieve this goal. These actions may be a win-win opportunity for not only China but also other developing countries which are facing both climate change and air pollution challenges.\n\n【102】Several limitations exist in our approach. First, we applied the concentration-response function from a meta-analysis of studies in multiple countries around the world to estimate the NO 2 \\-attributable burden of pediatric asthma incidence in urban areas in China. The relative risk from east Asia weighted 22·8% in the meta-analysis. Our sensitivity analysis using the pooled relative risk from studies in east Asia showed a low uncertainty ( **Figure S3** in appendix). It should be noted that NO 2 from indoor cooking is mixed with other air pollutants from burning oil, heating ingredient and stirring ingredient. Applying the coefficient of concentration-response function from ambient NO 2 for the indoor part may introduce some uncertainties. However, NO 2 is produced from gas combustion during cooking and it can be reduced by changing the type of energy to cook (i.e. switching from gas to electricity), and this is different from those pollutants produced from burning oil, heating ingredient or stirring ingredient. Therefore, other pollutants produced during cooking are not necessarily accompanied by the emission of NO 2 . As our aim was to analyze the disease burden attributable to NO 2 itself, rather than the disease burden associated with all the air pollutants from cooking, the concentration-response function from ambient NO 2 is still applicable to this study. Secondly, we estimated exposure to NO 2 from two main indoor sources, i.e. cooking and second-hand smoke. Another indoor source of NO 2 , wall-mounted gas boiler, was not considered in this study. The wall-mounted gas boilers are equipped with enclosed combustors and exhaust ducts, which emit negligible NO 2 indoors compared to cooking and smoking. Due to central heating systems in northern China, the wall-mounted gas boilers were mainly used in families in southern China. Studies have shown the low usage of wall-mounted gas boilers in south China. So the contribution of wall-mounted gas boiler to NO 2 exposure is too low to affect the incidence of NO 2 \\-attributable pediatric asthma incidence in this study. Thirdly, we estimated the incidence of pediatric asthma associated with an annual average exposure of NO 2 , while the time period of changes in NO 2 exposure may also influence the incidence and introduce uncertainties. Zhu et al. studied temporal variations of short-term associations between NO 2 concentrations and emergency department visits in Shanghai, China, in 2008–2019. They found the associations of emergency department visits and NO 2 remained stable over the study period. This evidence means that effects on pediatric asthma incidence for NO 2 may also remain stable over time, and we expect more direct evidence in future studies.\n\n【103】Despite these limitations, our results showed that indoor and outdoor NO 2 emissions are associated with the disease burden of pediatric asthma incidence in households without using solid fuels and kerosene. The implementation of the policies on developing clean and alternative energy vehicles has brought hope for reducing ambient NO 2 pollution in the future. We call on individuals to use the electricity for cooking instead of gas to reduce exposure to NO 2 from indoor sources. The government may need to adjust the energy structure of residences to meet the new demand for energy. These measurements on restrictions of NO 2 emissions, i.e. developing new energy vehicles and switching from gas stove to electric stove, support clean energy consumption and aid in achieving climate change mitigation.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nContributors\n------------\n\n【104】**Ying Hu** designed the study and planned the analysis, performed the model analysis, analyzed the results, interpreted the results, validated and completed all figures, and drafted the manuscript. **John S.

At the end of one particularly hectic day, he said to me, “think about the people in schools of public health all over the world developing elaborate theories about why WHO did this or that or the other thing. So often, the basis for a particular policy is just that that's what we decided.” And then he laughed, mostly at himself. He wasn't being glib or boastful. He was making fun of the fact that the office of the Director General faces so much pressure from so many different stakeholders with conflicting interests that the specifics of a particular policy decision can be determined as much by political compromise as some grand vision or design. The task for WHO, all too frequently, is to make compromises that aren't overly compromising, in the knowledge that whatever decision is made there will be fallout from those who will, inevitably, be unhappy with the outcome.\n\n【2】Before his election in January 2003, Lee had told the Executive Board of WHO that one of his highest priorities if elected would be to bring the organisation back into the centre of the global struggle against HIV. He promised that he would take bold action. With this in mind, I suggested that because his predecessor, Gro Harlem Brundtland, had announced the target of having 3 million people on HIV treatment by the end of 2005, we ought to embrace it. Lee listened patiently and said he would think about it.\n\n【3】One day soon after, he announced that he had been talking to global health leaders and had asked them whether or not he should go forward with what we were already calling “3 by 5”. Everyone he spoke with advised him against embracing a target that would be so difficult to reach. I asked him what he was going to do. “Oh we'll do it”, he said. “Someone has to tell the world to _do_ something about this epidemic and it might as well be WHO.”\n\n【4】In his new volume _AIDS and power: why there is no political crisis—yet_ , Alex de Waal examines the various doomsday predictions of the effect of AIDS on political process and democracy in Africa. While noting that the effect of AIDS is devastating at a magnitude that we have yet to understand, de Waal argues that “the epidemic does not threaten the continent's rulers—democratic or otherwise” and that “the evidence to date suggests that African social and political systems will absorb the impact of HIV/AIDS, albeit at a very high cost, borne chiefly by poor women.” De Waal's complex analysis moves deftly from epidemiological data to Weberian social theory as he argues that the global response to AIDS in Africa, although not effective in preventing new infections, has dampened the political impact of the epidemic in ways that were unforeseen. According to de Waal, denial, the nature of activism, the structure of bureaucracies that allows them to flourish in the midst of disaster, and the direct benefits of the epidemic for many governments all contributed to mitigating the political impact of AIDS in Africa.\n\n【5】Judging by results of the Afrobarometer public opinion survey, a first-of-its-kind pan-African poll started in 1999, AIDS is rarely a top-ranking concern. The time delay between infection and becoming sick, the abstract quality of population-based numbers, and the many religious condemnations of AIDS and its sufferers have all had a role in the denial of the epidemic.\n\n【6】But of far greater interest is de Waal's claim that a process of “normalisation” has kept AIDS out of the top tier of concerns. Dipping into the anthropological literature, de Waal argues convincingly that “denial” of the epidemic occurs in contested moral worlds where struggles over meaning play out in ways that both fascinate and horrify. While the unspeakable suffering of poor women and children is so often hidden, religious authorities of all persuasions use the epidemic to make brutally judgmental points about the moral failings of their fellow citizens. As for any hope of breaking though this often ugly tangle of metaphors, de Waal cites data generated for his book that suggest that a free press producing high-quality news, analysis, and opinion can have a strong effect on political commitment to AIDS programmes. One can only hope that he's correct.\n\n【7】AIDS activism has changed our society indelibly. Activists have awakened the entire world to the suffering of people living with HIV and AIDS and fundamentally altered the way we view science, drug development, and even sexuality. After securing treatment access for themselves through bitter struggles and enormous sacrifice, leaders in the American gay AIDS activist community could have averted their gaze from the exploding problem of HIV and AIDS among the poor in Africa. But people like Eric Sawyer, Mark Harrington, and Gregg Gonsalves unexpectedly turned their attention to the developing world and have worked tirelessly for universal access to HIV treatment. Their counterparts in developing countries, people like Noerine Kaleeba and Lydia Mungherera of Uganda and Zackie Achmat and Mark Heywood of South Africa, are no less heroic and often acted in much more difficult personal circumstances.\n\n【8】De Waal is appropriately respectful of all that the African AIDS activists have accomplished but he points out that theirs was not a “revolutionary” project. South Africa is the most important example. After fighting side by side to overthrow the apartheid regime, AIDS activists have not called for the fall of the African National Congress, despite its many failures in responding to the AIDS pandemic. As de Waal points out, African AIDS activists have not needed to call for revolutionary overthrow of their governments since they have “been part of an international revolution and entered welcoming citadels far more powerful than any they could have imagined storming”.\n\n【9】But even if AIDS activists were not working for the overthrow of their governments, de Waal, along with many others, had argued that the devastating lowering of life expectancy and the explosion in the number of AIDS orphans would surely threaten African democracies. The evidence now shows that, during the life of the AIDS pandemic, the number of democracies in Africa has in fact grown. De Waal argues that he and others misrepresented the threats of the epidemic. Also, the internal structure of African polities enabled them to withstand not only AIDS but famine, poverty, war, and other calamities that chronically plague the continent. Indeed, in Uganda and other countries, AIDS has represented an unparalleled opportunity to increase incoming aid dollars and to control the social discourse in a manner that has enhanced the stability of incumbent regimes.\n\n【10】De Waal's view of the political dimensions of the prevention/treatment discourse is especially interesting. He doesn't object to the current attention on treatment, as so many have, but instead focuses on the lack of an equally robust commitment to prevention. He points out that the “default mode for governments and institutions is to secure their own survival and they are doing very well on this score. They are prolonging lives through treatment. But they are doing miserably in terms of preventing new HIV infections because they haven't been required to succeed.” Although de Waal acknowledges that a focus on treatment has actually increased resources for all AIDS activities including prevention, his greatest fear is that “treatment roll-out will simply become the best mechanism for managing the risks of AIDS, a substitute for prevention measures.”\n\n【11】I share de Waal's concerns about the lack of commitment to prevention. As treatment scale-up progresses with great energy, igniting a similar passion and momentum in prevention efforts must be our highest priority. But de Waal writes about broad access to HIV treatment in Africa as if it were the most natural and predictable course for the global response to the epidemic. It was not. The response to Lee's declaration of the 3 by 5 target was met with jubilation among people living with HIV and AIDS and other activists, but among donors and African governments, the response was mixed at best and not infrequently hostile. The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) had committed to treating 2 million people by the end of 2008 in 15 countries, but it had not made any demands on African governments. By committing to work with governments to scale-up HIV treatment and reporting on progress every 6 months, WHO added an important dimension. Lee knew from his work with vaccines and child survival that a clear target with a clear end date and regular reports on progress could have a powerful effect on national governments. He also knew that his own advocacy for treatment scale-up as Director General of WHO could make all the difference.\n\n【12】It is difficult, of course, to determine the relative importance of 3 by 5, PEPFAR, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria, and other efforts in creating a world in which keen observers like de Waal could write about widespread efforts at HIV treatment scale-up in Africa as entirely predictable and natural. In meeting with many ministers of health throughout Africa and visiting countries engaged in treatment scale-up, it is clear to me that 3 by 5 has made an important difference. Without PEPFAR and the Global Fund, we wouldn't have got anywhere, but 3 by 5 put pressure on African governments in a unique way. For many, 3 by 5 was the first time that anyone had held them accountable for an HIV-related outcome. Governments had become very good at HIV-related process _,_ such as high-level meetings and declarations of commitment, but the outcome focus of 3 by 5 jolted many of them into action when faced with an outcome that would be measured and reported for all the world to see.\n\n【13】In writing this review, I am saddened by the realisation that Lee never had the opportunity to read this extremely well argued volume that I would place squarely in a “post 3 by 5” genre. Lee's advocacy of access to treatment of HIV for the poorest people in the world, which was met at times with crudely expressed hostility from some of the most powerful governments in the world, made a great and important difference, especially to the poor living with HIV. De Waal's new volume provides us with a clear picture of the way forward. Now if we only had a clear time-limited target for prevention in Africa…\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【14】### Publication history\n\n【15】Published: 05 August 2006\n\n【16】### Identification\n\n【17】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69135-6</u>\n\n【18】### Copyright\n\n【19】© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The CoBalT trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as an adjunct to usual care (including pharmacotherapy) for primary care patients with treatment resistant depression compared with usual care alone.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】This two parallel-group multicentre randomised controlled trial recruited 469 patients aged 18–75 years with treatment resistant depression (on antidepressants for ≥6 weeks, Beck depression inventory \\[BDI\\] score ≥14 and international classification of diseases \\[ICD\\]-10 criteria for depression) from 73 UK general practices. Participants were randomised, with a computer generated code (stratified by centre and minimised according to baseline BDI score, whether the general practice had a counsellor, previous treatment with antidepressants, and duration of present episode of depression) to one of two groups: usual care or CBT in addition to usual care, and were followed up for 12 months. Because of the nature of the intervention it was not possible to mask participants, general practitioners, CBT therapists, or researchers to the treatment allocation. Analyses were by intention to treat. The primary outcome was response, defined as at least 50% reduction in depressive symptoms (BDI score) at 6 months compared with baseline. 删除8:<u>This trial is registered, ISRCTN38231611.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between Nov 4, 2008, and Sept 30, 2010, we assigned 235 patients to usual care, and 234 to CBT plus usual care. 422 participants (90%) were followed up at 6 months and 396 (84%) at 12 months, finishing on Oct 31, 2011. 95 participants (46%) in the intervention group met criteria for response at 6 months compared with 46 (22%) in the usual care group (odds ratio 3·26, 95% CI 2·10–5·06, p<0·001).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Before this study, no evidence from large-scale randomised controlled trials was available for the effectiveness of augmentation of antidepressant medication with CBT as a next-step for patients whose depression has not responded to pharmacotherapy.

We aimed to assess lenalidomide maintenance therapy in these high-risk patients.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】In this randomised, double-blind, phase 3 study (CLLM1; CLL Maintenance 1 of the German CLL Study Group), patients older than 18 years and diagnosed with immunophenotypically confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with active disease, who responded to chemoimmunotherapy 2–5 months after completion of first-line therapy and who were assessed as having a high risk for an early progression with at least a partial response after four or more cycles of first-line chemoimmunotherapy, were eligible if they had high minimal residual disease levels or intermediate levels combined with an unmutated _IGHV_ gene status or _TP53_ alterations. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either lenalidomide (5 mg) or placebo. Randomisation was done with a fixed block size of three, and was stratified according to the minimal residual disease level achieved after first-line therapy. Maintenance was started with 5 mg daily, and was escalated to the target dose of 15 mg. If tolerated, medication was administered until disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival according to an independent review. The pre-planned interim analysis done by intention to treat was done after 20% of the calculated progression-free survival events.删除1-2:<u> This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01556776; treatment in the lenalidomide group is still ongoing.</u>\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Between July 5, 2012, and March 15, 2016, 468 previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were screened for the study; 379 (81%) were not eligible. Recruitment was closed prematurely due to poor accrual after 89 of 200 planned patients were randomly assigned: 60 (67%) enrolled patients were assigned to the lenalidomide group and 29 (33%) to the placebo group, of whom 56 (63%) received lenalidomide and 29 (33%) placebo, with a median of 11·0 (IQR 4·5–20·5) treatment cycles at data cutoff. After a median observation time of 17·9 months (IQR 9·1–28·1), the hazard ratio for progression-free survival assessed by an independent review was 0·168 (95% CI 0·074–0·379). Median progression-free survival was 13·3 months (95% CI 9·9–19·7) in the placebo group and not reached (95% CI 32·3–not evaluable) in the lenalidomide group. The most frequent adverse events were skin disorders (35 patients \\[63%\\] in the lenalidomide group _vs_ eight patients \\[28%\\] in the placebo group), gastrointestinal disorders (34 \\[61%\\] _vs_ eight \\[28%\\]), infections (30 \\[54%\\] _vs_ 19 \\[66%\\]), haematological toxicity (28 \\[50%\\] _vs_ five \\[17%\\]), and general disorders (28 \\[50%\\] _vs_ nine \\[31%\\]). One fatal adverse event was reported in each of the treatment groups (one \\[2%\\] patient with fatal acute lymphocytic leukaemia in the lenalidomide group and one patient (3%) with fatal multifocal leukoencephalopathy in the placebo group).\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Lenalidomide is an efficacious maintenance therapy reducing the relative risk of progression in first-line patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who do not achieve minimal residual disease negative disease state following chemoimmunotherapy approaches. The toxicity seems to be acceptable considering the poor prognosis of the eligible patients. The trial independently confirms the clinical significance of a novel, minimal residual disease-based algorithm to predict short progression-free survival, which might be incorporated in future clinical trials to identify candidates for additional maintenance treatment.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】Celgene Corporation.\n\n【10】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nTo read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【11】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【12】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【13】One-time access price info\n\n【14】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【15】Or purchase The Lancet Choice\n\n【16】Access any 5 articles from the Lancet Family of journals\n\n【17】### Subscribe:\n\n【18】Subscribe to _The Lancet Haematology_\n\n【19】Already a print subscriber?

Eligible staff were working part-time or full-time in a direct service role at one of the 18 sites and had consumers being recruited for this study. Eligible consumers were receiving care from a participating cluster, with contact in the 3 months before data collection; aged 18–75 years; and not imprisoned. Clusters were randomly assigned with a web-based randomisation tool to receive the REFOCUS-PULSAR intervention in either the first year (step one) or second year (step two).

Recovery-oriented practice involves clinical and other staff facilitating a change process through which individuals who have been diagnosed with a mental illness are supported to live a self-directed life and to strive to reach their full potential. Promoting recovery within mental health services is well established in mental health policy internationally. However, the practice lags behind policy: service-level intervention is required to effectively implement practices through which mental health professionals can use their skills, values, attitudes, and behaviours to support individuals in their personal recovery.\n\n【12】The past decade has seen the development of several recovery-oriented training programmes, such as REFOCUS and THRIVE in the UK, the Collaborative Recovery Model in Australia, and person-centred recovery planning in the USA. They typically emphasise the use of coaching and person-centred, strengths-focused, collaborative processes to support consumers in their recovery. A useful reference framework for the research on training interventions is Kirkpatrick's four levels for evaluation of training programmes: reaction (level 1), learning (level 2), behaviour (level 3), and results (level 4). Evidence is strongest for levels 1 and 2, with few programmes having evidence at either levels 3 or 4. Generally, level 4 evidence has not come from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), so there is a need for stronger evidence at this level. Evidence of the effectiveness of these interventions to promote recovery-oriented practice is required across settings so that these interventions might be used with some confidence by services.\n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【15】We searched PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature for articles published in English between Jan 1, 2007, and July 31, 2017, using the search terms \\[Mental Health/ OR “mental health” OR Mental Health Services/ OR “mental health service\\*”\\] AND \\[Recovery/ OR recover\\*\\]. Further relevant articles were identified from the reference lists of key papers and author and citation searches in Google Scholar. We selected articles if they were set in community mental health services and included data related to staff views, staff-related outcomes, or consumer-related outcomes in the context of staff training in recovery-oriented practice or implementation of recovery-oriented practice to promote and support personal recovery. We identified 16 relevant studies, of which most assessed staff-related outcomes after recovery-oriented training programmes. Although REFOCUS is the only intervention to have been evaluated in a randomised controlled trial, these studies generally suggest that recovery-oriented training improves staff knowledge, attitudes towards recovery, and self-efficacy in working with consumers using a recovery-oriented approach, with a recurrent theme that the organisational culture of the service setting and the provision of follow-up coaching might be important determinants of implementation success. Apart from the REFOCUS trial published in 2015, no trial has reported whether outcomes of consumers were improved by these interventions.\n\n【16】**Added value of this study**\n\n【17】The REFOCUS-PULSAR staff training intervention, adapted for Australian service settings from the REFOCUS package and based on the connectedness, hope, identity, meaning, and empowerment conceptual framework of personal recovery, brought about modest improvements in consumer-rated recovery for people using the involved services.\n\n【18】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【19】Training health-care workers to deliver recovery-oriented care using the REFOCUS materials developed over time and adapted to local settings can positively affect the process of personal recovery for consumers.\n\n【20】REFOCUS is a staff training intervention that was developed and trialled in the UK between April, 2011, and May, 2012. Its development was informed by the theory of planned behaviour, and its aim was to change both what practitioners do with consumers of mental health services and how they do it. REFOCUS came to include, as elements of a team-based training intervention for community mental health teams in England, three working practices: understanding values and treatment practices, working to strengths, and supporting goal striving. Thus, the REFOCUS intervention was designed to promote recovery through changes in the skills, knowledge, behaviour, and values of staff and their relationships with consumers. \n\n【21】In a large-scale, cluster RCT, outcomes of usual care plus REFOCUS were compared with those of usual care only in 27 community mental health teams delivering services to adults with psychotic disorders. In primary analyses, personal recovery assessed with the consumer-rated Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery (QPR) did not differ between intervention and control groups. Secondary analyses suggested that higher team participation was associated with higher staff-reported, recovery-promoting behaviour and improved ratings on the QPR. Several possible reasons exist for the negative primary analyses. First, the REFOCUS recruitment protocol and criteria meant that, on average, participants had been using mental health services for more than 15 years. Such individuals might have entrenched ways of relating to services and problems that take longer than 1 year to change. Second, participant attrition, which was higher than anticipated in the study (26% _vs_ 7%), reduced the study's power to detect a difference in the primary endpoint. To address these issues, future studies might include adaptive design principles, use a more homogeneous team type (ie, function and staff composition), or stratify by team characteristics. Furthermore, transition to recovery-oriented practice might require organisation-wide rather than team-level strategies.\n\n【22】The Principles Unite Local Services Assisting Recovery (PULSAR) project was based in Victoria, Australia. The REFOCUS team advised on project development, enabling PULSAR—4 years behind REFOCUS in development and implementation—to benefit from lessons learned during REFOCUS. Changes to the REFOCUS intervention included adjustments to learning materials to enhance relevance to the local setting and to incorporate developments made during implementation of the programme after the REFOCUS manual had been finalised for study use. We refer to the intervention described in this study as REFOCUS-PULSAR (shortened to PULSAR in the protocol and when implemented locally ) because, although it was developed for the PULSAR study, it drew heavily on REFOCUS materials.\n\n【23】We did a stepped-wedge cluster RCT wherein all study sites received the intervention but the time of intervention receipt was allocated randomly. Given that people who might benefit most from recovery-oriented practice, in relation to personal recovery, might also experience clinical recovery and so be discharged earlier from treating services, sampling of people who have been using mental health services for a long time might bias against positive findings. Hence, we recruited independently at three timepoints (baseline \\[T0\\], year 1 \\[T1\\], and year 2 \\[T2\\]), while maintaining tight control over the consistency of recruitment processes to minimise sampling bias as a source of systematic error. This approach promised greater possibility for progressive refinement of the training intervention through experience.\n\n【24】The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of the REFOCUS-PULSAR intervention for improving the experience of personal recovery, as reported by consumers, using repeated cross-sectional samples. The term consumer is used throughout this Article because it is the most widely accepted term used in Australia to describe people who experience mental distress and use public mental health services. The primary hypothesis was that consumers in clusters that had received the REFOCUS-PULSAR intervention would experience significantly greater personal recovery than would consumers accessing other mental health services that, at relevant timepoints within the trial, had not received the intervention. We also investigated change in clinical recovery and participants' experience of the services.\n\n【25】Methods\n-------\n\n【26】### Study setting\n\n【27】Participating services were providers of mental health care to people living in the catchment area of a large public mental health service in Victoria, Australia. The area ranges from a relatively affluent coastal city to the most socioeconomically disadvantaged and culturally diverse area in metropolitan Melbourne and includes a semi-rural growth corridor. In Victoria, state-run, area-based, block-funded public mental health services, typically accessed by people with severe mental illnesses, include clinical services that consist of a range of teams and service types, such as inpatient units, community-based residential rehabilitation, continuing care, and community treatment teams. Acute or longer-term residential care is typically provided in units of around 25 beds. Caseloads in community services might vary from around ten in mobile support and treatment services to 25–35 in many community clinics, while the typical length of care with a team might vary between a few days with crisis assessment and treatment teams to several years with mobile support and treatment services and community care units. Mental health care funded by the Victorian Government also includes substantial investment in the mental health community support services sector, which is run by non-government organisations and provides residential and outreach psychosocial support.\n\n【28】Within this setting, the temporal context for the work through 2014–16 included events worthy of some comment (details of these are provided in the appendix ). The state-funded organisations that operated in the catchment area were the major public mental health service and two organisations from the mental health community support services sector. Public mental health and mental health community support service partners identified and approached specialist care sites or teams within these organisations; all agreed to participate.\n\n【29】### Study design and participants\n\n【30】We collected data from consumers in three streams. Stream one was a cross-sectional, complete stepped-wedge cluster RCT from which we collected data on demographics and QPR. Stream two was a cross-sectional, incomplete stepped-wedge cluster RCT that involved face-to-face interviews with a subset of participants in stream one before and after staff from their service received the intervention. Stream three, a longitudinal, incomplete stepped-wedge cluster RCT involving consumers from stream two with diagnosed psychotic disorders, did not achieve adequate recruitment targets and is not reported here.\n\n【31】Staff were eligible to receive the PULSAR training intervention if they were working part-time or full-time in a direct service role and had an active caseload with consumers being recruited for this study. Staff employed on casual contracts (ie, those without regular and systematic hours of work) or those also working in a non-intervention site at the time of training were ineligible.\n\n【32】Consumers were eligible for stream one if they were receiving care from a participating cluster, with contact in the 3 months before data collection; aged 18–75 years; able to provide informed consent; proficient in English; and not imprisoned. Administration and clinical staff at participating organisations screened consumers for eligibility using detailed instructions provided by the research team. Eligible consumers were then invited by mail or directly onsite to participate in the study and to indicate consent by return of a completed survey and their contact details. A AUD$10 shopping voucher was sent to all participants who returned surveys and provided their contact details. Other recruitment strategies to encourage response were used according to the needs of individual sites. Care was taken to ensure, as far as reasonably possible, that recruitment strategies and time spent recruiting were consistent across timepoints at participating clusters.\n\n【33】Consumers were eligible for stream two if they provided contact details and consent to be contacted for a face-to-face interview, and were receiving care at a site that was in the pre-phase or post-phase of the intervention. Participants in this stream were recruited by phone, email, or letter.\n\n【34】This study was approved by Human Research Ethics Committees of Monash Health (approval number 14102B) and Monash University (approval number CF14/1600–2014000773).\n\n【35】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【36】We grouped care delivery teams at 18 sites into 14 clusters to enable adequate recruitment in the context of some smaller teams. Teams were classified into seven strata on the basis of similarities in their functions and characteristics. Within public mental health services, these strata were crisis assessment and treatment teams (consisting of three teams, including two smaller teams that were grouped into one cluster); two mobile support and treatment services each grouped with a community care unit (two clusters), which were four smaller teams with a shared focus on long-term intensive work with people with more complex needs; and four teams providing continuing mental health care services in the community (grouped into two strata and four clusters). The remaining strata included services delivered by two participating mental health community support services: four prevention and recovery services (grouped into two strata and four clusters), which deliver short-term, subacute, residential recovery-oriented care; and community outreach services (three teams, including two from one organisation that were grouped into one cluster).\n\n【37】We randomly assigned clusters to receive the intervention in either the first year (step one) or the second year (step two) using stratified randomisation to ensure that cluster types were well balanced across groups. Sequence generation was done with Research Randomizer, with seven randomisation keys corresponding to the seven strata and allocation of clusters within strata to step one or step two. Randomisation was done offsite by an independent researcher during the third quarter of 2014.\n\n【38】Given that the intervention involves training, specialist mental health care staff became aware of their group allocation as the study progressed. Consumers, however, were not informed about whether staff at their service had received the training, and efforts were made to maintain masking of research assistants who did onsite recruitment and stream two interviews. Further information about strata and randomisation is in the protocol.\n\n【39】### Procedures\n\n【40】The REFOCUS intervention is described in a freely available manual. The REFOCUS-PULSAR intervention comprises a manual that was adapted from REFOCUS, a structured training intervention to support use of the REFOCUS-PULSAR manual, and follow-up sessions termed PULSAR active learning sessions.\n\n【41】REFOCUS-PULSAR was developed following Medical Research Council guidelines for complex interventions and the plan-do-study-act model as a method for controlling and improving process, and was guided by discussions with the REFOCUS research team and a lived experience advisory panel and by information from qualitative analysis of group sessions with staff from participating organisations. The content of the REFOCUS manual was largely retained in the REFOCUS-PULSAR manual, with some amendments to contextualise it for the PULSAR study setting, including legal and policy contexts. Additions, which comprised less than 25% of the manual, included material related to relapse signatures and relapse drills, and material on the connectedness, hope, identity, meaning, and empowerment (CHIME) conceptual framework for recovery-oriented practice, which was developed during the course of the REFOCUS study.\n\n【42】The REFOCUS-PULSAR training programme was supported by slide presentations, a manual, session plans, and videos. In a change from the REFOCUS intervention, training was co-facilitated throughout by professional staff and trainers with lived experience of mental health problems, including the project's consumer researcher. This strategy, on the basis of local consultations through project leadership structures, as described in the protocol, was expected to enhance the recovery orientation of the training. Carer input featured in certain sessions. Quality assurance is described in the appendix .\n\n【43】The step-one intervention for clinical services was designed as a 2-day session, with the community services training planned as a separate 2-day session during the same week. In addition to having two project-employed consumer academics, trainers were employed from clinical services for clinical sessions and from the community sector for community sessions. This strategy enabled the inclusion of specialist skills and experience in training delivery. Step-two training was modified according to analyses of participant and trainer feedback from step one. Details of changes to step-two training can be found in the appendix . PULSAR active learning sessions, offered monthly as 1 h sessions to staff and managers of involved teams to support practice-based implementation of recovery-oriented practice, were facilitated by PULSAR investigators and local trainers.\n\n【44】Standard treatment was governed by national standards, adherence to which is maintained by regular accreditation. Consumers often have their locus of care change in response to their changing needs, moving between more intensive community teams (eg, crisis assessment and treatment teams or mobile support and treatment services) and residential options (eg, prevention and recovery care services) or less intensive community options. Case management in community clinics coordinates transitions through these levels of care and seeks to ensure that needs for medication, monitoring, support, and psychosocial interventions are met. Teams typically have multidisciplinary representation from mental health care disciplines, with nursing as the largest single workforce component.\n\n【45】Baseline (T0) data collection occurred in the year before and 3 months after delivery of the step-one intervention. The first 3 months after intervention delivery was deemed suitable for baseline data collection on the basis of Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model, which considers that the embedding of practice change requires at least 9 months: 3 months for consolidation and 6 months for implementation. During the next 2 years (T1 and T2 periods), data were collected at a minimum of 9 months after delivery of the intervention to allow embedding of intervention principles and practices.\n\n【46】Staff finishing REFOCUS-PULSAR training were asked to complete a training evaluation (level 1 evidence ), in which they rated satisfaction from 1 “extremely dissatisfied” to 10 “extremely satisfied”. Team managers or administrators were asked to record staff movements (staff leaving or joining their team) every 3 months. The proportion of the team who attended at least one training session, by headcount, was calculated for time of training. Sector staff turnover was calculated as the number of staff who left, joined, or moved teams in the organisation over the following year, divided by the staff headcount at the end of the core training period.\n\n【47】### Outcomes\n\n【48】Outcomes were divided into measures of clinical and personal recovery and measures of consumers' experience of health care. The primary outcome was the QPR, which is a 22-item, consumer-rated questionnaire used to assess personal recovery; each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale that ranges from 0 (disagree strongly) to 4 (agree strongly), with higher scores indicating increased recovery. \n\n【49】Secondary outcomes, assessed in stream-two participants, were the importance of services in recovery questionnaire (INSPIRE), which has support (20 items) and relationship with worker (7 items) subscales, and the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, which assesses emotional and functional wellbeing and has 14 Likert-scaled items, with higher scores indicating greater mental wellbeing. The subscale scores for INSPIRE were obtained by converting mean ratings on a 5-point Likert scale to percentages.\n\n【50】Other secondary outcomes assessed in stream-two participants were the Perceived Need for Care Questionnaire, which assesses perceptions of mental health care and classifies perceived needs of consumers as unmet, partially met, or met; the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire, which assesses consumers' satisfaction with services; the Mind Australia Satisfaction Survey, which rates consumers' satisfaction with services, their involvement in service delivery, and individual service-use outcomes; the Coercion Ladder, a visual analogue scale that measures consumers' perception of coercion in mental health service interactions; the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale, which is a researcher-rated (0–100) measure of an individual's social, occupational, and psychological functioning; the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale, which is a researcher-rated (0–100) measure of function, independent of psychological condition severity; and days out of role, which measures the effect of mental health problems on usual daily activities over the past 30 days. Health economic analyses, including those based on work time lost, will be the subject of a future publication.\n\n【51】Anticipated possible study-related adverse events included risk of participant distress during an interview, issues related to disclosure of potential self-harm or harm to others, and risk of harm to staff. A risk prevention and management protocol was approved by the governing human research ethics committee. Participants were provided with written contact details of the manager of the governing human research ethics committee to whom they could make complaints. We did not systematically collect other adverse event information from consumers. Further information about adverse events and complaints procedures is in the appendix .\n\n【52】### Statistical analysis\n\n【53】Sample size calculations were based on 14 clusters, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0·05, a significance level of 0·05, a power of 80%, and published SDs. Stream one and stream two were powered to detect medium effects (Cohen's d=0·5) in the primary outcome. Stream one required 756 consumers (252 in each wave, 18 per cluster per wave) to detect a change in the mean QPR score of 6·34. Stream two required 252 consumers (63 at T0, 126 at T1, and 63 at T2; nine per relevant cluster per step) to detect a change in the mean QPR score of 7·68. For stream-two secondary outcomes, expected detection thresholds were mean changes in the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale of 4·8 and in INSPIRE of 7·72 (also medium effects).\n\n【54】The primary analysis was done by intention to treat. We analysed all outcomes using multilevel regression models (linear or Poisson regression, as appropriate), with timepoint and intervention status as fixed effects and clusters as a random effect. Timepoint was included as a categorical variable. Covariates, selected on the basis of statistical and clinical considerations 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>, were age group, gender, sector (public mental health service or mental health community support service), and step group (step one or two; for stream-one models only). Age group and gender were included as covariates because they commonly affect clinical outcomes. Sector was included as a covariate because we deemed it to be the most important stratification variable; the other seven strata were not included because their inclusion would have produced an overfitted model. Step group was not included in stream-two models; collinearity of step group with intervention status was an intrinsic feature of the stepped-wedge cluster RCT design of stream two.\n\n【55】We planned to include consumers as a random effect in the model to account for repeated measures, but 90% of the data in streams one and two came from singletons (ie, individuals contributing data only once to the study; stream one: n=854; stream two: n=254). Given that studies have found low levels of bias for models with up to 70% singletons and 50–500 clustering units, we did not include consumers as a random effect in the model. Model development is described in greater detail in the appendix .\n\n【56】Intervention effects were estimated from the models 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u> using methods described by Hussey and Hughes. Additionally, we used models with interaction terms between timepoint and intervention status to assess trends across the sectors (public mental health services and mental health community support services). The statistician was not masked to treatment allocation during the analyses. All statistical analyses were done with Stata, version 11 or 15.\n\n【57】删除8:<u>This trial is registered with ANZCTR, number ACTRN12614000957695.</u>\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【58】The funder had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the manuscript. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n【59】</u>\nResults\n-------\n\n【60】84 staff from the three services attended step-one REFOCUS-PULSAR workshops in the first quarter of 2015, which were delivered over 22 days by five professionals and two consumers. Step-two training was delivered from June to October, 2016, to 106 staff over 21 days by six professionals and two consumers. In total, 190 team staff (111 from public mental health services and 79 from mental health community support services) received training (with 23 team staff from step one participating in step two training). Thus, 167 (63%) of 266 staff employed at the time of training attended at least one training session in their allocated step, including 92 (51%) of 182 staff within public mental health services and 75 (89%) of 84 staff in mental health community support services. Staff turnover was 68% (124 of 182) for the major public mental health service and 50% (42 of 84) for mental health community support services. Team-specific findings with associated outcomes will be reported in future publications.\n\n【61】The proportion of responding staff who rated training satisfaction as greater than 5 improved from year 1 (44% \\[17 of 39\\]) to year 2 (68% \\[23 of 34\\]; odds ratio 2·71, 95% CI 1·04–7·05; p=0·04). Staff who received training included representatives of multiple disciplines, but the team-based training approach generally did not succeed in engaging senior medical staff; it became apparent through the project that they would be more likely to attend service-wide, profession-specific training, which would not be readily compatible with the cluster RCT model. Medical-specific training in two 1·5-h sessions was attended by 11 registrars but no consultants.\n\n【62】For two public mental health service teams, no PULSAR active learning sessions occurred for logistical and engagement reasons. For all public mental health service teams in which PULSAR active learning sessions occurred (seven team settings, including some that were combined), the mean total number of sessions was 8·1 (SD 4·7). For 22% of these sessions, team sessions could not be arranged and so meetings were with individual clinicians. In mental health community support service settings, PULSAR active learning sessions were integrated into monthly staff support sessions, and the aspects of these sessions that were specific to PULSAR active learning could not be quantified.\n\n【63】Between Sept 18, 2014, and May 19, 2017, 942 consumers (575 of public mental health services and 367 of mental health community support services) were recruited across three timepoints 删除2:<u>( figure 1 删除2-1:<u>; appendix </u>)</u>, of whom 273 were recruited for stream-two interviews at timepoints related to intervention delivery (140 at baseline and 133 at follow-up删除2-1:<u>; figure 2 </u>). Overall, recruitment targets were surpassed and most clusters had the planned sample size (n=18 per cluster) at each timepoint 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. As expected, overall recruitment from mailouts was low (8% \\[622 of 7686\\]删除2-1:<u>; appendix </u>) but yielded 622 (66%) of 942 valid QPRs. Overall, the onsite recruitment rate was 46% (320 of 702删除2-1:<u>; appendix </u>), yielding 34% (320 of 942) of all QPRs. Proportions of QPRs derived from onsite recruitment were 32% (95 of 301) at T0, 34% at T1 (115 of 334), and 36% at T2 (110 of 307). The characteristics of consumers were well balanced across timepoints 删除2:<u>( table 1 删除2-1:<u>; appendix </u>)</u>. The majority of consumers were aged 30–49 years, were born in Australia, and spoke English as their main language 删除2:<u>( table 1 )</u>.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure 1 Trial profile for stream one</u>\n删除4:<u>\nShow full caption</u>\n\n【64】Invalid data refers to data-based issues in the form of missing data or invalid responses.

None of the outcomes were significantly different between the intervention and control groups 删除2:<u>( table 2 删除2-1:<u>; appendix </u>)</u>, although central estimates suggested an effect favouring the intervention in nine of the ten outcomes 删除2:<u>( appendix )</u>. If the intervention had no effect, the binomial probability that an effect favouring the intervention would occur by chance in nine of ten results is 0·01.\n\n【82】During the course of the project, four complaints were reported to the governing human research ethics committee, which led to changes in procedures under their direction as appropriate. No complaints were received that related to the REFOCUS-PULSAR intervention. Additionally, one participant expressed suicidal ideation, which was followed up as per our ethics protocol to ensure the individual's safety.\n\n【83】Discussion\n----------\n\n【84】We found that the REFOCUS-PULSAR staff training intervention had a small but significant effect on the QPR scores of consumers in stream one. Small effects in pragmatic trials are expected, and the significant finding is encouraging. A significant interaction effect for service sector suggests that changes in sectors should be considered separately: in public mental health services, QPR scores did not change significantly from T0 to T1 for the step-one group, when change might have been expected because of staff training between these timepoints, whereas they changed significantly for the step-two group during their intervention period (T1–T2). By contrast, in mental health community support services, there was a small but significant change in the QPR scores of step-one clusters during their intervention period (T0–T1), whereas those of step-two clusters did not significantly change from T1 to T2.\n\n【85】The 3·7-point improvement in QPR score in stream-one consumers after receipt of the intervention represents a 5·7% change in the full-scale score. Standardised effect sizes are easily distorted by factors unrelated to effect size, and are not straightforward to interpret because of expected variance differences in the mixed model components. Nevertheless, Cohen's d calculations suggested a small positive effect on the primary endpoint (d=0·23). Furthermore, based on QPR questionnaire content, changes of 1–2 points might be clinically meaningful. For instance, a 2-point change is achieved if the item “I feel part of society rather than isolated” goes from neutral to strongly agree. The training team, working in a plan-do-study-act approach, modified the training delivered in step two following analysis of feedback from staff participants.\n\n【86】Although speculative, mechanisms that might have led to the intervention having a greater effect on the primary outcome in step-two than in step-one clusters in the public mental health service sector include increased attention on the relationship between the two types of trainers (one a consumer and the other a clinician删除2-1:<u>; appendix </u>), which had the intended effect of providing a better model of behaviour for staff to follow (through clearer demonstration of respect for a lived-experience perspective) and more advanced communication skills, and the introduction of dedicated content on coaching. Earlier availability of the manual might have improved uptake of principles by some staff, and the team might have gained experience with the delivery of both the core training and the PULSAR active learning sessions over time. Findings for mental health community support services might have been affected by pressures building in that sector during the course of the study, which might have particularly affected step-two findings. Within this setting, the temporal context for the work through 2014–16 included events worthy of some comment. As well as the general problem of under resourcing, there was also a major reform of the mental health community support service during the course of the study, resulting in considerable staff turnover, adjustment, and a long transition period (further details are provided in the appendix ).\n\n【87】While stream-two findings across ten measures were of small and non-significant effects, findings for nine of the ten measures favoured the intervention. This finding is unlikely to be a chance occurrence and suggests possible beneficial effects.\n\n【88】The findings of this study regarding the improvement in personal recovery as assessed by QPR are more positive than those of the REFOCUS study, which might be due to differences in the PULSAR and REFOCUS recovery-oriented practice staff training interventions. The literature on stepped-wedge study designs advanced in the period between design of REFOCUS and design of PULSAR, and the adaptive nature of PULSAR allowed for refinements of the training intervention after evaluation of feedback from step one. If this study had a similar parallel-group RCT design to that of REFOCUS, then without the inclusion of the step-two findings, PULSAR would not have yielded the positive findings reported here. The involvement of facilitators with lived experience of mental health issues and recovery is central to challenging conventional practices and in making progress towards an effective recovery-oriented mental health workforce. Having people with lived experience as co-trainers might be the reason for the significant findings in this study, particularly in step-two, public mental health service clusters, in which the relationship between co-trainers had been the most developed.\n\n【89】This study has several limitations. First, we used the 22-item QPR scale, which is thought to be less psychometrically robust than the 15-item scale, although this has not been independently validated, other than within the 22-item questionnaire. Given that we collected data for the 22-item version and powered the study on the basis of its reported psychometric properties, we used the 22-item score. In this study, Cronbach's alpha was 0·95 for both versions. Second, the accuracy of estimates of change from pre-intervention to post-intervention might have been affected by multiple challenges facing the services at the time 删除2:<u>(see appendix for details)</u>. In both sectors, the trend from T0 to T1 in the step-two group, which had not received the intervention at this time, was of declining QPR scores, suggesting that external challenges were acting across the services to drive QPR scores down, particularly for users of mental health community support services. This downward trend in QPR scores might have led to underestimation of the effect of the REFOCUS-PULSAR intervention. Third, REFOCUS-PULSAR training reached only half of public mental health services staff in intervention sites and few medical staff, which might have reduced the effect of the intervention. Better results might be expected from implementation of the intervention outside the constraints of a team-randomised cluster RCT due to greater engagement of medical staff, whether in team-based or profession-specific training. Fourth, the REFOCUS intervention recommends some changes to record (ie, files or forms) structure, with more emphasis placed on prompting and recording recovery-oriented practice. However, this restructuring was not possible in our study because it would have required changes to some form structures that have organisation-wide regulation. Since completion of this study, the CHIME framework has been integrated into the record suite of public mental health services as part of an organisation-wide revision. Finally, our recruitment strategy, including repeated sampling and direct consumer approaches, was chosen to avoid sampling at clinician's discretion, which might have led to selection bias; to enhance consumer autonomy in participation; and to avoid selection bias towards individuals with longer-term illness, which was identified as a problem in REFOCUS. However, despite making considerable efforts to ensure consistency of recruitment strategies over time within clusters, we cannot exclude the possibility that this strategy led to time-variant selection bias.\n\n【90】Policy on recovery-oriented practice has been described as “substantially ahead of research and practice”. Recovery-oriented practice is a values-based movement, and policy and societal imperatives are strong that something be done to encourage services to work towards recovery-oriented practice, despite there being insufficient evidence on the best strategy. Other training programmes based on recovery-oriented practice are in use, often with limited evidence at levels 1–3 and none at level 4. The REFOCUS-PULSAR programme can be considered for use on the basis of findings suggesting improvements in high-adopting teams in the English REFOCUS study, along with the findings from this study. Teams in the participating public mental health service have requested further PULSAR training, with potential to extend and adapt the training to include inpatient staff. We are mindful of the need to carefully evaluate such initiatives, to continue plan-do-study-act cycles, to evaluate training programmes wherever possible, and to develop measures of fidelity.\n\n【91】To better understand how practice change can be sustained within services, future recovery-oriented practice training initiatives should focus on implementation strategies, such as follow-up coaching or mentoring, refresher programmes, and service-user feedback and evaluation. Wide-ranging organisational factors have a part in supporting or constraining implementation efforts, so attention to organisational readiness for change and alignment of organisational policies, processes, staffing, and resources with recovery-oriented principles are also important. Cluster RCT designs that study teams impede the use of organisation-wide strategies, and RCTs wherein randomisation is by organisation are limited by large cluster sizes; thus, design considerations continue to be a challenge in accumulating evidence for these approaches.\n\n【92】Taken together, these results suggest that the REFOCUS-PULSAR intervention can lead to a modest improvement in personal recovery. From an educational intervention perspective, we have provided some level 4 evidence for the REFOCUS-PULSAR intervention, which has otherwise been lacking for recovery-oriented practice. Although the findings of this study are modest, this is not surprising in view of the pragmatic trial design, and they provide at least some indication of positive change for individuals accessing the intervention services.\n\n【93】删除1-1:<u>For more on **PULSAR** see www.pulsarrecovery.org.au</u>\n\n【94】删除1-1:<u>For **Research Randomizer** see https://www.randomizer.org</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【95】GM was the principal investigator of this trial and, together with JCE, led development of key elements of the design and analysis approach and interpretation of the findings.

We investigated the effect of a classroom-based cognitive behaviour therapy prevention programme (FRIENDS) on anxiety symptoms in children.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】Preventing Anxiety in Children though Education in Schools (PACES) is a three-group parallel cluster randomised controlled trial. Interventions were given between September, 2011, and July, 2012, with schools as the unit of allocation and individual participants as the unit of analysis. We enrolled state-funded junior schools in southwest England. We sent information to all eligible schools (state-funded junior schools in southwest England) inviting them to enrol in the study. School year groups were assigned by computer-generated randomisation (1:1:1) to receive either school-led FRIENDS (led by teacher or school staff member), health-led FRIENDS (led by two trained health facilitators), or usual school provision. Children were not masked to treatment allocation. The allocated programme was given to all students (aged 9–10 years) in the school year (ie, universal delivery) as part of the school curriculum as nine, 60 min weekly sessions. Outcomes were collected by self-completed questionnaire administered by researchers masked to allocation. Primary outcome was symptoms of anxiety and low mood at 12 months assessed by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS 30). Analyses were intention to treat and accounted for the clustered nature of the design. The study is registered, number ISRCTN23563048.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】45 schools were enrolled: 14 (n=497 children) were randomly assigned to school-led FRIENDS, 14 (n=509) to health-led FRIENDS, and 12 (n=442) to usual school provision. 1257 (92%) children completed 12 month assessments (449 in health-led FRIENDS, 436 in school-led FRIENDS, and 372 in usual school provision). We recorded a difference at 12 months in adjusted mean child-reported RCADS scores for health-led versus school-led FRIENDS (19·49 \\[SD 14·81\\] _vs_ 22·86 \\[15·24\\]; adjusted difference −3·91, 95% CI −6·48 to −1·35; p=0·0004) and health-led FRIENDS versus usual school provision (19·49 \\[14·81\\] _vs_ 22·48 \\[15·74\\]; −2·66, −5·22 to −0·09; p=0·043). We noted no differences in parent or teacher ratings. Training teachers to deliver mental health programmes was not as effective as delivery by health professionals.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】Universally delivered anxiety prevention programmes can be effective when used in schools. However, programme effectiveness varies depending on who delivers them.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】National Institute for Health Research Public Health Research Programme.\n\n【10】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【11】Anxiety disorders affect 10% of children by the age of 16 years. They significantly impair everyday functioning, often persist into adulthood, and increase the risk of other psychiatric disorders in adolescence and young adulthood. The associated health-related burden, and economic and societal costs are large, and the need to improve the mental health of children is being increasingly recognised as a global priority. \n\n【12】Effective psychological interventions, especially cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), are available for children with anxiety disorders. However, comparatively few children with anxiety disorders are identified and referred for treatment. The poor reach and availability of traditional treatment services has led to interest in more proactive preventive approaches with schools offering a convenient and natural location to deliver such programmes. \n\n【13】Findings of systematic reviews show that universal and targeted anxiety prevention programmes are often based on cognitive behaviour therapy. Data from reviews suggest that cognitive behaviour therapy prevention programmes can be effective, although research methods are poor, adequately powered implementation trials are scarce, results are inconsistent, and effect sizes vary greatly. Most studies report overall changes in symptoms, and the preventive benefits for less symptomatic participants have seldom been reported.\n\n【14】Prevention programmes can be universally provided to all of an identified population, or targeted towards those at risk of developing a disorder or showing early signs of a disorder, or a combination of both approaches. Universal programmes have good reach, avoid the need for screening, are less stigmatising, and offer the potential to enhance mental health and reduce present symptoms. Targeted programmes focus scarce resources on individuals with greatest needs, and usually achieve larger treatment effects. \n\n【15】The effect of the intervention leader (health _vs_ school professional) has important implications for the method of delivery and sustainability of an intervention but has been directly investigated in only one study. Barrett and Turner noted that a universal anxiety prevention programme (FRIENDS删除2-1:<u>; panel 1 </u>) was equally effective in the reduction of symptoms of anxiety in children aged 10–12 years when given by a psychologist or teacher. However, systematic reviews have reached different conclusions about who is most effective at delivering these programmes . \n\n【16】Panel 1\n\n【17】**Acronym for the FRIENDS process**\n\n【18】*   F\n\n【19】    Feelings\n\n【20】*   R\n\n【21】    Remember to relax\n\n【22】*   I\n\n【23】    I can do it.

Stay calm for life\n\n【32】Before anxiety prevention programmes can be endorsed and widely provided, independent implementation trials are needed to measure effectiveness and cost-effectiveness when provided under real-life conditions and to establish the effect of the intervention leader on outcome.\n\n【33】We undertook a pragmatic assessment of the effectiveness of a classroom-based anxiety prevention programme (FRIENDS ) universally delivered by health and school professionals to school years 4 and 5 (children aged 9–10 years) in UK junior schools.\n\n【34】Methods\n-------\n\n【35】### Study design and participants\n\n【36】We did this three-group parallel cluster randomised controlled trial between September, 2011, and July, 2012, with school as the unit of allocation and individual participants as the unit of analysis. A project information sheet and trial enrolment form was sent to all primary schools in Bath and northeast Somerset, Swindon Borough, and Wiltshire within a 50 mile radius of the University of Bath, UK (n=268). Eligible schools were state-funded junior schools in three Local Education Authorities in southwest England. Such junior schools are mainstream government-funded schools that are attended by 94·5% of children aged 5–10 years in the UK. All children aged 9–10 years (years 4 and 5) in participating schools were eligible, unless they were not attending school (eg, because of long-term sickness or excluded from school) or did not participate in Personal Social and Health Education (PSHE) lessons for religious or other reasons. The allocated intervention was given to all participants in the school year (ie, universal delivery) as part of the PSHE curriculum. The trial protocol is online.\n\n【37】Participation required written consent from the school head teacher, parents' not opting their child out of the study, and signed assent from the child. The study was approved by the University of Bath, Department for Health Research Ethics Committee.\n\n【38】### Randomisation and masking\n\n【39】Once all schools had been enrolled, we randomly assigned year groups (1:1:1) to school-led FRIENDS, health-led FRIENDS, or usual school provision. Randomisation was undertaken at school and not the class level to avoid possible contamination within schools. Trial groups were balanced with respect to key characteristics by calculating an imbalance statistic for a large random sample of possible allocation sequences. Children were not masked to treatment allocation. Outcomes were collected by self-completed questionnaire administered by researchers masked to allocation. Group allocation was kept in a separate password-protected database. Researchers who analysed data were also masked to allocation—trial groups were numerically coded and data analysis undertaken masked to which code related to each trial group. The variables used for balancing were school size, number of students and classes, number of mixed classes, level of educational attainment, and preferred timetabling. A statistician with no other involvement in the study randomly selected one sequence from a subset with the most desirable balance properties.\n\n【40】### Procedures\n\n【41】Interventions were delivered in the academic year September, 2011, to July, 2012. The anxiety prevention programme we assessed (FRIENDS) is a manualised cognitive behaviour therapy intervention that has been identified as effective. The programme was developed to be delivered in schools and provided to whole classes of children. FRIENDS is based on the principles of CBT and develops skills to counter the cognitive, emotional, and behavioural aspects of anxiety. Children develop emotional awareness and regulation skills, to identify and replace cognitions that increase anxiety with more balanced and functional ways of thinking and to develop problem-solving skills to confront and cope with situations and events that provoke anxiety. The intervention trialled in this study consisted of nine, 60 min weekly sessions delivered to whole classes of children. Children had their own workbook and group leaders had a detailed session plan that specified key learning points, objectives, and core activities for each session. The feasibility and viability of delivering FRIENDS in UK schools has previously been established. \n\n【42】In the health-led FRIENDS programme, each session was led by two trained health facilitators working alongside the class teacher. All facilitators had at least an undergraduate university degree in a relevant discipline (eg, social science or education), appropriate professional backgrounds (eg, psychology, nursing, or education), or experience of working with children or young people. Initial 2 day training and supervision every 2 weeks were provided by accredited FRIENDS trainers. Supervision was in a group format and consisted of review of session plans, the underlying cognitive model, class and behaviour management skills, and any interpersonal difficulties or communication problems with the class teacher.\n\n【43】In the school-led FRIENDS programme, sessions were led by a teacher or member of the school staff (eg, teaching assistant) who were trained in delivery of the programme and were supported by two facilitators. School staff attended the same 2 day initial training and were offered ongoing supervision. We assessed treatment fidelity by randomly assessing audiotape recordings of 10% of FRIENDS sessions.\n\n【44】In the usual school provision programme, children participated in the usual PSHE sessions provided by the school. All schools were following a UK National Curriculum programme designed to develop self-awareness, management of feelings, motivation, empathy, and social skills. The sessions were planned and provided solely by the teacher and did not include any external input from the research team.\n\n【45】### Outcomes\n\n【46】Child outcomes were collected during class time with self-completed questionnaires administered by researchers at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. As described in the trial protocol, the primary outcome was symptoms of anxiety and low mood 12 months after baseline as established by the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression scale (RCADS 30). Secondary outcomes assessed worry (with the Penn State Worry Questionnaire for Children), self-worth and acceptance (with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), extent of bullying (with the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire), and life satisfaction (with a subjective wellbeing assessment).\n\n【47】Parents completed a behavioural screening questionnaire (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire \\[SDQ\\]) and the parent version of the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS-30-P) at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months.\n\n【48】Class teachers completed the impact rating of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) for all children in their class at all three assessment points to assess the presence of an emotional or behavioural problem, chronicity, distress, social impairment, and burden.\n\n【49】### Statistical analysis\n\n【50】We powered the study to detect a difference of 3·6 points in mean RCADS total scores between FRIENDS and usual PSHE. On the basis of an SD of 12 points and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0·02, 28 pupils per class, 90% consent and 80% retention, effect sizes between 0·28 and 0·30, SDs are detectable with 80% power and 5% two-sided α with 1134–1360 assenting pupils.\n\n【51】We used descriptive statistics to assess balance between the trial groups at baseline. The primary outcome was assessed by intention to treat without imputation. To take appropriate account of the hierarchical nature of the data, we used multivariable mixed effects models to compare mean RCADS at 12 months for health-led FRIENDS with school-led FRIENDS and usual school provision, with adjustment for baseline RCADS, sex, and school effects. We repeated these analyses for secondary outcomes. For RCADS we undertook a further planned analysis. We used repeated-measures mixed-effects analysis of variance models to investigate convergence and divergence between trial groups over time. We did preplanned subgroup analyses with interaction terms in the regression models between the randomised group and the baseline variable (low anxiety RCADS 0–48, high anxiety ≥49).\n\n【52】We did sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of missing data. Completion rates for all groups at 12 months were high (91·8–92·7%), although non-completers tended to be more symptomatic on our primary outcome measure (RCADS) at baseline (data not shown). With multiple imputation methods, we created 20 datasets and showed that imputation for missing data made no material difference to the overall results. Therefore, the data we present are based on recorded data only.\n\n【53】The study is registered, number ISRCTN23563048.\n删除5:<u>\n### Role of the funding source\n\n【54】The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, interpretation of data, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.\n\n【55】</u>\nResults\n-------\n\n【56】Between September, 2011, and July, 2012, 45 schools were enrolled. 41 consented to participate and were randomly assigned: 14 (n=497 children) to school-led FRIENDS, 14 (n=509) to health-led FRIENDS, and 12 (n=442) to usual school provision. One school from usual school provision withdrew before baseline assessments were undertaken 删除2:<u>( figure )</u>. The remaining 40 schools were representative of the UK in terms of academic attainment according to Department of Education performance tables (ie, the percentage of children achieving key stage 2 level 4 in maths and English; data not shown). However, more children had special educational needs (23·2% _vs_ 17·1%), pupil absence rates were lower (4·4% _vs_ 5·1%), and eligibility for free school meals was lower (12·4% _vs_ 18·2%) in the cohort than the national average.\n删除4:<u>\nFigure Trial profile</u>\n删除4:<u>\n*   View Large Image</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Figure Viewer</u>删除4:<u>\n*   Download (PPT)</u>\n\n【57】Of the 1448 eligible participants, 1362 (94%) consented to participate in the study, of whom 1339 (98%) completed baseline assessments.

To assess intervention fidelity, we recorded and independently rated 49 sessions (one from each class in the 28 schools delivering FRIENDS). All specified core tasks and home activities were delivered in the 24 health-led sessions. In the school-led sessions, 15 of 25 (60%) delivered all core tasks and the home activity, eight (32%) delivered all except the home activity, and two (8%) did not deliver one core task and the home activity. Session attendance was not recorded although average school absence rates were very low (4·2% in the health-led group and 4·4% in the school-led group).\n\n【62】We collected primary outcome data at 12 months from 1257 (92%) of the children who completed baseline assessments (449 \\[92%\\] in the health-led group, 436 \\[92%\\] in school-led group, and 372 \\[93%\\] in the usual school provision). We recorded a significant difference in adjusted mean RCADS at 12 months for health-led FRIENDS compared with school-led FRENDS (interaction co-efficient −3·91, 95% CI −6·48 to −1·35; p<0·0004) and usual school provision (−2·66, −5·22 to −0·09, p=0·043).

Although intervention leaders received the same initial training, our data suggest that a manualised programme might result in different outcomes depending on who delivers it. Although training teachers to deliver mental health programmes offers a potentially convenient low-cost sustainable option, our results show that this approach is not as effective as delivery by health professionals.\n\n【83】Panel 2\n\n【84】**Research in context**\n\n【85】**Systematic review**\n\n【86】Findings of systematic reviews of school-based anxiety prevention programmes show that universally (ie, whole class) provided programmes based on cognitive behavioural therapy can be effective. However, research methods are poor, adequately powered implementation trials are scarce, results are inconsistent, few medium term follow-ups exist, and direct comparison of school versus health-led delivery have seldom been undertaken.\n\n【87】We aimed to undertake a suitably powered implementation trial of a school-based cognitive behaviour therapy anxiety prevention programme (FRIENDS) for children aged 9–10 years. Programme delivery by health and school professionals was compared with treatment as usual at 12 months.\n\n【88】**Interpretation**\n\n【89】Our results are consistent with those from systematic reviews that show that school-based anxiety prevention programmes informed by cognitive behaviour therapy are effective in the reduction of anxiety in children. The programme leader is important because the programme we assessed was only effective when delivered by health staff. Our finding that children with low symptoms also benefited from the programme supports the use of universal approaches. This study supports the implementation of a universal anxiety prevention programme delivered by health professionals in regular schools in everyday settings.\n\n【90】Further exploration identified two potentially important differences between health and school leaders. First, although treatment fidelity was high, the home assignment was not undertaken in 40% of the school-led sessions that were assessed. Continuing practice of newly acquired skills is an integral part of cognitive behaviour therapy programmes and the absence of such practice might have compromised effectiveness. However, this possibility needs to be balanced against the increased opportunities for class teachers to integrate and consolidate programme skills more intensively through their daily contact with children. Second, although both groups had the same initial training, comparatively few teachers attended continuing supervision. Although teachers will be competent in some of the areas addressed in supervision (eg, classroom management and engaging children of differing abilities), they will be less familiar with the underlying cognitive model. Therefore, scarce opportunities to consolidate the theoretical model might have compromised programme delivery.\n\n【91】Children with high and low anxiety showed significant reductions in anxiety symptoms over time. The number of children with high anxiety was small and our study was not powered to compare between-group differences within this subgroup. Therefore, the absence of between-group differences might be a power issue or might show regression to the mean. This issue needs to be clarified in further suitably powered studies of highly anxious children. However, our cohort provided sufficient power to detect differences within the low anxiety group in which we found a marked reduction between groups in favour of the health-led FRIENDS group. Universally delivered prevention programmes offer the potential to reduce present symptoms, enhance emotional wellbeing, and potentially shift population means over time. Our findings support this theory and show that children in the low-anxiety health-led FRIENDS group showed markedly lower anxiety symptoms at 12 months than did those in the usual school provision group. Because fears, anxiety, and stress are common in children, anxiety prevention programmes might be especially suited to universal delivery. Further research is needed to establish whether improvements are sustained in the medium term, and to detail the cost-effectiveness of such universal interventions delivered by health professionals.\n\n【92】We recorded no differences between groups for any secondary outcomes, suggesting that the intervention effects were specific to anxiety. The FRIENDS programme is designed as an anxiety prevention programme and specifically develops skills known to reduce anxiety. Therefore, the specific effect that we identified is consistent with the underlying theoretical model and programme focus, although in view of the comorbidity between anxiety and depressive disorders and the shared elements of many cognitive behaviour programmes, this result is disappointing. Our findings show that although anxiety prevention programmes can have a positive effect on anxiety symptoms, they cannot be assumed to enhance the general emotional wellbeing of children.\n\n【93】The effect was also specific to child report because although parent and teacher ratings reduced over time, these changes were not significant. This finding might suggest that although children are feeling better, adults have not noticed any improvement in functioning or reduction in distress. However, only 42% of parents returned baseline questionnaires and as such these findings might not be representative of the total cohort. Similarly, the teacher assessment was global and might be insensitive to specific changes in anxiety symptoms. Alternatively, the absence of a parent and teacher effect might show the difficulty of assessment of changes in internal emotional symptoms and cognitions that are not directly observable.\n\n【94】The results of our study are consistent with those of reviews in which the intervention leader affected programme effectiveness, and with other implementation trials in which teacher-led FRIENDS was not effective. Our findings differ to those of the study by Barrett and Turner, which directly compared teacher and psychologist delivery of FRIENDS, although their study lacked statistical power. Overall, our study supports the growing evidence base for the use of the FRIENDS programme as an effective school-based anxiety prevention programme. \n\n【95】The intervention that we assessed was based on cognitive behaviour therapy, which is typically used to treat mental health disorders. However, for school-based universal emotional health programmes, most children will be healthy and will not need treatment. Furthermore, provision of individual treatment in a classroom context would not be appropriate. Therefore, it is important to emphasise that we did not provide treatment but used the cognitive behaviour therapy framework to help children to develop emotional, cognitive, and behavioural skills. Provision of life skills development within the school context fits with the growing reognition that schools are not just concerned with the development of academic skills, but also have an important role in the enhancement of emotional development in children.\n\n【96】Our study has many strengths. We used a manualised anxiety prevention programme that has been shown to be effective in schools and has been piloted in UK schools. Recruitment and retention were high, absenteeism was low, and programme fidelity was good. In terms of limitations, we relied on self-report measures and did not undertake any diagnostic interviews. Although anxiety symptoms were reduced in the health-led FRIENDS group, whether this reduction was indicative of changes in diagnostic status or impairment is unclear. Second, although our regional cohort included a representative sample of UK schools on several key dimensions, our group was less socially disadvantaged and had more white British participants than did the average UK state school. Therefore, whether similar results would be obtained with a more disadvantaged or ethnically diverse population is unclear. Similarly, although our schools were well matched across trial groups and our exploratory qualitative analysis identified few differences in school culture and ethos, these differences could have affected outcomes. Third, although the health-led and school-led FRIENDS facilitators had the same initial training and treatment fidelity was good, we did not directly assess how the intervention was delivered. Therefore, the differences between these groups might be indicative of differences in leader enthusiasm, confidence, and ability to engage and motivate students, which are skills that could be developed in school staff with additional training and supervision. Finally, although we reported symptoms at 12 months, we were unable to estabish whether the improvements reported would be sustained over time. This point is especially important for prevention programmes in which the full extent of the preventive effects might take several years to emerge.\n\n【97】In summary, our results are encouraging and show that anxiety prevention programmes delivered in schools to children aged 9–10 years do reduce anxiety symptoms at 12 months. The finding that children with low symptoms benefited from the programme supports a universal approach, which also fits well with school timetables and organisational structures. However, our data suggest that the same programme can result in different effects depending on who delivers it. Further research is needed to explore the longer term effect, and the potential mediators and moderators of anxiety prevention programmes, to assess cost-effectiveness, and to establish whether anxiety prevention programmes are effective with more diverse and disadvantaged groups.\n\n【98】删除1-1:<u>For **Department of Education performance tables** see http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/archive/index.shtml</u>\n以下都删除1:<u>\n**Contributors**\n\n【99】PS, GT, RP, HD, RA, and NS conceived and designed the study.

Most reported cases were in people who had high CD4 cell counts and similar outcomes to those without HIV. Emerging data suggest worse clinical outcomes and higher mortality in people with more advanced HIV. We describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of mpox in a cohort of people with HIV and low CD4 cell counts (CD4 <350 cells per mm 3 ).\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】A network of clinicians from 19 countries provided data of confirmed mpox cases between May 11, 2022, and Jan 18, 2023, in people with HIV infection. Contributing centres completed deidentified structured case report sheets to include variables of interest relevant to people living with HIV and to capture more severe outcomes. We restricted this series to include only adults older than 18 years living with HIV and with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 cells per mm 3 or, in settings where a CD4 count was not always routinely available, an HIV infection clinically classified as US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage C. We describe their clinical presentation, complications, and causes of death. Analyses were descriptive.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】We included data of 382 cases: 367 cisgender men, four cisgender women, and ten transgender women. The median age of individuals included was 35 (IQR 30–43) years. At mpox diagnosis, 349 (91%) individuals were known to be living with HIV; 228 (65%) of 349 adherent to antiretroviral therapy (ART); 32 (8%) of 382 had a concurrent opportunistic illness. The median CD4 cell count was 211 (IQR 117–291) cells per mm 3 , with 85 (22%) individuals with CD4 cell counts of less than 100 cells per mm 3 and 94 (25%) with 100–200 cells per mm 3 . Overall, 193 (51%) of 382 had undetectable viral load. Severe complications were more common in people with a CD4 cell count of less than 100 cells per mm 3 than in those with more than 300 cells per mm 3 , including necrotising skin lesions (54% _vs_ 7%), lung involvement (29% _vs_ 0%) occasionally with nodules, and secondary infections and sepsis (44% _vs_ 9%). Overall, 107 (28%) of 382 were hospitalised, of whom 27 (25%) died. All deaths occurred in people with CD4 counts of less than 200 cells per mm 3 . Among people with CD4 counts of less than 200 cells per mm 3 , more deaths occurred in those with high HIV viral load. An immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome to mpox was suspected in 21 (25%) of 85 people initiated or re-initiated on ART, of whom 12 (57%) of 21 died. 62 (16%) of 382 received tecovirimat and seven (2%) received cidofovir or brincidofovir. Three individuals had laboratory confirmation of tecovirimat resistance.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】A severe necrotising form of mpox in the context of advanced immunosuppression appears to behave like an AIDS-defining condition, with a high prevalence of fulminant dermatological and systemic manifestations and death.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】None.\n\n【10】</u>\nIntroduction\n------------\n\n【11】Since May, 2022, around 85 000 human mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) infections have been reported in 110 countries, with transmission predominantly through sexual contact among men who have sex with men. The multicountry outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by WHO in July, 2022. People with HIV have been disproportionately affected, accounting for 38–50% of people diagnosed with mpox. Most people living with HIV described in the 2022 case series had HIV viral suppression with median CD4 counts of more than 500 cells per mm 3 and had similar clinical presentations, time to monkeypox viral clearance, and outcomes to people without HIV. \n\n【12】Data from Nigeria and the USA suggest worse clinical outcomes in people with more HIV-related immunosuppression. 4,14–16 Two reports from Nigeria during the 2017–18 outbreak suggested that people with advanced HIV presented with more severe or prolonged mpox. The first report described that four of seven deaths in 122 individuals with mpox occurred in people with untreated advanced HIV. The second report included nine (of 40) people with HIV with CD4 cell counts of 20–357 cells per mm 3 . The authors described these nine people had more confluent rashes, higher rates of secondary bacterial infections and more prolonged illness than people without HIV. More recently, a report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the 2022 outbreak confirmed these findings with 47 cases of severe mpox among people with advanced uncontrolled HIV infection. All 47 people were hospitalised, had prolonged disease courses, or developed complications, and five deaths were attributed to mpox. Worse rectal disease has also been described in another CDC series, in which 82% of people living with HIV were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 72% were virally suppressed.\n\n【13】**Research in context**\n\n【14】**Evidence before this study**\n\n【15】In 2022, mpox, a disease caused by an orthopox virus referred to as monkeypox virus has caused outbreaks in 110 countries. Two distinct clades of monkeypox virus, clade I and clade II, have existed in different geographical regions. The subclade IIb, identified in the 2022 outbreak, originates from subclade IIa mpox, which is considered a self-limiting disease. Unlike the previous epidemiological descriptions in west Africa, monkeypox virus transmission in this outbreak has been closely associated with the sexual networks of gay and bisexual men who have sex with men, in which a high proportion of people are living with HIV. Some evidence suggests greater disease severity in people with advanced HIV. These findings warrant careful evaluation of the interplay between HIV, immune status, and clinical manifestations of mpox. We searched PubMed for the terms “monkeypox, mpox AND (HIV)” from database inception to Dec 31, 2022. Publications were predominantly letters, perspectives, case reports, and public health agency reports. In the multicountry outbreak, scientific publications of case series have described similar clinical outcomes in people living with HIV to those in people without HIV infection. However, most cases series included people with HIV and high CD4 cell counts (>500 cells per mm 3 ) and suppressed HIV viral loads. In contrast, a Nigerian case series in the 2017–18 outbreak reported that people living with HIV had more severe outcomes when hospitalised, especially those who were viraemic and immunosuppressed. In a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report on 758 mpox cases in people living with HIV during the multicountry outbreak (median CD4 639 \\[IQR 452–831\\] cells per mm 3 ; 12% had <350 cells per mm 3 and 3% had <200 cells per mm 3 ). 68 (10%) of 758 were hospitalised for a median duration of 2 (IQR 0–7) days. Worse rectal symptoms were described in those with HIV. A second CDC report identified adverse outcomes in 47 people with HIV and mpox who had low CD4 counts; 12 (26%) died and five deaths were attributed to mpox. On the basis of these data, individuals with HIV and advanced disease have been identified as requiring expert clinical advice, close surveillance, and prioritisation for antiviral treatments, such as tecovirimat, and preventive vaccines (where available).\n\n【16】**Added value of this study**\n\n【17】This mpox case series is the largest to investigate people with advanced HIV disease. We characterised 382 people with HIV and CD4 less than 350 cells per mm 3 . Individuals with lower CD4 counts presented with widespread, large, necrotising, and coalescing skin lesions. Some individuals also developed lung nodules without an alternative confirmed or suspected diagnosis. Severe secondary bacterial infections were common. Frequent and severe oral, anogenital, and ocular presentations and complications were described. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was suspected in a quarter of those starting or reinitiating antiretroviral therapy after mpox diagnosis, 57% of whom died. The greatest disease severity, hospitalisation, and mortality was observed in individuals with both low CD4 count and high HIV viral load. This international case series includes 27 of the 60 people reported to have died of mpox in the multicountry outbreaks; all 27 were people with HIV and a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells per mm 3 .\n\n【18】**Implications of all the available evidence**\n\n【19】Our findings support the consideration of a severe, disseminated, and necrotising form of mpox as an AIDS-defining condition in CDC and WHO HIV disease classifications. This finding is based on the observation of protracted illness with fulminant disseminated necrotising cutaneous lesions, systemic complications, and mortality in those with CD4 cell counts of less than 200 cells per mm 3 . Clinicians should also be aware that starting antiretroviral therapy in people with advanced HIV and mpox could contribute to deterioration and possible death, possibly as part of an immune reconstitution syndrome. Our data reinforces the importance of HIV and CD4 testing in mpox cases. Our findings support the recommendations that all people at risk of mpox with HIV and a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells per mm 3 should be prioritised for preventive mpox vaccination. There should also be consideration for use of potential mpox antivirals where available, despite lacking data on their effectiveness, and a concerted global effort to ensure access in countries without access to antivirals and vaccines.\n\n【20】On the basis of the existing data, we hypothesised that, in the current outbreak, mpox presentations and outcomes in people living with HIV might differ by CD4 strata and HIV viral load. We used global research networks to describe the characteristics, clinical course, and outcomes of mpox in people with HIV and CD4 count less than 350 cells per mm 3 .\n\n【21】Methods\n-------\n\n【22】### Case definition and identification\n\n【23】Participating clinicians were recruited through the international research networks of the London-based Sexual Health and HIV All East Research (SHARE) Collaborative (London, UK) and the Network of the Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases and Sexually Transmitted Infections Unit of the Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol (Barcelona, Spain). Researchers globally in locations with high numbers of mpox diagnoses were approached and invited to contribute mpox cases diagnosed between May 11, 2022, and Jan 18, 2023. A confirmed case was defined as a PCR-confirmed monkeypox virus infection in a specimen from any anatomical site. We restricted this series to include only adults older than 18 years living with HIV and with a CD4 cell count of less than 350 cells per mm 3 or, in settings where a CD4 count was not always routinely available, an HIV infection clinically classified as CDC stage C. We included people living with HIV who had CD4 cell counts of less than 350 cells per mm 3 in line with the widely accepted 2010 consensus statement, which defines late presentation of HIV as a CD4 cell count of less than 350 cells per mm 3 or an AIDS-defining illness.\n\n【24】CD4 cell count was categorised as less than 100, 101–200, 201–300, and 301–350 cells per mm 3 , because CD4 cell count cutoffs of 100 cells per mm 3 and 200 cells per mm 3 are associated with different risks of opportunistic infections (eg, cryptococcal meningitis is associated with CD4 cell count of <100 cells and _Pneumocystis jirovecci_ pneumonia or toxoplasmosis is associated with a count of <200 cells). For strata comparison, we grouped the seven individuals with a missing CD4 cell count measurement with those who had a CD4 count of less than 100 cells per mm 3 . Three of these individuals had an AIDS-defining condition and four had a positive point-of-care qualitative CD4 cell count test (Visitect CD4 Lateral Flow assay providing a visually interpreted result of >200 cells per mm 3 \\[negative\\] or <200 cells per mm 3 \\[positive\\]). HIV viral load was categorised as undetectable (<50 RNA copies per mL), 50–200 RNA copies per mL (low-level viraemia), 201 copies per mL to log4 copies per mL, and log4 RNA copies per mL or more. We categorised the presence or absence of clinician-reported complications by organ system.\n\n【25】### Data collection\n\n【26】Each contributing centre completed a deidentified structured case report sheet (CRS) adapted from one used in our previous case series to include variables of interest relevant to people living with HIV and to capture more severe outcomes 删除2:<u>( appendix p 8 )</u>. The CRS used drop-down menus and free-text fields to capture routinely collected data from electronic or paper medical records. The CRS focus on HIV status included CD4 cell count, HIV viral load, concurrent opportunistic infections, and adherence to ART. These data were included with information on mpox presentation, diagnosis, clinical features, complications, and outcome. We also considered four outcomes for management: outpatient, hospitalisation, intensive care unit-level care, and death. Duration of hospitalisation was the number of days until discharge or until data collection if ongoing by the end of data collection.\n\n【27】### Ethical considerations\n\n【28】Participating clinicians identified individuals living with HIV and diagnosed with mpox infection at their clinic or hospital. Informed consent for inclusion was obtained and maintained in accordance with local standards, along with local institutional review board approval as per each site's local requirement. Image-specific consent was obtained from participants (or their families when deceased) for the use of images. Deidentified data were securely transferred to the coordinating site.\n\n【29】### Statistical analysis\n\n【30】All analyses were descriptive and no hypothesis testing was done. Continuous variables were described as the mean (SD) or median (IQR). Categorical variables are described as counts and percentages over the entire sample or the corresponding subgroup. No imputation methods were applied to missing data. Data were analysed using R (version 4.2.1).

The median number of skin lesions was 15 (IQR 8–35), and the median duration to resolution was 23 (IQR 18–33) days. Among 36 (9%) individuals who had 100 or more lesions and 43 (11%) people who had a duration to resolution of 40 days or more, the majority had CD4 cell counts of less than 200 cells per mm 3 and detectable HIV plasma viral loads 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 15–16 )</u>. Overall, 235 (62%) individuals had genital lesions, 203 (53%) anal lesions, 144 (38%) had oral involvement, and 20 (5%) had ocular involvement. The most common organ complications were dermatological, respiratory, and secondary bacterial infection 删除2:<u>( table 2 )</u>. A total of 94 (25%) of 382 people developed dermatological complications. Ten (3%) of these individuals developed ecchymotic or haemorrhagic lesions and 84 (22%) developed necrotising lesions, of which 55 (14%) were coalescing. The most common presentation was multiple, large (typically greater than 2 cm in diameter), rounded ulcers with necrotic centres and a fresh, raised border, located close to the orogenital regions 删除2:<u>( figure 1B–D )</u> or in distant locations 删除2:<u>( figure 1E, F )</u>, whereas verrucous appearance 删除2:<u>( figure 1E )</u> was rare 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 30–49 )</u>. In many instances, erythema and oedema surrounded the ulcer. Lesions involving the mouth, eye, or anus resulted in functional impairment 删除2:<u>( figure 1B, C, F )</u>. In the anogenital region, some individuals presented with substantial tissue damage and phagedenic ulcerations 删除2:<u>( figure 1F )</u>. Some people had progression to target-shaped lesions with erythema, swelling, and pallor beyond the margins of the ulcer indicating severe necrosis 删除2:<u>( figure 1F )</u>. Pseudo-Koebner phenomena (ie, the spread of the skin infection along sites with skin microtrauma or rubbing) were manifested by ulcers with a lineal distribution or overlying bony prominences 删除2:<u>( appendix p 17 )</u>.

Among the 27 individuals who died, the median CD4 cell count was 35 (IQR 24–100) cells per mm 3 and the median HIV viral load was log5 (IQR 4–5) RNA copies per mL, and only one patient was HIV virologically suppressed. Among those who died, severe necrotising or haemorrhagic skin lesions were described in 25 (93%) of 27, bloodstream or deep tissue bacterial infections in 24 (89%), respiratory symptoms and respiratory failure in 23 (85%), neurological involvement in eight (30%), rectal involvement in 21 (78%), and oropharyngeal involvement in 18 (67%).

Of these, six (29%) were newly diagnosed and 15 (71%) were known to be living with HIV but were not receiving or not adherent to ART. All 21 people had a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells per mm 3 . The median time from onset of mpox symptoms to the start of ART was 21 (range 0–73) days, and from the start of ART to worsening of mpox symptoms was 14 (range 3–64) days. Nine (43%) of 21 were treated for immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome with steroids, and ten (48%) received supportive care. Of those with suspected immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, three (14%) of 21 were admitted to an intensive care unit, five (24%) were hospitalised in a general ward, and 12 (57%) died.\n\n【57】43 (42%) of the 103 individuals who had been hospitalised (including ten of the 27 people who died) and 21 (8%) of the 279 outpatients received antivirals to treat mpox. 62 (16%) of 382 individuals received tecovirimat (five received both oral and intravenous doses) and seven (2%) received cidofovir or brincidofovir. All people receiving mpox-specific antiviral therapy were treated in Europe or the USA, except two who received tecovirimat in Brazil. Laboratory confirmation of tecovirimat resistance (presence of _FL13L_ mutations by sequencing) was detected in three of five people tested, who had severe immunocompromise, disseminated, and progressive mpox infection despite prolonged treatment (>14 days) with tecovirimat and finally died. Sampling for resistance testing was done after at least one course of tecovirimat had been completed. Nobody who died had received mpox vaccination before or during 2022.\n\n【58】Discussion\n----------\n\n【59】Our large case series describes a severe, disseminated form of mpox infection with 15% mortality in individuals with advanced HIV-related disease characterised by CD4 cell counts below 200 cells per mm 3 . This fulminant form of mpox is characterised by massive necrotising skin, genital and non-genital cutaneous and mucosal lesions 删除2:<u>( appendix pp 30–52 )</u>, and is sometimes accompanied by lung involvement with multifocal nodular opacities or respiratory failure and severe cutaneous and bloodstream secondary bacterial infections. The severities of oral and anogenital complications were more marked than previously described. As described in the CDC classification, disseminated forms of coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and mycobacterium avium complex are considered to be AIDS-defining illnesses. We describe that people with the lowest CD4 counts (<100 cells per mm 3 ) and highest HIV viral loads (>log4 copies per mL) had disseminated and necrotising forms of mpox, strongly suggesting that this severe form of mpox with systemic involvement could also be an AIDS-defining condition 删除2:<u>( appendix p 28 )</u>. We describe in detail the clinical course of 27 people with CD4 cell counts of less than 200 cells per mm who died, including ten people who had completed one or two full courses of tecovirimat. We also wish to raise awareness of the 57% mortality rate in those in whom immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was suspected following ART initiation or reinitiation.\n\n【60】These data build on the observations of the altered natural history and course of mpox that is emerging. During the 2022 multicountry outbreak, most information about the intersection of HIV and mpox reports on people with well-controlled HIV infection. Even the largest series either did not report on CD4 cell count or included very few people living with HIV and CD4 cell counts of less than 350 per mm 3 (12%) or less than 200 cells per mm 3 (3%). We hypothesised that mpox might have a different clinical presentation in individuals with advanced immunosuppression, as can be the case with some pathogens. Although the self-limiting clinical course in individuals with well-controlled HIV is very similar to that of individuals without HIV, our series provides evidence that the disease is very different in those with advanced HIV. The protracted duration and larger number of skin lesions in these individuals also raises the possibility of a more prolonged period of infectivity, but additional studies are needed to investigate this.\n\n【61】Previous work has shown that people living with HIV with high CD4 cell counts (>350 cells per mm 3 ) mount a poxvirus-specific T-cell response that is similar to those without HIV infection, but there are no data on immunological responses in those with low CD4 cell counts (<350 cells per mm 3 ). In our series, low CD4 cell count, especially when less than 200 per mm 3 , was strongly associated with increasing severity of mpox disease relative to those with a CD4 cell count of 200–350 cells per mm 3 and compared with previous reports in which most individuals had a CD4 cell count of more than 500 per mm 3 . Data from animal model monkeypox virus studies have shown that CD4 cell count depletion before immunisation of non-human primates decreased the development of protective B-cell responses and antibodies and increased infection severity after monkeypox virus challenge, which is consistent with our findings. In our series, the effect of a low CD4 count on severity or death varied with the HIV plasma viral load, with higher viral loads associated with increased frequency of severe illness in any given CD4 cell count group. Previous work has shown that replicating HIV virions target antigen-specific T cells that are activated to combat other pathogens, resulting in impaired T-cell responses. Thus, it is possible that a substantial proportion of monkeypox virus-specific CD4 T cells might die or be impaired due to either complete or abortive HIV infection. Other studies have shown impaired immune responses to hepatitis B and other vaccines in those with low CD4 cell counts and unsuppressed HIV virus replication, providing additional evidence that HIV replication can interfere with the immune response to other pathogens. On the basis of our findings, we believe that a severe necrotising form of mpox with systemic manifestations exists. This form of mpox affected people with CD4 cell counts less than 200 cells per mm 3 —the precise CD4 threshold considered to be AIDS-defining in international guidelines 删除2:<u>( appendix p 28 )</u>. Given the 15% mortality in this group, strong consideration should be given to designating this disseminated form of severe mpox as a new AIDS-defining condition in definitions and guidelines.\n\n【62】Several limitations of our research need to be highlighted. Our data are derived from an observational retrospective convenience case series from countries with high numbers of mpox infections. We were, therefore, unable to assess how well our cohort represents the entire population of people living with HIV who developed mpox infection. Study sites might have been more likely to include individuals with more severe outcomes, which could have biased the relationships between both CD4 cell counts and HIV viral load and clinical outcomes. Individuals included in this case series had symptoms that led them to seek medical care; therefore, people who were asymptomatic, had milder symptoms, or did not have access to medical care could have been missed and we could have overestimated illness severity. Additional, outcomes might have been missed if people reattended with severe disease at different sites that were not part of the case series. Due to data collection from multiple sites, some characteristics might have been collected in a heterogeneous manner. Laboratory techniques also differed between sites. Many of the cases had a concomitant opportunistic infection and it might be difficult to differentiate many of the outcomes of mpox from those of the other infections. For example, some health-care settings included did not have access to some radiological and microbiological investigations so we cannot be certain of the role of mpox (as opposed to other opportunistic infections). However, we suggest that the coincident perivascular non-cavitating lung nodular pattern described by two radiologists and seen in 11 people, without a documented suspicion or microbiological evidence of a co-opportunistic pathogen, could be a manifestation of mpox disease and further research into this is warranted. Many of the deaths were associated with multiorgan system failure but the relative contribution of the mpox to death is unclear. We have raised the possibility of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome reactions with the initiation of antiretroviral therapy; however, in the absence of a strict definition and in the absence of details on confounding conditions that might have contributed to adverse outcomes, the data are uncertain. Data are currently not available from randomised controlled clinical trials on the impact of monkeypox virus antivirals or preventive vaccines on the course of mpox, and, with the limited use in this series, their role cannot be evaluated.\n\n【63】Our data reinforce the recommendation that HIV testing (in addition to testing for other sexually transmitted pathogens) and CD4 cell counts measurement be performed in every case of mpox. When immune suppression is detected, a different course of action should be followed in terms of infection prevention and control, the potential use of antivirals, and consideration of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Physicians caring for people with mpox and advanced HIV disease must be made aware of the severe outcomes and high mortality that can occur, especially when cutaneous and bloodstream bacterial superinfection sets in. Clinical trials tailored to this group are needed to evaluate the effect of antiviral agents and preventive vaccines to modify disease outcomes. In the absence of these data, people with HIV and low CD4 cell counts who need to be hospitalised with mpox should be considered for expanded access to these therapies where available and specific guidelines with best practices should be developed. We have shown that, among people with advanced HIV, the risk of deterioration and death after initiation of antiretroviral therapy is 57%. This risk needs to be considered when caring for people with HIV and advanced disease with mpox who are not on therapy. Additional research into the role of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is necessary to better understand the role of potential interventions, such as early versus delayed initiation of ART, and the concomitant use of steroids or other immunomodulatory strategies leading to a reduction in the frequency of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.\n\n【64】In regard to prevention, people with HIV and high risk of mpox infection should be prioritised for a preventive vaccine. Moreover, two-thirds of the deaths that we reported had occurred in Latin America. Our findings are particularly pertinent for countries with low levels of HIV diagnosis or without universal free access to ART and intensive care units, where the interaction of uncontrolled HIV infection and mpox is more prevalent. In these countries, a concerted effort to provide urgent access to mpox antivirals and vaccines is of critical importance.\n删除4:<u>\n**This online publication has been corrected.

Whether these similar but different findings relate to the different interventions, the patient groups, or differences in methods remains to be seen.\n\n【5】SP, DH, NL, and NB are employees of GlaxoSmithKline.

He was born in Adell, WI, USA, on Jan 19, 1919, and died in Madison, WI, USA, on Sept 30, 2014, aged 95 years.\n\n【2】In 1949, having completed a residency at the University Hospitals in Madison, Wisconsin, USA, Robert Schilling became a National Institutes of Health fellow at Harvard Medical School's Thorndike Memorial Laboratory. Under its then Director, the pioneering haematologist William Castle, the Thorndike Laboratory had a research agenda that has since led it to be regarded by many as the birthplace of modern haematology. It was Schilling's stint there that confirmed the future course of his career.\n\n【3】One of the laboratory's research topics at the time Schilling joined it was pernicious anaemia. His interest in this, and in the shortfall of vitamin B12 associated with it, stayed with him when he returned to the University of Wisconsin as an Assistant Professor. He began studying the absorption of vitamin B12 from the gut, and devised a new and better way of measuring it. “Previous attempts had been made to do this”, says Eliot Williams of the Section of Hematology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine. “But it was Bob Schilling who made it accurate.” The new test involved giving radioactive vitamin B12 by mouth followed by a large parenteral dose of unlabelled B12 to saturate its binding sites in the liver. This ensured that a fraction of the labelled vitamin B12 would be excreted in the urine where it could be measured, so revealing the effectiveness of its absorption from the gut. The test soon became known by the name of its inventor. The one person who never referred to it as such was Schilling himself. “He was a very modest man”, says Williams. “It was completely impossible to get him to speak the words ‘Schilling test’”, adds Walter Burgdorf, a retired doctor who first met him when studying at Wisconsin in the 1950s. “As students we tried every trick in the world, but we couldn't get him to say it.” As Williams points out, the test itself has been superseded by immunological methods. “Almost no-one does the Schilling test any more. But Dr Schilling wasn't upset about that. He was just pleased with all the progress that had been made.”\n\n【4】Schilling's career began as it was to end: at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine. He graduated from the school in 1943, did a brief internship in Philadelphia, then joined the US Marine Corps as a battalion surgeon. He returned to Madison in 1946 and, aside from his 2 years at Harvard, spent the rest of his life there. He became Professor of Medicine in 1962, and Professor Emeritus from 1989 onwards. His initial interest in haematology can be traced back to his student days and to his first research project: a comparison of clotting times in relation to the material of the surface on which the clotting was allowed to occur. Although it is for pernicious anaemia and the radioactive vitamin B12 test that he'll be remembered, his research interests ranged from the effect of anaemia on lipid metabolism to a longitudinal study of families with hereditary spherocytosis. He continued working on the latter for many years after his retirement—and in so doing earned an official rebuke for failure to comply with certain regulations governing the reporting of such studies. As he pointed out, he had been collecting the data long before the regulations came into existence; being retired from everyday academic administration he had never heard of them.\n\n【5】“Dr Schilling possessed that rare combination of a caring clinician, mentor, and scholar”, says Thomas Ansfield, a cardiologist affiliated to the University of Wisconsin Hospital. “He challenged trainees to understand evidence-based medicine before the term was coined.” Williams agrees. “He always wanted evidence that a treatment worked. He had a healthy scepticism about many medical interventions. He took a scientific approach to medical problems. He would come to a conference and we'd be discussing a case and arguing about what to do. He'd be sitting there writing on a yellow pad, and at the end of the meeting he'd hand me this piece of paper that outlined an experiment that answered the question.” Williams recalls Schilling as among the most well-liked of faculty members. “He was gentle. But he could be tough when needed, and make hard decisions when he had to.” Ansfield sums him up: “Very direct, very down to earth. He made everyone feel comfortable, whether a student, patient, or colleague.” Schilling leaves a wife, two sons, and two daughters.\n以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【6】### Publication history\n\n【7】Published: 24 January 2015\n\n【8】### Identification\n\n【9】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60109-X</u>\n\n【10】### Copyright\n\n【11】© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Hospital Episode Statistics records for the NHS in England are a powerful yet flawed source of information about the development of problematic drinking careers of young people. The aim of this study was to assess whether these careers could be summarised and investigated after novel processing techniques had been applied to these records. These techniques attempted to account for problems in the data, specifically coding errors and splitting of relevant admission records between multiple annual datasets.\n\n【3】### Methods\n\n【4】A cohort of 15 203 young people aged 10–25 years in England who had an index alcohol-related emergency admission between April, 2003, and March, 2004, were tracked for subsequent alcohol-related readmission through the use of a pseudo-anonymised identification number for 3·75 years (data collection ended March, 2008). International Classification of Diseases 10 codes used in initial sample selection focused on those that indicated the immediate effects of excessive alcohol consumption (F10.0, F10.1, R78.0, T51.-, X45.-, X65.-, Y15.-, Y90.6, Y90.7, Y90.8, Y91.1, Y91.2, Y91.3, and Z72.1). Mean age of the cohort was 18·4 years (56·5% male). For those for whom ethnicity was known, just over 95% were white, although missing data makes this finding uncertain. Novel processing techniques were used to prepare data for analysis, whereby algorithms undertook record-by-record processing, with the intention of quality checking and appropriately combining incomplete or duplicate admission entries. The algorithms accomplished this preparation by applying standard data quality checks to each record, checking for repetition or incomplete or faulty records. By stepping through the dataset line-by-line, the algorithms were able to analyse a record in the context of adjacent, associated records. This method eliminated much uncertainly in the dataset and allowed a detailed picture of subsequent drinking careers to emerge. Confounding factors are inevitable in a cohort of this nature (in particular, dual diagnosis relating to mental health, self-harm, injury, assault, and other substance use) and were accounted for by incorporating them into the analysis as independent variables, along with other patient demographic variables. The resulting analysis dataset was subject to analysis in an attempt to distinguish the determinants of readmission.\n\n【5】### Findings\n\n【6】Almost 13% (1950 of 15 203) of the cohort was readmitted during the following 3·75 years, and almost 5% (707 of 15 203) of the cohort had two or more alcohol-related readmissions. The characteristics of each return were investigated. On average, each subsequent admission featured a lengthened hospital stay, was progressively more likely to occur on a non-traditional drinking day, and occurred after a progressively smaller number of days since previous admission. The likelihood increased for a patient, as they cycled through subsequent readmissions, to be living in a neighbourhood of a lower average wealth than that where they lived during their index admission.\n\n【7】### Interpretation\n\n【8】The use of an automated method of summarising admission sequences proved feasible. The resulting findings can be used to inform the process of hospital screening for referral to alcohol treatment. Additionally, the deprivation finding can be interpreted as showing that poverty is both a part cause of, as well as being a result of, a problematic drinking career. Potential limitations of the study include (1) data quality problems that may have persisted despite the algorithms; (2) an absence of data about actual level of alcohol consumption; and (3) a focus on data that only capture people at specific periods when their drinking (often briefly) emerges in a clinical setting. Associated with this last point, an alternative explanation of the results is that the cohort offers an unrepresentative picture of problem drinking among young people, because the methodology excludes a group of unknown size who develop drinking problems, but who are never admitted (or readmitted) into hospital.\n删除5:<u>\n### Funding\n\n【9】None.\n\n【10】**Conflicts of interest**\n\n【11】删除9:<u>I declare that I have no conflicts of interest.</u>\n\n【12】</u>以下都删除1:<u>\nArticle info\n------------\n\n【13】### Publication history\n\n【14】Published: 29 November 2013\n\n【15】### Identification\n\n【16】删除1-1:<u>DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62438-1</u>\n\n【17】### Copyright\n\n【18】© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
