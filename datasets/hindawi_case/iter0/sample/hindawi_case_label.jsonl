Here, we report a case of primary bone marrow DLBCL successfully treated with high-dose chemotherapy and rescued by _in vivo_ rituximab-purged autologous stem cells. A 39-year-old woman visited our hospital because of anemia. Bone marrow examination revealed a large B-cell lymphoma invasion. An <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan revealed disseminated bone marrow uptake without evidence of dissemination at other sites. These findings led to a diagnosis of primary bone marrow DLBCL. Our patient underwent R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) chemotherapy and achieved complete remission. Subsequently, she received high-dose chemotherapy with an _in vivo_ rituximab-purged autologous stem cell transplant. Seven years have passed since the transplantation, and she remains in remission. This suggests that transplantation of an _in vivo_ rituximab-purged autograft is a promising strategy for primary bone marrow DLBCL.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The involvement of bone marrow in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) usually represents the systemic dissemination of lymphoma. However, a rare type of DLBCL involving the bone marrow alone, known as primary bone marrow DLBCL, has been reported \\[1–3\\]. The prognosis of primary bone marrow DLBCL is poor with a median survival of 14.9 months, and approximately 70% of patients die within 2 years despite receiving chemotherapy \\[4\\].\n\n【4】High-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic stem cell rescue is an effective treatment strategy for high-risk non-Hodgkin lymphoma \\[5, 6\\]. Furthermore, treatment with rituximab in addition to stem cell mobilization or a conditioning regimen has been reported to improve the outcome in patients with high-risk B-cell lymphoma \\[7\\]. High-dose chemotherapy rescued by _in vivo_ rituximab-purged autologous stem cells is a reasonable approach for primary bone marrow DLBCL because the risk of lymphoma cells being contaminated in the autograft is high. Here, we present a case of a patient with primary bone marrow DLBCL who achieved long-term remission (at least 7 years) after high-dose chemotherapy rescued by _in vivo_ rituximab-purged autologous stem cells.\n\n【5】The present case suggests that this strategy may enable the cure of patients with primary bone marrow DLBCL.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 39-year-old woman suffering from dyspnea on exertion was admitted to our hospital. On physical examination, her body temperature was 37.0°C, the conjunctiva was anemic, but neither lymphadenopathy nor hepatosplenomegaly was observed.\n\n【8】Laboratory findings showed a decreased white blood cell count of 2,950 × 10<sup>6</sup>/L, a low hemoglobin level of 6.5 g/dL, an increased soluble interleukin-2 receptor level of 3,350 U/mL, and a normal serum lactate dehydrogenase level of 154 U/L. Initial bone marrow aspiration revealed a dry tap, but bone marrow biopsy showed the involvement of large abnormal lymphoid cells with focal clusters (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). Hemophagocytosis and sinusoidal involvement of lymphoma cells were absent.\n\n【9】  \n**(a)**\n\n【10】  \n**(b)**\n\n【11】  \n**(c)**\n\n【12】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【13】Figure 1 \n\n【14】| Images of the bone marrow biopsy showing the involvement of large abnormal lymphoid cells with focal clusters.

Karyotypic analysis of a second bone marrow aspiration showed a complex chromosomal abnormality: 46, XX, add (10) (q22 or q23). An <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan revealed disseminated bone marrow uptake, but no abnormal uptake was observed at other sites (Figure 2(a)). These clinical findings led to a diagnosis of primary bone marrow DLBCL. The international prognostic index (IPI) score was 1.\n\n【16】  \n**(a)**\n\n【17】  \n**(b)**\n\n【18】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【19】Figure 2 \n\n【20】| (a) An 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan showing disseminated bone marrow uptake at diagnosis.

Our patient received an additional 2 courses of R-CHOP, followed by stem cell mobilization chemotherapy consisting of 24 mg/day dexamethasone (days 1 to 10), 60 mg/m<sup>2</sup> carmustine (day 2), 75 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> etoposide (days 4 to 7), 200 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> cytarabine (days 4 to 7), 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> melphalan (day 3), and 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> rituximab (day 1), which was started 40 days after the completion of the last course of R-CHOP. Filgrastim at a dose of 600 __μ__g was administered on day 11 and continued until the completion of leukapheresis. Leukapheresis was performed using a continuous-flow blood cell separator (Cobe Spectra, Lakewood, CO, USA), and a total of 7.3 × 10<sup>6</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> cells/kg body weight were obtained.\n\n【22】Two weeks after stem cell collection, our patient received a conditioning regimen of 300 mg/m<sup>2</sup> carmustine (day −6), 100 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> etoposide (days −5 to −2), 200 mg · m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> cytarabine (days −5 to −2), 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> melphalan (day −1), and 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> rituximab (day −9), followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). All of the collected stem cells were infused, and filgrastim was administered at a dose of 450 _μ_g on days +1 to +10 and at 150 _μ_g on days +11 to +13. Engraftment of neutrophils (ANC > 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>/L) was performed on day +11. Seven years have passed since the transplantation and the patient remains in remission (Figure 2(b)).\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Primary bone marrow DLBCL is a rare but distinctive entity of extranodal lymphoma with a poor prognosis.\n\n【25】Because primary bone marrow DLBCL is rare, no standard therapy has been established. Chang et al. reported 8 cases of primary bone marrow DLBCL \\[3\\]. Four patients were treated with chemotherapy alone, of which 3 died at 8, 10, and 22 months after the initial diagnosis. In contrast, of the 4 patients treated with chemotherapy combined with rituximab (R-CHOP, 3 patients; R-COP, 1 patient), 3 have remained in remission for 3, 10, and 14 months. These results suggest that similar to other types of DLBCL, chemotherapy combined with rituximab would be a standard strategy for primary bone marrow DLBCL too. However, the long-term outcome is unknown because the followup period is too short.\n\n【26】Although high-dose chemotherapy rescued by autograft is known to improve the outcome of relapsed lymphoma \\[5\\], the role of upfront ASCT for the patients with DLBCL is controversial \\[8, 9\\]. Presently upfront ASCT is recommended only in selected high-risk circumstances or in the context of clinical trials \\[10\\]. Although primary bone marrow DLBCL is thought to be a type of high-risk lymphoma, the role of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is unclear because of its extremely rare incidence. To date, 3 cases of primary bone marrow DLBCL (including the present one) treated by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation have been reported, all of which have remained in remission for 14 months, 12 months, and 7 years (our patient) after transplantation \\[3, 11\\].\n\n【27】In patients with primary bone marrow DLBCL, the high risk of lymphoma cells in the autograft being contaminated is a major problem because it may cause relapse. Therefore, an _in vivo_ rituximab-purged autograft was used for transplantation in our patient. She has been alive without evidence of relapse for the past 7 years. This suggests that ASCT using an _in vivo_ rituximab-purged autograft might be a promising strategy for the treatment of primary bone marrow DLBCL.\n\n【28】However, because this is only a case report, the role of ASCT in curing primary bone marrow DLBCL remains unclear. An accumulation of cases is required to clarify the role of ASCT with an _in vivo_ rituximab-purged autograft for primary bone marrow DLBCL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Diabetes and other metabolic abnormalities including high triglycerides (TGs) are commonly seen comorbid conditions in patients having nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). There is no approved pharmacotherapy for NAFLD, and life-style therapy plays a major role. Saroglitazar, the world’s first approved dual PPAR _α_/_γ_ agonist, is approved in India for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia. The objective of this case series analysis was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of saroglitazar 4 mg once daily in reducing liver stiffness in patients having diabetic dyslipidemia associated NAFLD. _Method_. In this retrospective case series analysis, we identified 10 patients with diabetic dyslipidemia (type 2 diabetes and triglycerides >200 mg/dL at baseline) and NAFLD who were treated with saroglitazar 4 mg once daily and the follow-up data were available for 9 months after saroglitazar treatment. At baseline, all patients were on stable antidiabetic and statin therapy. Liver stiffness was measured by using 2D shear wave elastography at baseline and at 9-month follow-up. _Results_. At 9-month follow-up after saroglitazar treatment, significant improvement was observed in shear wave velocity (SWV) and serum transaminases levels. Serum TG level was significantly reduced after 9-month treatment with saroglitazar. No major adverse event was reported. _Conclusion_. In this case series of 10 patients with diabetic dyslipidemia and NAFLD, saroglitazar improved liver stiffness along with reduction observed in liver enzymes and TG values. Long-term randomized controlled clinical trial is required to further establish the safety and efficacy of saroglitazar in treatment of NAFLD.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is projected to become the leading cause of liver transplantation \\[1\\]. Insulin resistance has been considered as a core pathophysiological factor in NAFLD \\[2\\]. There has been a strong association observed between NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the studies have shown that >70% of patients with T2DM will have NAFLD \\[3\\]. In NAFLD, the risk of liver-related mortality increases exponentially with increase in fibrosis stage \\[4\\]. The recommended gold standard in the diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis is liver biopsy, but it is invasive. The use of shear wave elastography (SWE) in the diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis has been increasing. The SWE method uses the values of acoustically produced SW propagation speeds in the liver tissue then estimates the liver stiffness \\[5\\].\n\n【4】Currently, there is no FDA approved pharmacotherapy for T2DM patients with associated NAFLD/NASH. Saroglitazar is the first approved dual PPAR _α_/_γ_ agonist, approved in India for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia \\[6\\]. Here we retrospectively analyse the case series of 10 type 2 diabetic patients who also had dyslipidemia with NAFLD and were treated with saroglitazar 4 mg once daily for the period of 9 months.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【6】We retrospectively identified the database of patients who had been prescribed saroglitazar 4 mg (Lipaglyn™, from Cadila Healthcare Ltd, containing saroglitazar magnesium) for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia from author’s clinic. We selected patients on the following criteria for this case series analysis:(1)Patients with type 2 DM having TG > 200 mg/dL whose baseline and 9-month posttreatment parameters were available(2)Presence of NAFLD (defined sonographycally and from history) and underwent shear wave elastography for liver stiffness assessment(3)Treated with saroglitazar magnesium 4 mg once daily(4)No use of GLP1 analogue or SGLT2I or pioglitazone in the population during the assessment period or 3 months prior to assessment(5)No history of liver injury by any chemicals or drugs during the 9 months of assessment period(6)Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C negative status(7)On stable therapy for any chronic disease for >6 months prior to recruitment\n\n【7】Shear wave elastography machine used for liver stiffness assessment was Philips Affinity 70® using 2 dimensional imaging. This technology measures shear wave velocity (SWV) using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) (Table 1).\n\n【8】Table 1 \n\n【9】ARFI (acoustic radiation force impulse) values for liver stiffness by SWE.\n\n【10】##### 2.1. Statistical Analysis Applied\n\n【11】The statistical analysis was done using GraphPad insta online version® (https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/ttest1/) and results were analysed applying paired _t_ test. A value of <0.05 was taken as statistically significant.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【13】We analysed a total of 10 patients (male : female 7 : 3) with mean age of 59.3 years with average duration of diabetes 8.8 years (Table 2). The mean baseline HbA1c and TG values were 7.8% and 298.2 mg/dL, respectively (Table 3). All these patients were already on stable dose of statin therapy and antidiabetic therapy at baseline. They all were prescribed saroglitazar 4 mg once daily. The baseline and 9-month follow-up data were analysed after adding saroglitazar therapy.\n\n【14】Table 2 \n\n【15】Baseline characteristics.\n\n【16】Table 3 \n\n【17】Change in biochemical/clinical parameters and SWV values at baseline and after 9-month treatment with Saroglitazar 4 mg once daily.\n\n【18】The mean baseline SWV value 1.837 ± 0.0691 m/s was reduced significantly to 1.645 ± 0.0844 m/s at 9-month follow-up after saroglitazar treatment (Table 3; Figure 1). At 9-month follow-up after saroglitazar, the HbA1c level was significantly reduced from 7.8 ± 0.343% to 6.9 ± 0.33% (). Serum TG was also significantly reduced from 298.2 ± 35.75 mg/dL to 202.4 ± 13.19 mg/dL () at 9-month follow-up. Liver enzymes, ALT, and AST were also reduced significantly from baseline at 9-month follow-up after saroglitazar treatment (Table 3).\n\n【19】  \n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Figure 1 \n\n【22】SWV of 10 patients at baseline and after 9-month treatment with saroglitazar.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Obesity, insulin resistance, and other metabolic abnormalities including high TG are very closely related to NAFLD. Recently, a retrospective study showed a huge burden of liver fat score as measured by SWE in our T2DM patients having NAFLD \\[7\\]. Current guidelines recommend that the management of NAFLD should consist of treating liver disease as well as the associated metabolic comorbidities such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and T2DM \\[8\\]. Saroglitazar has been studied in India in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia during phase III RCTs \\[9\\]. Saroglitazar significantly improves insulin resistance by its action on PPAR _γ_ receptor \\[10\\]. This study showed significant improvement in SWV values with additional improvements in metabolic parameters (HbA1c, TG and HDL-C) with 9-month treatment with saroglitazar. Saroglitazar also improved serum transaminases levels at 9-month treatment. In this case series, saroglitazar treatment was not associated with increase in BMI and waist circumference (Table 3) at 9-month follow-up.\n\n【25】##### 4.1. Limitations of This Case Series\n\n【26】The sample size was small to deduce any proper conclusion. There was no chance of intervention in life-style changes, and hence, the differences in SWV value reduction cannot be properly attributed to the molecule per se. The robust reduction of HbA1c might be attributed to the change in other oral hypoglycemic drugs whose doses were increased to meet the HbA1c target of 7%.\n\n【27】##### 4.2. Summary\n\n【28】In this case series, 9-month treatment with saroglitazar showed significant reduction in SWV values along with improvement in metabolic parameters (blood glucose, TG, and HDL-C levels) without causing weight gain in Indian type 2 diabetic dyslipidemia patients with NAFLD. This is a retrospective case series analysis of only 10 patients, and a large randomized controlled clinical trial is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of saroglitazar in patients with NAFLD.\n\n【29】#### Consent\n\n【30】Informed consent has been taken by the author from all 10 cases analysed in this case series.\n\n【31】#### Disclosure\n\n【32】The abstract of this study was presented as an E-poster viewing at the Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes held in Madrid, Spain (2020).\n\n【33】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【34】The author has no conflicts of interest.\n\n【35】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【36】The abstract of this study was presented as an E-poster viewing at the Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes held in Madrid, Spain (2020).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The incidence of unsuspected contralateral peritonsillar abscess identified at tonsillectomy has been reported to be between 1.9% and 24%, while the overall incidence of bilateral peritonsillar abscess is reported to reach 4.9%. Diagnosis can be based on clinical criteria or imaging techniques. As far as the treatment is concerned, it is generally accepted that the basic strategy consists of systemic antibiotics and drainage of the pus. We report the case of a 19-year-old girl, treated in the emergency room with a bilateral diagnostic needle aspiration followed by bilateral incision and drainage along with intravenous clindamycin plus anti-inflammatory agents and hydration. Following treatment, the patient progressively experienced a marked alleviation of her odynophagia. She was discharged 48 hours later on a 10-day course of clindamycin.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Peritonsillar abscesses (PTAs) are collections of purulent material that usually develop outside the tonsillar capsule near the superior pole. They develop as the most frequent complication of acute tonsillitis, when the infection spreads from the crypts to the loose alveolar peritonsillar tissues. They are mainly situated in the region of the upper pole and involve the soft palate pushing the tonsils forwards and towards the midline. The condition is usually unilateral and mostly affects young male adults (2 : 1 male preponderance) \\[1–6\\]. In our 10-year series (1999–2009), male to female ratio is about 100/63 (Figure 1), with the majority of the cases diagnosed between 20 and 40 years of age (Figure 2).\n\n【4】  \n\n【5】  \n\n【6】Figure 1 \n\n【7】| Diagnosed peritonsillar abscesses: Male to Female ratio in our 10-year series (1999–2009). |\n| --- |\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 2 \n\n【11】| Diagnosed peritonsillar abscesses: Range of age in our 10-year series (1999–2009). |\n| --- |\n\n【12】Peritonsillar abscess is believed to be part of a clinical modality that progresses from acute tonsillitis to peritonsillar cellulitis and finally to peritonsillar abscess. The most common symptoms at presentation are sore throat, odynophagia (usually unilateral), dysphagia, otalgia, trismus, oral drooling, and high fever. Early diagnosis, with drainage of the abscess, is crucial to prevent perforation into the parapharyngeal/retropharyngeal space and further spread along the neck vessels to the mediastinum and skull base. Possible aspiration and severe upper airway obstruction due to epiglottis or laryngeal oedema may develop if treatment is delayed \\[3, 5–7\\].\n\n【13】The methods of accomplishing drainage have been varied, and the appropriate approach to the definitive treatment of peritonsillar abscess is still controversial. The theurapeutic options, in general, include needle aspiration, incision and drainage, quinsy tonsillectomy, intravenous antibiotics, and steroid therapy. Although unilateral peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute bacterial tonsillitis, bilateral peritonsillar abscesses are quite rare. The overall incidence of bilateral PTA is reported to reach 4.9% \\[3, 5–8\\]. In most bilateral cases, an unsuspected contralateral abscess is discovered during tonsillectomy. The incidence of unsuspected contralateral peritonsillar abscess identified at tonsillectomy has been reported to be between 1.9% and 24% \\[3, 5–8\\].\n\n【14】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【15】A 19-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of our Hospital with a 6-day history of worsening odynophagia, bilateral earache, difficulty in swallowing solids, subjective fever, and significant trismus. Despite oral Clarithromycin prescribed by her GP, her symptoms worsened in the 24 hours preceding admission. Intraoral examination revealed a diffusely erythematous soft palate and uvula, with prominent swelling and midline protrusion (Figure 3). She showed no signs of upper airway obstruction in fiberoptic endoscopy. Laboratory tests revealed a significant increase of white blood cells, normal electrolytes, and no monocytosis.\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】| The bilateral Peritonsillar absesses in our case (12 hours after the initial incision and drainage which followed diagnostic needle aspiration). The incisions are still clearly visible. |\n| --- |\n\n【20】As the patient presented with significant symmetrical bulging of the soft palate, she was treated in the emergency room with a bilateral diagnostic needle aspiration (a 10 gauge needle was used) followed by bilateral incision and drainage (Figure 3). Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was clear.\n\n【21】Although bilateral peritonsillar abscesses are quite rarely diagnosed, it must be taken into account that tonsillitis is obviously a bilateral disease in most cases. Therefore, development of a peritonsillar cellulitis or abscess is quite likely to occur bilaterally \\[3\\] as happened in this case. The final progression of this—initially bilateral—disease on any side usually depends on the patient’s physical condition and systemic response to infection, on former surgical interventions in the oropharynx and on prior medical treatments, especially with antibiotics \\[3, 5\\]. In our case, the patient was treated with Clarithromycin for 5 days before her admission and was also seriously dehydrated and malnutritioned for about one week, due to her significant odynophagia. These facts could have influenced the physical history of the disease, leading to this rare bilateral diagnostic modality.\n\n【22】Foul-smelling pus was drained from both abscesses and sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures and determination of sensitivities. The aerobic culture grew few alpha-hemolytic streptococci, occasional beta-hemolytic streptococci (not group A or B), rare _Staphylococcus aureus_, and rare _Candida albicans_. The anaerobic culture grew few beta-lactamase-positive _Prevotella melaninogenica_ and few other beta-lactamase-positive, anaerobic, gram-negative rods. No penicillin-resistant organisms were isolated.\n\n【23】The patient was admitted to our clinic and treated with intravenous clindamycin plus anti-inflammatory agents and intravenous hydration. Following treatment, the patient progressively experienced a marked alleviation of her odynophagia. She was discharged 48 hours later on a 10-day course of clindamycin. A followup intraoral examination one week later showed a well-resolved infection and normal mucosa.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Unilateral peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is a common complication of acute bacterial tonsillitis and has been described since the time of Hippocrates \\[1–3\\]. However, bilateral peritonsillar abscesses are quite rare. Reports in the literature with regard to the incidence of bilateral abscesses are quite varied. The larger percentage includes cases where an unsuspected contralateral abscess was discovered during tonsillectomy. The incidence of unsuspected contralateral peritonsillar abscess identified at tonsillectomy has been reported to be between 1.9% and 24%, while the overall incidence of PTA is reported to reach 4.9% \\[3, 5–8\\].\n\n【26】As tonsillitis is an infection mostly involving both tonsils, it is probable that progression to peritonsillar abscess also occurs bilaterally, with the developmental stages of the abscesses being different on each side. However, most authors support that the individual's systemic response to infection, antibiotics, or surgical intervention may interrupt the progression of this disease at any stage \\[3\\]. Moreover, adequate antibiotic treatment as well as incision and drainage of the obvious abscess is often likely to suppress the development and even mask the presence of a peritonsillar abscess on the opposite side \\[3\\] Therefore, we do believe that the cases of bilateral abscesses are quite likely to be underreported.\n\n【27】The vast majority of peritonsillar abscesses harbor multiple organisms. The most common aerobic organisms isolated are _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Streptococcus milleri_, _Haemophilus influenza_, and streptococci group viridans, while fusobacterium and _Prevotella melaninogenica_ are reported to be the usually involved anaerobic organisms \\[3, 6\\]. In our case, the culture results demonstrated quite different organisms than expected, such as _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _Candida albicans_. This fact could be attributed to the recent treatment with Clarithromycin, as well as to multiple antibiotic treatments involved during the last 6 months, as the patient’s history revealed.\n\n【28】The intraoral appearance of a bilateral peritonsillar abscess lacks the classic asymmetry and uvula deviation that are considered to be the hallmarks of a unilateral abscess. Moreover, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, or steroid treatment may often mask the signs and symptoms of PTA \\[3–7\\]. Therefore, bilateral abscesses can be confused with other conditions such as bilateral lymphomas of the tonsils, infiltrating carcinomas of the soft palate or uvula, any tumors of the small salivary glands of the oral cavity, tonsillar cellulitis, or infectious mononucleosis \\[3–7\\]. That is the reason why some authors support that contrast-enhanced CT imaging can help diagnose bilateral PTA and should be considered in the presence of marked trismus but with the absence of unilateral inflammatory findings \\[9\\]. However, contrast CT scan is quite expensive and usually not available immediately. Therefore, we believe that the diagnosis of bilateral peritonsillar abscesses should be kept in mind when the clinical presentation suggests the diagnosis of PTA, but the physical examination reveals bilateral swollen tonsils with a midline uvula. In such cases, needle aspiration is a reliable alternative diagnostic procedure as it leads to immediate and accurate diagnosis in most situations. Some authors also support the diagnostic use of intraoral ultrasound in cooperative patients \\[10–12\\], reporting significantly good results.\n\n【29】In our case, the patient presented with significant symmetrical bulging of the soft palate and significant trismus. She was treated in the emergency room with a bilateral diagnostic needle aspiration which was positive in both sides. This initial procedure was followed by bilateral incision and drainage. Computed tomography was not performed as the diagnosis was quite clear right after the bilateral diagnostic needle aspiration.\n\n【30】As far as the treatment of peritonsillar abscess is concerned, it is generally accepted that the basic strategy consists of systemic antibiotics covering group A _β_\\-hemolytic streptococci which is reported to be the most common offending organism and subsequent drainage of the pus \\[3–7\\]. Drainage of the pus from the abscess cavity can be accomplished via needle aspiration (sometimes ultrasound-guided), incision-drainage, or immediate (quinsy) tonsillectomy \\[3–8\\].\n\n【31】The surgical treatment of peritonsillar abscess that is not complicated with upper airway obstruction still remains controversial. Immediate tonsillectomy is an easy to perform one-stage surgical procedure assuring quick relief of trismus and pain and total evacuation of the pus. Such an operation may subsequently reveal an unsuspected contralateral peritonsillar abscess as well \\[3–8\\]. On the contrary, incision and drainage which is also supported by many authors is an awkward procedure, very unpleasant for the patient that could often lead to incomplete evacuation of the abscess cavity. That is the reason why the procedure is often necessary to be repeated several times. Besides, if an interval tonsillectomy is planned, such an operation could be technically more difficult because of the fibrosis of the tonsillar bed usually developed \\[3–8\\].\n\n【32】Quinsy tonsillectomy supporters also cite the need to prevent a recurrent abscess. However, those who favor only incision and drainage state that the reccurence rate has not been clearly defined. In fact, the reported frequency of recurrent peritonsillar abscess in several series is 5.9 to 22.7% \\[3\\].\n\n【33】Most authors accept that both needle aspiration and incision-drainage are the mainstay of management for the majority of peritonsillar abscesses and are reported to be equally effective for the treatment of the disease, whereas immediate tonsillectomy is now considered to be a reliable and safe procedure, suggested for bilateral cases, immunocompromised patients, or in cases with no response to systemic antibiotics or incision and drainage \\[3–8, 13\\].\n\n【34】On the other hand, initial conservative (nonsurgical treatment) is still supported by some authors in selected cases, before taking the risk of surgical drainage \\[13–15\\]. This strategy is reported to be involved especially in cases of inferior pole peritonsillar abscess, provided that the patient is immunocompetent and has no significant systemic diseases \\[14, 15\\]. The patient is treated with parenteral antibiotics and is under close observation for the first 48 hours. We suggest that poor response to antibiotics, progressively deteriorating clinical status or development of other complications, should always redirect the theurapeutic plan towards the surgical management. Moreover, the authors believe that this conservative strategy could also be involved for the first 48 hours in selected cases of peritonsillar celullitis, provided that diagnostic needle aspiration is negative in both sides and there is no evidence of immunodeficiency or any clinical signs or imaging data which would make the physician to suspect a life-threatening complication.\n\n【35】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【36】Although unilateral peritonsillar abscess is a common complication of acute bacterial tonsillitis, bilateral abscesses are quite rarely diagnosed. The intraoral appearance of a bilateral peritonsillar abscess lacks the classic asymmetry and uvula deviation. That is the reason why the ENT surgeon must keep this diagnostic modality in mind, even if the clinical appearance is not entirely suggestive, especially if previous antibiotic or steroid treatment has been involved. Diagnosis can be supported by both imaging techniques (such as CT or intraoral ultrasound) and bilateral needle aspiration. Treatment of choice consists of systemic antibiotics and drainage of the pus via bilateral incision and drainage or immediate quinsy tonsillectomy. Initial conservative (nonsurgical treatment) is supported by some authors in selected cases, before taking the risk of a surgical approach.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The latest coronavirus infection due to SARS-CoV-2, which started in China in December 2019, was announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. All epidemiological data so far show us that SARS-CoV-2 infection is less serious in children than in adults. Allergic asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is usually not to be related to greater risk or severity for COVID-19 in pediatric populations. Although reports/research on asthma and COVID-19 in children have thus far been comforting, when coming across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. _Case Report_. Here, we report a rare adolescent case of COVID-19-related pneumonia development with underlying asthma. A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. He was thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Pulmonary CT showed findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. He was discharged after 1 week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day favipiravir treatment was completed. _Conclusion_. When a physician comes across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus pandemic, owing to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was later announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is the third highest known pathogen coronavirus, whose mortality rates range from 6 to 10.5%, depending on the comorbidity of the infected individuals \\[1, 2\\]. At least, a quarter of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are reported to have one of the chronic diseases as a comorbidity \\[3\\]. Some of the comorbidities, especially chronic respiratory tract diseases (such as asthma and COPD) with long-standing drug treatments, may influence the development, therapy, and prognosis of COVID-19 \\[4\\].\n\n【4】Here, a rarely seen case of a 16-year-old adolescent male patient is discussed under the light of the current literature, since he developed severe COVID-19-related pneumonia with the preexisting diagnosis of asthma.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. The patient was regularly using daily montelukast 10 mg tablet and budesonide + formoterol 80/4.5 mcg 2x1 puffs in the maintenance treatment of asthma. His persistent asthma has been under control, and its severity is mild. His pulmonary function test (spirometry) was found to be within normal limits (predicted FEV1: 131%, FVC: 136%, FEV1/FVC: 92, and PEF: 90%) several times for the last 3 years. He was detected to be allergic to molds and wild grasses. A skin prick test showed indurations as negative control: 0 × 0 mm, positive control: 6 × 6 mm, _Chenopodium album_: 3 × 3 mm, and _Cladosporium_: 3 × 3 mm.\n\n【7】He had symptoms of persisting fever up to 39°C degrees in the morning and night for 5 days and cough with green sputum and described a very severe headache for 3-4 days in the last week. He assessed the severity of headache as 10/10 with a visual analog scale. Also, the patient was experiencing orthopneic dyspnea while coughing. It was learned that he had previous contact with a SARS-CoV-2-positive individual.\n\n【8】In the initial physical examination, he seemed to have mild dyspnea and tachypnea, body temperature was 39.5°C, heart rate: 110/min, respiratory rate: 38/min, and oxygen saturation: 88% (without oxygen support). Pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse sibilant and subcrepitant rales on the anterior and posterior parts of both the lungs and on the left basal region at the end of inspiration and beginning of expiration. Rest of the physical examination was within the normal limit. According to the laboratory results, initial leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet counts were decreased. In his routine biochemistry, AST and ALT levels were increased (Table 1). Prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 such as CRP, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels were mildly elevated. PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were detected by nasopharyngeal swabs as positive twice. Serum immunoglobulins were within ±2 standard deviations of normal values. Pulmonary CT showed findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. Diffuse ground glass-like consolidated nodular lesions in the left hemithorax of the patient continued to the lower lobes. Ground glass-like nodular lesions were also observed in the peripheral areas in the upper lobe and in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung (Figure 1(a)).\n\n【9】Table 1 \n\n【10】Laboratory results of the patient are shown.\n\n【11】  \n**(a)**\n\n【12】  \n**(b)**\n\n【13】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【14】Figure 1 \n\n【15】The patient’s thorax CT images show radiologic findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. Diffuse ground glass-like consolidated nodular lesions in the left hemithorax continue to the lower lobes.\n\n【16】He was thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Final diagnosis is confirmed as COVID-19-related pneumonia with preexisting asthma. After diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, he was admitted to the pediatric COVID-19 inpatient service. In addition to maintenance fluid, favipiravir (2x8 tablets on the first day and 2x3 tablets for the rest of 4 days, po) and methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day, iv route) were given for COVID-19. Also, for pneumonia, ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day, 3 gr/day, iv), clarithromycin (15–20 mg/kg/day, 1 gr/day, po), and paracetamol (3-4x15 mg/kg/dose, po) were administered. Since the patient sometimes had up to 39.5°C fever and described an increase in cough and dyspnea during the admission, inhaled corticosteroid 80 mcg 4x1 puffs was added to his treatment on the 4<sup>th</sup> day of admission. Without oxygen support, oxygen saturation (SpO2) level was usually observed at >95%. He was discharged after 1 week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day favipiravir treatment was completed. He was later followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic. During follow-ups, his repeated spirometry values were within normal limits and he did not need any physical therapy (**we have obtained an informed consent form from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report**).\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】We are reporting a rare case of suffering from COVID-19-related pneumonia with preexisting pediatric allergic asthma. As described above in our case with asthma, SARS-CoV-2 positivity in PCR testing and findings of typical ground glass-like opacity in chest CT were consistent with COVID-19 \\[5–7\\].\n\n【19】Because COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, certain diseases (such as congenital heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and some primary immune deficiency diseases) have been identified as a potential risk factor for COVID-19 \\[8\\]. However, asthma has not been generally thought as a specific risk factor for severe COVID-19 development \\[9–11\\]. While some meta-analyses reported almost no data related to asthma patients, some others reported that asthma was thought to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in hospitals. Where do asthmatic patients stand in this pandemic? Are asthmatic patients more inclined to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection? When afflicted, are asthmatic children at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19? Another issue is if the association between asthma and COVID-19 progress differs according to the age of the patient (adults vs. children) \\[12–14\\].\n\n【20】According to his initial laboratory results, leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet counts decreased, which were related to myelosuppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 1). According to the laboratory results, all his immunoglobulin levels were found to be normal except for total IgE. Overall, although these clinical and laboratory findings demonstrated the severity of the disease, the patient overcame the disease without need of oxygen support and intensive care unit treatment. This course was also consistent with a report of Turkish pediatric patients by Karbuz et al. \\[15\\]. Similar to our case, this report describes that pediatric asthma patients may have a symptomatic course but do not require mostly intensive care admission. In this report, cough was the key symptom in asthmatic cases (80.0%), and 87.6% of children with asthma were symptomatic (: 0.016). Nevertheless, being asthmatic was not always associated with disease gravity \\[15\\]. After 5 days of favipiravir treatment, liver function test (AST and ALT) levels of our patient were found to be doubled. This may be due to the use of the hepatotoxic effect of paracetamol and/or favipiravir \\[16\\].\n\n【21】In many nations, such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Italy, the asthma prevalence in COVID-19 cases was lesser than that detected in the overall population, while the contradictory findings were demonstrated in the USA, Australia, UK, and Ireland \\[14\\]. In a Chinese study, only one of the 182 pediatric cases with COVID-19 was admitted in Wuhan had asthma \\[17\\]. On the other hand, in Brazil and New York, it was demonstrated that asthma was a common comorbidity, but was not linked with more severe COVID-19 leading to hospitalization or the need for intensive care therapy \\[6\\]. In an online survey of 91 asthma specialists, caring for more than 133,000 pediatric asthma cases in 5 continents, only 14% of the responders described assumed COVID-19 patients among their cases; asthmatic children had mild symptoms in 73% of them, and only 1 patient needed hospitalization \\[18\\].\n\n【22】Respiratory viruses are one of the recognized triggers of asthma attacks. Conventional coronaviruses are respiratory viruses and have been accused of both upper airway infections and asthma attacks upon infection. Reported entry receptors for most conventional coronaviruses do not include ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) \\[19\\]. Even for asthma patients, it is difficult to distinguish respiratory COVID-19 symptoms such as chest tightness, coughing, and shortness of breath from an asthma exacerbation by other triggers. Consequently, it is crucial to draw attention to the surveillance and active management of chronic preexisting diseases in COVID-19 cases. In a study, mild bronchospasm was noticed in 24% of the cases, and oral steroids were used in only 1 case \\[20\\]. In reality, COVID-19 has not been held responsible as an essential driver of viral wheezing or asthma attacks in children \\[21\\].\n\n【23】Favipiravir as an antiviral agent and anti-inflammatory methylprednisolone were used in his treatment. Corticosteroid therapy is the main treatment for asthma, but its use in viral pneumonia is debatable. Steroids are supposed to be able to antagonize some pathophysiological developments of acute respiratory distress syndrome, comprising extreme inflammatory response \\[4\\]. According to an assessment of the Cochrane system, glucocorticoids can lessen the fatality of cases with severe community-acquired pneumonia as well \\[22\\]. There is a complex relationship among asthma, inhaled corticosteroid use, and ACE2 expression. According to Severe Asthma Research Program-3 (SARP-3), the use of inhaled corticosteroids is linked with a decreased level of ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) gene expressions in asthmatic patients which are the key entrance receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[23\\]. Also, all guidelines and experts suggest that asthma patients continue taking their inhaled corticosteroids using a metered-dose-inhaler (MDI) during this pandemic \\[24, 25\\].\n\n【24】Some of the potential mechanisms suggested in the relevant literature for a milder COVID-19 course in asthmatic children are as follows. Seriousness and complications of any SARS-CoV-2 infection are linked with the production of hyperinflammation. In asthmatics, such hyperinflammation could be decreased by several factors including the hindered and ineffective antiviral reaction because of lessened IFN-_α_ production by dendritic and epithelial cells. Nevertheless, the defensive role of eosinophilic inflammation, Th2 type inflammatory mediator (e.g., IL-4/-5/-13) predominance in the respiratory system, and antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of inhaled corticosteroids are also thought to play a strong role. Asthma and respiratory allergy, as a type 2 eosinophilic inflammation, and allergen exposures are connected with decreased expression of the ACE2 gene in bronchial epithelial cells. Eosinophils also might help in the reduction of viral load with subsequent attenuation of SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[26–28\\].\n\n【25】Due to stay-at-home orders, physical activity is restricted and the risk of contact with COVID-19-positive parents is greatly increased. The longer the stay at home, the greater the risk of further exposure to indoor allergens such as mold, rodents, cockroaches, and tobacco smoke. Indoor air quality and air conditioning will be more essential during stay-at-home times. Therefore, indoor plants where asthmatic children live are also very important as potential attack triggers.\n\n【26】Our strength in this report is that this is a rare allergic asthma case developing severe COVID-19-related pneumonia even under control with maintenance therapy. Our limitation is this is just one case, and it is hard to make definitive conclusion and does not reflect the whole reality on COVID-19 progress in these allergic asthma cases, especially controlled asthma cases.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【28】Although reports/research on asthma and COVID-19 in children have so far been comforting \\[29\\], the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) stated that “reliant on good judgment, rather than growing data” pediatric patients with asthma, particularly if severe or uncontrolled ones, should be contemplated to be at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19.\n\n【29】A take-home message from this case is when physicians come across an asthma patient in clinic with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[30, 31\\]. Nevertheless, even asthma patients under control could develop SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia.\n\n【30】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【31】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present a case of a young female with subacute symptoms of cough and progressive dyspnoea. On evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia based on her histopathological reports. However, her significant elevation of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels which drop after treatment with oral steroids, relapse, and clinical presentation pointed towards sarcoidosis as clinical diagnosis. _Discussion_. Here, in this patient, transbronchial biopsy was suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia along with chest X-ray, and the HRCT finding was also favouring the same. But in this case, we have also seen elevated levels of serum ACE which dropped significantly to the normal level along with a complete clearance of lesions with systemic steroids, and this favours sarcoidosis. Also, the recurrence was in different areas of the lung, and lesions once again responded both clinically and radiologically to steroids with a consistent drop in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, which again is a feature common in sarcoidosis. In COP, often complete clearance of the lesions is seldom seen, even though they do respond to steroids but not as dramatically as in our case. Also, recurrence of the lesion with BOOP at different sites is uncommon as it generally progresses in the same site. _Conclusion_. This case report suggests that sarcoidosis as a possible cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is worth considering with the mixed spectrum of presentation as in our case. And to our knowledge, this type of presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with sarcoidosis as an overlap disease is very rare, and this possibility needs to be explored by more series of such cases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia earlier known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is clinically characterized by subacute or chronic respiratory disease for a duration of 2 weeks to 2 months. Usual presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia will be persistent with dry cough and breathlessness. Pathologically, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia was defined by the presence of granulation tissue in the bronchiolar lumen, alveolar duct, and some alveoli, associated with a variable degree of interstitial and air space infiltration by mononuclear cells and foamy macrophages \\[1–3\\]. Various associations of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with many drugs, connective tissue disorders, hematological malignancy, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, infections, inflammatory bowel disease, inhalation injury, irradiation injury, and transplantation have been reported in the literature, except for an unlikely cluster of patients with association of sarcoidosis and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Summary\n\n【5】A 32-year-old female with no comorbid illness presented with dry cough and progressive dyspnoea for 3 weeks with no history of expectoration, fever, haemoptysis, night sweats, weight loss, myalgia, arthralgia, muscle weakness, or rash. Oral antibiotics were consumed with no symptomatic relief. She was a housewife with no history of exposure to mineral dust, silica, asbestos, fumes, and drugs.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed a healthy well-built female with a BP of 100/80 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and a saturation of 94% in room air. No pallor, clubbing or cyanosis, lymphadenopathy, oedema, or skin lesions were observed.\n\n【7】Initial laboratory investigations showed an elevated ESR of 90 and an elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) level of 83, as against a normal level of 52 IU, with normal hemogram and other biochemistry and electrolyte assays. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-dsDNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C/P-ANCA), rheumatoid factor, and serology for HIV, HCV, and HBsAg were negative. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli and other routine bacteriology tests were negative.\n\n【8】The pulmonary function test showed a mild restrictive pattern. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates (Figure 1). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest showed peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe (Figures 2 and 3). Bronchoscopy with brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies were done.BAL was found to be negative for malignancy. Cultures of bacterial pathogens and acid-fast bacilli were also found to be negative by GeneXpert. The BAL study showed endobronchial cells with alveolar dust-laden macrophages with acute and chronic inflammatory cells. Transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, and histology (Figures 4 and 5) showed air space consolidation with fibrinous exudation and polymorph and macrophage infiltration, along with polypoidal proteinous layer in the alveolar spaces composed of granulation tissue, with alveolar septa showing moderately dense chronic inflammatory infiltrates (Masson bodies), all were suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP).\n\n【9】  \n\n【10】  \n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】Chest X-ray showing bilateral interstitial infiltrates.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】HRCT chest showing peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe.\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】  \n\n【22】Figure 4 \n\n【23】Low-power examination shows plugs of granulation tissue in bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli.\n\n【24】  \n\n【25】  \n\n【26】Figure 5 \n\n【27】High-power examination shows Masson bodies that are rounded nodules of granulation tissue in alveolar spaces.\n\n【28】The patient was treated with systemic steroids to which the patient responded dramatically with a clinical and significant radiological clearance (Figure 6) and a decrease in serum ACE to normal.

The serum ACE levels again increased to pretreatment levels of 70 IU, and it again reached a nadir after another 3 months of a tapering course of steroids.\n\n【34】  \n\n【35】  \n\n【36】Figure 7 \n\n【37】HRCT showing recurrence of bilateral patchy lesions in different zones.\n\n【38】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【39】The differential diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) includes diseases like community-acquired pneumonia, idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and sarcoidosis \\[1, 4\\]. In our case, with the persistence of symptoms and lack of response to antibiotics, we diverged from bacterial or viral pneumonia. We excluded the diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with clinic-pathological collaboration. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) has a similar clinical and radiographical presentation to subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We excluded the disease because of the absence of a known exposure to an aetiological agent and the absence of poorly formed granulomas on lung biopsy. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia can have a similar clinical and radiographical presentation to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP). In chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, blood eosinophilia is usually higher than 1500/mm<sup>3</sup> and bronchoalveolar eosinophilia is higher than 25%. In our case, blood and BAL eosinophils were within the normal range. Also in histopathological patterns, a significant eosinophilic infiltration is seen, and the eosinophilic infiltration is often accompanied by foci of necrosis and proteinaceous debris, termed eosinophilic microabscesses \\[1, 4\\]. With these findings, we excluded all other diseases and established the diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP).\n\n【40】In our case report, a 32-year-old female presented with dry cough and progressive dyspnoea with high ESR and elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, with the imaging study showing peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe and biopsy, suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with granulation tissue and underwent remission of both clinical and radiological findings on treatment with systemic steroids.\n\n【41】Here, in this patient, transbronchial biopsy was suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) along with chest X-ray, and the HRCT finding was also favouring cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Here, we came to the final diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia after excluding all other possible conditions as well.In the absence of other contributing disease processes, diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia can be demonstrated by typical histological features in the patients with a compatible clinical and radiological pattern.\n\n【42】But in our case, we have also seen elevated levels of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) which responded to oral steroids. The features that favoured sarcoidosis were that there was a significant clearance of lesions with steroids. Also, the recurrence was in different areas of the lung once steroids were discontinued, and lesions once again responded both clinically and radiologically to steroids with a consistent drop in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, suggesting a sarcoidosis aetiology to the disease.\n\n【43】In cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP), often complete clearance of the lesions is seldom seen, even though they do respond to steroids but not as dramatically as in our case. Also, recurrence of the lesion in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) at different sites is uncommon as it generally progresses in the same site. Distinguishing cryptogenic organizing pneumonia from sarcoidosis can be difficult. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia frequently occurs in 40 to 60 years, and sarcoidosis usually occurs in the age group of 20 to 50 \\[5\\]. Both entities may present with almost same clinical symptoms. The histological appearance of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and sarcoidosis differs as mononuclear cells and Langerhans giant-cell granulomas characterize acinar infiltrates of sarcoidosis, whereas cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is characterized by fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and granulation buds in the distal airways and alveoli. The BAL study will show mononuclear cells in sarcoidosis and mixed cell populations with a modestly increased lymphocyte number in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Since our patient had a significant clinical, radiological, and pathological overlap of symptoms which could not be explained by either cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or sarcoidosis alone, an overlap of sarcoidosis-cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) was a strong possibility.\n\n【44】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【45】In conclusion, for this patient, we came to a diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis as a possible cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is worth considering with the mixed spectrum of presentation as in our case. And to our knowledge, this type of presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with sarcoidosis as an overlap disease is very rare, and this possibility needs to be explored by more series of such cases.\n\n【46】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【47】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Imaging studies led to a diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome combined with internal jugular vein thrombus. We investigated the cause of thrombosis and found that the anticoagulant activity of protein C was decreased. Genetic analysis showed the presence of a c.125C>A (Arg42Ser) substitution in the protein C gene (_PROC_) of the proband, which generates an Arg42Ser mutation that replaces the scissile bond Arg42-Ala43 normally cleaved by a furin-like processing protease. Her father and younger brother also carried this mutation, although they had no evidence of thrombosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Budd-Chiari syndrome is defined as any pathophysiologic process, such as thrombosis, that results in an interruption or diminution of the normal flow of blood from the liver \\[1\\]. One cause of this syndrome is a deficiency in protein C \\[2–4\\], a precursor of a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that plays an important role in the regulation of blood coagulation \\[5–7\\]. Heterozygous protein C deficiency is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and hereditary deficiency in this protein is associated with a high risk of thrombotic disease \\[8\\]. A c.125C>A change in the protein C gene (_PROC_) is designated protein C Osaka 10. This mutation had been reported in only one case so far \\[9\\]. Although some cases of Budd-Chiari syndrome have been reported to be caused by hereditary protein C deficiency, genetic analysis of family members was not investigated.\n\n【4】To our knowledge, the present study represents the first case report describing Budd-Chiari syndrome combined with multiple thrombotic lesions and genetic analysis of family members.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 34-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of a weight gain of up to 15 kg and increased bilateral pedal edema over the preceding 3 weeks. She did not have a history of these symptoms and was not taking any medications. On admission, her pulse rate was 84 beats/min, her blood pressure was 130/84 mmHg, and her body temperature, 36.7°C. Her consciousness was alert, her bulbar conjunctiva were not icteric, and the palpebral conjunctiva were not pale. No respiratory rales or heart murmurs were noted on auscultation. Palpation revealed hepatosplenomegaly and ascites with no enlargement of the thyroid gland. Neurological abnormalities, jaundice, or palmar erythema was not evident. However, bilateral pedal edema was observed.\n\n【7】Laboratory data acquired upon admission are shown in Table 1. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (46 IU/L) and D-dimer (1.40 _μ_g/mL) were slightly elevated. Her chest X-ray and echocardiogram were normal, but carotid ultrasonography showed a thrombus of the right internal jugular vein (Figure 1(a)). Blood flow in the right internal jugular vein was maintained and did not require immediate treatment. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) showed hepatomegaly, ascites, gallbladder wall thickening, and a thrombus within the intrahepatic portion of the inferior vena cava. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a region of high-intensity, which suggested the presence of a thrombus within the inferior vena cava (Figure 1(b)). Abdominal-pelvic CT and MRI analyses did not detect tumors. The presence of right pleural effusion and dilatation of an azygos vein were evident in CT images acquired following the injection of contrast medium (Figure 1(c)). Venous angiography revealed a thrombus within the inferior vena cava at its outlet that extended to the right atrium and was accompanied by intrahepatic collaterals (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). This patient was therefore diagnosed with Budd-Chiari syndrome.\n\n【8】Table 1 \n\n【9】Laboratory test values of the proband upon admission.\n\n【10】  \n**(a)**\n\n【11】  \n**(b)**\n\n【12】  \n**(c)**\n\n【13】  \n**(d)**\n\n【14】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【15】Figure 1 \n\n【16】| Imaging studies.

The arrow points to the the stent. |\n| --- |\n\n【24】Based on the results of a previous study, we expected that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), a minimally invasive procedure, would result in a favorable outcome \\[10\\]. We performed PTA with stent implantation (LUMINEXX 14 × 80 mm) and successful balloon dilatation (OPTA Pro 10 × 40 mm) from the outlet of the inferior vena cava to the right atrium (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). The pressure of the inferior vena cava decreased after PTA from 25 mmHg to 16 mmHg. Although we prepared the operation for a case of pulmonary embolism, PTA was completed without any complications. We started treatment by administering intravenous heparin sodium (10,000 units/day). Heparin sodium infusion was discontinued 2 days after PTA, and the patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. Abdominal CT during injection of contrast medium was performed on postoperative day 10 and showed the patency of the inferior vena cava. Abdominal ultrasonography showed that hepatomegaly, ascites, and gallbladder wall thickening were diminished. Bilateral pedal edema was dramatically alleviated after 14 days.\n\n【25】We examined protein C anticoagulant activity and it was decreased to 44% (normal: 64%–146%), contributing to thrombogenesis. Protein C anticoagulant activity was decreased in her father (61%) and younger brother (62%) (Table 2). While the medical histories of her younger brother and father were not informative, her younger brother had been suffering for several years from idiopathic recurrent chest pain.\n\n【26】Table 2 \n\n【27】Analysis of clotting factors.\n\n【28】To determine whether or not the patient and her family members harbored _PROC_ mutations, we performed genetic analyses after we obtained informed written consent. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood samples using a QIAamp DNA Blood MiniKit kit (Qiagen). All exons and flanking intronic regions of _PROC_ were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and then sequenced in both sense and antisense strands using an ABI Prism BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) \\[11\\]. Primer sequences are available on request. A c.125C>A change that encodes an Arg42Ser mutation was identified in the patient. Arg42 is located at the cleavage site recognized by the furin-like protease that normally processes preproprotein C to its mature form.\n\n【29】This mutation was also identified in the patient’s father and younger brother, whereas the sequence of her mother’s DNA in this region was found to be wild-type (Figure 3). Although her younger brother did not have evidence of thrombosis, his idiopathic recurrent chest pain may be shown by pulmonary embolism due to microscopic thrombosis. And he desired administration of warfarin. Warfarin (3–6 mg/day orally) was given to the patient and younger brother according to the levels of prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (maintaining between 2.0 and 2.5). Abdominal Doppler ultrasonography, which was performed during a follow-up visit to the outpatient clinic 16 months after the procedure, showed complete patency and no ectopia of the stent (Figure 1(d)). Carotid ultrasonography showed that blood flow in the right internal jugular vein was maintained.\n\n【30】  \n\n【31】  \n\n【32】Figure 3 \n\n【33】| DNA sequence analysis.

This mutation was also identified in her father and her younger brother but not in her mother. |\n| --- |\n\n【34】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【35】We describe here a patient with Budd-Chiari syndrome with multiple venous thrombi caused by an Arg42Ser mutation in _PROC_. Her father and younger brother also carried this mutation; however, they were free of detectable thrombosis. Her mother was genetically unaffected.\n\n【36】Budd-Chiari syndrome is defined as any pathophysiologic process that results in an interruption or diminution of the normal flow of blood out of the liver. This presentation is uncommon, often dramatic illness characterized by abdominal pain, ascites, hepatomegaly and a poor prognosis \\[1\\]. The diagnosis can be established noninvasively by ultrasonography with Doppler studies, CT scan, or magnetic resonance angiography (MRI angiography) \\[12–14\\]. Treatment depends upon the cause, the anatomic location, and extent of the thrombotic process \\[15\\]. The etiology of Budd-Chiari syndrome, a rare disorder, is varied, and its cause remains unknown in most patients \\[16\\]. Analysis of 157 patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome in Japan revealed that 141 were idiopathic, 2 were deficient in protein C, 2 were deficient in protein S, and 1 was deficient in antithrombin \\[17\\]. Protein C deficiency is one of the causes of Budd-Chiari syndrome \\[2–4\\].\n\n【37】Protein C is the precursor of a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that plays an important role in the regulation of blood coagulation \\[5–7\\]. The observed molecular mass of protein C is approximately 62 kDa, accounted for by one light chain (21 kDa) and one heavy chain (41 kDa), which are connected by a disulfide bridge. The primary effect of activated protein C is to inactivate coagulation factors Va and VIIIa, which are necessary for the efficient generation of thrombin and the activation of factor X. Congenital protein C deficiency is most often transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with varying degrees of penetrance \\[18\\]. Heterozygous protein C deficiency is an important independent risk factor for the development of deep vein thrombosis, \\[19\\] characterized by recurrent venous thrombosis. In this case, c.125C>A _PROC_ mutation was identified in the proband, where CGT encoding Arg42 at the furin-like processing enzyme cleavage site was changed to AGT encoding Ser. This mutation abolishes the cleavage site required for production of mature protein C molecule \\[9\\]. In this mutation, the specificity of the processing protease would be shifted to a Lys-Ser bond to produce mutant protein C with loss of anticoagulant activity. Protein C Osaka 10 showed normal amidolytic activity and a normal protein C antigen level; however, it had an anticoagulant activity of only about 50% compared to that of the wild-type protein. This mutation is characterized as type 2 protein C deficiency. In this case, protein C antigen of the patient and her younger brother was decreased by administration of warfarin (Table 2).\n\n【38】In a study of 173 patients with deep vein thrombosis, 55 (32%) were found to carry mutations in genes encoding protein S, protein C, and antithrombin \\[11\\]. However, deficiency of protein C occurs in a variety of other conditions, such as severe liver disorders, the nephrotic syndrome, acute respiratory distress, and postoperative states \\[20\\], suggesting the importance of extending investigations of _PROC_ particularly to patients suffering from multiple thrombi. The frequency of heterozygous protein C deficiency may be as high as 1/200 to 1/500 in healthy adults; however, those affected do not exhibit thrombotic manifestations \\[21, 22\\]. This study also indicates that other unidentified factors may play an important role in the clinical signs of thrombosis formation.\n\n【39】The patient, her father, and younger brother described here express Protein C Osaka 10. However, her father and younger brother showed no detectable thrombi. The implementation of primary prophylaxis with aspirin, heparin, or warfarin is often considered in known familial cases. Anticoagulant prophylaxis is given to all patients who develop a venous clot regardless of the underlying cause. Patients with protein C deficiency are at increased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolic events. Long term anticoagulation therapy using warfarin may be considered in these patients \\[23\\]. Therefore, we believe that familial screening for _PROC_ mutations could avoid new thrombotic complications as well as improving the long term prognosis of the patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome caused by protein C deficiency.\n\n【40】We suggest a hypothesis to account for the absence of detectable thrombosis in our patient’s family members, these individuals harbored the same mutation as our patient with a concomitant decrease in protein C activity. The hypothesis maintains that elevated levels of total cholesterol may be a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Studies on the association between lipid profile and VTE are inconsistent, with some reporting that total cholesterol is the risk factor \\[24\\], while others report that lipid levels do not influence the risk of VTE; however, the levels of LDL are significantly associated with unprovoked VTE as revealed by univariate analysis \\[25\\]. Further, statins can prevent VTE \\[26\\]. The levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in our patient (total cholesterol, 299 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol, 195 mg/dL) were higher than those of her younger brother (total cholesterol, 234 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol; 161 mg/dL) and father (total cholesterol, 200 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol, 99 mg/dL). Moreover, we noted no recurrence of thrombosis after statins were administered to our patient.\n\n【41】In summary, we describe here a case of Budd-Chiari syndrome with multiple venous thrombi caused by an Arg42Ser mutation in _PROC_ and in two of three of her family members without detectable thrombosis. Thus, the patient’s brother and father did not experience thrombotic events, even though they harbored the same mutation with a concomitant decrease in protein C activity. Further, the difference between the patient’s complicated thrombosis and family members with no thrombosis, even though they all harbor the same _PROC_ mutation, may be associated with lipid levels. Therefore, the contribution of this mutation to thrombogenicity remains to be determined.\n\n【42】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【43】The authors state that they have no conflict of interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of bone are known for their local aggressiveness and high recurrence rate. Patients with GCT present with nonspecific symptoms including pain, overlying soft-tissue swelling, and decreased range of motion at the adjacent joint \\[1\\].\n\n【4】They rarely metastasize to distant structures such as the lung, although these metastases generally have the same benign histologic appearance as the index tumor \\[2\\]. Even rarer are cases of multicentric giant cell tumor. Most multicentric giant cell tumors are synchronous, that is, occurring within a poorly defined time of the initial tumor \\[3\\].\n\n【5】In this paper, we present the case of a metachronous giant cell tumor as well as a review of the literature of metachronous multicentric giant cell tumor.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】An 18-year-old female presented to our institution with inflammatory right elbow pain and elbow stiffness. X-rays showed a lucent image on the medial aspect of the right distal humeral metaphysis with a radiologically intact cortex (Figure 1). Histological diagnosis of GCT was made on open biopsy. Extensive curettage was undertaken, phenol was applied on the walls of the remaining cavity as well as high-speed burring, and the cavity was filled with methyl methacrylate, with a satisfying result.\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| AP view of the elbow with radiolucent lesion of the medial condyle. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】Four years later, X-rays showed involvement of the lateral condyle and MRI articular involvement. The diagnosis of recurrent GCT was confirmed on biopsy. A total marginal excision of the elbow joint was undertaken along with prosthetic elbow arthroplasty. Three years following the surgery, the patient was free of tumor and pain but had an unstable elbow due to prosthetic dislocation, but she said that she was satisfied with the result and refused revision surgery.\n\n【13】She was then lost to followup and came back only 7 years later, at the age of 32, after a fall from the stairs with pain around the left hip persisting for several weeks despite a regular use of anti-inflammatories and pain killers. Pelvic radiographs showed a lucent lesion of the left iliac bone (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). MRI showed active lytic process occupying the left iliac wing without cortical or joint involvement. PET-CT scan showed a high uptake of left iliac wing (6.8 SUV uptake) with no other involvement sites. Parathyroid hormone levels were normal. Biopsy confirmed GCT. She was operated on with curettage, application of phenol and alcohol, and methyl methacrylate. Followup after two years was clinically and radiologically unremarkable and a chest CT scan one year later showed no lung metastases.\n\n【14】  \n**(a)**\n\n【15】  \n**(b)**\n\n【16】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【17】Figure 2 \n\n【18】| AP view of the pelvis showing a lucent lesion of the supra-acetabular area of the left iliac bone. |\n| --- |\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Material and Methods\n\n【20】A MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Google Scholar search was done using the following keywords: metachronous giant cell tumor. Inclusion criteria were (1) case report of metachronous multifocal GCT; (2) histologically confirmed GCT. The first distinction between synchronous and metachronous GCT was provided by Park et al. who defined a metachronous GCT as a GCT with 2 or more locations separated by more than 6 months in presentation \\[4\\]. Clinical characteristics of each case, involvement sites, radiographic findings, treatment modalities, and recurrences were recorded (Table 1).\n\n【21】Table 1 \n\n【22】Analysis of all metachronous multicentric GCT.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Results (Table 1)\n\n【24】A total of 37 cases of multifocal metachronous GCT were identified until 2012. There were 15 (40%) male and 22 (60%) female patients. Average age at diagnosis of the first GCT was 23 years.\n\n【25】The site of first involvement was in the upper extremity in 16 cases: 4 in the distal ulna, 4 in the distal radius, 5 in the humerus (4 proximal and 1 distal), and 3 in the hand, and in the lower extremity in 19 patients: 7 in the distal femur, 7 in the proximal tibia, 3 in the proximal fibula, and 2 in the foot. One patient had the first tumor in the pelvis and another one in the sphenoidal bone.\n\n【26】For the 2nd metachronous location of the GCT, 12 cases were in the upper limb: 7 in the humerus (4 proximal and 3 distal), 2 in the radius (1 proximal and 1 distal), 2 in the proximal ulna, and 1 in the hand. 11 cases were in the lower limb: 3 in the femur (1 proximal and 2 distal), 6 in the tibia (6 proximal and 1 distal), and 1 in the foot. In 7 metachronous tumors, the second location was in the trunk: 1 in the spine, 4 in the pelvis, and 2 in the skull. There were 7 metachronous GCTs in 2 or more locations: 1 in the proximal tibia and acetabulum, 1 in the ipsilateral proximal femur and proximal tibia, 1 in the ipsilateral proximal femur and fibula, 1 in the distal tibia and sacrum, 1 in the left proximal femur and right iliac wing, 1 in right foot, left fibula, right radius, and lung, and 1 in the pelvis, skull, and lung.\n\n【27】There was a 3rd metachronous location of the GCT in 11 patients (30%) and a 4th one in 2 patients (5%). 11 patients (28.5%) had a recurrence of their initial GCT at the same location. The mean duration separating the 2 locations of the metachronous multifocal tumors was 74.5 months.\n\n【28】The treatment used for the first location(s) of the GCT was resection of the tumor in 11 cases (29.7%), curettage with bone graft in 16 patients (43.6%), curettage alone in 1 patient (2.7%), curettage with PMMA in 2 patients (5.4%), curettage with cryotherapy in 1 patient (2.7%), amputation in 3 cases (8.1%), radiotherapy in 2 cases (5.4%), and unknown in 1 case (2.7%).\n\n【29】On an average 73-month followup, 20 patients (54%) suffering from multifocal metachronous GCT were disease-free, 8 patients (22%) still had a tumor in 1 or more locations but were asymptomatic, 2 patients (5%) died from the disease and its complications, and 7 patients (19%) were lost to followup.\n\n【30】Overall, 3 patients had metastases in the lung at the final followup: 2 as a second location and 1 as a 4th location. The 3 patients died from this complication. The mean lapse of time between the first and second locations of the GCT is 10 months.\n\n【31】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【32】Giant cell tumors are typically lesions of young and middle-aged adults, with 80% of tumors occurring in patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and a peak prevalence in the third decade of life. They account for 4% to 5% of primary bone tumors. Multifocal GCTs are rare. Approximately 1% of cases present as multiple synchronous or metachronous lesions \\[17\\]. Most multifocal GCTs are synchronous and 68% of cases of multicentric giant cell tumor occur in less than 4 years from the initial lesion treatment \\[18\\]. They have a more aggressive course, including an increased incidence of pathologic fractures \\[13\\].\n\n【33】There is a slight female predominance in metachronous GCT (57% versus 43%) \\[3\\] but not a 2 : 1 ratio as reported in the literature \\[23\\]. We have found a 3 : 2 female : male ratio in this study. GCT occurs between the 3rd and 5th decades of life and >80% of patients are more than 25 years old \\[21, 23\\]. However, patients with multicentric GCT tend to be younger averaging 23 with more than 70% aged 25 years old or younger at the time of initial diagnosis. The youngest patient reported with multicentric is 10 years old \\[13, 16\\].\n\n【34】The etiology of multifocal GCT is unclear: de novo formation or a metastatic phenomenon. Solitary benign GCTs may metastasize to the lung or undergo malignant transformation (either de novo or following irradiation); however, pathologic analysis of multifocal GCT reveals findings identical to histologically benign solitary tumors \\[3\\]. This suggests that the multifocality of some GCT is not a metastatic phenomenon but rather represents the separate development of the tumor at multiple sites \\[1, 2\\]. Iatrogenic seeding may represent a cause of multicentric giant cell tumors \\[18\\].\n\n【35】The most common site of the primary GCT is around the knee (44%), followed by wrist (23%) and hand and feet (13%), and is consistent with localization of solitary GCT. Diaphyseal involvement is more found in multifocal than in solitary GCT \\[21\\]. Some studies suggested that GCTs of hand and feet are more likely to have a more aggressive course (17% in multicentric GCT compared to 2% in solitary GCT \\[23\\]). They recommended a skeletal survey for these tumors as well as multiple followups to detect metachronous GCT \\[24, 25\\].\n\n【36】Recurrence rate of multicentric GCT is 28.5% and is comparable to the 35% recurrence rate of solitary GCT \\[3, 23\\]. Pulmonary metastasis in solitary GCT occurs in less than 2% of patients \\[23\\]. In multicentric multifocal GCT, it occurs more frequently and averages around 8%.\n\n【37】In general, multicentric giant cell tumor is histologically indistinguishable from solitary giant cell tumor \\[21, 23\\] and has the following characteristics: large vascular lacunae separated by septa in which numerous giant cells are found and filled with clotted blood (blood-filled spaces with bland fibrous connective tissue septa). These cavernous spaces vessels lack walls and normal features of blood vessels and stroma is formed of histiocytes, fibroblasts, scattered giant cells, hemosiderin, and occasional inflammatory cells \\[18\\]. Differential diagnosis for multicentric giant cell tumors includes brown tumor, Paget’s disease, osteomyelitis, fibrous dysplasia, giant cell reparative granuloma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, osteosarcoma, hematopoietic malignant tumor, and metastasis \\[18, 23\\]. Before a diagnosis of multicentric giant cell tumor can be made, it is necessary to rule out the presence of hyperparathyroidism, which can produce features of a polyostotic osteolytic lesion that are virtually identical to those of a giant cell tumor of bone \\[4\\].\n\n【38】Limitations to this review are that only case reports are available and many patients were lost to subsequent followup to uniform the population.\n\n【39】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【40】In summary, multicentric giant cell tumor is rare and most commonly affects long bones, particularly those around the knee. It tends to occur in younger patients and frequently manifests as synchronous lesions. In addition, lesions of multicentric giant cell tumor may have an unusual metaphysodiaphyseal location. Virtually all tumors have areas with typical histopathologic features of giant cell tumor. As in solitary giant cell tumor, the most aggressive behavior of the vast majority of multicentric giant cell tumors is local recurrence, especially in multicentric metachronous GCT of hand and feet, although there have been rare cases of metastasis to the lungs. Because a variety of other primary bone lesions may also have a polyostotic presentation, the correct diagnosis relies on correlation of clinical and radiographic findings with confirmation of the diagnosis by histopathologic examination.\n\n【41】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【42】B.

Workup not only confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 but also revealed discordant HIV test results, with a reactive fourth-generation antigen/antibody test but a negative HIV-1/2 differentiation immunoassay. Subsequent HIV viral load testing obtained two days later ultimately established a diagnosis of acute HIV (AHI). Screening for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is critical that providers (1) continue recommended screening for HIV as an essential service; (2) consider acute HIV in the differential when evaluating patients with acute viral syndromes; (3) recognize that AHI can occur concurrently with other infections, including COVID-19; and (4) understand the differential diagnosis for discordant HIV test results and know when HIV viral load testing is needed to resolve such discordant results.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】With over 33 million cases and nearly 600,000 deaths in the United States alone, \\[1\\] COVID-19 remained at the forefront of attention for both public health and clinical medicine throughout much of 2020 and into 2021. Because COVID-19 was an extremely common diagnosis during this period, this illness was often at the top of the differential when patients presented with nonspecific symptoms suggestive of viral illness. Non-COVID-19 diagnoses such as acute HIV (AHI) with similar presentations could have been easily missed. In this case report, we discuss a case of acute HIV (AHI) diagnosed concurrently with COVID-19. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of COVID-19 and AHI coinfection. Our goals are to (1) describe and draw attention to the symptom overlap between viral illnesses such as COVID-19 and AHI, (2) review the interpretation of discordant HIV test results with a focus on AHI, and (3) encourage providers to continue screening for HIV in routine clinical settings even during public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 26-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) in February of 2021 feeling generally unwell, with 3 days of symptoms including diaphoresis, dizziness, loose stools, and loss of taste sensation. His past medical history included occasional methamphetamine and cocaine use along with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Vital signs included a temperature of 36°C, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, blood pressure of 131/80 mm of mercury, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air.\n\n【6】Bloodwork revealed a white blood cell count of 6.6 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/liter with lymphopenia (absolute lymphocytes 0.3 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/liter). The patient’s complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel were otherwise normal. Initial evaluation for pulmonary and gastrointestinal infections included a chest X-ray which demonstrated clear lungs and negative stool polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for _Clostridium difficile_. A nasopharyngeal PCR swab confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\n【7】The ED physician took a sexual history, noting that the patient had recently ended a relationship with a female partner and had several condomless sex partners thereafter. The patient was screened for HIV in the ED, with results as presented in Table 1. He was discharged with these results still pending. A laboratory-based 4<sup>th</sup>\\-generation HIV antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) test was reactive, while HIV differentiation testing was negative. Outpatient HIV testing was repeated two days later, this time including an HIV RNA. The patient was started on antiretroviral therapy (ART) while awaiting his repeat test results. Again, the 4<sup>th</sup>\\-generation Ag/Ab test was reactive, and the differentiation test was negative. HIV RNA was detectable at nearly 1 million copies/ml. A diagnosis of AHI was confirmed and disclosed to the patient, who continued ART and immediately established HIV care.\n\n【8】Table 1 \n\n【9】HIV test results in a case of concurrent acute HIV and COVID-19.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】This case of a young man with concurrent COVID-19 and AHI (defined as the initial weeks after HIV infection, prior to antibody formation) illustrates several important points regarding the presentation and diagnosis of AHI, especially during a global public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【12】First, likely due in part to COVID-19-related disruptions in routine clinical services, screening for HIV declined dramatically during the COVID-19 era. Compared with the same period in 2019, following implementation of stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders throughout much of the country, there were nearly 700,000 fewer screening HIV Ag/Ab tests sent and almost 5,000 fewer new HIV-1 diagnoses confirmed at a large U.S. commercial laboratory from March–September 2020 \\[2\\]. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all people aged 13–64 be screened for HIV at least once (and that people with risk factors be screened at least annually), these recommendations were likely deferred throughout much of 2020-2021. At the same time, HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use and uptake declined, with modeling studies estimating a 21% decrease in PrEP prescriptions and a 28% decrease in new PrEP users in March–September of 2020 compared with the prior year \\[3\\].\n\n【13】Screening for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) similarly decreased during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Nationally reported cases of gonorrhea (GC), chlamydia (CT), and primary/secondary syphilis declined steeply in March 2020, despite having risen steadily over the last ten years, resulting in over 27,000 fewer reported GC cases than would have otherwise been expected in April of the same year \\[4\\]. U.S. cities and states demonstrated similar findings: the state of California, for example, reported 31%, 15%, and 13% fewer cases of CT, primary and secondary syphilis, and GC in January–June 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 \\[5\\].\n\n【14】These declines in HIV/STI diagnoses were unlikely to have been driven exclusively by COVID-19-related changes in sexual behavior. While some patients may have changed their sexual practices in response to social distancing requirements, many likely did not, especially as COVID-19 continued into a second year. A review incorporating 20 articles from 12 countries confirmed that many people (25–60%) did not reduce their numbers of sexual partners during the COVID-19 era \\[6\\]. In at least one U.S. survey of men who have sex with men, respondents instead reported mean increases of 2.1 anal sex partners \\[7\\].\n\n【15】For these reasons, many patients remained vulnerable to STIs/HIV but were less likely to be screened in routine clinical settings at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowing that patients may have missed routine HIV screening, it is imperative for clinicians to consider HIV in their differential diagnoses for viral syndromes, particularly since, as in the case of our patient, there can be a significant symptom overlap between AHI and other viral processes. Indeed, many of the classic COVID-19 signs/symptoms \\[8\\], including fever, myalgias/arthralgias, pharyngitis, and even gastrointestinal symptoms, are nonspecific and can also be seen in AHI \\[9\\]. In terms of laboratory abnormalities, lymphopenia may similarly be observed in both conditions \\[10, 11\\]. Our patient’s AHI diagnosis could have easily been missed had his symptoms been ascribed exclusively to COVID-19 and HIV screening not been sent. Without a confirmed AHI diagnosis, the patient would have been unable to rapidly start ART, an approach known to decrease the risk of forward transmission while reducing loss-to-follow up, improving virologic suppression rates, and potentially decreasing mortality \\[12\\].\n\n【16】Providers should resume screening for HIV and other STIs as an essential service and should consider AHI when evaluating patients like ours with acute viral syndromes. We were fortunate that a sexual history was taken and that HIV screening was initiated when our patient first presented to the ED. Such steps could easily have been deferred, particularly in a busy clinical setting and with an already-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. The benefits of sending workup for HIV alongside COVID-19 were similarly demonstrated in Chicago, where a 2020 initiative incorporating routine HIV screening for all patients undergoing COVID-19 evaluations resulted in 9 diagnoses of AHI, including one other case of AHI/COVID-19 coinfection, the details of which have not been previously described in the literature \\[13\\].\n\n【17】In addition to remaining vigilant to AHI as an alternative or concurrent explanation for nonspecific viral-like symptoms, providers should consider AHI as a possibility when interpreting discordant HIV test results rather than assuming such results represent false positives. After initial HIV exposure, HIV RNA becomes detectable first (often within days of infection), followed by the p24 antigen (detectable within 2-3 weeks after exposure) and finally HIV-1 and 2 antibodies (detectable another week or more thereafter). In routine clinical settings, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends \\[14\\] screening for HIV with a laboratory-based HIV Ag/Ab combination immunoassay, capable of detecting the p24 antigen as well as HIV-1 and 2 antibodies \\[15\\]. If the laboratory-based HIV Ag/Ab test is reactive, as was the case with our patient, the second recommended step in workup is a separate immunoassay differentiating antibodies to either HIV-1 or HIV-2. In cases where the differentiation assay is positive for such antibodies, a diagnosis of HIV is confirmed. However, if the differentiation is indeterminate or negative, as was seen with our AHI patient (who presumably had a detectable p24 antigen but had not yet formed HIV antibodies), an HIV RNA is required as the final diagnostic step \\[14\\].\n\n【18】In line with this recommended HIV testing algorithm (Figure 1), our patient had repeat HIV testing, including an HIV RNA, performed within two days of his initial discordant HIV test results. This process allowed for rapid confirmation of the AHI diagnosis and linkage to HIV care. Such favorable outcomes would not have been possible had this patient not been (A) initially screened for HIV/AHI alongside COVID-19 and (B) rapidly retested with an HIV RNA in response to his initial HIV test results. While viral load testing is rarely used as a screening tool due to cost and turnaround time, providers should consider sending an HIV RNA alongside initial Ag/Ab testing in cases where there is a high suspicion for AHI based on symptoms or exposures, as the former test can be necessary to clinch an AHI diagnosis.\n\n【19】  \n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Figure 1 \n\n【22】Recommended HIV screening algorithm in routine clinical settings. <sup>∗</sup>HIV viral load testing still indicated if high clinical concern for acute HIV and/or in high incidence patient populations, as this is the first test to become positive after HIV acquisition.\n\n【23】To our knowledge, this is the first detailed description of a case of concurrent AHI and COVID-19. This case highlights the importance of recognizing the symptom overlap between AHI and other viral illnesses, reinstating routine HIV screening practices, and using HIV RNA testing when needed to resolve discordant HIV test results.\n\n【24】#### Data Availability\n\n【25】No data were used as this case report involves a single patient.\n\n【26】#### Consent\n\n【27】No written consent has been obtained from the patient as there is no uniquely identifiable patient information included in this case report.\n\n【28】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【29】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【30】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【31】This work was supported in part by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, grant no. 6 NU62PS924589-01-02, which supports Dr. Kelly Johnson’s time.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We report a rare case of a 76-year-old man who presented with a three-month history of right flank dullness and was noted to have a nonhomogeneous retroperitoneal mass with hydronephrosis of the right kidney on computed tomography of the abdomen. Computed tomography of the thorax showed a nodule in the lower lobe, measuring 3 × 2  cm, in the right lung. After excluding the presence of other primary tumors and metastases, we reached a final diagnosis of solitary retroperitoneal metastasis of adenocarcinoma of the lung. Although rare, in patients of non-small cell lung cancer, presence of hydronephrosis should alert the physician to the possibility of metastasis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death for both genders. At the time of diagnosis, only 20% of all lung cancer patients will have local disease, while 55% will have distant metastatic disease \\[1\\]. The brain is the most common site of metastases of lung cancer followed by the bones, liver, and adrenal glands \\[2\\]. However, ureteral obstruction caused by metastases of lung cancer is extremely rare. Here we report a unique case of metastatic ureteral involvement of non-small cell lung cancer which was the first clinical evidence of the underlying malignancy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 76-year-old man presented with a three-month history of right flank dullness. He had not had any respiratory symptoms, and no malignancies had been diagnosed. He did not smoke tobacco. Physical examination results were mostly normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed a non-homogeneous retroperitoneal mass with hydronephrosis of the right kidney. CT of the thorax showed a soft tissue density nodule with spiculated margins and vascular convergence in the lower lobe, measuring 3 × 2  cm, in the right lung (Figure 1). These morphologic characteristics on CT scans were suspicious for primary lung cancer. CT of the head and bone scan were negative for metastases. Laboratory data, including those for prostate-specific antigen, _α_\\-fetoprotein, _β_\\-human chorionic gonadotropin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 19-9, were within normal limits except for elevated serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL (normal, 0.6 mg/dL–1.1 mg/dL). Urinalysis results were also normal.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】| Computed tomography of the thorax showed a soft tissue density nodule with spiculated margins and vascular convergence in the lower lobe, measuring 3 × 2  cm, in the right lung. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】A right retrograde ureterogram showed a continuous extrinsic obstruction, 7 cm in length, of the middle third of the ureter (Figure 2). The results of cytologic assessment of urine specimens collected from the right ureter were normal. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images demonstrated a retroperitoneal mass, measuring 3 × 3 × 5  cm, with compression of the inferior vena cava (Figure 3(a)). Enhancement by gadolinium-diethylenetetraminepentaacetic acid of the T1-weighted images showed a high-intensity rim (Figure 3(b)). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed that a luminal mass caused obstruction of the bronchi and was used for brushing of the lesion for cytologic evaluation of the specimens, which showed the tumor to be a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. CT-guided fine needle biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass was performed, and the pathological examination indicated a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with fibrosis (Figure 4). The pathological features were consistent with metastasis of adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Figure 2 \n\n【14】| A right retrograde ureterogram showed a continuous extrinsic obstruction of the middle third of the ureter (arrowheads). |\n| --- |\n\n【15】  \n**(a)**\n\n【16】  \n**(b)**\n\n【17】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】| (a) T1-weighted magnetic resonance images demonstrated a retroperitoneal mass (arrowheads) with compression of the inferior vena (arrow).

Subsequent occurrence of many small lung nodules, which may be consistent with metastatic disease, was not observed. Chemotherapy was initiated, but the patient died as a result of compression of the inferior vena cava by the retroperitoneal metastasis 6 months later after the diagnosis.\n\n【25】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【26】Hematogenous or lymphatic metastases from a distant primary neoplasm to the ureter are encountered infrequently. Babaian et al. reported 37 (0.3%) of 11,689 patients with malignant disease had histologically proved metastatic lesions to the ureter in a large series of autopsies \\[3\\]. The rarity of their occurrence probably reflects the segmental distribution of the blood and lymphatic vessels in the ureter and periureteral sheath, resulting in the absence of continuous longitudinal networks \\[4\\]. Secondarily, the lymph drainage of the ureter of the lower portion of the ureter is downward and counterdirectional to that of the pelvic organ \\[5\\]. The primary sites include stomach, colon, uterine cervix, breast, skin, prostate, lung, and adrenal gland. In the autopsy data, metastases to the ureter was found in 2 (0.2%) of 1281 lung cancer patients \\[3\\].\n\n【27】In the majority of cases, the presence of ureteral metastases is not either diagnosed or suspected prior to death. Early symptoms of ureteral metastases may be masked by the overbearing presence of the primary tumor or other metastases, or by the generally poor condition of the patient. In the present case, metastatic ureteral involvement of non-small cell lung cancer was the first clinical evidence of the underlying malignancy.\n\n【28】Radiographic findings of extrinsic ureteral obstruction due to metastatic diseases depend on the pattern of the tumoral spread: hematogenous submucosal/mucosal metastasis, hematogenous adventitia metastases spreading along periureteral vessels, scirrhous metastatic spread along periureteral vessels, or metastatic spread into lymph nodes with perinodal desmoplastic reaction \\[6\\]. The present case demonstrated the scirrhous spread pattern, which is seen especially in adenocarcinomas of the prostate, stomach, and colon \\[7–9\\].\n\n【29】Accurate determination of the extent of disease is critical in patients with lung cancer, as it has implications for both prognosis and treatment. The choice of surgical biopsy technique for diagnostic confirmation depends on many factors, for example, the size and anatomic location of the mass, and the overall estimated risk of malignancy. It should also be considered that the metastatic cells are usually dispersed diffusely in fibrotic plaque. In our case, multiple fine-needle aspiration biopsies of the retroperitoneal mass under CT guidance could establish the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary surgical exploration.\n\n【30】In patients of lung cancer, presence of hydronephrosis should alert the clinician to the possibility of metastasis and subsequent evaluation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9de45ff5-522c-4e7a-9c2c-2654de54e8d7", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】An autoimmune response causing inflammation in the brain tissue is called autoimmune encephalitis. Autoantibodies directed against N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors cause a type of autoimmune encephalitis resulting in memory loss, confusion, and psychosis. A 28-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, seizure disorder, and stroke presented with a 2-day history of bizarre behavior, restlessness, insomnia, agitation, and hallucinations. He was initially managed for acute psychosis without any improvement. Further workup for organic causes revealed positive NMDAR antibodies in both the cerebrospinal fluid and serum, confirming a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. His condition later improved with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. This case signifies the importance of ruling out organic causes in patients with unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms. NMDA encephalitis is more common in young females with underlying malignancies, especially ovarian teratomas. This case is unique, given the extremely rare occurrence of NMDA encephalitis in male patients without any malignancies.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Autoimmune encephalitis is caused by autoantibodies against neuronal cell surface/synaptic proteins called N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) \\[1\\]. NMDARs play a significant role in maintaining synaptic plasticity and memory. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis has been associated with multiple infectious agents, including _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, herpes simplex virus, measles virus, mumps, and group-A hemolytic _Streptococcus_ \\[2\\]. Here, we describe the case of a young male with a known diagnosis of schizophrenia, presenting with confusion and hallucinations warranting psychiatric management and subsequently found to have anti-NMDAR encephalitis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 28-year-old male presented with a 2-day history of restlessness, bizarre behavior, confusion, and hallucinations. His past medical history was significant for schizophrenia, seizure disorder, and stroke with residual left-sided facial droop. There was no family history of psychiatric disorders. His family reported that he had no recent fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, runny nose, sore throat, cough, headaches, urinary symptoms, loss of appetite, or loss of weight. On physical examination, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable. He was alert, oriented to person and place, but not to time. His fiancé reported that he had been pacing around his room, not sleeping, acting paranoid, and hearing voices. He was admitted to the psychiatry department for acute psychosis, where he was unsuccessfully managed with valproic acid, risperidone, and benztropine, with haloperidol and diphenhydramine as needed. A review of his chart revealed two past admissions for a similar presentation of acute psychosis, and he was discharged with outpatient psychiatry follow-up recommendation. The patient failed to follow-up as an outpatient, and no further workup was done at that time. His hospital course was complicated by worsening mental status, and he continued to be unresponsive to the abovementioned medications.\n\n【6】A thorough evaluation for organic causes was performed, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast, lumbar puncture (LP), and an autoimmune workup. The brain MRI with contrast showed multiple areas of bright signal intensity throughout the brain parenchyma, most notably in the medial temporal lobes and bilateral insular cortices, compatible with encephalitis (Figure 1). LP was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed white blood cell count, 8 mm<sup>3</sup>; neutrophils, 1 mm<sup>3</sup>; lymphocytes, 95%; protein, 35 mg/dl; and glucose, 56 mg/dl. CSF testing for herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 DNA, varicella zoster PCR, VDRL, FTA ABS, enterovirus, and viral cultures were negative. A mild elevation of antinuclear antibody (1 : 40 titer) was noted. Blood and CSF were positive for oligoclonal bands.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】  \n**(c)**\n\n【10】  \n**(d)**\n\n【11】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【12】Figure 1 \n\n【13】Axial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) demonstrating bright signal intensity and gyriform swelling in the region of the uncus (a) and thalami and insular cortex (b). This is best appreciated on flair images (c) and is harder to detect on T2-weighted images. The contrast study (d) does not show enhancement.\n\n【14】Initially, the patient was started on empirical treatment with vancomycin, ceftriaxone, and acyclovir for possible infectious causes of encephalitis. The diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis was confirmed when the CSF was found positive for NMDAR antibodies. Empiric antibiotics and acyclovir were discontinued, and the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days and methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 5 days.\n\n【15】The patient’s condition improved significantly. He was observed to have more meaningful conversations and an improvement in his pressured speech. Repeat MRI after two weeks showed decreased bright signal intensity, although swelling remained the same (Figure 2). The patient was discharged and was followed up as an outpatient with complete resolution of his symptoms.\n\n【16】  \n**(a)**\n\n【17】  \n**(b)**\n\n【18】  \n**(c)**\n\n【19】  \n**(d)**\n\n【20】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【21】Figure 2 \n\n【22】Axial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) one and a half weeks after treatment with immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone demonstrating gyriform swelling of the temporal lobes (a), especially medially, best seen on flair sequences (a, c, d). There is a faint bright signal intensity observed in the bilateral thalami and basal ganglia (c). Vague cortical brightness is also seen. There is no evidence of abnormal contrast enhancement (b). Compared to the earlier study, the degree of bright signal intensity is decreased, though swelling remains. These findings, with cortical, thalamic, and basal ganglia involvement, are typically seen in encephalitis.\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Although this patient presented with features typical of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, his history of schizophrenia, seizures, and acute psychotic episodes contributed to delayed diagnosis. The classic presentation of this syndrome involves the development of psychiatric symptoms, memory loss, sleep disturbances, and seizures \\[3\\]. Malignancy is a known risk factor, and teratomas, germ cell tumors of the testes, and small cell lung cancer are specifically hypothesized to be associated with the disease \\[4, 5\\]. The presence of anti-NMDAR antibodies is specific for diagnosis. Although it has been associated with pathogens including _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, herpes simplex virus, measles virus, mumps, and group-A hemolytic _Streptococcus_, these were all negative in our patient. The improvement of symptoms in our patient after treatment with IVIG and methylprednisolone further strengthens the diagnosis. The pathophysiology behind psychiatric manifestations of this disease is anti-NMDAR antibody inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid at the presynaptic junction in the thalamus and frontal cortex. Subsequently, postsynaptic glutaminergic neurons are uninhibited, resulting in dysregulation of the dopaminergic pathway \\[6\\].\n\n【25】Diagnosis of probable anti-NMDAR encephalitis requires the onset of at least four of the following symptoms within 3 months: abnormal behavior or cognitive dysfunction, speech dysfunction, movement disorder, dyskinesia, rigidity/abnormal posture, decreased level of consciousness, autonomic dysfunction, or central hypoventilation. Patients must also have either an abnormal electroencephalogram or CSF with pleocytosis or oligoclonal bands and reasonable exclusion of other disorders \\[7\\].\n\n【26】For a definitive diagnosis of anti-NMDAR encephalitis, IgG anti-GluN1 antibodies (NMDA receptor antibodies) should be positive in the presence of one or more of the six major groups of symptoms, after exclusion of other disorders \\[8\\]. Our patient met the diagnostic criteria for definitive anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The treatment approach to anti-NMDAR encephalitis includes removal of the etiological agents such as a tumor or treatment of the underlying infectious source and immunotherapy. The immunotherapies commonly used are corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, and plasma exchange with plasmapheresis in severe cases \\[8\\]. In resistant cases, immunosuppression is induced using rituximab, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, and methotrexate. Our patient responded well to immunotherapy with methylprednisolone and IVIG. Although symptoms are usually severe, studies suggest that patients are usually highly responsive to therapy \\[9\\]. As per a reported case series of 99 patients with all-cause encephalitis, 9.1% were found to have anti-NMDAR encephalitis. The mean age of these patients was 28 years, and 5 of 9 were females. Follow-up of these patients showed zero mortality and complete symptomatic recovery after treatment with high-dose corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin \\[9\\]. Prompt diagnosis and early treatment will reduce mortality and ensure complete recovery.\n\n【27】In conclusion, anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a very rare entity in male patients, especially in those without any underlying malignancies. However, physicians should consider this diagnosis as a differential in any young patient presenting with unexplained neuropsychiatric symptoms. Younger patients who present with an initial episode of bizarre behavior should be assessed to rule out major organic causes, as delay in diagnosis leads to poor patient outcomes. Although literature suggests a predominance of anti-NMDAR encephalitis occurs in women with ovarian teratomas, this case demonstrates that the diagnosis should also be considered in men without any signs and symptoms of a neoplastic process, and a thorough workup for the infectious source should be conducted \\[2\\].\n\n【28】#### Data Availability\n\n【29】The data used to support this study are restricted to protect patient privacy concern.\n\n【30】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【31】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "1788aa74-4a29-4c6b-a9a5-6f94e18cefa5", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Aortosternal venous compression (AVC) is a rare venous compression syndrome that involves brachiocephalic venous compression due to its positioning between the sternum and the aorta. One of the features of AVC involves compression of the left innominate vein with variability in luminal caliber on inspiration and expiration. Imaging modalities such as computed tomography (CT) examination can aid in initial diagnosis; however, venography can be utilized for confirmatory diagnosis due to its higher specificity during the inspiratory and expiratory phases. Through findings demonstrated during venography, we herein present two cases of confirmed AVC secondary to an aberrant right subclavian artery. Characteristic imaging features in the diagnosis of AVC and its etiology are discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Aortosternal venous compression (AVC) was first described by Wurtz et al. in 1989 \\[1\\]. It is a rare venous compression syndrome that is commonly asymptomatic in otherwise healthy patients due to compensation by collateral vasculature \\[2\\]. Scarcely reported symptoms in the literature include left upper extremity edema and intermittent instances of pain \\[1–3\\]. Although mediastinal masses can result in external compression of the underlying vasculature within the anterior or superior mediastinum, AVC is a diagnosis of exclusion. It can be caused by tortuous and/or ectatic great vessels resulting in associated compression on the underlying brachiocephalic vein in the setting of a diminished anterior-posterior chest diameter \\[2, 4, 5\\]. Three instances of an aberrant right subclavian artery have been reported in the literature as the causative agent of AVC; however, the prevalence of this etiology has yet to be established \\[2, 5\\].\n\n【4】We present two cases of AVC, in the setting of anatomical variation of aberrant right subclavian artery, wherein chest computed tomography (CT) and venography were utilized in establishing this rare diagnosis and its etiology.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 72-year-old female presented with ongoing paresthesia and “pulsations” of the right neck and scalp. Her medical history includes an asymptomatic congenital coronary to pulmonary artery fistula that was monitored without any surgical intervention. The patient denied any loss of consciousness, tinnitus, or slurred speech. Physical examination demonstrated a lack of neck or facial swelling, lack of skin discoloration, and absence of dysphagia. A focused upper extremity exam revealed intact sensations, 2+ reflexes bilaterally, normal muscle tone and motor strength 5/5, in addition to a steady gait. Laboratory investigations showed an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.0 and an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 29. Complete blood count (CBC), Vitamin B12, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were all within normal limits.\n\n【8】Due to the ongoing paresthesia, a contrast-enhanced CT head and neck was ordered. Initial imaging revealed an aberrant right subclavian artery with a course dorsal to the esophagus and an anteroposterior (AP) chest diameter of 6.4 cm (Figure 1). An ultrasound of the neck was ordered as part of the workup (Figure 2) which demonstrated no thrombus within either internal jugular vein (IJV) but did show the diffuse slow flow of the left IJV, with the near stagnant flow in the proximal left IJV. Findings were nonspecific; however, the layered appearance could be seen in the setting of underlying proximal compression/obstruction.\n\n【9】  \n**(a)**\n\n【10】  \n**(b)**\n\n【11】  \n**(c)**\n\n【12】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【13】Figure 1 \n\n【14】(a) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images (CTA neck) demonstrate the anatomical variation of an aberrant right subclavian artery (yellow arrow) with its course posterior to the esophagus, resulting in an impression along the dorsal aspect of the esophagus. The left brachiocephalic vein (purple arrow) demonstrates no evidence of stenosis, with the examination performed in the inspiratory phase. No evidence of diverticulum of Kommerell. Anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 8 cm on inspiratory phase.

(c) Comparison between the right IJV (A) and left IJV (B), with the left IJV demonstrating increased echogenicity of the blood suggesting underlying aggregation with near stagnant to and fro flow of blood. This layered appearance could be seen in the setting of underlying proximal compression/obstruction. Right IJV (A) was observed to be patent with the nonsluggish flow.\n\n【21】The initial CT neck did not include the entire mediastinum within the field of view and thus additional imaging with a chest CT was ordered to rule out mediastinal mass as an etiology of proximal compression. The subsequent imaging did not reveal a mediastinal mass or aortic arch aneurysm, however, did demonstrate a left-sided aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery without a diverticulum of Kommerell. However, as the CT chest examination was performed during the expiratory phase, findings of brachiocephalic venous compression were noted. A comparison was made to the prior CT angiography (CTA) neck, with interval difference in the brachiocephalic venous caliber. Thus, an inspiratory phase of the chest CT was also performed in the same setting to further evaluate the change in luminal caliber of the brachiocephalic vein. Findings of the chest CT (with inspiration and expiration) revealed the left brachiocephalic vein to become severely stenotic on expiration with an AP chest diameter of 5.6 cm. Comparatively, during inspiration, the chest CT revelated a patent left brachiocephalic vein with an AP chest diameter of 8 cm (Figure 3). Findings were suspicious for AVC, and thus venography was ordered. The venogram was obtained through a left upper extremity venous catheter during both expiration and inspiration. The venogram demonstrated severe stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein during expiration with multiple venous collaterals around the site of obstruction (Figure 4). The venogram during inspiration demonstrated prompt flow of contrast across the left brachiocephalic vein with no evidence of obstruction. Previous exclusion of other aforementioned etiologies of venous compression, and the venographic findings mentioned above, led to a diagnosis of AVC in the setting of anatomical variation of an aberrant right subclavian artery.\n\n【22】  \n**(a)**\n\n【23】  \n**(b)**\n\n【24】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【25】Figure 3 \n\n【26】(a) Axial noncontrast CT obtained in full inspiration demonstrates patent left brachiocephalic vein (purple arrow).

The patient opted out of having any surgical intervention. The patient has since been lost to follow-up.\n\n【34】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【35】A 34-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of dysphagia and headaches accompanied by left orbital pain with visualization of occasional “squiggly lines” in the left eye. Additionally, she complained of a warm sensation overlying the left forehead and ipsilateral ear. She denied any pulsatile tinnitus, facial droop, or paresthesia. The medical history of the patient included tonsillectomy, with a family history of intracranial aneurysms, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, colorectal cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【36】On physical examination, she was alert and oriented to person, time, and place. No cranial or carotid bruits were observed. Normal ocular vision with no pathological nystagmus, proptosis, or diplopia was noted. The facial sensation was intact, and the muscles of facial expression were normal and symmetric. Motor examination revealed normal bulk, tone, power, and coordination in all 4 limbs with no pathological reflexes. The sensation was grossly normal. Romberg's testing was negative. Physical examination demonstrated a prominent left frontal superficial scallop vein that became prominent when a patient was placed in a left lateral decubitus position. The left frontal superficial scallop vein did not demonstrate prominence during spine flexion, right lateral decubitus, or upright positioning.\n\n【37】Due to the ongoing headaches and the prominent left frontal superficial vein, investigation with MRI of the brain and MR angiography (MRA) was performed. Findings of the MRA demonstrated no evidence of dural arteriovenous fistula, vascular thrombosis, arteriovenous (AV) shunting, or vascular malformation.\n\n【38】Further investigation with a CTA chest (inspiratory phase) was conducted to rule out a mediastinal mass resulting in venous compression. CTA chest demonstrated no evidence of a mediastinal mass; however, incidentally, an aberrant right subclavian artery was noted (Figure 5). Furthermore, there was mild compression of the brachiocephalic vein during this initial inspiratory phase, which warranted further investigation to rule out aortosternal venous compression (Figure 5(c)). CTA in an expiratory phase was subsequently performed, demonstrating findings of severe stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein (Figure 6). Thus, a venogram was ordered as part of the workup in order to confirm the diagnosis of AVC. Findings of the venogram demonstrated a patent left subclavian and superior vena cava (SVC) with no significant stenosis with respect to the left brachiocephalic vein in the inspiratory phase (Figure 7(a)). The subsequent expiratory phase (Figure 7(b)) demonstrated severe stenosis of the left brachiocephalic vein, with cephalad reflux of contrast in the left IJV. Additionally, collateral supply arising from the left IJV and communicating with the right brachiocephalic vein was observed during the expiratory phase. The above findings were utilized to confirm the diagnosis of AVC with a component of cranial venous congestion.\n\n【39】  \n**(a)**\n\n【40】  \n**(b)**\n\n【41】  \n**(c)**\n\n【42】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【43】Figure 5 \n\n【44】(a) Axial contrast-enhanced CT images (CTA neck) demonstrate the anatomical variation of an aberrant right subclavian artery (yellow arrow) with its course posterior to the esophagus.

Collateral vasculature arising from the left IJV with communication to the right brachiocephalic is noted.\n\n【54】The neurology team opted for conservative management including arm elevation at night. Based on the last follow-up visit the patient is doing well with decreased severity of symptoms.\n\n【55】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【56】##### 3.1. Symptoms and Presentation\n\n【57】Extrinsic venous compression can be observed in the setting of mediastinal mass compression given the rather confined anatomic space within the superior and anterior mediastinum \\[5, 6\\]. AVC, characteristically regarded as brachiocephalic vein compression, is a rare form of extrinsic venous compression, first reported in 1989 \\[1\\]. Tortuous and/or ectatic great vessels can act as another factor resulting in extrinsic compression of the brachiocephalic vein, particularly in patients with a diminished anteroposterior chest diameter. An aberrant right subclavian artery has also been associated with AVC \\[2, 4\\]. The prevalence of AVC has not been well characterized due to its rarity. A study in hemodialysis patients undergoing fistulograms identified some degree of extrinsic compression of the brachiocephalic vein in 44% of patients \\[7\\].\n\n【58】AVC is often asymptomatic, due to adequate compensation by collateral vasculature; however, cases in the literature have described instances of pain and swelling in the supraclavicular region and left upper extremity, as well as morning headaches \\[2, 8\\]. One case reported symptoms of paresthesia, thus, a similar symptomatic presentation to the first case presented in this case series. Even though rare, symptoms of paresthesia combined with pulsation, can lead the referring clinician to consider AVC as part of the differential workup \\[3\\]. Furthermore, the presence of an anatomical variant such as an aberrant right subclavian artery resulting in esophageal compression due to its dorsal course can result in dysphagia lusoria, which potentially accounts for the dysphagia observed in the second case presented above \\[2\\]. Nevertheless, the atypical presentation of AVC and the variable etiology of this syndrome highlight the necessity of combining imaging modalities in confirming a diagnosis \\[6\\].\n\n【59】##### 3.2. Imaging Features\n\n【60】Few imaging modalities are employed in the diagnosis of venous compression syndromes \\[8\\]. Contrast-enhanced chest CT and diagnostic venography are imaging modalities that can be utilized to diagnose AVC. Initial imaging with ultrasound may demonstrate sluggish flow and/or intraluminal thrombus in the left subclavian, brachiocephalic, or left IJV, however, these findings are nonspecific as they primarily relate to proximal stenosis or obstruction, and thus further investigation into AVC or brachiocephalic vein compression is warranted with cross-sectional imaging \\[7\\]. Based on a retrospective review of the literature, the importance of cross-sectional imaging for the evaluation of anatomical variation and in establishing the etiology of venous compression has been established \\[2, 8, 9\\]. Therefore, in the appropriate clinical setting, chest CT (with inspiratory and expiratory phase) can be utilized as the initial imaging modality to exclude an extrinsic venous compression etiology such as a mediastinal mass, aortic aneurysmal dilation, or compression secondary to the aortic arch anomaly. Even though the rare association of AVC with the aberrant right subclavian artery is noted in the literature, such a finding can be visualized on contrast-enhanced CT \\[7\\]. Once the brachiocephalic vein compression is suspected on CT, the next step of performing a diagnostic venogram can aid in real-time fluoroscopic evaluation, again in the setting of the inspiratory and expiratory phase, with the latter demonstrating venous compression. Secondary findings on the venogram, demonstrated by underlying collateral vascularity establish the chronicity of the diagnosis. The venogram can be performed via cannulating the basilic, cephalic or brachial veins, followed by advancing an angled catheter and a 0.035 Glidewire to access the distal left subclavian or axillary vein (proximal to the region of the stenosis). Alternatively, the catheter can also be advanced into the ipsilateral jugular vein. The angled catheter can be exchanged for a multipurpose side-hole catheter, through which a contrast injection can be performed in the inspiratory and expiratory phases. The patency within the left subclavian vein, LIJ, and left brachiocephalic vein during inspiration excludes an underlying acute or chronic thrombus as an etiology, thus highlighting the importance of a biphasic exam \\[2\\]. Therefore, the ability to visualize flow dynamics in venography can aid in establishing a firm AVC diagnosis, and thus venography could potentially be established as a gold standard \\[10, 11\\].\n\n【61】Moreover, during cross-sectional imaging, the AP diameter (dorsal aspect of the manubrium to the ventral aspect of the vertebral body) can be measured, at the level of the brachiocephalic vein in both inspiratory and expiratory phases of the examination. Upon expiration, the AP diameter diminishes, with a confined mediastinal anatomic space. Even though there are no established AP diameter parameters, a significant decrease in expiratory phase diameter should prompt further investigation into AVC or brachiocephalic vein compression. Furthermore, aberrant right subclavian arteries, which are the most common embryologic abnormality of the aortic arch, result as an additive feature to the already confined anatomic space in the mediastinum which further predisposes patients to brachiocephalic vein compression \\[2, 12\\]. Therefore, upon findings of an aberrant right subclavian artery with the appropriate abovementioned clinical symptoms, the patient could be assessed for AVC as a potential etiology once other differentials have been excluded. Nevertheless, standard variations in AP diameters on inspiration versus expiration, and the incidence of aberrant right subclavian arteries as the cause of AVC have yet to be established, drawing attention to the need for future studies on this topic.\n\n【62】#### 4\\. Treatment and Discussion\n\n【63】Conservative management remains the mainstay in AVC and includes arm elevation at night as well as avoidance of the left lateral decubitus position to reduce pressure on the brachiocephalic vein \\[2\\]. In our institution, conservative management has proven to be sufficient in managing the symptoms and complaints of AVC. However, surgical management may be required for symptomatic cases of compression in the setting of conservative management failure. Yet, surgery is an invasive option that carries risks and thus is not recommended as a first-line approach. Therefore, conservative management is the advisable treatment option in symptomatic venous compression patients as a first-line approach. In patients who fail conservative management, angioplasty and self-expanding stents are treatment methods of choice in common venous compression syndromes such as Paget-Schroetter syndrome (PSS), nutcracker syndrome, and May–Thurner syndrome \\[13\\]. A literature review also demonstrated that self-expanding stents can successfully treat symptomatic stenosis of the brachiocephalic vein, particularly in hemodialysis patients where dialysis access may be threatened \\[4\\]. However, due to the extrinsic nature of compression, stents are not recommended in AVC patients due to limited patency and allowable volume changes of the vascular space during respiration \\[7, 14\\]. In the setting of the patient not being a surgical candidate and failing conservative management, the stenosis could potentially be treated with self-expandable stents. Notably, balloon expandable stents should also be avoided in AVC management as they can be crushed and can migrate secondary to external compression \\[7\\]. In severe cases of venous compression syndromes, operative decompression of the thoracic inlet including manubrioplasty has been employed as a radical approach to address the underlying anatomy \\[12\\]. Nevertheless, the long-term prognosis is unknown due to limited cases in the literature.\n\n【64】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【65】AVC is a rare extrinsic venous compression syndrome. Through the abovementioned case series, we highlight the importance of combining imaging modalities, particularly chest CT and venography, in confirming a diagnosis and determining the etiology of AVC.\n\n【66】#### Data Availability\n\n【67】Data is available within the secure institutional electronic medical record in which the senior author is faculty.\n\n【68】#### Consent\n\n【69】Informed consent was obtained from the patient for use of anonymized clinical, pathological, and radiological information.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is rarely complicated by amyloidosis. _Case_. A 66-year-old white male presented to the emergency room (ER) after an unwitnessed fall and change in mental status. Patient was awake and alert but not oriented. There was no focal deficit on neurological exam. Past medical history (PMH) included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic valve replacement (nonmetallic), incomplete heart block controlled by a pacemaker and IgG- IgA type Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance. The MGUS was diagnosed 9 months ago on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) as patient was referred to the outpatient clinic for hyperglobulinemia on routine blood work. In ER, a head-computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions suspicious for metastases. A CT chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed numerous ground-glass and solid nodules in the lungs. Lower extremity duplex and transesophageal echocardiogram were negative. Serial blood cultures and serologies for cryptococcus and histoplasmosis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), cryoglobulin, and antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies were all negative. CT guided lung biopsy was positive for Thioflavin T amyloid deposits. Brain biopsy was positive for eosinophilic material (similar to the lungs) but negative for Thioflavin T stain. The patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate with cold cyanotic fingers developing on day 12 and a health care acquired pneumonia, respiratory failure, and fungemia on day 18. On day 29, family withdrew life support and denied any autopsies. _Conclusion_. Described is an atypical course of MGUS complicated by amyloidosis of the lung and nonamyloid eosinophilic deposition in the brain. As MGUS might be complicated by diseases such as amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, a scheduled follow-up of these patients is always necessary. Further research is needed in order to better define the optimal treatment and management strategies of MGUS and its complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】B cell dyscrasias are characterized by a clonal proliferation of B cells (benign or malignant). The spectrum of B cell dyscrasia is broad and includes the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) \\[1\\]. MGUS is found in more than 1% of persons who are 50 years or older and is defined by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein concentration less than 3 g/dL, with absence of lytic bone lesions, of M proteins in urine, of hypercalcemia and of renal failure \\[1–3\\]. Amyloidosis is a rare complication of MGUS which is secondary to excessive production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) and deposition of the single Ig isotype or subunits in various tissues. Aggregomas, on the other hand, are tumoral non-amyloidotic monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain deposits \\[4\\]. In this paper, we describe an unusual presentation of MGUS combining amyloid deposition in the lung and non-amyloid eosinophilic deposition in the Brain.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】A-66-year-old male, who was exsmoker, presented to the ER for a change in mental status. As per the family, the patient who had a normal mental status in the past was noticed to be progressively worsening for the last couple of months, with disorientation mainly found over phone discussions. At the time of presentation he was awake and alert, but disoriented to time and place. He denied any pain and was unable to provide any history. Physical exam was normal except for the presence of facial ecchymosis. The neurological part showed a normal motor, sensory, and cranial nerve exam. Also, his gait was stable.\n\n【6】Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic valve replacement (nonmetallic), atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), incomplete heart block, pacemaker, and IgG- IgA, kappa type Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS). Family history was not relevant.\n\n【7】MGUS was diagnosed 9 months ago on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) as patient was referred to our institution’s center for cancer and blood related diseases for hyperglobulinemia on routine blood work. At that time the patient underwent extensive work up to rule out any plasma cell dyscrasias. The Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) was negative for M spike. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry from peripheral smear as well as from bone marrow biopsy were negative for a clonal plasma cell or malignant B-cell. Chromosomal analysis and cytogenetics were also normal.\n\n【8】In the ER, a head CT scan revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions suspicious for metastases mainly in the frontal part bilaterally and in the left parieto-temporal region, with edema and compression mainly on the left lateral ventricle. Also, an interventricular lesion at the foramen of Monro causing mild hydrocephalus was seen. CT chest, abdomen and pelvis was done to find a possible primary malignancy and revealed numerous ground-glass and solid nodules in the lungs. Warfarin was discontinued and the international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.2 was reversed with fresh frozen plasma. Patient was started on steroids and phenytoin. Lower extremity duplex was negative.\n\n【9】The clinical status continued to deteriorate with cold, cyanotic fingers developing on day twelve of hospitalization. At this point he was seen by a vascular surgeon in order to rule out arterial emboli. A transesophageal echocardiogram was done for possible vegetations causing infectious emboli. All results were negative, and no infiltrative cardiomyopathy was found. Bronchoscopy and broncho-alveolar lavage with cultures (including nocardia) was also negative. CT guided lung biopsy showed H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and PAS (periodic acid-schiff) positive amorphous eosinophilic material suspicious for amyloid (Figure 1). Initial staining with congo red was negative. However, it stained positively with Thioflavin T stain and had weak green birefringence under polarized light. Immunostains for kappa and lambda chains showed stronger staining for kappa subtype. Brain biopsy was positive for eosinophilic material (similar to the lungs) but negative for congo red and thioflavin T stain (Figure 2). Later, the patient had a respiratory failure secondary to health care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and was intubated. Serial blood cultures and serologies for Cryptococcus and histoplasmosis, serology for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), cryoglobulin, and Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies (antiGBM) were all negative. Only seen was a positive blood culture for candida on day eighteen.\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 1 \n\n【13】| CT guided lung biopsy showed H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and PAS (periodic acid-schiff) positive amorphous eosinophilic material suspicious for amyloid.

Later, he was switched to vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin for possible health care acquired pneumonia. Also, he was started on amphotericin B after blood cultures revealed candida. Whether a more diffuse disease such as systemic amyloidosis is present was not confirmed, as the family refused any further diagnostic procedures that are not relevant to the acute care of the patient in a context of a deteriorating clinical picture. Despite all antifungals and supportive measures, he failed weaning trials and remained on ventilator support. A tracheostomy was suggested. However, after extensive discussions, the family refused. On day 29, health care proxy decided to withdraw all life support measures based on the patient’s previous wishes who did not want to be kept alive on a ventilator. Finally, the patient had a terminal wean after these events, and the family refused any autopsies.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】As we discussed above, MGUS is found in around 1% of persons who are 50 years or older and is defined by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein concentration less than 3 g/dL. MGUS of IgM class can progress to lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia; whereas IgA and IgG can progress to primary amyloidosis or multiple myeloma. B cell lymphoproliferative disorders can cause AL (light chain) amyloidosis, which is very rarely reported in MGUS \\[1, 4\\]. Depending on the type of antibodies secreted, immunoglobulin deposition diseases can be divided into light chain amyloidosis (AL), heavy chain amyloidosis (AH), non-amyloid forms of light chain deposition diseases (LCDD), and heavy chain deposition diseases (HCDD). Coexistence of the amyloid and non-amyloid deposits is very rare, and was first described by Gallo et al. as “monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases” \\[5\\].\n\n【21】Biclonal gammopathy was described in less than 3 percent of the Mayo clinic MGUS series \\[3\\]. The clinical course and behavior were not significantly different. Our patient had high levels of IgG 3730 mg/dL (range: 751–1560 mg/dL) and IgA 619 (range: 82–453 mg/dL). Immunofixation was positive for kappa chains which was consistent with the amyloid deposits in the lungs. These were highly positive for the kappa immunostaining. Therefore, we can suggest that one of the contributing causes for the respiratory failure in our case might have been the amyloidosis itself.\n\n【22】Also, found in our patient was multiple organizing hemorrhagic brain lesions suspicious for metastasis. However, no primary tumor was found and there was no evidence of lymphoproliferative diseases in the brain or lung biopsies. Hemorrhage in patients with MGUS can be secondary to amyloidosis or cryoglobulinemia. However, finding of eosinophilic non-amyloid material possibly suggests “Aggregoma” which is a very rare entity, only described once previously in the literature, as per our knowledge \\[4\\]. Amyloid depositions seen in plasma cell dyscrasias can lead to amyloid angiopathy and secondary hemorrhagic lesions \\[6, 7\\]. Light chain deposition diseases might mimic amyloidosis, leading also to bleeding susceptibilities \\[6, 7\\]. Our patient might have light chain deposition disease in the brain that did not lead to amyloidosis itself. However, this disease might have been the cause of significant parenchymal hemorrhages.\n\n【23】Further workup in order to define the exact nature of these depositions, like immunohistochemistries, ultra-structural analysis, and mass spectrometry, was not done, mainly due to technical and technological limitations in our institution. Also, we cannot rule out a possible systemic amyloidosis as no further diagnostic testing such as a fat pad biopsy was done. The family refused any workup that is not relevant to the acute care of the patient who was in a critical condition. Also, the final diagnosis was not ascertained as the autopsy was refused.\n\n【24】Although there were some indicators predicting the risk of progression to Multiple Myeloma (serum protein M ≥ 1.5, non-IgG MGUS), till now, there is no known indicators predicting the odds of amyloidosis formation. Periodic monitoring of MGUS is advised, but there is currently no recommended optimal intervals. Many experts recommend routine follow-up between 6 and 12 months. This is based mainly on the potential risk for multiple myeloma progression.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】This case describes two organ specific presentations related to the MGUS disease: amyloid deposition in the lung and non-amyloid eosinophilic deposition in the brain. The possibility of a presence of systemic amyloidosis and the final confirmation of the nature of the non-amyloid depositions in our case were not ascertained, mainly due to the refusal by the family for any autopsies or any further diagnostic procedures, but also view the lack of technological availabilities, mainly staining subtypes in our institution.\n\n【27】Knowing that the course of MGUS can be potentially complicated by amyloidosis, peripheral neuropathies, and multiple myeloma transformations, a scheduled follow-up of these patients is always necessary. Further research is needed in order to establish the optimal treatment guidelines for the complications and diseases related to MGUS.\n\n【28】#### Consent\n\n【29】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s next of kin for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

During the progress of the disease bone loss takes place due to resorption on the subperiosteal and endosteal surfaces. Brown tumor is a localized form of osteitis fibrosa cystica, being part of the hyperparathyroid bone disease. It is rarely the first symptom of hyperparathyroidism. Nowadays, the diagnosis is made at an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic stage. We present a male patient presented with a massive painless swelling in the left maxilla as the first manifestation of primary hyperparathyroidism due to a parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroidectomy was performed, and there was a regression of the bone lesion, without the need of performing other local surgical procedures.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The most common cause of hypercalcemia is hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in outpatients. Incidence of PHPT is 2-3/1000 in women and 1/1000 in men. The disease is most frequent in postmenopausal women during the sixth decade of life, although it is seen in all age groups. Of patients with PHPT, 80–85% develop the disease due to parathyroid adenoma, 15–20% due to hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland, while in less than 0.5%, the cause is parathyroid carcinoma. Brown tumor is a reactive lesion in the bone tissue, very rarely seen during the course of PHPT and is secondary to localized rapid osteoclastic bone turnover resulting from the direct effect of parathormone. Hemorrhage, vascular fibrous tissue, and resultant granulation tissue replace normal bone marrow elements. Localized accumulation of fibrous tissues and giant cells results in bone expansion. These are reversible tissues with excision of the parathyroid adenoma or removal of the four glands \\[1–4\\].\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 23-year-old male patient with no known additional disease history has noticed about 10 months ago a painless swelling first on the left side of his face which gradually generalized and presented to the dental clinic. The patient was treated with antibiotics for a while. When the swelling in the patient’s face persisted despite the treatment, biopsy was performed to the affected part of the face. The patient was referred to our hospital for advanced examinations after the pathologic analyses demonstrated giant-cell reparative granuloma.\n\n【6】Physical examination of the patient revealed no additional pathologies other than the swelling in the left maxillary region. Upon noticing considerably increased levels of alkaline phosphatase and blood calcium and considerably decreased levels of blood phosphor (calcium: 14.6 mg/dL, phosphor: 2 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase: 702 U/L (70–290)) in the results of the requested analyses, the patient was hospitalized at our clinic for emergency hypercalcemia treatment and advanced analyses. The patient was initiated on isotonic 5 L/day and furosemide infusion for emergency treatment. Zoledronic acid 4 mg vial infusion was started as the calcium values did not decrease despite the treatment. With this treatment, patient’s blood calcium levels returned to normal levels (Ca: 9.5 mg/dL) on the second day of the treatment. Because primary hyperparathyroidism was considered as the diagnosis of the patient when initiating the emergency treatment, intact parathormone (IPTH) and 24-hour urine calcium levels were requested from the laboratory. The results were indeed significantly high, supportive of our prediagnosis; IPTH: 1302 pg/mL (15–65) and 24-hour urine calcium: 617.5 mg/24 h. Although our diagnosis was confirmed biochemically, neck ultrasound and parathyroid scintigraphy (sestamibi scintigraphy) were requested to localize the adenoma in the patient. In addition, cranial MRI including the face was scheduled to fully understand the facial lesion radiologically and to be able to follow up after the planned surgery. The neck ultrasound revealed a  mm lesion containing a  mm hypoechoic space in the thyroid left lobe inferior. Expansile, remodeling, and multicentric osseous lesions of multilocular septate appearance localized at bilateral maxillary and left ramus-corpus mandibula, the largest of which was localized in left maxillofacial bones, were detected on cranial MRI analysis (Figure 1). Parathyroid sestamibi scintigraphy results were consistent with parathyroid adenoma (Figure 2). These findings confirmed the primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosis of the patient. The patient, after achieving reductions in blood calcium with emergency treatment, was referred to surgery. Total excision of the parathyroid adenoma guided by gamma probe was performed in the patient. The lesion in the maxillofacial region was judged to be Brown tumor secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism, based on both biopsy and radiographic findings. This lesion was monitored without any intervention. Presence of Brown tumor in other bones was investigated through long bone graphy and extremities and cranial direct graphies. No foci suggestive of another Brown tumor were identified. The pathology report was also consistent with parathyroid adenoma. Hungry bone syndrome developed following the surgery: PTH < 3 pg/mL and Ca: 8.2 mg/dL. The patient was administrated i.v. calcium treatment for two days and was initiated on calcitriol 0.5 tbl. calcium tbl. .\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| Cranial MR: multicentric osseous lesions in left maxillofacial bones. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】  \n**(a)**\n\n【13】  \n**(b)**\n\n【14】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】| Sestamibi scintigraphy: parathyroid adenoma. |\n| --- |\n\n【17】Regression in the Brown tumor localized in the left maxillary region was observed during followup (Figure 3).

Discussion\n\n【23】Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrinologic condition following diabetes mellitus and thyroid diseases. Its annual incidence has been reported as 28/100.000 in the USA \\[5\\]. Improper or excessive secretion of PTH results in PHPT. Of patients with PHPT, 80–85% develop the disease due to parathyroid adenoma, 15–20% due to hyperplasia of the parathyroid gland, while in less than 0.5% the cause is parathyroid carcinoma \\[6\\]. A single adenoma indicates sporadic disease, while hyperplasia of four glands suggests familial diseases (MEN type 1 or 2A). Its diagnosis is usually based on serum calcium and PTH levels higher than normal limits. In some cases, blood calcium levels within normal limits may also be observed. Today, patients with PHPT can be diagnosed in the early and asymptomatic period owing to the advances in the blood analysis methods \\[7\\].\n\n【24】Although many systems are affected in PHPT, the most pronounced alternations are observed in the bone. Approximately 2% of the patients are reported to develop osteitis fibrosa cystica, and 0.8% develop Brown tumor. These figures suggest a very low frequency of Brown tumors in these patients \\[8, 9\\]. Brown tumor is the localized form of osteitis fibrosa cystica \\[10\\] and is a reactive lesion in the bone tissue, very rarely seen during the course of PHPT. The tumor is secondary to localized rapid osteoclastic bone turnover resulting from the direct effect of PTH. Hemorrhage, vascular fibrous tissue, and resultant granulation tissue replace normal bone marrow elements. Localized accumulation of fibrous tissues and giant cells results in bone expansion \\[3\\]. Brown tumors are primarily observed in face, mandible and neck region, followed by the pelvis, ribs, and femur. Axial skeleton is rarely involved. They may occasionally cause pathologic fractures \\[9, 11\\].\n\n【25】Primary treatment of Brown tumors is surgical removal of associated parathyroid pathology. Brown tumors generally regress spontaneously over time \\[10\\]. Return of serum PTH, calcium, and phosphor levels to normal limits is an indicator of the success of treatment. Increases in bone mineral mass during the consequent period may also represent a significant indicator \\[12\\].\n\n【26】The patient may first present with the complaint of painless mass in the maxillary region, as was the case in our patient. There are very few cases in the literature describing Brown tumor localized in the maxillary and facial regions in primary hyperparathyroidism. Diagnosis may be easily overlooked in such cases. Therefore, we must consider primary hyperparathyroidism in differential diagnosis by analyzing blood calcium and PTH levels of patients presenting with mass in bones, particularly in the face. Establishing an accurate diagnosis will eliminate patient’s problem through the surgery of the parathyroid gland and will avoid more advanced surgical interventions. It should be kept in mind that there may be a regression in the Brown tumor over years, as is the case in our patient.\n\n【27】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【28】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Adrenal cavernous hemangiomas (AH) are benign nonfunctional vascular tumors rarely discovered as incidental findings on imaging studies or autopsies. This study presents a single case report of AH with another rare finding of the Liesegang ring. Also, we reviewed 73 case reports of cavernous adrenal hemangioma to provide an overview of AH’s clinical characteristics. _Case Report_. A nonfunctional AH was incidentally discovered in a 59-year-old morbidly obese female patient with a 10-year history of hypertension and thyroidectomy. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a left suprarenal mass of ∼16 cm in diameter. While the patient had no clinical manifestations from the hemangioma, all laboratory tests were within the normal values with no indication of a functional adrenal tumor. The mass was removed by open left adrenalectomy. The microscopic histological examination revealed a laminated structure with wide blood-filled spaces with a central core of necrotic and hemorrhagic changes, characteristic of a cavernous AH with the presence of a rare Liesegang ring. _Conclusion_. Although rare, AH should be considered as a differential diagnosis for adrenal masses. This is the first reported case of a cavernous AH with rare microscopic findings of the Liesegang ring.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Benign vascular tumor-like growths are commonly seen in the liver and skin tissues. However, the presence of a vascular tumor, cavernous hemangioma, in the adrenal glands is a rare incidental finding often discovered on radiologic imaging (abdominal CT, MRI, or ultrasonography) or autopsy \\[1\\]. Adrenal hemangioma (AH) is a rare benign nonfunctioning tumor developing from the vascular endothelium of the adrenal gland. The first clinical case of the adrenal cavernous hemangioma was published by Johnson and Jeppesen in 1955 \\[2\\]. This was a patient presenting with a complaint of sudden-onset hypertension and no symptoms of endocrinal origin. Despite being a rare occurrence, the potential accompanying endocrinal manifestations make it imperative to study the tumor and identify its characteristic features that may help in making a diagnosis.\n\n【4】Usually unilateral, AH is observed later in life (after the fifth decade) with female preponderance \\[3, 4\\]. We report a case of an incidental adrenal hemangioma with a rare microscopic finding of the Liesegang ring found on the abdominal computed tomography (CT) of a 59-year-old female patient.\n\n【5】There are about 73 case reports of AH available from the year 1955 to date. Evidence of Liesegang ring has been reported with fibrotic, cystic, necrosed, or inflamed tissue of the skin, conjunctiva, female genital tract, or kidney \\[5\\]. Liesegang rings are formed as a result of precipitation occurring over time in highly saturated solutions. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of AH with histological evidence of a Liesegang ring. Following the case report, the authors also present a brief and comprehensive review of the reported cases of AH so far.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 59-year-old morbidly obese lady with a history of essential hypertension for ten years and hypothyroidism was referred to the urology department because of an incidental finding of a huge left suprarenal mass on the abdominal CT scan. The patient had no other complaints or clinical signs that may be attributed to adrenal (medullary or cortical) overactivity, and the physical examination had no abnormality. Laboratory tests, including urine tests for 24-hour fractionated metanephrine, were within normal limits.\n\n【8】Pre- and postcontrast abdominal CT scans (Figure 1) revealed a large heterogeneous solid left adrenal gland mass with internal calcifications and central necrosis. Postcontrast showed peripheral nodular discontinuous enhancement (Figure 1; B + D). The mass caused a significant mass effect on the left kidney, which is pushed inferiorly.\n\n【9】  \n**(a)**\n\n【10】  \n**(b)**\n\n【11】  \n**(c)**\n\n【12】  \n**(d)**\n\n【13】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【14】Figure 1 \n\n【15】Pre- and postcontrast CT scan of the abdomen: large heterogeneous solid left adrenal mass (M) with internal calcifications and peripheral discontinuous enhancement after contrast (arrows in B and D). _Note_. Significant mass effect of the left kidney which is pushed inferiorly.\n\n【16】The mass was removed through an open approach via a supraumbilical midline incision. It was well-circumscribed and has no signs of local invasion to the adjacent structures. The gross pathological examination showed an intact mass covered by a smooth and glistening capsule, measuring 16 × 15 × 10 cm and weighing 1.73 kg. On cut-section, the mass showed cystic areas with extensive hemorrhage and yellow areas, suggestive of necrosis. The residual adrenal gland could be identified (Figure 2).\n\n【17】  \n**(a)**\n\n【18】  \n**(b)**\n\n【19】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【20】Figure 2 \n\n【21】The gross examination of adrenal hemangioma (a) before and (b) after slicing, on the cut section, shows a cystic area with extensive hemorrhage.\n\n【22】On histological examination, the specimen consisted mainly of infarcted, necrotic tissue with cyst-like vascular spaces that were expanded due to collection of blood and were lined by a single layer of mature endothelial cells, without atypia or mitosis. The stroma showed extensive fibrinous material in which many Liesegangs rings were observed. The rings were assembled in a lamellar fashion similar to psammoma bodies or a parasite egg (commonly, kidney worm). With an amorphous material in the middle, the central core was surrounded by a two-layered wall that stained negative with PAS and von Kossa (for calcium). The annular structure was nonbirefringent when viewed under polarized-light microscopy, and on immunohistochemistry, the cystic lining tested positive for CD34 and CD31 (Figures 3 and 4).\n\n【23】  \n\n【24】  \n\n【25】Figure 3 \n\n【26】Microscopic examination of the adrenal cavernous hemangioma showing cystic dilated vascular spaces filled with blood and lined with a single layer of mature endothelium, with adjacent compressed adrenal gland (hematoxylin-eosin staining ×40).\n\n【27】  \n\n【28】  \n\n【29】Figure 4 \n\n【30】Microscopic examination showing fibrinous matrix with many basophilic, lamellar structures (the rare: Liesegang ring) (hematoxylin-eosin staining ×100).\n\n【31】The excision surgery was uneventful with no postoperative complications. The patient stayed in the hospital for three days postoperatively without any untoward incident. The six-month follow-up CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed no signs of any distant metastasis or recurrence.\n\n【32】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【33】Due to the rarity of adrenal hemangioma, this benign form of a vascular tumor requires a definitive preoperative protocol for diagnosis since the tumor is nonfunctional and has no clinical manifestations of its own. The differential diagnoses for AH include benign adrenal, adenomas, myelolipomas, angiomyolipomas, or rare teratomas. Also, malignant adrenal neoplasms such as pheochromocytoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma may be considered while diagnosing \\[6\\]. AHs are mainly unilateral and more than 10 cm in diameter, predominantly affecting females in their fifth to a seventh decade \\[3\\]. Biochemical tests, like the 24-hour catecholamine secretion in urine, are essential to rule out any endocrine neoplasms, especially pheochromocytoma. All laboratory test results of the patient reported in this study were unremarkable.\n\n【34】Based on the provisional diagnosis of a malignant adrenal cortical carcinoma, surgical resection of the tumor was done as per the mandatory protocol \\[3, 4\\]. As reported above, the microscopic examination of the specimen revealed typical blood-filled dilated spaces of vascular origin with a monolayer endothelium. AH is usually a cavernous type (big vessels with wide blood-filled spaces within) \\[3\\] and rarely capillary in type (small well-defined tightly packed capillaries). Also, the presence of the endothelial markers CD34 (a marker of hematopoietic progenitor cells) and CD31 (a marker that stains small and large vessels in the cystic lining) confirms the vascular origin of tumors. These findings also corroborate the proposed congenital nature of AH, i.e., the influence of hereditary factors leading to vascular ectasia \\[3\\].\n\n【35】Another interesting finding in our study was the evidence of rare microscopic Liesegang rings seen in the AH specimen. Liesegang rings are concentric acellular structures common in chemical reactions where precipitation occurs as a consequence of the accumulation of sub- and supersaturation of insoluble components of a colloidal matrix. Not commonly seen in vivo, these rings are indicative of continuous deposition of organic components in tissues that have undergone degeneration either due to inflammation, fibrosis, necrosis, or cystic degeneration, i.e., the pathogenesis of the Liesegang ring remains unclear. Hitherto, the reported cases of Liesegang rings reveal the commonest site to be in the renal tissue, while other clinical accounts have documented these rings in the paranasal sinuses, eyelid, conjunctivae, and intraperitoneum endometriosis \\[5, 7, 8\\]. Also, isolated cases of Liesegang rings have been published in association with mammary duct ectasia and breast cyst \\[9, 10\\].\n\n【36】Often varying in shape, the diameter of these rings ranges from 5 to 820 nm depending on the size and location \\[11\\]. Morphologically, these structures bear a resemblance to psammoma bodies. Also, they typically test positive for PAS, highlighting the double-layered wall. However, the case presented in the current study tested negative for PAS, similar to another previously published case report \\[11\\]. The nonbirefringent nature of these rings under polarized-light microscopy was also seen in our patient’s specimen.\n\n【37】Furthermore, the Liesegang rings seen in our study were accompanied by both necrotic and hemorrhagic changes \\[9, 12–16\\]. The reason for these changes within the hemangioma and the specific components of the Liesegang ring is yet to be determined. However, the immunohistochemical and histochemical staining for iron (Prussian blue), calcium (von Kossa), amyloid, mucopolysaccharide, keratin, glycogen, and hemangioma’s epithelial antigen is negative. Additionally, using special stains, radiographic imaging, and scanning-electron microscopy, it has been demonstrated that, at times, these rings contain iron, silicon, and sulfur. Also, Tuur et al. have reported the presence of Ca++ ions, organic polycations and polyanions, and other inorganic anions in these rings \\[5\\]. Because of this chemical composition, these rings have often been misidentified for parasites’ ova, green growth, calcific deposits, corpora amylacea, psammoma bodies, and the spheroid kind of amyloid. Therefore, even though these rings are a rare finding, it is imperative to characteristically study them to avoid misidentification with parasital ova. The typical presentation of a lamellar structure with a double-layered wall, cross-striations flowing radially, may be used for precise diagnosis \\[12, 13, 15, 17–19\\].\n\n【38】Besides, the characteristic presence of peripheral discontinuous nodular enhancement with a centripetal pattern on the contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is highly suggestive of AH \\[20, 21\\]. Following diagnosis, the standardized treatment for an enlarging symptomatic adrenal tumor or suspected carcinoma is surgical resection, irrespective of its endocrine activity \\[4\\].\n\n【39】This review aimed to identify and systematically present the typical clinical features of the cavernous adrenal hemangioma to aid in diagnosis and treatment planning. Approximately 73 cases of cavernous AH have been published from 1955 through 2020 which were reviewed in the present study (Table 1). The average age at which the patients were diagnosed was 55 years (range: 19–84 years old), and the prevalence of female gender in these patients was approximately 1.7 times more than the male gender \\[22\\]. Generally unilateral with no side preference in most cases, only one case of bilateral involvement has been reported so far \\[21\\]. The usual size has been reported to be above 10 cm in diameter \\[1\\] ranging up to 35 cm \\[23\\]. Endocrinology examinations of the adrenal tumor were normal for 67 out of 73 cases. Of the six clinically functional adrenal hemangiomas identified, three cases were of hyperaldosteronism, while the other three had subclinical Cushing’s syndrome \\[24\\]. The mean diameter of all these reported cases of adrenal hemangiomas with documented specific tumor characteristics was 11 cm and weighed an average of 752 gm \\[24\\].\n\n【40】Table 1 \n\n【41】Summary of the adrenal cavernous hemangiomas reported between 1955 and 2020.\n\n【42】Of the 73 cases reviewed, 42 (57.5%) were discovered incidentally with no clinical symptoms, while the other 31 (42.5%) had clinical manifestations, including abdominal symptoms of epigastric pain and heaviness (_n_ = 10) and pain or discomfort in the flank (_n_ = 8), and 3 patients presented with rupture of the adrenal mass leading to retroperitoneal hemorrhage and hematoma \\[25–27\\].\n\n【43】Surgical mass excision was done in 69 cases, of which 16 patients (22.5%) had laparoscopic surgery. Of the two nonoperated patients, one patient died from an unrelated cause, while the other opted for monitoring and observation since the tumor size was small and no clinical manifestations were seen \\[22, 24\\].\n\n【44】Lastly, mitotane, an established adrenolytic drug, was used in these patients that did not affect the viability of primary culture cells. However, cytotoxic drugs like doxorubicin decreased the viability of these cells. Furthermore, there is evidence that sunitinib, a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor, drastically reduced the viability of the primary culture cells, indicating that the drug and its analogs may be useful in medically treating adrenal hemangiomas \\[4\\].\n\n【45】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【46】Adrenal hemangioma should be considered as an important differential diagnosis of adrenal neoplasms despite being a rare finding. The treatment of choice remains surgical excision owing to the possibility of malignancy.\n\n【47】#### Data Availability\n\n【48】All data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【49】#### Consent\n\n【50】The patient provided consent and approved for publishing.\n\n【51】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【52】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【53】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【54】Wejdan N Almotairi wrote, edited, and reviewed the manuscript and contributed to literature review.

Maluf and Koerner first reported this disease entity as a special type of ductal carcinoma in situ with several characteristic histopathological features, including low-grade cellular atypia, intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, and solid papillary growth pattern, as well as neuroendocrine differentiation. The present paper describes a case of SPC with bcl-2 expression, which is known as a marker for malignancy of neuroendocrine tumors. Interestingly, despite bcl-2 expression being a poor prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors, the patient with this tumor has achieved long-term survival (approximately 6 years) at the time of writing this report. Because previous investigators reported that bcl-2 expression might play a role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer, we suggest that bcl-2 expression might reflect a good prognosis in patients with SPC, rather than being a poor prognostic indicator, as it is in several types of neuroendocrine tumor. However, to confirm this hypothesis, further investigation is required.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Solid papillary carcinoma (SPC) is considered a rare malignant breast tumor, with an incidence ranging from 1.1% to 1.7% of all malignant breast tumors \\[1–10\\]. Maluf and Koerner first reported this disease entity as a special type of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with several characteristic histopathological features, including low-grade cellular atypia, intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, and solid papillary growth pattern, as well as neuroendocrine differentiation \\[2\\]. Furthermore, the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) classification categorized this tumor as a solid papillary carcinoma (ICD-O codes: 8509/2 or 8509/3, with and without invasion) and indicated that solid neuroendocrine carcinoma originated from SPC \\[11\\]. The present paper describes a case of SPC with low Ki-67 labeling index, absence of p53 expression, and bcl-2 expression, which is known as a marker for malignancy of neuroendocrine tumors \\[12–20\\].\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 62-year-old Japanese woman presenting with a mass in the left breast was admitted to Japanese hospital for evaluation of this lesion. Mammography showed a high-density mass, and breast ultrasonography showed well-demarcated, highly abundant blood flow and a cystic lesion (Figure 1). Because these results indicated the presence of a malignant tumor, fine-needle aspiration cytology and needle biopsy were performed. Aspiration cytology indicated a lesion suspicious for carcinoma (Figure 2). If tumor cells show ill-defined rosette formation, these findings indicate solid papillary carcinoma. But actually this is not 100% proven. We therefore conducted needle biopsy that suggested ductal carcinoma. Consequently, the patient underwent partial mastectomy of the left breast with lymph node dissection. Our patient’s surgical intervention had a successful outcome—neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis occurred, and she maintains a high quality of life 70 months after the operation.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】A breast ultrasonography image shows well-demarcated, highly abundant blood flow and a cystic lesion.

A solid tumor 25 × 30 × 25 mm in size and sharply demarcated from the surrounding tissue was visible at the cut surface of the breast tissue (Figure 3). Both necrosis and hemorrhage were present. Sections of paraffin-embedded tissue were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain for light microscopic observation. Histological examination revealed intraductal carcinoma showing a solid papillary growth pattern and nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores (Figure 3). The neoplastic lesion was encapsulated by bands of dense fibrosis. The tumor cells had a round to elongated and hyperchromatic nucleus plus finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. Intracellular and extracellular mucin deposition was present (Figure 4).

The tumor cells showed positive immunoreactivity for synaptophysin, chromogranin A, ER, PgR, and bcl-2 (Figures 5 and 6) and negative (or almost negative) immunoreactivity for HER-2. The Ki-67 labeling index was 3.7% and almost negative or weak immunoreactivity for p53 was found (Figures 5 and 6). In the present study, representative antibodies against the following were then used via immunohistochemically evaluating the tumor cells: bcl-2 (1 : 50 dilution; Dako Japan, Tokyo, Japan, Clone name: 124), chromogranin A (1 : 800 dilution; Dako Japan, Clone name: DAK-A3), Ki-67 (1 : 200 dilution; Dako Japan, Clone name: MIB-1), and synaptophysin (1 : 40 dilution; Dako Japan, Clone name: M0776).\n\n【25】  \n**(a)**\n\n【26】  \n**(b)**\n\n【27】  \n**(c)**\n\n【28】  \n**(d)**\n\n【29】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【30】Figure 5 \n\n【31】(a) The tumor cells show a solid papillary growth pattern (HE stain, original magnification ×400).

Discussion\n\n【37】Although SPC was first reported by Maluf and Koerner in 1995 \\[2\\], this disease entity remains underrecognized by clinicians, cytotechnologists, and pathologists \\[1\\]. As previously mentioned, the 2010 WHO classification categorized this tumor as a solid papillary carcinoma. It is well known that SPC usually arises in the seventh or eighth decade and has a better prognosis than other breast cancers \\[11\\]. Histopathologically, the tumor cells show a solid papillary growth pattern, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, and a round to elongated nucleus plus finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm \\[1\\]. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells usually show positive reactivity for neuroendocrine markers, including synaptophysin and chromogranin A. In addition, these tumors generally show positive reactivity for ER and PgR \\[1\\]. Several types of low-grade ductal carcinomas should be considered as differential diagnoses for SPC. In particular, papillary carcinoma is similar to SPC in many respects. Namely, it arises in elderly patients, grows in large well-circumscribed ducts, and is characterized by a good prognosis \\[5\\]. However, this tumor differs from SPC by the presence of delicate papillae, a branching pattern, a cuboidal to columnar appearance of the tumor cells, and the lack of a solid growth pattern \\[5, 11\\]. Certain benign intraductal tumors should be considered because of their solid or papillary intraductal epithelial growth pattern \\[5, 11\\]. However, a uniform cell population, increased mitotic activity, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, and intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition are not usually seen in benign intraductal tumors \\[5, 7, 11\\]. Furthermore, the importance of the confirmation of neuroendocrine differentiation has often been described \\[5\\]. In the present paper, the tumor cells followed the characteristic features of SPC, including a solid papillary growth pattern, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, a round to elongated and hyperchromatic nucleus, finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, and intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, as well as positive reactivity for synaptophysin, but without positive reactivity for chromogranin A.\n\n【38】The immunohistochemical examination findings of this tumor are worthy further discussion. Ki-67 is known as a prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors \\[12, 17, 21, 22\\]. Kawasaki et al. reported that the Ki-67 labeling index of nonneuroendocrine DCIS (8.1%) was significantly higher than that of neuroendocrine DCIS (4.3%), and they concluded that a low Ki-67 labeling index is correlated with a good prognosis in patients with neuroendocrine DCIS \\[20\\]. In fact, our patient showed an exceptionally low Ki-67 labeling index (3.7%). In addition, several studies on neuroendocrine tumors have reported that bcl-2 or p53 expression might be correlated with malignant behavior \\[13–17, 19, 23–27\\]. However, no studies were found in which investigation was limited to SPC. Therefore, we tried to establish the immunohistochemical prognostic indicators of SPC by using bcl-2 and p53, which are acceptable prognostic indicators in several types of neuroendocrine tumor. As a result, the tumor cells showed negative reactivity for p53, which may reflect a good prognosis in patients with SPC. However, the tumor cells showed positive reactivity for bcl-2, which is a poor prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors \\[17\\].\n\n【39】To explain this paradoxical result, we considered the meaning of bcl-2 expression in breast cancer. Won et al. reported that beclin-1 and bcl-2 expression might play a role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer \\[28\\]. Therefore, we suggested that bcl-2 expression also reflexes the good prognosis of the patients with SPC rather than prognostic indicators in several kinds of neuroendocrine tumor. Unfortunately, our immunohistochemical examinations are based on only one patient with SPC. To confirm this hypothesis, further investigation is required.\n\n【40】#### Competing Interests\n\n【41】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.\n\n【42】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【43】This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research to Yoichiro Okubo (no. 26860774) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan and a research grant to Yoichiro Okubo from the Kanagawa Cancer Center (no. 28-27).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

A 51-year-old female was referred to us because of macroscopic hematuria. Computed tomography revealed a renal tumor filling renal pelvis and ureter, which turned to be a clear cell RCC after nephroureterectomy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Although RCC occasionally invades the renal pelvis and ureter microscopically, massive extension into the renal pelvis and ureter is a rare event. Herein, we describe a case with an RCC growing in the renal pelvis and ureter and reaching the bladder.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 51-year-old female visited us due to asymptomatic macroscopic hematuria persisting for two weeks. She had experienced discomfort, not pain, in the stomach. She had been followed up at another clinic for polycythemia for several years. Cystoscopy revealed a nonpapillary tumor about 2 cm in diameter, emanating from the left ureteral orifice (Figure 1). Blood results at presentation showed Hb 14.8 g/dL, Cr 0.7 mg/dL, estimated GFR 68.1 mL/min, WBC /_μ_L, CRP 5.35 mg/dL, LDH 184 IU/L, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> 9.9 mg/dL. Urine cytology was negative for malignant cells.Contrast enhanced CT showed an unevenly contrasted tumor, infiltrating almost all renal parenchyma, filling the renal pelvis and ureter, and extending into the urinary bladder (Figure 2). There were no apparent metastases to lung, liver, adrenal glands, or lymph nodes. With a tentative diagnosis of renal pelvic tumor, we didnot perform perioperative biopsy, and she underwent nephroureterectomy with hilar lymph node dissection. Macroscopically the tumor almost replaced the whole kidney. The renal pelvis and ureter were extensively packed with the tumor. Histological examination (Figure 3) revealed a clear cell RCC, grade 2 > 1, with microvascular invasion, Fuhrman grade 2, without any sarcomatoid elements. There was no evidence of a venous thrombus or metastasis to lymph nodes. Leibovich score was 6. Postoperative course was uneventful, but 6 months later multiple pulmonary metastases were detected.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】| Cystoscopy showed the tumor emanating from the left ureteral orifice. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】  \n**(a) Horizontal view**\n\n【11】  \n**(b) Sagittal view**\n\n【12】  \n**(a) Horizontal view**  \n**(b) Sagittal view**\n\n【13】Figure 2 \n\n【14】| Contrast enhanced CT showed a left renal tumor with heterogenous enhancement (white arrows).

Discussion\n\n【20】Although RCC may penetrate the renal pelvis, intraluminal spread into the renal pelvis and ureter is extremely rare with only a few cases reported in the English literature \\[1–6\\]. Munechika et al. \\[3\\], Chen et al. \\[4\\], and Fujita et al. \\[5\\] reported similar cases, although the tumor extension was limited in the renal pelvis and ureter. Gulati et al. \\[6\\] reported a case in which the tumor protruding from the ureteral orifice was resected transurethrally and confirmed as a clear cell RCC. Interestingly, in these cases, as well as ours, no visible venous thrombus was reported. We did not resect the tumor in the bladder transurethrally because we considered it was less likely lymphoma, whose tumor marker, soluble IL-2R, was 643 U/mL a little over normal range.\n\n【21】Also, enhanced CT findings did not show hypovascular pattern, suggesting that it would not be sarcoma.\n\n【22】Intraluminal spread of the upper urinary tract by other types of cancer has also been documented (Table 1). Thorup reported a case of implantation of colonic adenocarcinoma which occluded the ureter a year after the surgery with ureteral injury. Tsurumaki et al. described a case of uterine endometrioid carcinoma filling the upper urinary tract 11 years after hysterectomy with partial ureterectomy for invasion.\n\n【23】Table 1 \n\n【24】The implantation and/or invasion to urothelial mucosa followed by intraluminal expansive growth would be the pathogenesis of this rare manifestation.

However, there have been few reports on cases at high risk of postoperative complications. Cancer patients often have negative automatic thoughts about illness, and these negative automatic thoughts are associated with reduced health behavior and physical activity. This case series demonstrates the successful combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation for negative automatic thoughts in two cancer patients who underwent thoracic surgery. One patient underwent pneumonectomy with laryngeal recurrent nerve paralysis; the other patient, who had a history of recurrent hepatic encephalopathy and dialysis, underwent S6 segmentectomy. Both patients had negative automatic thoughts about cancer-related stress and postoperative pain. The physical therapists conducted a perioperative rehabilitation program in which the patients were educated to replace their maladaptive thoughts with more adaptive thoughts. After rehabilitation, the patients had improved adaptive thoughts, increased physical activity, and favorable recovery without pulmonary complications. This indicates that the combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation was useful in two thoracic cancer surgery patients. The psychoeducational approach should be expanded to perioperative rehabilitation of patients with cancer.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Although thoracic surgery is necessary for the treatment of cancer, it carries the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications \\[1–3\\]. Perioperative rehabilitation strategies recommended to prevent postoperative complications include lung expansion interventions, deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry, and ambulation \\[1, 2\\].\n\n【4】Negative automatic thoughts are associated with reduced health behavior and physical activity \\[4, 5\\]. The psychoeducation for negative automatic thoughts reportedly enhances the adaptive coping and psychological wellbeing of cancer patients through the provision of medical and psychological information and the development of patient problem solving skills \\[6, 7\\]; this approach has been investigated starting several days after surgery \\[6, 7\\] and after the initiation of immunotherapy \\[6\\]. Negative automatic thoughts in cancer-related stress are expressed as helplessness, anxious preoccupation, fatalism, and avoidance \\[8, 9\\]. Negative automatic thoughts related to pain have also been successfully treated using the psychoeducation in the perioperative period in orthopedic surgery \\[10, 11\\]. Pain-related negative automatic thoughts are expressed as helplessness, rumination, and magnification \\[12–14\\]. Although the psychoeducational approach has been proven effective for negative automatic thoughts \\[6, 7, 10, 11, 15\\], further investigation is needed into the benefit of psychoeducational approaches in cancer rehabilitation.\n\n【5】Herein, we report two cases in which patients with negative automatic thoughts underwent thoracic cancer surgery. These patients received the combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation for negative automatic thoughts.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Treatment\n\n【8】Treatment was provided by attending thoracic surgeons, anesthesiologists, nurses, and physical therapists. During the preoperative period, the patients received information about the operation and rehabilitation. After the operation, the patients were immediately extubated and transferred to intensive care unit. The patients started deep breathing, sitting, and standing by postoperative day 1 (POD1). Gait training was initiated after the patients returned to the general ward.\n\n【9】##### 2.2. Rehabilitation Program\n\n【10】The rehabilitation program, which included psychoeducation, was conducted from the time of admission (a few days before surgery) until discharge. The most important treatment goal was the prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications. Perioperative rehabilitation, including orientation and measurements, was performed by a specialized physical therapist (K.H.) with 5-year experience who was trained in psychoeducation and cognitive behavior therapy. Training consisted of guided discovery, identifying and countering negative automatic thoughts, pacing, graded activity, relaxation, and other skills. During the preoperative period, the physical therapist provided medical and psychological information specific to cancer and the perioperative condition, as well as the plan for postoperative rehabilitation. The goal of providing psychological information was to help the patients understand the influence of various stressors on physical and mental conditions and to motivate them to change their behavior to reduce stress \\[7\\].\n\n【11】Patients were guided to explore their individual emotions, automatic thoughts, and beliefs based on Beck’s approach \\[15\\]. The therapist helped the patients to distinguish their emotions and thoughts from an external event. The patients were helped to identify particular cognitive distortions and to replace these negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes with more adaptive thoughts. The patients were educated in coping style and were encouraged to participate in more activities. The physical therapists went to the patients’ rooms several times a day for the first 3-4 days after the operation and checked their exercise level and thoughts. The presence of the physical therapists was then gradually reduced to facilitate independence. The 6-minute walking distance (6MWD) measured by the 6-minute walking test was performed during the preoperative period and at discharge by following a standardized procedure in room air \\[16\\]. Publication of these cases was approved by the ethics committee of Nagoya University Hospital (number 2015-0413).\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Case 1\n\n【13】##### 3.1. Pneumonectomy with Recurrent Nerve Paralysis\n\n【14】###### 3.1.1. Patient History\n\n【15】The patient was a 60-year-old man. He had a high school degree, lived alone, and worked until he was 60 years old. He smoked 30 cigarettes per day for 20 years until he was 40 years old. He had a history of moderate alcohol consumption for 20 years until he was 40 years old. He did not regularly exercise. This patient was referred to our university hospital for investigation of a cough with bloody sputum that had persisted for months. He had no other comorbidities.\n\n【16】Chest CT revealed a 6.3 × 5.2 cm mass located in the left central portion of the lung and enlarged hilar lymph nodes. The tumor was diagnosed as stage IIB (T2bN1M0) squamous cell carcinoma 6 months after the patient first experienced coughing symptoms.\n\n【17】Clinical findings on admission were normal, except that electrocardiography revealed sinus tachycardia (heartrate > 110 bpm) (Table 1). The 6MWD immediately after admission was 493 m. The patient’s thoughts regarding his illness were as follows: “There is nothing I can do to help myself” and “I have put myself at the doctor.” These thoughts were similar to one of the items in the helplessness and fatalism maladaptive coping style \\[8, 9\\].\n\n【18】Table 1 \n\n【19】Patient characteristics and response to treatment.\n\n【20】###### 3.1.2. Perioperative Course\n\n【21】Medical and psychological information was provided during the preoperative period, and the modifying structured association counseling technique was performed throughout the study \\[7\\]. The patient was provided with opportunities to remember how he had lived before his cancer diagnosis and was encouraged to be aware of how he was being affected by the stress of the cancer. The psychoeducation and information consisted of “stress and both physical and psychological reaction,” “stress and its related factors (including personality, self-esteem, and social support),” and “better attitude for living (including having a positive attitude, expressing negative emotions, getting social support, and the effectiveness of laughter).” The physical therapists helped the patient find ways to manage stressful situations and to better perform health behavior and physical activity.\n\n【22】The patient underwent a left pneumonectomy and combined resection of the left recurrent nerve. Operating time was 198 minutes, and blood loss was 105 mL. Postoperative diagnosis was stage IIIA squamous cell carcinoma. The patient had tachycardia (heartrate > 110 bpm) and was given landiolol hydrochloride (3.39 _μ_g/kg/min) on POD1. A tracheal tube was inserted via cricothyrotomy due to insufficient sputum expectoration. The patient returned to the general ward on POD2. Postoperative pain was managed with continuous epidural anesthesia, patient-controlled analgesia, and oral loxoprofen sodium. Oral intake without aspiration was possible on POD4. The patient’s thoughts were “I suffer from a lot of anxiety due to my disease,” “I have difficulty in believing this happened to me,” and “I distract myself when thoughts about my illness come into my head”; these thoughts were similar to one of the items in the anxious preoccupation and avoidance maladaptive coping style \\[8, 9\\]. However, the patient also thought “I try to fight the illness,” which was similar to one of the items in the fighting spirit of the adaptive coping style \\[8, 9\\].\n\n【23】The patient could independently perform activities of daily living and was discharged home on POD16. The 6MWD at discharge was 455 m. The patient thought “I am determined to beat this disease” and “I see my illness as a challenge,” which was similar to one of the items in the fighting spirit of the adaptive coping style \\[8, 9\\]. After discharge, the patient regularly walked 30 minutes daily to improve physical function. The patient was not readmitted for any pulmonary complications.\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Case  2\n\n【25】##### 4.1. S6 Segmentectomy with Comorbidities of Hepatic Encephalopathy and Dialysis\n\n【26】###### 4.1.1. Patient History\n\n【27】The patient was a 67-year-old man with hypertension who had undergone pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer 7 years ago. He also had noncirrhotic recurrent hepatic encephalopathy after shunting from the superior mesenteric vein to the inferior vena cava for a jejunal varicose vein for 3 years and dialysis for chronic kidney disease for 1 year. He had a high school degree, lived with family, and worked until he was 60 years old. He smoked 40 cigarettes per day for 30 years until he was 50 years old. He had no history of alcohol consumption. He did not regularly exercise.\n\n【28】Chest CT screening after pancreatoduodenectomy in our hospital revealed a 1.1 × 1.4 cm mass located in the right S6. The tumor was diagnosed as stage IV (T1aN0M1) lung metastasis of pancreas adenocarcinoma. The patient was advised to limit the use of postoperative analgesic drugs because of comorbidities. He had no signs of pleural effusion, ascites, disturbance of consciousness, or obvious fatigue. Clinical findings on admission were normal, except that the pulmonary function test revealed a mild restrictive defect (Table 1). The 6MWD on admission was 372 m.\n\n【29】Preoperative pain-related psychological findings were measured using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), which consists of 13 items and gives a score ranging from 0 to 52 \\[12, 14\\]. The PCS measures a subject’s perception of how frequently they have experienced negative automatic thoughts and predicts postoperative pain \\[17, 18\\]. The total PCS score was 23, and the subscales were 15 in rumination, 5 in magnification, and 3 in helplessness. The total PCS score was above the cutoff points of strong pain prediction, which have been reported to be 13 \\[18\\] or 16 \\[19\\]. The patient’s thoughts were “I cannot seem to keep pain out of my mind” and “I keep thinking about how badly I want the pain to stop,” which was one of the items in the rumination of pain of the maladaptive coping style \\[12–14\\].\n\n【30】###### 4.1.2. Perioperative Course\n\n【31】Medical and psychological information was provided during the preoperative period, and training to modify pain coping skills was performed throughout the study \\[11\\]. The patient was provided with opportunities to recognize pain-related negative automatic thoughts, such as pain catastrophizing, and to replace these with alternative, rational, reassuring, adaptive thoughts.\n\n【32】###### 4.1.3. Postoperative Course\n\n【33】The patient underwent S6 segmentectomy of the right lung. The operating time was 87 minutes, and blood loss was 103 mL. The patient returned to the general ward on POD1. Postoperative analgesic drugs included continuous fentanyl (50 _μ_g/hr) until POD2 and oral celecoxib (up to 200 mg per day as needed). Continuous epidural anesthesia and patient-controlled analgesia were not used because of comorbidities. Pain intensity using a 0–10 numerical rating scale was 8/10 on POD1, 5/10 on POD2, 3/10 on POD3 and POD4, and 0–2/10 on all subsequent days. The patient thought “I do something active, which diverts my attention away from the pain” and “I tell myself to be brave and carry on despite the pain,” which was similar to one of the items in the adaptive coping style \\[13\\]. Oral intake without aspiration was possible on POD6.\n\n【34】The patient was discharged home on POD19. The 6MWD at discharge was 344 m. The patient thought “I see my illness as a challenge,” which was similar to one of the items in the fighting spirit of the adaptive coping style \\[8, 9\\]. After discharge, the patient regularly walked for 20 minutes every day to improve his physical function. The patient was not readmitted for any pulmonary complications.\n\n【35】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【36】The present patients had negative automatic thoughts and were assessed as having high risk of postoperative pulmonary complications following thoracic surgery. These patients received combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation, which led to improved adaptive thoughts, increased physical activity, and favorable recovery.\n\n【37】Psychological intervention should be based on the individual patient’s specific goals for problem solving, not just a general coping strategy \\[7\\]. Negative automatic thoughts are associated with reduced health behavior and physical activity \\[4, 5\\]. Therefore, perioperative rehabilitation for cancer patients should focus not only on exercise, but also on psychoeducation for coping style. Successful exercise experiences can dramatically improve negative automatic thoughts. Physical therapists often initiate postoperative exercise, and so they should take the lead in psychoeducation to help patients replace negative thoughts with more adaptive coping styles during rehabilitation. As psychological constructs and QOL are worse in patients with short duration rather than long duration since diagnosis \\[20–22\\] and surgery \\[23–25\\], early combination treatment of rehabilitation and psychoeducation could be useful in cancer patients. Patients in the early postoperative phase experience pain and reduction of QOL, and therefore the treatment should be individualized for each patient’s symptoms.\n\n【38】Cancer patients often have psychological concerns and maladaptive coping styles about illness in the period from diagnosis to the completion of treatment \\[26, 27\\], as observed in Case  . Perioperative psychological and physical changes occur before the patient is discharged. Hence, psychoeducation for effective coping strategies should be performed constantly during the perioperative period. Previous studies have reported that surgical patient outcomes are improved by patient education \\[28, 29\\], and the maladaptive coping style is a risk factor for psychiatric morbidity and decreased survival in cancer patients \\[26, 30–32\\]. Further longitudinal psychological assessment and treatment are required from diagnosis to completion of treatment in cancer patients.\n\n【39】The patient in Case   had a high PCS score and marked postoperative pain. Preoperative pain catastrophizing predicts persistent postoperative pain in total joint replacement patients \\[19, 33, 34\\]. Marked postoperative pain prevents effective cough-up and deep breathing and increases the risks of postoperative complications \\[35\\]. Positive coping for pain, such as thinking of things to distract them from the pain or engaging in active behaviors that divert attention away from the pain, is useful for health behavior \\[13\\]. The psychoeducation for the maladaptive coping style in pain should be performed perioperatively.\n\n【40】This case report has several limitations. The negative automatic thoughts were assessed mainly by medical interview. Several short screening tools about negative automatic thoughts have been reported \\[36\\]. Development of simple psychological assessment tools for perioperative cancer patients is required.\n\n【41】#### 6\\. Conclusions\n\n【42】The combination treatment of perioperative rehabilitation and psychoeducation is useful for improving automatic thoughts and behaviors about illness and leads to favorable recovery in thoracic cancer surgery. The psychoeducational approach should be expanded to perioperative cancer patients.\n\n【43】#### Competing Interests\n\n【44】The authors certify that no affiliation or financial involvement exists between them and any organization with a direct interest in the subject matter or materials discussed in the article.\n\n【45】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【46】This work was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (no. 16K21081 to T.

{"seq_id": "146dd9e0-5287-4e5c-871a-eb3aff4cfa1f", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】We report the case of a 56-year-old male patient, who over two decades, sequentially presented with a combination of clinical manifestations. These included thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), right leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and eventually constitutional symptoms, arthralgia, diffuse lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, skin rash, pericarditis, and glomerulonephritis. Serologic tests and renal pathology uncovered a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and immunosuppressive therapy was initiated. Soon after, the patient developed striking cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, requiring prolonged antiviral therapy and reduction of immunosuppression. Finally, an acute embolic stroke complicated the disease course. Prompt interventions allowed an excellent clinical outcome.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototypical systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, often exhibiting a relapsing-remitting course \\[1\\]. As treatment is based on immunosuppressive therapy, infections pose a major iatrogenic complication \\[2\\]. Here, we report a unique case of a middle-aged male, gradually presenting with a diverse constellation of systemic manifestations over a prolonged period. We discuss the clinical presentation, diagnostic implications, therapeutic decisions, and treatment complications.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 56-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 2-month history of extreme weakness, fatigue, and anorexia. His past medical record was remarkable for a previous event of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) 20 years earlier. He was then treated with plasmapheresis, aspirin, and corticosteroids, with complete recovery. 18 months thereafter, he was diagnosed with an unprovoked right leg deep vein thrombosis (DVT), for which no etiology was found. Noticeably, antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) were negative.\n\n【6】Similar constitutional symptoms had plagued the patient before. Several years prior to his current presentation, he was admitted for weakness and weight loss (30 kg over a few months). He then underwent a thorough investigation, including blood tests, whole-body computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT). Diffuse hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy, involving axillary, abdominal, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes (LNs), was seen. Excisional biopsy of a pelvic LN (PN) and bone marrow (BM) biopsy were performed, both being unremarkable. Immune serologies sent at that time showed only a weakly positive antinuclear antibody (ANA). The differential diagnosis comprised a systemic infection, an indolent neoplastic process, and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS). None of these entities was proven however, leaving the patient undiagnosed despite regular follow-up. Thereafter, he spontaneously recovered, enjoying several uneventful years.\n\n【7】Upon the patient’s current admission, physical examination revealed mild bilateral leg edema and numerous lichen-like skin lesions (see Figure 1). Recurrent fever spikes of up to 39°C were recorded, with otherwise normal vital signs. Blood tests were extremely abnormal, showing pancytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, high creatinine levels, and elevated inflammatory markers (see Table 1). While whole-body CT displayed no noteworthy findings, PET/CT demonstrated widespread hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy and diffusely increased BM uptake. BM and groin LN biopsies were performed, again being noncontributory. Peripheral blood flow cytometry, however, showed a high proportion (7%) of double-negative (DN) T cells (negative for both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>). Blood cultures and broad bacterial and viral serologies were negative. The patient’s urinalysis was significant for hematuria and proteinuria, and urine microscopy revealed red blood cell (RBC) casts, along with dysmorphic RBCs. 24-hour urine collection demonstrated nephrotic range proteinuria (3.9 g/d).\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Lichen planus-like lesions on the patient’s back. On biopsy, the positive lupus band test was found, signifying immune complex deposition.\n\n【12】Table 1 \n\n【13】The patient’s blood chemistry and counts upon admission.\n\n【14】During this time, the patient’s clinical condition was one of the ongoing weakness, fatigue, and dyspnea. He also suffered from pleuritic chest pain and progressive, asymmetric leg edema. Further work-up directed at these complaints showed an extensive right leg DVT, elevated cardiac enzymes, and new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). In addition, a small pericardial effusion was found on transesophageal echocardiography (TTE). Therapy with enoxaparin was started for his DVT and AF, and broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage was instituted for a suspected bacterial infection. Pericarditis was added to this ever-growing list of diagnoses.\n\n【15】Results of ANA and anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (anti-dsDNA) antibody were reported at this stage, both being strongly positive, along with low complement levels (see Table 2). Notably, APLAs were negative. In light of the patient’s deteriorating renal function and active urinary sediment, kidney biopsy was performed. Lupus nephritis stages 3 and 5 (focal proliferative and membranous glomerulonephritis, respectively) were present on pathology. Biopsy of the skin lesions demonstrated immune complex (lupus band) deposition and a lichen planus-like pathological picture. The patient was thus diagnosed with SLE and started on high-dose corticosteroid therapy, hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil, and ramipril, with impressive clinical and laboratory improvement. After a 4-week hospital stay, he was eventually discharged for follow-up at the rheumatology and nephrology outpatient clinics.\n\n【16】Table 2 \n\n【17】The patient’s immune serologies, completed during his admission.\n\n【18】Less than one month after discharge, the patient was readmitted due to a painful right calf ulcer, productive cough, and general weakness. Thorough work-up revealed significant cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia (>925,000 copies/mL), with no signs of visceral involvement upon bronchoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, and ophthalmologic evaluation. The leg ulcer was attributed to postphlebitic syndrome, and biopsy of the ulcer was noncontributory. Cultures from both the ulcer and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid grew _Pseudomonas aeroguinosa_, and therapy with ciprofloxacin was started. Besides, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone doses were reduced in an attempt to minimize immunosuppression, and intravenous ganciclovir therapy was initiated. The lack of clear signs of end-organ involvement has made it difficult to define the required duration of ganciclovir treatment, and the CMV viremia was monitored instead. Following the gradual elimination of viremia, antiviral therapy was stopped. Diligent wound care, compression stockings, and antibiotic treatment allowed stepwise healing of the ulcer.\n\n【19】Three months later, the patient was again admitted for sudden-onset dysarthria and right-sided hemiparesis. Brain CT angiography showed left middle cerebral artery branch obstruction, consistent with an embolic etiology. An emergent thrombectomy was performed. TTE, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and carotid Doppler studies revealed no embolic source. Aspirin and high-dose statin were added, and the patient continued apixaban. Gradually, he was able to regain excellent functional capacity.\n\n【20】As of today, one year after his index presentation, the patient is well and suffers no residual neurologic deficits. His most recent labs, including blood counts, chemistry panels, complement levels, and urinalysis, are unremarkable. His proteinuria has declined to 170 mg/d, and CMV titers in blood are undetectable.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】Our patient was eventually diagnosed with SLE. Over 20 years, he presented with an assembly of disease manifestations, including hematologic, musculoskeletal, dermatologic, cardiac, and renal phenomena. Initially experiencing events of TTP and DVT, he went on to develop, over many years and in a relapsing-remitting manner, constitutional symptoms, arthralgia, lymphadenopathy, pancytopenia, skin lesions, pericarditis, and glomerulonephritis. Past immune serologies showed only a weakly positive ANA, with normal complement levels. The absence of classic lupus manifestations in the past obscured the diagnosis, and it was not until significant visceral involvement occurred many years thereafter, that the correct conclusions were drawn. In these days of extensive testing and follow-up, “the great pretender,” lupus, appears to present a lesser diagnostic dilemma than in the past. Atypical manifestations, combined with spontaneous disease remissions, may nonetheless obfuscate the clinical picture.\n\n【23】Constitutional symptoms, including fatigue, anorexia, fever, and weight loss, are commonly seen in patients with SLE. Fatigue is a frequent, sometimes disabling, disease symptom. Its etiology is multifactorial and includes chronic inflammation, cytokine dysregulation, side effect of medications, comorbidities, and hormonal imbalances \\[3\\]. Fever occurs in 42–86% of SLE patients \\[4\\]. Its work-up can be challenging, and the disease occasionally presents as fever of unknown origin (FUO) \\[5\\].\n\n【24】SLE is known to have myriad hematologic manifestations, many of which appeared in our case. Lymphadenopathy is a common, often unappreciated feature. LNs are usually soft and nontender and may fluctuate in size with disease exacerbations. Biopsy usually shows reactive hyperplasia \\[6\\]. 50% of patients with SLE develop anemia, usually due to chronic inflammation and iron deficiency, and less often due to autoimmune hemolysis \\[7\\]. White blood cell abnormalities are also common in lupus and include leukopenia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia \\[8\\]. Thrombocytopenia, when related to active disease, tends to be lower than 50,000/mm<sup>3</sup> and usually necessitates aggressive therapy \\[9\\]. While TTP may be a rare manifestation of SLE, it is seldom the presenting feature \\[10\\]. Thrombosis, on the contrary, is a well-known finding in the disease and is multifactorial. Despite APLAs being the most important risk factor, 40% of SLE patients negative for these antibodies will still experience a thrombotic event. Other factors that contribute to thrombosis in lupus include inflammatory disease activity, medications, and traditional risk factors (including smoking, diabetes, and hypertension) \\[11\\]. Immunologically, it is noteworthy that SLE patients may have increased numbers of DN T cells in peripheral blood, probably driven by excessive T cell stimulation. These cells synthesize interleukins and can stimulate B cells, contributing to the pathogenesis of kidney damage, for instance \\[12\\].\n\n【25】Regarding cardiac involvement, SLE can affect any layer of the heart. Pericardial effusion secondary to pericarditis is the most common manifestation \\[13\\]. Valvular heart disease is also well known in SLE. Left-sided valvular thickening is the predominant finding, followed by valvular vegetations, regurgitation, and stenosis \\[14\\]. It is worth mentioning that, in Libman–Sacks endocarditis complicating SLE, the sterile valvular vegetations have a greater tendency to embolize than in infective endocarditis, thus predisposing to neuropsychiatric disease, including ischemic stroke \\[15\\]. The latter is twice as common in SLE patients as compared to the general population. Contributing factors include embolic events, comorbidities (such as antiphospholipid syndrome and hypertension), systemic inflammation, and treatment complications \\[16\\]. AF, present in our case, is also known to be more common in SLE patients and is associated with increased mortality \\[17\\].\n\n【26】Skin disease is a well-characterized feature of lupus. Chronic cutaneous lupus includes a lupus-lichen overlap entity \\[18\\]. In the majority of patients with systemic disease, immunofluorescence reveals deposits at the dermal-epidermal junction in normal non-sun-exposed skin and at sites of cutaneous lesions, the so-called lupus band test \\[19\\].\n\n【27】Renal involvement remains one of the most devastating manifestations of SLE, with increased morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in management, 10% of the patients still progress to renal insufficiency and end-stage renal disease \\[20\\].\n\n【28】Complications of immunosuppression are also represented in our case. CMV viremia dominated the clinical picture, necessitating reduction of immunosuppression and institution of prolonged intravenous antiviral therapy. The heavy immunosuppressive regimens used in systemic autoimmune diseases are known to predispose to opportunistic infections. These remain the most frequent cause of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality in SLE patients. More than half of the infections are viral, the most common being herpes zoster \\[2\\]. No guidelines in the field of rheumatology advise in favor of prophylactic therapy against CMV upon heavy immunosuppression, as opposed to the recommendations in patients undergoing BM transplantation. In cases of symptomatic CMV disease, treatment involves both the minimization of immunosuppression and the institution of antiviral therapy, typically with oral valganciclovir or intravenous ganciclovir \\[21\\]. Duration of intravenous therapy is usually guided by the target organ, lacking in our patient.\n\n【29】We believe our case is educational in several aspects. First, the patient showed a remarkable mixture of systemic manifestations (see Figure 2), varying in severity, pattern, and timing, with the eventual diagnosis being made two decades after his initial presentation. Secondly, despite appropriate therapy, he went on to develop complications of the disease and its treatment, including DVT, AF, CMV viremia, and stroke. Finally, the correct utilization of the therapeutic armamentarium and the proper implementation of urgent interventions yielded an excellent outcome.\n\n【30】  \n\n【31】  \n\n【32】Figure 2 \n\n【33】Timeline of events in the patient’s course over 20 years.

During an interview with a patient with DID, a surprising talent emerged when she wrote a sentence for the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam—mirror writing. It is not known whether her mirror writing had a deeper level of meaning; however, it does emphasize the idiosyncratic nature of dissociative identity disorder.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

It is defined as script that “runs in the opposite direction to normal, with individual letters reversed, so that it is most easily read using a mirror \\[1\\].” Mirror writers are often intrinsically left handed and mirror write with their left hands and may come from cultures, such as Chinese or Japanese, that normally write from right to left \\[1\\]. Mirror writing may also be found among those who have degenerative brain diseases or who have suffered brain lesions, head injuries or vitamin deficiencies \\[1, 2\\]. With practice healthy adults may also learn to mirror write. Even those with amnestic disorders can learn to mirror write after enough practice \\[2\\].

Case Report\n\n【5】Ms. A, a 46-year-old woman, was admitted for global amnesia. She was awake and alert in the emergency room but was confused about her identity, past events in the last 2 days, and how she had arrived at the hospital. A head CT scan showed no acute disease. The psychiatry team was consulted, and it was discovered that Ms. A had a previous diagnosis of dissociative identity disorder (DID). Further investigation revealed that her family recently experienced enormous stress, which may have precipitated the current episode. During the psychiatric exam, she calmly sat with her eyes closed and insisted that they were already open when asked to open them. She also repeatedly fluctuated between referring to herself as “I” or “she.” When asked to write a complete sentence during the Folstein Mini-Mental State Exam, Ms. A took the pen with her right hand and effortlessly wrote, from the right margin to the left, the mirror image of “I’m tired of being here.” When asked to write the sentence again, she wrote the same sentence in the same direction as fluidly as she had done before (Figures 1 and 2). She later reported that she was normally right handed. Ms. A ultimately received a 24/30 on the Mini-Mental State Exam, with points deducted in orientation to place and time and in short-term memory. The amnesia began to clear toward the evening, and Ms. A agreed to continue her care at a local community hospital.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】| Sentence written by Ms. A. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 2 \n\n【13】| Mirror image of sentence. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】People with severe DID are known to fluctuate in various abilities, “such as fluency in a foreign language or athletic abilities \\[3, 4\\].” In some case studies, people with DID are able to switch handedness \\[5\\].

One other case study described a left handed woman with a previous history of migraines and sensory and perceptive disturbances who mirror wrote with her right hand \\[6\\]. An exhaustive literature search was unable to yield reports of people with DID who spontaneously mirror wrote during their dissociative states, thereby making Ms. A’s situation distinctive.

We report a pilot study of the effects of Nichi Glucan, 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucan food supplement, in lowering the blood glucose and lipid levels in three patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) from India. These patients had increased blood glucose and lipid levels inspite of routine antidiabetic and lipid level lowering medications. Each of the participants took 1.5 g of Nichi Glucan per day with food for two months along with their routine medications. The relevant parameters to assess glycemic status and lipid levels were calculated at the baseline and at the end of two months. After two months of continuous consumption, in one patient, the HbA1c decreased from 9.1% to 7.8%, and the glycemic target of HbA1c <6.5% laid down by the International Diabetes Federation was reached in two patients. Lipid levels also decreased significantly. Based on our findings, Nichi Glucan food supplement can be considered along with routine medications in patients with Type II diabetes with hyperlipidemia. Further studies are needed to validate the results.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The rampantly increasing incidence of lifestyle changes has contributed to the massive increase in the prevalence of diabetes with nearly 51 million people suffering from Diabetes in India \\[1\\]. There is also growing concern on the term “Asian Indian Phenotype,” which refers to certain unique clinical and biochemical abnormalities in Indians, including an increased insulin resistance, greater abdominal adiposity, dyslipidemia with low HDL cholesterol, elevated serum triglycerides and increased small, dense LDL cholesterol, which further with an increased ethnic susceptibility makes Indians at high risk for diabetes and premature coronary artery disease \\[1\\]. Studies indicate that 31.4% of the population in South India have abdominal obesity, 45.6% have hypertriglyceridemia, 65.5% have low HDL, 55.4% have hypertension, and 26.7% have raised fasting plasma glucose, all of which are major features of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) \\[2\\]. Type II Diabetes or the noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is the more common type of diabetes with its prevalence particularly higher in South India compared to other parts of India \\[3\\]. In addition to the influence on health, the toll of diabetes on the country’s economy is alarming with nearly 2.1% of the nation’s GDP spent on treatment for diabetes \\[4\\]. In this regard, apart from therapeutic interventions such as oral glucose lowering drugs and insulin, dietary supplements are a potential intervention, both preventive and therapeutic. In this context, Beta Glucan-based food supplements have been developed for the treatment of various diseases including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cancer, and infectious diseases with promising results, based on clinical studies \\[5\\]. Beta Glucans are polysaccharides with glucose residues joined by beta linkage found in the cell wall of certain fungi, yeast, oat, barley, bacteria, and so forth \\[5\\]. However, such Beta Glucan-based food supplements for lowering glucose levels and treating metabolic syndrome have not gathered prominence in India. Herein, we report the effects of a food supplement, Nichi Glucan, which is 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucan, in lowering the blood glucose and lipid levels on the basis of results obtained from a preliminary study involving three patients with NIDDM from South India.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】##### 2.1. The Nichi Glucan\n\n【6】The Beta Glucan used in the study is Nichi Glucan, a commercially available, water soluble 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucan obtained from the cultured black yeast (_Aureobasidium pullulans_), which is an approved health food supplement in Japan. The Nichi Glucan contains 5% _β_\\-1, 3-1, 6-glucan, 71% starch, 13% corn starch, 13% Aureobasidium nutrient solution as thickening agent, 2% tricalcium phosphate, and 1% pullulans as manufacturing solutions. The aqueous solutions are used during the manufacturing process; however, the above percentages were calculated based on the dry weight of the product. The Nichi Glucan was supplied by GN Corporation through Nichi-Vision Life Sciences (NVLS), India. It was given to the participants of the study in the form of sachets each containing 0.5 g granules of Nichi Glucan. The participants were advised to take three of such sachets per day, one at morning, one at afternoon, and one at night as a food supplement for two months. The HbA1c, fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels, serum cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglyceride levels were calculated before starting the Nichi Glucan supplement and at the end of two months.\n\n【7】##### 2.2. Description of Participants Included in the Study\n\n【8】Three participants were included in the study. All three were from South India. One of them (Patient III) was a vegetarian on all days but could consume all kinds of milk products and the other two (Patients I and II) were vegetarian on selected days but could consume milk products on all days and nonvegetarian food such as egg products, chicken, fish, and lamb as animal proteins on other days. Food intake and physical activity were quantified at the baseline by a physician. All three participants had undergone individual counselling by a common physician during the study period concerning daily food intake, and they were advised to consume a diet similar to their consumption prior to the starting of the Nichi Glucan intake. All three participants did only mild exercise such as walking for 30 minutes, simple non-strenuous domestic work, and travelling by public transport. The participants were advised not to change their diet habits or physical activity during the study. Every two weeks during the study, the food intake and physical activity were evaluated by the same physician who evaluated them before the start of the study.\n\n【9】###### 2.2.1. Patient I\n\n【10】A 46-year-old male, white collar job holder, BMI of 24.2, with history of hypertension for 10 years, and has Type II diabetes for the past 10 years. He has been taking insulin injection, 12 units at morning and night for past six years. He has also been prescribed Metformin 500 mg one tablet at morning and night and 1000 mg at noon and Pioglitazone 15 mg twice daily. He is not a smoker but consumes alcohol occasionally. He also had an elevated lipid profile, for which he was prescribed Atorvastatin 40 mg and Fenofibrate 67 mg twice daily. He started taking Nichi-Glucan as a food supplement in the dosage described above, on the 20th November 2011, and his parameters of relevance were measured before and after taking Nichi-Glucan for two months. During this period of two months, he did not change his food habits or other lifestyle related events. His antiglycemic medications were also continued as before.\n\n【11】###### 2.2.2. Patient II\n\n【12】A 60-year-old female, house wife, BMI of 26.6, with history of hypertension for five years, under medication with Amlodipine 5 mg once daily, and Type II diabetes for 1 year. She has been taking oral antidiabetic agent (Metformin) 500 mg thrice daily after food for the past one year. She had an elevated lipid profile, for which she was prescribed lipid-lowering drugs, but she did not follow it due to side effects of nausea and vomiting after taking the drugs initially. She started taking Nichi Glucan as a food supplement in the dosage described above, on 28th November 2011, and her parameters of relevance were measured before and after taking Nichi Glucan for two months. During this period of two months, she did not change her food habits or other lifestyle related events. Her antidiabetic medications were also continued as before.\n\n【13】###### 2.2.3. Patient III\n\n【14】A 63-year-old female, house wife, with a BMI of 26.1, with Type II diabetes for the past one year and on insulin 16 units in the morning and 12 units in the night along with Metformin 500 mg thrice daily and Pioglitazone 15 mg twice daily, started taking Nichi Glucan as a food supplement on 26th November 2011, and her parameters of relevance were measured before and after taking Nichi Glucan for two months. She is neither a smoker nor consumes alcohol. During this period of two months, she did not change her food habits or other lifestyle related events. Her antidiabetic medications were also continued as before.\n\n【15】The study was done in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration, and all the participants were included in the study after proper informed consent.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【17】The HbA1c levels and fasting, postprandial blood glucose levels before and after taking Nichi Glucan are depicted in Table 1. It can be observed that in spite of the antidiabetic medication, the glycemic target, HbA1c <6.5%, laid down by the International Diabetes Federation \\[5\\] was not achieved in any of the patients prior to Nichi Glucan supplementation. However, after Nichi Glucan supplementation, there is a decrease in the blood glucose levels in all of the three patients with the glycemic target reached in two of the patients (Patient II—HbA1c—5.9% and Patient III—HbA1c—5.6%). A decrease in total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides and an increase in HDL levels can also be appreciated after Nichi Glucan supplementation.\n\n【18】Table 1 \n\n【19】Characteristics of patients and study parameters of relevance before and after food supplementation with Nichi Glucan.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【21】Diabetes has a global prevalence of 366 million in 2011, and this figure is expected to increase to 552 million by 2030 \\[6\\]. Current treatments of Diabetes both Types I and II include diet modifications, exercise, insulin injection, and glucose-lowering drugs \\[7\\]. Metabolic syndrome, which includes diabetes, obesity, and hyperlipidemia \\[8\\], is another facet of consideration, particularly in Indian diabetic patients. With the increasing evidence of the Asian Indian Phenotype in whom, diabetes sets in at least a decade earlier compared to their western counterparts \\[9\\], the need to control the glycemic level and hyperlipidemia in Indians becomes increasingly more important. At this juncture, the role of food supplements in reducing the blood glucose and lipid levels needs attention.\n\n【22】There are several literatures which have reported the efficacy of Beta Glucan food supplements in lowering blood glucose levels, improving glucose tolerance, decreasing hyperlipidemia, improving immunity, and decreasing infections \\[10–13\\]. Antitumour properties of Beta Glucans have also been reported \\[14\\]. Beta Glucans are obtained from a variety of sources like fungi, mushrooms, oats barley, and other bacteria. Fungal Beta Glucans have 1, 3-1, 6 linkages while those from oats and barley have 1, 3-1, 4 linkages \\[5\\]. The Beta Glucan used in this study was obtained from a black yeast known as _Aureobasidium pullulans_ (Strain AFO-202) isolated by Dr. Ikewaki et al., which secretes the 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucans extracellularly in the culture medium. Hence refining and purification are relatively simple \\[12\\]. Further, it is odorless, water soluble, and does not change the taste or flavor of the food thus making it an ideal food supplement. It can also be used as a food additive due to its water retentive and thickening characteristics. This Beta Glucan is already available as a commercial health food supplement, but the efficacy of the same in Type II diabetes patients in India has not been yet reported.\n\n【23】From the results of this study, it can be observed that there is a significant decrease in the glycemic levels in all of the three patients, wherein in the first two patients, the HbA1c levels decreased by 1.3%, while in the third patient, the HbA1c level decreased by a significant 4.2% (Figure 1). The fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels also decreased considerably. A consensus article by the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes states that the expected decrease of HbA1c levels with Metformin and Thiazolidinedione monotherapy is 1%-2%, and with Insulin a decrease of 1.5%–3.5% can be expected \\[5\\]. In all these three patients, before supplementation with Beta Glucan, the glycemic target of HbA1c <6.5% was not achieved, and plasma glucose levels were high in spite of intake of antidiabetic medication including insulin injections in two of the patients, but after supplementation glycemic target was achieved in two of the patients. Plasma Glucose levels also returned to the normal range. The average decrease in the levels before and after Beta Glucan supplementation of the total cholesterol (2.05 mmol/L), LDL (1.91 mmol/L) and Triglycerides levels (1.04 mmol/L) is comparable or even slightly higher than the levels reported in other literatures including a meta-analysis on changes in the lipid profile after Beta Glucan consumption \\[15, 16\\]. The HDL cholesterol levels also increased after Nichi Glucan supplementation which is another favorable response. As the patients did not change their food habits or physical activity during the study, the influence of these factors on the reduction of HbA1c levels and total cholesterol, LDL, and Triglyceride levels may be considered negligible or minimal.\n\n【24】  \n\n【25】  \n\n【26】Figure 1 \n\n【27】| HbA1c Levels before and after food supplementation with Nichi Glucan. |\n| --- |\n\n【28】The total quantity of Nichi Glucan consumed was only 1.5 g per day, and since the three subjects involved in the study were used to a relatively fibre dominant south Indian diet, this 1.5 g in addition to the diet did not amount to a significant proportion leading to any high fibre-related side effect. Also in a study done in 27 elderly people aged above 70 years, it has been confirmed that an oral administration of nearly 150 mg/day of _β_\\-1, 3-1, 6-glucan similar to the one used in the study, through gastronomy or nasal tube, for a period of 3 months, did not have any adverse changes on the levels of Na, K, Cl, glucose, uric acid, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglyceride, total protein, albumin, and cholinesterase, _γ_\\-GTP, AST, ALT, and CRP in the blood of the subjects as revealed by biochemical screening \\[17\\].\n\n【29】Our study has limitations of any observational study based on few patients. Hence, our findings need to be interpreted with caution. However, on the basis of limited information available from three patients, we hypothesize that three-time intakes of 0.5 g Nichi Glucan daily can serve as an effective food supplementation to diabetics with particular relevance to Indians who have concomitant risk of development of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease associated with diabetes. However, this needs evidence from large randomized controlled trials in such patients.\n\n【30】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】Daily food supplementation with 1, 3-1, 6 Beta Glucan (Nichi Glucan) along with routine antidiabetic and lipid-lowering drugs has favorable response in improving glycemic status and lipid status in Indian Patients with Type II Diabetes with hyperlipidemia. Further studies with larger samples are needed to validate the results.\n\n【32】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【33】The authors have declared that no conflict of interests exists.\n\n【34】#### Acknowledgment\n\n【35】The authors acknowledge M/S Hope Foundation (Trust), India, for funding the study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It may, however, masquerade as a commonly encountered disease, such as sinusitis. A high index of clinical suspicion of nasal ENKL should be raised when there is inadequate clinical response despite appropriate therapeutic intervention of sinusitis. Biopsy would be warranted and crucial in those instances to make an accurate and timely diagnosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (ENKL), nasal type, is a rare non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and was previously known as lethal midline granuloma or angiocentric lymphoma \\[1\\]. Sinusitis is a common disease and has been seen daily in clinical practice. ENKL is an aggressive lymphoma with poor outcome if delayed in diagnosis and therapy \\[1, 2\\]. When a patient with ENKL presents with persistent sinusitis or periorbital cellulitis, it may well be a missed diagnosis. A tissue biopsy for pathology is vital to reach an early diagnosis in conjunction with a heightened clinical suspicion and multidisciplinary approach to optimize clinical outcomes.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 52-year-old Caucasian male presented to his primary-care physician with a 2-month history of right-sided nasal congestion, fever, and purulent rhinorrhea. His past medical history was significant for gout and seasonal rhinitis. He denied intranasal cocaine use. Despite appropriate courses of oral antibiotics, the patient’s symptoms progressed to headache and redness around the right eye. He was referred to an otorhinolaryngologist at that time. Physical examination revealed erythema and edema of the right periorbital tissues, upper and lower eyelids, and cheeks. On palpation, there was no fluctuant mass or exquisite tenderness over the right periorbital region or sinuses. Pupils, extraocular movements, and vision were all intact. The intranasal examination showed considerable swelling of the right middle meatus with purulent drainage. The computed tomography (CT) scan of sinuses showed 100% opacification of the right frontal and ethmoid sinuses, 50% opacification of the right maxillary sinus, and 20% opacification of the right sphenoidal sinus. There was no evidence of orbital or periorbital abscess or bony destruction. Routine laboratory workup was unremarkable. He was admitted to an outside hospital and treated with intravenous vancomycin and cefepime for presumed bacterial sinusitis. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) was performed; the operative findings revealed thick yellow purulence and frontal/ethmoidal sinus abscesses. Intraoperative cultures revealed methicillin-sensitive _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MSSA)_._ Postoperatively, the patient felt better and the swelling and erythema around the right eye markedly decreased (see Figure 1). The patient was discharged to complete a 2-week course of oral cephalexin for MSSA bacterial sinusitis.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】Reduction of swelling and erythema was noted around the right paranasal sinuses and right eye after nasal washout.\n\n【10】However, 5 days into the oral antibiotic therapy, he experienced worsening of symptoms and was admitted to our institution. He was noted to have marked right periorbital edema with inability to completely open his right eye. Nasal washout on the right was performed. Thick mucinous discharge was noted. No specimens were taken for culture or pathology because it was thought to be severe MSSA bacterial sinusitis that failed outpatient oral antibiotic treatment. The patient was then discharged home with intravenous nafcillin for 2 weeks.\n\n【11】Despite intravenous antibiotic therapy, the patient reported worsening right eye swelling and was readmitted 6 days into his course of intravenous antibiotics. The patient could not open his right eye due to extensive eyelid swelling. Marked periorbital erythema and extensive conjunctival chemosis were noted.\n\n【12】MRI of the right orbit with IV gadolinium showed extensive fluid collection in the right frontal and ethmoidal sinuses and soft tissue swelling within the right orbit with right eye proptosis. MRI brain and MRI venogram with IV gadolinium failed to show intracranial extension or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. The patient underwent an additional FESS of the right frontal and ethmoidal sinuses to optimize source control of the infection. There was no endoscopic finding suggestive of invasive fungal sinusitis. Cultures and biopsy from the sinus tissue were obtained this time. The former revealed the growth of _Enterobacter cloacae_ for which ciprofloxacin was added to the antibiotic regimen. Fungal sinus tissue culture was negative. However, the patient continued to have worsening right periorbital edema, erythema, and chemosis despite on appropriate antibiotic therapy (see Figure 2).\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】Exuberant periorbital edema, erythema, and superficial excoriation with serous drainage were noted over the right eye and right paranasal region.\n\n【17】Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies test (ANCA) was ordered to rule out ANCA-associated vasculitis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and it returned negative. Ophthalmology also evaluated the patient and their examination revealed a normal fundus with no optic nerve edema or venous congestion. The patient had the right anterior orbitotomy and dacryocystorhinostomy for better lacrimal drainage to alleviate periorbital swelling. Right orbital tissue biopsy for pathology was also obtained.\n\n【18】The right sinus as well as the orbital tissue pathology illustrated dense small atypical T cells with irregular nucleoli (see Figure 3), which were positive for natural killer cells or cytotoxic T-cell markers—CD2, CD3, and CD56 on the immunohistochemistry study. The neoplastic cells were negative for CD4, CD8, and CD7 on immunophenotype evaluation. Molecular detection of a clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement was positive, confirming T-cell origin monoclonal expansion. In situ hybridization was strongly positive for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) RNA (see Figure 4). Pathologic findings were suggestive of nasal type, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Blood EBV PCR was positive at 3,100 copies/mL (reference, <100 copies/mL). There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly on CT chest, abdomen, and pelvis as well as no evidence of lymphoma in the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. All findings were consistent with extranodal natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type.\n\n【19】  \n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Figure 3 \n\n【22】There were dense atypical lymphoid cells with irregular nucleoli (H&E stain, 400X).\n\n【23】  \n\n【24】  \n\n【25】Figure 4 \n\n【26】In situ hybridization was diffusely positive for Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) RNA.\n\n【27】The patient had completed 4 cycles of SMILE chemotherapy regimen (_S_teroids, _M_ethotrexate, _I_fosfamide, _L_\\-asparaginase, and _E_toposide) and 20 sessions of radiation therapy. The right periorbital edema and erythema had almost resolved (see Figure 5). On surveillance imaging, contralateral jugular lymphadenopathy was noted. The patient subsequently had the lymph node biopsy, and the report revealed recurrent NK/T-cell lymphoma. He then underwent 3 cycles of pembrolizumab with complete clinical response. The patient eventually had the matched-unrelated donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant (MUD-PBSCT). It was complicated by severe GI graft-versus-host disease for which the patient was placed on a prolonged course of high-dose steroid therapy. Unfortunately, while on steroid therapy, the patient succumbed to severe _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ pneumonia 2 years after the initial diagnosis of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma.\n\n【28】  \n\n【29】  \n\n【30】Figure 5 \n\n【31】Significant resolution of the right periorbital edema and erythema was noted after 3 cycles of chemotherapy. The right eye was eventually able to fully open.\n\n【32】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【33】Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (EKNL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and is derived from natural killer (NK) cells or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes \\[1\\]. The most common body site of involvement in EKNL is the sinonasal region, and hence it is termed extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type \\[2\\]. This type of lymphoma was formerly known as lethal midline granuloma or angiocentric lymphoma \\[1\\]. Other organs involvement in EKNL includes salivary glands, skin, breast, gastrointestinal tract, spleen, or testes \\[2, 3\\]. The incidence of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma is highest in Asia (China, Hong Kong, Korea, and Japan) and South America (Peru and Mexico) \\[1, 2\\]. It is a rare disease in North America and Europe \\[2\\]. Nasal EKNL is virtually always associated with EBV infection \\[1, 2\\].\n\n【34】ENKL, nasal type, usually affects the sinonasal region first with extension into the ipsilateral periorbital tissues \\[2–4\\]. Clinical manifestations of nasal ENKL include signs and symptoms of recurrent chronic sinusitis, periorbital swelling, chemosis, or proptosis \\[3, 4\\]. Rarely, there have been reported cases of periorbital involvement without sinusitis \\[5\\]. The diagnosis of nasal ENKL is almost always delayed because of its rarity and oftentimes treated as chronic or acute on chronic sinusitis during initial presentation.\n\n【35】A sinus or orbital tissue biopsy is paramount for arriving at the correct diagnosis. ANCA-associated vasculitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, relapsing polychondritis, intranasal cocaine use, and sarcoidosis are important differential diagnoses. Clinical vigilance of nasal ENKL should be raised when there is sinusitis and/or periorbital cellulitis with slow or worsening clinical response to surgical intervention and appropriate antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【36】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【37】Our case illustrates the need to be aware of mimickers of sinusitis/periorbital cellulitis, such as nasal ENKL. Even if cultures are positive, the lack of clinical response or recurrence of sinus/orbital disease despite optimal antimicrobials and surgery should prompt clinicians to consider urgent tissue biopsy in order to rule out other potentially fatal disease processes.\n\n【38】#### Data Availability\n\n【39】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【40】#### Consent\n\n【41】Consent was obtained from the patient.\n\n【42】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【43】All authors have no financial disclosures and no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.\n\n【44】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【45】We gratefully thank Dr. Elias Y.

We report a case of pyometra detected on second-look surgery in an elderly patient with life-threatening septic shock and cardiopulmonary arrest before hospital arrival. _Case Presentation_. A 70-year-old woman with cardiopulmonary arrest received adrenaline. Computed tomography revealed ascites, and abdominal paracentesis was performed to identify the cause of cardiopulmonary arrest. The ascitic fluid was purulent, and intraperitoneal infection was identified. Emergency exploratory laparotomy revealed pyometra. _Conclusion_. If perforated, pyometra may cause peritonitis and lethal septic shock. Not only gynecologists but also emergency physicians should be aware of this possibility. Moreover, patient education is necessary. In patients with cardiopulmonary arrest, diagnostic abdominal paracentesis should be performed when the sole imaging finding is ascites. Improving outcomes in patients with difficult-to-diagnose pyometra with cardiopulmonary arrest by implementing damage control strategies before hysterectomy is possible.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pyometra is a rare condition characterized by pus accumulation due to a bacterial infection in the uterine cavity. It is caused by impaired drainage of the uterine cavity, usually due to stenosis and obstruction of the cervix and vagina. Spontaneous perforation in pyometra is rare, and its consequences are often severe, with a mortality rate of 25%–40% \\[1–3\\]. Additionally, 50% of imperforate pyometra cases are asymptomatic, which complicates the issue and makes it difficult to ensure survival of these patients.\n\n【4】Pyometra should be considered when patients present with the “classic triad of purulent vaginal discharge, postmenopausal bleeding, and lower abdominal pain” \\[4\\]. Physical findings, including fever and an abdominal mass, are often observed in patients with pyometra; however, some patients experience cardiopulmonary arrest in the absence of these.\n\n【5】A high index of suspicion is required to make an early diagnosis and provide early intervention \\[5\\]. Management options include total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, antibiotics targeting anaerobic organisms, and intensive care unit admission \\[3, 5\\]. There have been no reports on treatment strategies after resuscitation in cases where findings could not be confirmed after cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n【6】We present a case of damage control management of perforating pyometra after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in an elderly woman presenting with septic shock. Intraperitoneal infection was diagnosed by ascites puncture, and she underwent damage control surgery.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 70-year-old woman with a history of uterine fibroids was looking for an emergency hospital with a chief complaint of dysarthria, when an acquaintance found her collapsed. She could barely speak when found, and upon arrival at emergency services by ambulance, she was in cardiopulmonary arrest. Her electrocardiogram waveform showed a pulseless electrical activity. She had not received bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and ambulance crews started CPR upon arrival on the scene. After the administration of 1 mg adrenaline in the ambulance, the patient’s heartbeat resumed. Thirteen minutes passed from the confirmation of cardiac arrest (at arrival at emergency services) to the ROSC. Her bilateral pupil diameter was 4 mm, but spontaneous breathing soon resumed.\n\n【9】On arrival, her vital signs were as follows: heart rate, 72 beats/min; blood pressure, 79/35 mmHg; and body temperature, 30.8°C. Assessment of her level of consciousness using the Glasgow Coma Scale revealed eye response of 1, verbal response of 1, and motor response of 1 (E1V1M1), but the bilateral pupil diameter had reduced to 3 mm. Blood gas analysis revealed pH of 6.909, PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 80.8 mmHg, PaO<sub>2</sub> of 67.9 mmHg, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> level of 17.5 mmol/L, and lactate level of 7.0 mmol/L. On abdominal computed tomography (CT) (Figure 1), we observed ascites accumulation and fluid-containing uterine fibroids of approximately 10 cm in size.\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 1 \n\n【13】Plain computed tomography (CT) on admission showing ascites accumulation and fluid-containing uterine fibroids.\n\n【14】Figure 2 shows the patient’s clinical course, and Figure 3 shows her laboratory data after admission. We could not identify the cause of cardiopulmonary arrest; thus, the nature of the ascites detected on CT was assessed. Puncture revealed the ascites to be purulent. We suspected septic shock due to an intraperitoneal infection and decided to perform emergency laparotomy, when a large volume of purulent ascites flowed out. Based on intra-abdominal findings, we speculated that some organs in the pelvis might have been infected, but we could not find the origin in the first-look surgery.\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Figure 2 \n\n【18】Clinical course after admission. Since the patient was initially in severe septic shock, intensive care was given according to the damage control strategy. As a result, her circulatory dynamics became stable by the end of the day. NAD, noradrenaline; AD, adrenaline; OAM; open abdomen management; PMX-DHP, direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin B-immobilized fibers; HR, heart rate; MAP, mean arterial pressure; BT, body temperature.\n\n【19】  \n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Figure 3 \n\n【22】Changes in laboratory data after admission. Inflammatory parameters, renal function, and clotting ability of blood were generally stable within a week. DCS, damage control surgery; WBC, white blood cell; Plt, platelet; CRP, C-reactive protein.\n\n【23】As a damage control strategy, we only performed open abdominal drainage and did not remove the uterus. For temporary abdominal closure, we used open abdomen management (OAM) using the VAC® system (KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA), with polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column direct hemoperfusion (PMX®-DHP, Toray, Tokyo, Japan) immediately after surgery to stabilize the patient’s circulatory dynamics.\n\n【24】Twelve hours after the patient’s circulatory dynamics stabilized, we performed second-look surgery and again washed out the intra-abdominal cavity. On re-examining the uterus, we found a pore of approximately 1 cm at the top of the fibroid on the dorsal side and continuous discharge of pus. We judged the cause to be sepsis and immediately removed the uterus, with gauze packing to control oozing from the bottom of the pelvis. The small intestine was ischemic; hence, we again performed OAM for temporary abdominal closure (Figure 4).\n\n【25】  \n\n【26】  \n\n【27】Figure 4 \n\n【28】Operative findings on second-look surgery, with a pale small intestine, indicating that it might become ischemic (circle).\n\n【29】We closed the abdomen on day 5 after the first damage control surgery. The patient’s vital signs stabilized, and her inflammatory parameters improved and, finally, so did her level of consciousness.\n\n【30】Pathological findings (Figure 5) included a fibroma with abscess formation, peritonitis, adenomyosis, endometrial polyp, and endometrial stromal nodule of the uterine corpus. Examination of the uterus for pyometra revealed yellowish fragile areas with necrosis or abscess formation (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). No malignancy was identified on histological examination (Figure 5(c)), suggesting a fibroma with inflammatory cell infiltration. Both blood and ascites cultures were positive for _Peptostreptococcus micros_, an anaerobic bacterium.\n\n【31】  \n\n【32】  \n\n【33】Figure 5 \n\n【34】Pathological findings. (a) Appearance of pyometra. (b) A solid white mass of approximately 10 cm in size, and yellowish fragile areas with necrosis or abscess formation in the mass (circles). (c) Histologically, there was no obvious malignancy. There were few positive findings of smooth muscle markers (SMA, Caldesmon) using immunostaining. Deposition of collagen fiber bundles was relatively prominent in the stroma, and a flower bud-like array was recognized. These findings suggested that this mass was a fibroma rather than a leiomyoma. An abscess with massive neutrophil infiltration was present in the mass, and the surrounding serosal surface showed inflammatory cell infiltration with fibrin deposition. (d) A large mass of Gram-positive bacteria (arrowheads) was found inside the abscess.\n\n【35】Soon after, the patient developed urinary tract infection due to right ureteral calculi, and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was performed. On day 146, she was transferred to another hospital for rehabilitation for hypoxic encephalopathy.\n\n【36】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【37】Pyometra may cause peritonitis and lethal septic shock if intraperitoneal perforation occurs. Causes of pyometra include malignant or benign gynecologic tumors, radiation cervicitis, atrophic cervicitis with aging, and intrauterine devices \\[6–8\\]. In our patient, pyometra was due to her history of uterine fibroids, which are among the commonest tumors in women, most being followed up.\n\n【38】An aging population suggests that cases of pyometra will increase. Pyometra is usually a chronic disease with a good prognosis, but sometimes it may burst into the peritoneal cavity. In such cases, it may cause generalized peritonitis and has a poor prognosis. Because of the nonspecific symptoms associated with rupture, an accurate diagnosis is often challenging. This can cause a delay in identifying the source of infection, which results in delayed removal of the infection source.\n\n【39】Therefore, not only gynecologists but also emergency physicians should be aware that the perforation of pyometra can be a cause of abdominal pain in elderly women \\[9\\]. However, it is also necessary to educate patients about uterine fibroids and about the fact that, in rare cases, they may develop infections that could prove fatal.\n\n【40】As in our case, pyometra is often diagnosed based on findings, including fever, abdominal pain, and abdominal mass. In contrast, there is a report on a patient in whom pyometra could not be confirmed from findings, including those after resuscitation \\[7\\]. A common treatment for pyometra is transvaginal uterine washing; however, in the case of perforation, intraperitoneal irrigation drainage by laparotomy, total hysterectomy, and superior uterotomy are preferred \\[2\\].\n\n【41】A report has suggested that removal of uterine necrosis, closure of the perforation, and transabdominal uterine drainage without total uterine removal can save the patient’s life \\[10\\], but, in most previous cases, total hysterectomy has been selected because of its better outcome \\[3\\]. Currently, no standard treatment strategy has been reported, and there are no clear criteria to select a damage control strategy for atraumatic patients. However, in the most severe instances, the patient may benefit from a damage control strategy \\[11\\]. In our case, we were unaware of the fact that her primary care doctor had previously detected a pyometra. It took over 10 minutes to resuscitate the patient; thus, we thought that it would be difficult to save her life, especially that her hemodynamics on arrival were unstable. Therefore, we judged that open abdominal drainage was sufficient for source control.\n\n【42】We suggest that if even a slight improvement in the neurological prognosis is anticipated—similar to that observed in our patient—aggressive treatment, including searching for the cause and surgery, should be considered. Abdominal echography or CT should be performed to identify the cause, followed by ascites puncture when ascites is confirmed. If ascites puncture identifies an intraperitoneal infection, abscess drainage by opening is a reasonable strategy for source control \\[12\\] and can be performed as a damage control surgery.\n\n【43】Spending time searching for the cause of the intraperitoneal infection after resuscitation and continuing with primary curative surgery will likely result in failure of circulatory dynamics. After stabilizing the patient’s circulatory dynamics in the intensive care unit, it is possible to identify the cause by examining the intra-abdominal cavity in second-look surgery. Our patient survived because of hysterectomy performed to treat pyometra, which was determined to be the cause of the life-threatening septic shock at second-look surgery. If a damage control strategy is undertaken, as reported here, outcomes of patients with difficult-to-diagnose pyometra who experience cardiopulmonary arrest may improve.\n\n【44】#### Data Availability\n\n【45】The data used to support this study are restricted to protect patient privacy.\n\n【46】#### Consent\n\n【47】This patient consented to the reporting of this case in a scientific publication.\n\n【48】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【49】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.\n\n【50】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【51】The authors would like to thank Editage (http://www.editage.jp) for English language editing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

A 72-year-old woman was diagnosed as having primary lung cancer (cT1N0M0 stage IA) in the right upper lobe and was treated with SBRT of 48 Gy in 4 fractions. After 12 months, mass-like consolidation appeared around the irradiated area, and after 13 months, it had increased in size. FDG-PET revealed high uptake (SUV m a x \\= 5 . 6 1 ) for the consolidation. CT-guided biopsy was performed, but we could not confirm the diagnosis. Considering her poor respiratory function and her age, short-interval follow-up was performed. After 15 months, the consolidation enlarged at the dorsal side, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) became elevated (14.6 ng/mL). Serum KL-6 (436 U/mL) and SP-D (204 ng/mL) were also elevated. However, after 16 months, serum CEA slightly decreased. The consolidation gradually retracted on follow-up CT images. CEA, KL-6, and SP-D were also decreased by degrees. After 40 months, there is no evidence of local recurrence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an effective therapy for early-stage lung cancer. In some cases after SBRT, dense consolidation is observed over or around the tumors on follow-up computed tomography (CT). Sometimes, it appears as mass-like consolidation, in which case it is difficult to distinguish radiation fibrosis from local recurrence, though it is important from a clinical point of view to make this distinction.\n\n【4】We experienced a case of radiation fibrosis appearing as mass-like consolidation with elevation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which was difficult to distinguish from local recurrence. In this paper, we present this case along with a review of the literature.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 72-year-old woman was diagnosed as having primary lung cancer (cT1N0M0 stage_Ⅰ_A) of the right upper lobe (Figure 1). Because her respiratory function was not sufficient for her to undergo surgical resection, she was treated with SBRT. Irradiation was performed with a 4-MV and 10-MV linear accelerator. Forty-eight Gy in 4 fractions was prescribed at the isocenter with multiple static ports. The isodose distribution of SBRT is shown in Figure 2. Serum CEA was elevated to 14.7 n/mL, but serum KL-6 (230 U/mL) and SP-D (72.8 ng/mL) were not elevated before SBRT. She was a heavy smoker, and her Brinkman index was 900 ( 2 0 × 4 5 years).\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| CT images before SBRT showing a solitary lung tumor in the right upper lobe. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】| Dose distribution of treatment plan.

On CT images 2 months after treatment, irregularly shaped patchy consolidation, which was considered radiation pneumonitis, appeared in the irradiated field (Figure 3(a)). After 6 and 9 months, the patchy consolidation was retracted, which was considered to be typical radiation fibrosis (Figures 3(b), 3(c)), and serum CEA gradually decreased. However, after 12 months, mass-like consolidation appeared around the irradiated area (Figure 3(d)), and after 13 months, it had increased in size. Because ecstatic air-containing bronchi were not observed within the consolidation, and the 3b branch of the right lung was displaced on CT images, the possibility of local recurrence was considered. At this time, serum CEA, KL-6, and SP-D were not elevated compared with the previous values. FDG-PET revealed high uptake (SUV m a x \\= 5 . 6 1 ) for the consolidation (Figure 4). CT-guided biopsy was performed. The result of cytology was class II, and histologically cancer cells were not detected. Because there was no definite evidence of malignancy, and considering her poor respiratory function and her age, short-interval follow-up was performed.\n\n【17】  \n**(a)**\n\n【18】  \n**(b)**\n\n【19】  \n**(c)**\n\n【20】  \n**(d)**\n\n【21】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【22】Figure 3 \n\n【23】| Serial CT images after SBRT.

Furthermore, the consolidation gradually retracted on follow-up CT images (Figure 5). CEA, KL-6, and SP-D decreased by degrees (Figure 6), although transient re-elevation was observed after 31 months, accompanied by the development of pneumonia in the left lower lung.

Discussion\n\n【40】On CT images, parenchymal consolidation with a straight lateral margin and air bronchograms is typical for radiation fibrosis, whereas a homogeneous opacity without air bronchograms and with a convex border is strongly suggestive of recurrent tumor in the irradiated lung \\[1\\]. In addition, the filling in of bronchi within radiation fibrosis is abnormal and usually represents local recurrent malignancy or a superimposed infection \\[2\\]. Koenig et al. firstly described as mass-like radiation fibrosis related to 3-D conformal radiotherapy \\[3\\]. Mass-like radiation fibrosis in their cases was accompanied by volume loss and bronchiectasis. However, in our case, neither volume loss nor bronchiectasis was observed at the presence of mass-like consolidation. Therefore, it was difficult to differentially diagnose this mass-like consolidation as radiation fibrosis from local recurrence. Aoki et al. \\[4\\] reported patchy consolidation or discrete consolidation in 74% of cases during the first 6 months after SBRT. In SBRT, the shape of the dose distribution with a lower dose tended to become large and irregular, while a higher dose could be concentrated uniformly on the tumor. Matsuo et al. \\[5\\] reported that mass-like consolidation appeared in 27 (68%) of 40 tumors treated with SBRT. Of these 27 mass-like consolidations, 24 were radiation-induced lung injuries (RILI) and 3 were local recurrences. According to the previous reports mentioned above, it is not uncommon for mass-like consolidation to appear after SBRT. In conventional radiation therapy, the shape of the dose distribution of irradiated lungs is simple, and the boundary between the nonirradiated and irradiated lung is usually distinct \\[4\\]. In contrast, in SBRT, multiple non coplanar portals with various directions were used. And the dose distribution usually has a 3-D shape and concentrates around the tumor. Therefore, radiation fibrosis after SBRT can appear in a 3-D shape, and is sometimes observed as mass-like lesions. In our case, also, the consolidation after SBRT had a 3-D shape, and was observed in approximately 50% or more of the isodose area.\n\n【41】Matsuo et al. \\[5\\] also reported that mass-like consolidations appeared at a median of 5 months (range, 2 to 9 months) after SBRT. The time to the appearance of the mass-like consolidations after SBRT was 2 to 9 months (median, 5 months) in RILI cases and 4 to 7 months (median, 7 months) in local recurrence cases. There was no significant difference in the time to appearance between RILI and local recurrence. According to their report, the size of the mass-like consolidations did not increase in any RILI cases after 12 months or later. In our case, however, the mass-like consolidation appeared at 12 months after SBRT, and had increased in size at 13 months. Radiation fibrosis can appear as mass-like consolidation even 12 months or more after the completion of SBRT.\n\n【42】In our case, serum CEA was also elevated in addition to the mass-like consolidation. The CEA elevation and the late appearance of the mass-like consolidation made it very difficult to differentially diagnose this condition as RILI from local recurrence. Several authors have reported that CEA elevation is observed in patients with various pulmonary inflammations such as acute pneumonia, chronic bronchitis, bronchial asthma, especially in cases with mucoid impaction, and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia \\[6–9\\]. In our case, after 31 months, transient and slight re-elevation of serum CEA was seen, accompanied by the elevation of serum KL-6 and SP-D. CT examination at this time revealed minimal lung opacities, suggesting the presence of pneumonia in the left lower lobe, but no significant change in the irradiated area. This finding also suggested that the transient CEA elevation after SBRT was related to inflammatory changes of the lung in this case. The serum CEA level of smokers has been reported to be higher than that of nonsmokers \\[9\\]. CEA secretion from pulmonary epithelial cells has been considered to be influenced by smoking \\[10\\]. This patient was a heavy smoker, and serum CEA did not decrease to its normal level after SBRT. The elevation of the serum CEA level before SBRT may have been caused not only by the tumor but also by heavy smoking.\n\n【43】Serum KL-6 and SP-D are useful serum markers of inflammatory lung diseases, typically interstitial pneumonia \\[11\\]. It has also been reported that KL-6 and SP-D can become elevated in some cases of adenocarcinoma \\[12\\]. In our case, however, serum KL-6 and SP-D levels were not elevated before SBRT. Also, serial changes of these serum marker levels were almost synchronous with the radiological change of the consolidation after SBRT and that following pneumonia in the left lower lung. Therefore, the changes in the serum KL-6 and SP-D levels after SBRT were considered to reflect the severity of the pulmonary inflammation rather than the progression of cancer.\n\n【44】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【45】We experienced a case of radiation fibrosis appearing as mass-like consolidation after SBRT with the elevation of serum CEA, which was difficult to distinguish from local recurrence. If it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis by further examination including FDG-PET and histological examination, short-interval follow-up should be recommended.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In this report, we present a 27-year-old male patient with a mediastinal bronchogenic cyst together with clinical presentation and management of the pathology.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cystic lesions may occur in the mediastinum; however, they are rare. They can have pericardial, enteric origin or bronchogenic origin in most of the cases \\[1, 2\\]. Usually the patients are asymptomatic, and when the lesion leads to symptoms, since it was first reported in 1959 by Meyer \\[3\\], the standard therapy is the resection of cyst. The literature seldom reveals reports of intrapericardial bronchogenic cysts.\n\n【4】Here, we report clinical presentation and management of a mediastinal bronchogenic cyst in a 27-year-old patient.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】The patient was a 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with dyspnea and swelling of his face and neck when he lay down. He complained of recent faint attacks in the last few weeks. Physical examination, chest radiography, and blood analysis were found to be normal. An echocardiography showed mild diastolic dysfunction and a cysts-like structure inside the pericardial cavity. The computerized tomography (CT) confirmed 8 × 7 cm cystic structure situated between the aortic arch and right pulmonary artery (Figure 1). We decided to surgically remove the mass lesion to treat myocardial diastolic dysfunction and for an accurate histopathologic diagnosis after the consent of the patient.\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】The computerized tomography of the patient showing 8 × 7 cm cystic structure situated above the right ventricle between the aortic arch and right pulmonary artery.\n\n【11】Following standard median sternotomy, the pericardium was opened and 8 × 7 cm in diameter cystic structure was detected (Figure 2). After mobilizing the cyst from the right atrium, aorta, and the right pulmonary artery, it could be _en bloc_ resected (Figure 3). The cyst was removed from the operating table to another table and cut. Yellow, jelly-like liquid was drained. Specimens for microbiology and histopatologic examination were obtained. A frozen section excluded malignancy and indicated a benign cystic lesion of bronchogenic origin. The cavity left after the removal of the cyst was covered with pericardium and the operation was finished uneventfully.\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】Perioperative view of the cyst.\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】Resected cystic lesion.\n\n【20】The patient was taken to the intensive care unit and weaned off mechanic ventilation in 6 hours. He was taken to the ward next day and discharged from the hospital on the postoperative 5th day. Microbiologic examination ended sterile and bronchogenic cyst diagnosis was confirmed with detailed histopathologic examination. The patient is followed regularly for more than 1 year at the outpatient clinic, and he was found to be asymptomatic throughout the followup period.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】Bronchogenic cysts are rare congenital lesions. They emerge due to abnormal development of the foregut which develops in a blind-end, fluid-filled pouch \\[4\\]. Although they are mostly located in the mediastinum, they may also occur in the lungs, diaphragm, retroperitoneum, pericardium, thymus, and neck \\[5\\]. Within the mediastinum, they are mainly situated at the subcarinal and right paratracheal regions \\[6\\]. Cases of intrapericardial and intracardiac bronchogenic cysts are very seldom in the literature \\[7\\]. Limaïem et al. reported an incidence of 1 case per 42,000 patients in the North American population \\[8\\].\n\n【23】Bronchogenic cysts usually do not cause symptoms and patients are mostly detected incidentally \\[5\\]. Very rarely, nonspecific symptoms such as retrosternal chest pain, dyspnea, cough, fever, and hoarseness may be present \\[6\\]. However, a huge cyst can provoke arterial compression, compression of the main bronchus and superior vena cava \\[5\\]. Although adults with cysts are usually symptomatic \\[5\\], in children they can cause symptoms due to the compression of the adjacent structures. Clinical findings such as cardiac murmur and electrocardiographic changes are described in a few cases in the literature \\[6\\].\n\n【24】Bronchogenic cysts are sacs filled with fluid. The radiologic diagnosis may be difficult because of air-fluid level or variable protein content as in case of an infection \\[5, 9\\]. As in our case, computerized tomography aids in preoperative diagnosis; however, differentiation between infections such as hydatid disease, a malignancy, or for the exact origin (i.e., pericardial, enteric, bronchogenic, or others) of the cyst can only be made with resection material and detailed histopathologic examination.\n\n【25】St-Georges et al. analyzed a collection of 86 resections of bronchogenic cysts. Their analysis revealed that 82% (the majority) of the patients became either symptomatic or complicated due to fistulization, ulceration, and infection in time \\[5\\]. McGlynn Jr. et al. reported that the cysts could even imitate an acute coronary syndrome \\[10\\]. Moreover, there are a few reports in the literature indicating malignancy potential of bronchogenic cysts, such as converting into large cell carcinoma \\[11\\], bronchoalveolar carcinoma \\[12\\], adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma \\[13\\].\n\n【26】In conclusion, due to the proximity of the vital structures, surgical treatment is an approved, useful, and safe procedure with low complication rates for the treatment of bronchogenic cysts \\[14\\]. Considering the risk of complications and even malignancy, bronchogenic cysts require resection and should be performed when they are diagnosed.\n\n【27】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【28】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It was subsequently found that the SFT had metastasized to the brain by additional pathology, and not the predicted adenocarcinoma. SFTs are a rare mesenchymal neoplasm that accounts for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors. SFTs most commonly arise in the thoracic cavity, but are frequently found in various locations throughout the body, and rarely metastasize to the brain. This case highlights that rare neoplasms, such as SFT, should not be ruled out as a potential cause of metastasis. Due to the rarity of this clinical situation, we also provide a review and discussion of previously reported SFT cases and the use of postoperative radiation therapy. The optimal treatment for individual patients remains unclear in this unique situation. Surgical resection followed by adjuvant Gamma Knife radiation therapy to the surgical bed appears to be a safe option for local treatment of SFT in select patients. Further studies are needed of this rare clinical situation in order to better understand and optimize future treatments for patients with SFT and metastasis to the brain.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】We present a unique case of a patient with simultaneously diagnosed solitary fibrous tumor of the lung and adenocarcinoma of the lung, and who was later found to have a single solitary fibrous tumor metastasis to the brain. This patient underwent surgical resection for the brain metastasis followed by Gamma Knife treatment to the surgical cavity. At this time, there are no other reported cases in the literature with this specific course of treatment for the single brain metastasis from solitary fibrous tumor pathology.\n\n【4】Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs) are rare mesenchymal neoplasms that account for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors \\[1\\]. SFTs are most commonly benign, but 10–20% of cases have been reported to be malignant. SFTs usually occur in middle-aged patients and equally in men and women \\[2\\]. The most common sites for metastasis are the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%) \\[3\\]. SFT has a low reported incidence of metastasis to the brain, especially low when compared to lung adenocarcinoma \\[4\\].\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】The patient is a 70-year-old male Navy veteran who served on the Mekong in Vietnam for 14 months, during which time he reports that he was exposed to Agent Orange. He has a previous history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass grafting in 2015, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from tobacco.\n\n【7】He presented with progressive shortness of breath and underwent a workup with CT scan of the chest without contrast, which revealed two distinct appearing tumors, one in the right upper lobe with a tumor size of 1.5 cm and another in the right lower lung with a tumor size of 13 cm (see Figures 1 and 2). He underwent a right upper lobe wedge resection and a right lower lobectomy for these tumors. Pathology revealed two distinct neoplasms. The right upper lobe tumor was a moderately differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, stage pT2a (see Figure 3). Pathology revealed focal invasion of the visceral pleura, confirmed by elastic stain.\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Noncontrast CT chest, coronal view. Visible is a 1.5 cm tumor mass in the right upper lobe of the lung.\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】Noncontrast CT chest, coronal view. Visible is a 13.0 × 12.8 × 7.5 cm tumor mass in the right lower lobe of the lung.\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, low-power 100x view of adenocarcinoma. Tumor shows an acinar growth pattern.\n\n【20】The pathology of the right lower lobe tumor was a SFT. This tumor showed a fascicular pattern of spindled cells with elongated nuclei (see Figure 4). The mitotic rate was significantly elevated at 13 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields (see Figure 5). Multiple fields of necrosis were also identified. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, which revealed reactivity for CD34 and Bcl-2. The tumor was negative for pancytokeratin. This tumor did not extend beyond the lung parenchyma. A routine sampling of the right lower paratracheal (4R), subcarinal (7), paraesophageal (8), and right hilar (10R) lymph nodes was negative for metastatic disease from either tumor. The surgical margins were negative for tumor in both cases. Thus, no additional therapy was recommended at that time. He was followed with clinical visits and imaging studies.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 4 \n\n【24】Hematoxylin and Eosin, low-power 100x view of solitary fibrous tumor.

Four mitotic figures identified within a single high-power field.\n\n【29】The patient did well over the next 15 months. However, a restaging CT chest with contrast showed multiple new pulmonary tumors. Shortly after this CT scan was performed, he presented with mild right leg weakness. MRI of the brain showed a solitary 2.5 cm enhancing mass of the left posterior frontal lobe, just anterior to the motor cortex, with extensive surrounding edema (see Figures 6 and 7). The timing of his new symptoms and the imaging findings were consistent with a metastatic brain lesion.\n\n【30】  \n\n【31】  \n\n【32】Figure 6 \n\n【33】T1 postgadolinium MRI brain with axial view.

The brain resection pathology revealed a malignant solitary fibrous tumor. It appeared similar to the SFT resected from the lung. It was comprised of spindled cells with storiform and haphazard arrangement. The tumor matrix was predominantly myxoid, and the cells were fed by a rich vascular network of small slit-like vessels and large ectatic branching vessels (see Figure 10). The tumor showed immunoreactivity for CD34, Bcl-2, and STAT-6. The Ki-67 proliferation index approached 30%. His case was discussed at the regional multidisciplinary brain tumor board where the consensus recommends radiosurgery. He underwent single fraction Gamma Knife radiosurgery to the tumor cavity with a prescription dose of 22 Gy to the 50% isodose line (see Figure 11). His weakness subsequently resolved.\n\n【39】  \n\n【40】  \n\n【41】Figure 8 \n\n【42】Postresection, T1 postgadolinium MRI brain with axial view.

He was prescribed systemic treatment with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and Alimta and tolerated systemic therapy well but does continue to have generalized weakness, generalized dyspnea on exertion, and a chronic dry cough. At the time of this report, it has been 16 months since the Gamma Knife treatment and he has not developed subsequent recurrence of brain metastasis. He continues to receive treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\n【56】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【57】This is an unusual case of routine adenocarcinoma of the lung, but also SFT of the lung. Furthermore, the patient developed a symptomatic solitary brain metastasis from the SFT, not the lung adenocarcinoma, even more unusual and unexpected.\n\n【58】SFTs are rare mesenchymal neoplasms that account for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors \\[1\\], first reported in the literature by Wagner in 1870 \\[5\\]. SFTs were originally thought to only arise in the thoracic cavity, but it is now known that while most SFTs are intrathoracic and usually from the pleura, these tumors are frequently found in various locations throughout the body \\[6, 7\\]. Peritoneal cavities, usually the retroperitoneum or pelvic soft tissue, are the primary site of origin in 30% of SFTs \\[8, 9\\]. 20% occur in the head and neck, the meninges, or extracranial locations \\[10–12\\]. These can include the sinonasal tract, oral cavity, and orbit \\[13–15\\]. There have also been cases of SFT arising from the extremities and bone as well as very few reported from the abdominal wall \\[16–18\\]. SFTs are most commonly benign, but 10–20% of cases have been reported to be malignant. SFTs usually occur in middle-aged patients and equally in men and women \\[2\\]. The most common sites for metastasis are the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%) \\[3\\]. SFT has a low reported incidence of metastasis to the brain, especially low when compared to lung adenocarcinoma \\[4\\].\n\n【59】SFTs are usually considered chemoresistant; therefore, localized treatments with surgery or radiation therapy are the most common modalities used. Initially, surgery is most effective, and tumor removal with negative margins of 1 to 2 cm, if possible, is recommended. Complete surgical resection of localized lesions is thought to be important for optimal outcomes \\[3\\]. Though the literature is inconclusive about the most effective use, radiotherapy is a good adjuvant treatment before or after surgery in more complex conditions, such as in the case of an incomplete resection or if the tumor is inoperable. We have previously published clinical outcomes after radiosurgery or whole brain radiation for brain metastasis of various histologic types \\[19, 20\\]. Radiation therapy is especially utilized in cases with malignant SFT, narrow margins, tumor size greater than 10 cm, and fast-growing tumors \\[2\\]. For example, in an analysis of 102 SFT cases, Krengli et al. reported that local control was higher in patients who were treated with surgery plus postoperative radiation therapy when compared to surgery alone \\[21\\]. If the tumor has metastasized, adjuvant radiation therapy and sometimes chemotherapy are also used. However, Duranti et al. summarized their treatment of 337 patients with localized thoracic soft tissue sarcoma, where 51% received adjuvant radiotherapy and 41% received postoperative chemotherapy, and concluded the patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy presented with better local control than those who received adjuvant chemotherapy alone \\[22\\].\n\n【60】When compared to brain metastasis from adenocarcinoma, brain metastasis from SFT is significantly less common. In a study of 16,210 patients with brain metastasis, the authors reported that brain metastasis from lung cancers (19.9%) occurs more frequently when compared to other types of cancer, such as melanoma (6.9%), renal (6.5%), breast (5.1%), and colorectal (1.8%) \\[4\\]. Another study reported similar outcomes with a higher incidence of brain metastasis in lung cancer (16.3%) when compared to renal carcinoma (9.8%), melanoma (7.4%), breast carcinoma (5.0%), and colorectal carcinoma (1.2%) \\[23\\]. Of lung cancers, a study of 485 cases of patients with lung cancer by Villano et al. reported that the highest occurrence of brain metastasis was from adenocarcinomas \\[24\\]. In addition, in a 2018 study of 373 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung, brain metastasis was reported to be one of the most common sites of distant metastasis and have a significantly higher rate of brain metastasis than other types of non-small-cell lung cancer \\[25\\]. The relatively high metastatic rate to the brain from adenocarcinoma of the lung is historically documented in that a study published in 1988 reported brain metastasis in 28% of their 259 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung \\[26\\].\n\n【61】SFT has a much lower incidence of brain metastasis than adenocarcinoma. In a study of 139 patients with SFT (49 of which had metastases), O’Neill et al. reported that the most common sites of metastasis were the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%). Only 8 of their 49 patients with metastases had brain metastases. The authors report that 5 patients had multiple brain metastases while 3 patients had single brain metastases. Six of the patients with brain metastases had tumors located extraaxially, 1 had extraaxially, and 1 had both extraaxially and intraaxially. The metastases were hypervascular in half of the patients, and the largest diameter was 1.4 cm (range, 0.5–2.8 cm). O’Neill et al. stated that brain metastases were most commonly from head and neck primary SFT, as seen in 5 patients, but also arose from 2 patients with thoracic SFT and 1 with abdominal SFT \\[3\\]. Very few brain metastases from SFT have been reported in the literature.\n\n【62】Surgical excision generally yields a good prognosis for most SFT patients, as seen in a study by Gold et al. of 75 patients with SFTs in a wide range of anatomic sites. The authors reported that the factors predicting worse prognosis include positive surgical margins, large tumor size greater than 10 cm, and the presence of a histologically malignant component \\[1\\]. Another study by van Houdt et al. similarly found that the variables most correlated with local recurrence and worse prognosis overall included positive resection margin, tumor size greater than 10 cm, and high mitosis rate. Five years after surgical resection of the 81 patients they followed, overall survival was 84%, local recurrence rate was 29%, and metastasis rate was 34% \\[27\\]. Franzen et al. also emphasized the importance of a high mitotic index in recurrence and worse prognosis after following 42 SFT patients \\[28\\]. A study by Tapias et al. reviews 59 patients with surgical treatment of SFT of the pleura (SFTP), one of the most common anatomical locations of SFT, to propose a score that can help predict recurrence of SFTP and guide postoperative surveillance. They report that their scoring system was better at predicting malignant behavior and recurrence than some other scores, such as England’s criteria or de Perrot staging. Their predictive score focuses on factors including mitotic activity, necrosis, sessile morphology, presence of hypercellularity, and size \\[29\\]. However, Franzen et al. in their study found the factors of tumor necrosis and sessile morphology to be statistically insignificant \\[28\\].\n\n【63】Localized treatment for primary tumor typically consists of surgery with or without radiotherapy for SFT. SFT can be chemoresistant, or chemotherapy may have inconsistent effects in some patients, but a study at MD Anderson concludes that conventional chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin-based therapy, gemcitabine-based therapy, and paclitaxel, can be helpful in controlling or stabilizing locally advanced and metastatic SFT \\[30\\]. Another study at MD Anderson reported that combination therapy with temozolomide and bevacizumab was well tolerated and almost as beneficial as surgery \\[31\\]. However, surgical excision still remains the treatment of choice. van Houdt et al. reported the factor most significantly correlated with local recurrence is the positive resection margin with a hazard ratio of 4.8 (confidence interval 95%) \\[27\\]. Compared to patients with a negative margin, patients with a positive resection margin have a statistically significant higher risk of local recurrence. In a study of 220 cases reported of intracranial and intraspinal SFT, Bisceglia et al. recommends surgery as the main treatment as well as stereotactic and external beam radiotherapy for unresectable tumors and some cases of postsurgical tumor remnants \\[32\\]. Adjuvant radiotherapy is also often used for cases with extensive external invasion. In a very recent study, Bishop et al. reviewed 31 patients treated for SFT in multiple anatomic sites using both surgery and radiation therapy and reported 5-year rates of local control, overall survival, and distant metastatic-free survival as 100%, 95%, and 92%, respectively \\[33\\]. In another very recent study including 14 SFT patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy, Jia et al. also recommends adjuvant radiotherapy to lower recurrence rate \\[34\\].\n\n【64】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【65】We present a unique case of a patient with simultaneously diagnosed solitary fibrous tumor of the right lung and adenocarcinoma of the right lung, and who was later found to have a solitary fibrous tumor metastasis to the brain with a single left frontal lobe lesion. This patient received neurosurgical resection for the brain metastasis followed by Gamma Knife treatment to the surgical cavity. At this time, there are no other reported cases with this specific course of treatment for the single brain metastasis from solitary fibrous tumor pathology.

Clinical features are heterogeneous and include fever, respiratory compromise, mucocutaneous involvement with conjunctival abnormalities and erythematous exanthem, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Neurologic and cardiovascular symptoms can also develop, including coronary artery dilatation. Some cases involve 2 or more organs and require critical admission. Echocardiography is the mainstay of cardiac evaluation in the acute setting as well as on outpatient follow-up. We present the case of a 4-month-old female with no past medical or surgical history who presented with a prolonged febrile syndrome associated with severe respiratory illness, gastrointestinal symptoms, and mucocutaneous abnormalities. Diagnosis of MIS-C was established based on clinical findings, persistently elevated markers of systemic inflammation and positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test and evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection with SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive. Echocardiogram evidenced myopericarditis and coronary aneurysms and patient was deemed candidate for immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), resulting in favorable clinical and paraclinical outcomes. Few cases of giant coronary aneurysms have been reported in children. There are no existing literature reports about coronary thrombosis or thrombus formation resulting from vascular aneurysmal dilations in this population. As such, the prognosis and natural history of coronary artery aneurysms in the setting of MIS-C remain largely unknown.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】COVID-19, initially known as a cause of severe acute respiratory syndrome, has represented a major challenge for those working in pediatric healthcare, where a great diversity of clinical manifestations has been documented. During the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first observational studies showed that most children were asymptomatic \\[1\\] or were not severely affected \\[2\\].\n\n【4】However, in the United Kingdom in April 2020, a potentially fatal hyperinflammatory condition was first described. This condition shared clinical characteristics with incomplete Kawasaki disease, toxic shock syndrome, and macrophage activation syndrome, consistent of a febrile syndrome associated with mucocutaneous involvement, polymorphic rash, edema and erythema on palms and soles, coronary involvement, and elevation of inflammatory markers \\[3–5\\]. This condition called Multisystemic Inflammatory Syndrome in children (MIS-C) is recognized as a complication that generally develops 4 to 6 weeks after infection by SARS-CoV-2 \\[1\\], a situation suggesting that the virus may be a trigger for genetically predisposed individuals. 53–80% of them did not show positivity in the polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR), but the vast majority, from 75% to 90%, had serological positivity IgG or an epidemiological link with the infection \\[1, 6\\].\n\n【5】The overall proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection presenting with MIS-C is largely unknown. Most patients do not have past medical conditions and the mean age of presentation is around 8 years \\[1\\]. Its clinical manifestations include fever, respiratory involvement in 30–70%, mucocutaneous involvement in 74%, conjunctival changes in 45–54%, erythematous rash in 52–62%, in addition, gastrointestinal manifestations such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea in 53–92%, neurological and cardiovascular symptoms in 80%. 71–90% of patients presented involvement of more than 2 organs and half of the patients require admission to the intensive care unit during their hospital stay \\[6–8\\].\n\n【6】Cardiac complications are significant, with more than 80% of patients presenting cardiac involvement and around 10% to 40% of cases developing alterations in the coronary arteries. Among those most documented include coronary hyperechogenicity and with a lower incidence, true coronary aneurysm \\[5, 6\\] which if not timely treated, could lead to fatal outcomes. Coronary artery aneurysm is a rare clinical entity defined by an abnormal focal dilatation of a coronary artery exceeding the adjacent normal segment in diameter by at least 1.5-fold \\[9\\]. The size threshold for a small aneurysm is defined by _Z_ score ≥2.5 to <5, medium aneurysm with a _Z_ score ≥5 to <10, and a giant aneurysm with a _Z_ score ≥10 or ≥8 mm in diameter \\[10\\].\n\n【7】Echocardiography is the cornerstone for evaluation of cardiac involvement in the acute phase and during follow-up. The most common findings include left ventricular dysfunction and abnormalities in coronary arteries including dilatation. Reports of giant aneurysmal alterations are not common and to date there is no information on the presence of thrombi in coronary dilatations developed in association with this condition.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Clinical Case\n\n【9】A 4-month-old female patient presented with fever. She had no significant clinical history, weighing 8 kg (ideal 6.9 kg), height 64 cm, cephalic circumference 41 cm, BMI 19.5 and nutritional classification: _P_/_T Z_ score: 1.65 Overweight risk, _T_/_E Z_ score: 0.05 appropriate, BMI _Z_ score: 1.63 Overweight risk, PC _Z_ score: -0.31 Normal. She was admitted with a prolonged febrile syndrome of 15 days, associated with severe respiratory symptoms, liquid stools, and nonpurulent bilateral conjunctival injection. Given persistence of fever, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR), and a positive molecular test for SARS-CoV-2, further laboratory analyses were significant for leukocytosis and thrombocytosis, elevated D-dimer, elevated pro-BNP, and evidence of previous infection as indicated by positive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (Table 1). As an epidemiologic link to SARS-CoV-2 infection, she had contact with her grandfather who died from COVID-19. During physical examination, she had sustained tachycardia as a sign of low output, no hypotension, and appropriate respiratory pattern without requiring ventilator or vasoactive support, without neurological involvement.\n\n【10】Table 1 \n\n【11】Lab tests.\n\n【12】Clinical and laboratory findings met WHO criteria for MIS-C. Despite the timeframe of the febrile condition and considering the laboratory findings, immunomodulatory therapy with intravenous (2 g/kg) was indicated along with aspirin (ASA) in anti-inflammatory dosage (50 mg/kg) in addition to anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (1 mg/kg) according to the recommendations described in the literature to date. A first echocardiogram demonstrated appropriate left ventricular contractility, with myopericarditis and aneurysmal dilatations of the left and right coronary arteries (Table 2). Electrocardiogram showed ST segment elevation in three continuous leads, a pattern suggestive of myocarditis.\n\n【13】Table 2 \n\n【14】Echocardiograms.\n\n【15】Two days after starting immunomodulation with IVIG, the fever resolved, so corticosteroid treatment was not deemed necessary. She presented an appropriate clinical response, was discharged from the PICU 10 days later, and was discharged from the hospital 11 days after admission with anticoagulant therapy that she was already receiving in the hospital (1 mg/kg) and ASA in antiplatelet dose; she still receives treatment to date.T\n\n【16】Echocardiograms performed during follow-up showed dilatation of the left cardiac chambers and persistence of aneurysmal dilatations. This led to a cardiac catheterization carried out 7 months after the onset of the inflammatory condition. A finding of an aneurysm in the middle third of the right coronary artery was described, measuring 9.43 mm × 5.8 mm with an image of intracoronary thrombus occupying 2/3 of the aneurysmal lumen. There was also evidence of an aneurysm in the circumflex artery, measuring 5.9 mm × 5.3 mm without evidence of thrombus (Figures 1–4).\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Figure 1 \n\n【20】Cardiac catheterization: Aneurysm in the middle third of the right coronary artery, measuring 9.43 mm × 5.8 mm with an image of intracoronary thrombus occupying 2/3 of the aneurysmal lumen.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 2 \n\n【24】Cardiac catheterization: Aneurysm in the right coronary artery, with an image of intracoronary thrombus.\n\n【25】  \n\n【26】  \n\n【27】Figure 3 \n\n【28】Cardiac catheterization: Intracoronary thrombus occupying 2/3 of the aneurysmal lumen in the middle third of the right coronary artery.\n\n【29】  \n\n【30】  \n\n【31】Figure 4 \n\n【32】Cardiac catheterization: Aneurysm in the circumflex artery, measuring 5.9 mm × 5.3 mm without evidence of thrombus.\n\n【33】#### 3\\. Disscusion\n\n【34】MIS-C is a severe clinical condition with significant cardiac implications that occurs as a consequence of a dysregulated inflammatory response. It typically develops several weeks after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a reported mortality of around 2% in high-income countries \\[4, 5\\]. In contrast, data from developing countries such as Colombia report mortality rates of 9% \\[11\\]. The incidence of cardiac biomarker elevation such as pro-BNP and troponin is 86.65% and 76.34%, respectively \\[12\\], on some occasions with extremely high levels as was with our current case, correlating with severe myocardial damage comparable to that from Kawasaki disease (KD). Significantly elevated levels of ferritin, procalcitonin, and D-dimer have also been documented, as in the case described \\[8\\].\n\n【35】Echocardiography has great diagnostic value when evaluating cardiovascular involvement. The main documented findings have been coronary artery dilatation by 17.83%, aneurysm by 6.85%, pericarditis by 20.97%, myocarditis by 35.97%, and myocardial dysfunction up to 68% of patients \\[6, 12\\]. Most of the described complications related to dilatation and coronary aneurysm are small with a _Z_ score of 2–2.5, contrary to the case presented in which giant aneurysmal dilatations were found. This could probably be explained by young age, as with growth comes improved mechanical resistance of the internal elastic lamina to aneurysm formation \\[1\\].\n\n【36】Although infrequent, 3 cases described in Atlanta (Georgia) reported giant aneurysms occurring in children \\[13\\], however, so far there are no reports of aneurysmal thrombus formation. Despite the important presentation of MIS-C cases described, there are no national or Latin American publications about the findings of giant aneurysms, nor their evolution or complications.\n\n【37】Echocardiography plays an important role during longitudinal surveillance after MIS-C. Studies suggest that in patients with abnormal findings such as dilatations or aneurysms, it is necessary to carry out rigorous imaging monitoring, which in this case was not possible due to the difficulties with access to healthcare. The last outpatient echocardiogram report (8 months after the presentation of this hyperinflammatory syndrome) showed persistence of giant aneurysms in the right and circumflex coronary arteries \\[8\\].\n\n【38】The main purpose of treatment in MIS-C is to reduce systemic inflammation to protect affected organs and reduce or prevent complications such as coronary aneurysms and death. This treatment is guided according to the clinical presentation and requires a multidisciplinary team (cardiology, infectious diseases, rheumatology, hematology, and intensive care). To date, there are no randomized controlled clinical trials or comparative efficacy studies evaluating treatment strategies. This is why available guidelines are based on expert opinion, scientific societies, and previous experience with Kawasaki disease and other multisystemic disorders in children \\[2\\]. Immunomodulatory management with immunoglobulins continues to be the first choice, and has been prescribed as monotherapy or in conjunction with corticosteroids \\[7\\]. Other important interventions include administration of ASA in 58–74% of cases and anticoagulant management in 37–44%, based on the presence of serum markers \\[6\\].\n\n【39】The prognosis and natural history of coronary aneurysms associated with MIS-C are still uncertain. To date, reports show that even the subset patients with MIS-C requiring critical admission and/or those with severe cardiovascular involvement, recovery was seen without sequelae in 70–95% of cases. The prognostic impact on outcomes of those cases with aneurysmal thrombosis is not known, as this severe clinical presentation remains largely undescribed. This clinical entity requires further study and structured long-term follow-up due to the risk of progression of cardiac manifestations \\[2\\]. It has been established that in Kawasaki disease the risk of presenting thrombotic or stenotic complications is related to the size of the aneurysms; giant aneurysms (Z score ≥10) are the least likely to undergo resolution, and are associated with up to 50% risk of adverse outcomes such as thrombotic coronary occlusion, progressive stenosis requiring revascularization, or acute coronary syndrome within 30 years after the initial illness \\[10\\]. This highlights the importance of guaranteeing rigorous follow-up in order to anticipate early complications and carry out timely interventions.\n\n【40】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【41】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Few case reports have been reported of ITP after COVID-19 infections and COVID-19 vaccines. Herein, we present a patient who presented with severe ITP with a platelet count of 0 after receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (also known as the Pfizer BioNTech). She subsequently recovered with a prolonged treatment course.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a clinical condition where the platelet count is less than 100,000/_μ_L and is associated with petechiae, bruising, or mucosal bleeding when the platelet count is below 50,000/_μ_L \\[1, 2\\]. ITP may be primary when autoantibodies to platelets cause platelet destruction without an underlying cause, but it is secondary when it is the result of an associated condition that may include medications, infections, malignancies, or autoimmune conditions. Prior reports have indicated that vaccinations such as MMR have resulted in ITP in children and that viral infections such as hepatitis C, HIV, and EBV infection can be associated with ITP \\[3–5\\]. In this report, we present a patient who presented with severe ITP after receiving the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (also known as the Pfizer BioNTech) and recovered with treatment.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Vignette\n\n【5】A 63-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a rash and easy bruising that started a day after her second dose of BNT162b2 vaccination. The rash was initially noted on both her legs and then spread to the rest of her body. Two days after the second COVID-19 vaccination, the patient noticed a large bruise on her lower back, without prior trauma. In addition, she also noted mild bruising of her tongue but no active bleeding. She reported mild dyspnea after receiving her first COVID-19 vaccine 3 weeks earlier and noted similar symptoms soon after her second dose of the vaccine. Dyspnea was not associated with chest pain or leg edema. The patient denied nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, hematemesis, hematochezia, or any abdominal pain. She had a past medical history of COPD, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, but no history of liver disease or bleeding tendencies. She was on hypoglycemic agents, antihypertensives, and citalopram, but not on aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed generalized petechiae and subcutaneous bruises on the lower back. Laboratory evaluation showed normocytic anemia, normal white blood cell count, and platelet count was 0/_μ_L. Peripheral blood smear was normal except for decreased platelets without evidence of immature platelets. Figure 1 demonstrates the timeline of the patient’s treatments and her platelet counts.\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】The timeline of the patient’s treatments and her platelet counts.\n\n【11】Since thrombocytopenia due to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) can occasionally lead to thromboembolism and, given the patient’s initial complaint of dyspnea, with an elevated D-dimer of 0.85, a CT angiogram was ordered. CT angiogram was negative for pulmonary embolism. Subsequent workup including absence of schistocytes on peripheral smear, normal LDH, haptoglobin, and bilirubin levels ruled out MAHA. CT head showed no intracranial bleeding. Table 1 shows the pertinent lab values at admission and after treatment.\n\n【12】Table 1 \n\n【13】Laboratory values on admission.\n\n【14】Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), believed to be secondary to the COVID-19 vaccine. She was admitted to the hospital. The patient was started on dexamethasone at 40 mg orally daily for 5 days, as well as IVIG 1 g/kg once daily for a total of two doses. Of note, the patient tested positive for Sjogren’s Ab (SS-A) and scleroderma antibodies. Workup for other causes of thrombocytopenia including hepatitis serology, HIV, EBV, ANA, Smith Ab, RNP ab, anti-Jo1 Ab, anti-dsDNA Ab, anti-centromere, and Sjogren’s ab (SS-B) were negative.\n\n【15】Over the next week, the patient’s vitals and overall health remained stable. Her bruising was gradually improving, with no evidence of bleeding or new bruising. While the clinical picture showed stability, her platelet count showed a very slow response to treatment. Labs showed slowly increasing platelet counts from 0K/_μ_L on day 1, 1K/_μ_L on day 3, 5K/_μ_L on day 5, 15K/_μ_L on day 6, 11K/_μ_L on day 7, and 8K/_μ_L on day 8. Since the thrombocytopenia was refractory to IVIG and a 5-day course of steroids, the patient was started on prednisone therapy daily for a total 9 of doses. She subsequently received two doses of Nplate and one dose of Rituxan. Her platelet count responded and improved to 99K/_μ_L on day 14. She was discharged on a prednisone taper and is scheduled to receive the remaining three doses of Rituxan in the outpatient setting.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】The diagnosis of ITP is generally made after the exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia as well as response to treatment \\[2\\]. As in our patient with new onset ITP, the temporal association of the onset of symptoms after the BNT162b2 vaccine is significant but cannot be proved causality. An underlying rheumatological process cannot be entirely ruled out, given patient’s mildly positive ANA and positive scleroderma antibodies. A detailed review of the current literature shows that patients have been diagnosed with ITP after COVID-19 vaccination, including some patients with a prior history of ITP and few without prior ITP, as in our patient \\[6–14\\]. However, most of the reports have shown ITP occurring after the first dose of vaccine, with few reports after the second dose, as seen in our patient \\[6, 7, 9–14\\]. It is also possible that the patient may have had a mild form of ITP after the first dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine but was not symptomatic or not detected at that time.\n\n【18】As most patients with ITP respond well to IVIG and steroids, this is the initial management approach for patients with ITP after the COVID-19 vaccine. If the platelet count remains low, thrombopoietic agents and vincristine may be considered \\[8\\]. Rituximab is generally avoided following COVID-19 vaccination due to the slow onset of action, potential negation of recent vaccine-induced immunity, and the inability to revaccinate for more than 6 months \\[15\\]. However, it may be administered in refractory cases when the benefits outweigh the risks of treatment \\[16\\].\n\n【19】The pathogenesis of ITP is still unclear, but it is believed to be secondary to autoantibodies against platelet membrane glycoprotein by the patient’s B cells, or by cytotoxic T cells against platelet precursors \\[2\\]. As noted earlier, secondary ITP has been reported following multiple conditions, including vaccinations. Based on a literature review, it may be possible that antibodies directed against an antigen formed by the attachment of vaccine particles to some platelets lead to a reaction involving the rest of the platelets \\[8\\]. There have also been reports of ITP following a COVID-19 infection \\[5, 17\\]. Interestingly, all the patients presented with symptoms of subcutaneous or mucosal bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia. In general, platelet counts improve rapidly with steroids, but this was not seen in our patient \\[9\\]. One speculation regarding the etiology is that an underlying damage to megakaryocytes may have resulted in a lack of platelet production. This could also possibly explain the lack of response to IVIG due to the absence of autoantibodies to platelets. The subsequent improvement after day 14, which included treatment with Nplate, could then have been secondary to the development of a new population of megakaryocytes to reestablish platelet production.\n\n【20】ITP is commonly treated with steroid therapy and IVIG, as in our patient. It is important to highlight that the platelet count responds to therapy with improvement of counts. In some instances, when there are bleeding complications, platelet transfusion may be needed.\n\n【21】In summary, we herein report a unique case of severe ITP likely induced by the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, reiterating that this is a rare and treatable condition that can be diagnosed easily and responds to therapy.\n\n【22】#### Consent\n\n【23】Informed consent was received from all participants.\n\n【24】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【25】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Common manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from its initial official introduction are mostly related to the respiratory system. However, other rarer presentations are reported nowadays. _Case Presentations_. We reported three cases of COVID-19-infected patients with rhabdomyolysis as well as two other rarer simultaneous signs, including hypocalcemia (Case 1) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (Case 2). _Conclusion_. Despite the fact that rhabdomyolysis is an infrequent manifestation of COVID-19, high clinical suspicion is required for proper diagnosis and management of this disease as well as other concurrent rarer presentations, including hypocalcemia and DKA for the prevention of further complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerges as a novel infectious agent with several body organs’ involvement. This disease’s most common presentations are fever, dry cough, fatigue, or myalgia \\[1\\]. However, some patients develop severe symptoms, including shortness of breath, requiring further therapeutic support. On the other hand, rarer manifestations of COVID-19 have been declared.\n\n【4】Rhabdomyolysis is defined as muscle cell destruction resulting in subsequent leakage of cellular components to the bloodstream. This disease is mostly manifested with weakness, myalgia, electrolyte imbalance, myoglobinuria, or even acute kidney injury \\[2\\]. However, the exact etiology of rhabdomyolysis among COVID-19 patients needs to be investigated in future studies.\n\n【5】Moreover, hypocalcemia is a common phenomenon among critically ill patients, and it has been reported that calcium plays a pivotal role in the replication mechanisms of some viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebolavirus \\[3, 4\\]. For instance, a study done on patients suffering from SARS reported that hypocalcemia was prevalent in 70% of individuals during the hospitalization duration \\[4\\]. Another study investigated the prevalence of hypocalcemia among severely ill COVID-19 patients and figured out that almost two-thirds of them had lower calcium levels and had subsequent worse outcomes \\[5\\].\n\n【6】Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is another rare manifestation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Goldman et al. reported that this disorder is prevalent among 1.8% of admitted patients \\[6\\]. Chan et al. performed a case series on six patients with COVID-19 admitted with DKA and/or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) and found that these two glucose imbalance disorders were the primary manifestations in most cases \\[7\\]. However, the data are limited, and several future studies in terms of predisposing factors are required.\n\n【7】Herein, we reported three cases of COVID-19 patients with rhabdomyolysis as well as other concurrent rarer symptoms, including hypocalcemia and DKA.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【10】A 22-year-old man with no previous past medical history was referred to the emergency department with severe hypocalcemia (Ca: 5 mg/dl) as well as spastic muscles in both upper and lower extremities. Also, he was opium-addicted and used 15 cc of daily methadone. He had severe bloodless diarrhea from 20 days before admission managed with serum therapy. His vital signs were in normal ranges. He was conscious, but he appeared to be pale. He did not have any positive history in terms of nausea, vomiting, cough, or dyspnea. However, he suffered from generalized muscle spasms and pain. There was not any positive finding during heart and lung examinations. His abdomen was nontender, but pitting edema (2+) was observed in the lower extremities. Chvostek’s and Trousseau’s signs were positive, and his electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a prolonged QT interval (QT = 550 msec). Due to the high prevalence of COVID-19, lung high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was performed and the results were highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection (Figure 1).\n\n【11】  \n**(a)**\n\n【12】  \n**(b)**\n\n【13】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【14】Figure 1 \n\n【15】Multifocal peribronchial consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacities.\n\n【16】In the first hour of admission, intravenous infusion of 10% calcium gluconate was initiated promptly, and muscle spasms disappeared within four hours. Intravenous calcium administration was then continued based on plasma-calcium and ECG monitoring. The patient had a myoclonic-like seizure with an upward gaze on the first night of hospitalization, while the serum level of calcium was 8.9 mg/dl. The result of the requested brain CT was negative. Unfortunately, the seizure recurred, and intravenous diazepam was prescribed. On the third day of admission, the calcium concentration reached 9.1 mg/dl, and the QT interval was corrected (QT = 405 msec). Other laboratory data collected during the admission time were as follows: lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) of 1740 U/L, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) of 1840 U/L, potassium of 6.9 mEq/l, sodium of 142 mEq/l, blood sugar of 234 mg/dl, albumin of 3.2 g/dl, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 261 IU/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 110 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 379 IU/L, parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 145 pg/ml, 25-hydroxy vitamin D of 32 ng/mL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 19 mg/dl, and creatinine (Cr) of 1.2 mg/dl.\n\n【17】His laboratory findings favored rhabdomyolysis, and fluid therapy was started promptly with concurrent seizure as well as hypocalcemia management to avoid acute kidney injury. Unfortunately, the patient had a cardiac and respiratory arrest, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was implemented, and he was connected to a ventilator. However, on the fourth day of hospitalization, the patient could not be resuscitated after the second cardiac arrest attack.\n\n【18】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【19】A 36-year-old man was referred to the emergency department with two days of polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, and vomiting. His medical history was positive for psychosis, and he consumed olanzapine, lorazepam, propranolol, and sertraline for the last ten years. He was opium-addicted and used 20 cc of daily methadone. At admission, he was confused and lethargic with normal vital signs except for high temperature (_T_ = 38.5°C). Besides dehydration, other physical examinations did not reveal any positive findings. His blood sample was taken and showed a blood sugar of 500 mg/dl, pH of 7, and HCO<sub>3</sub> of 2.5 mEq/l. With the assumed diagnosis of DKA, insulin, tazocin, and serum therapy was initiated. The patient’s general condition and blood sugar levels were improved during the next day, and the HCO<sub>3</sub> concentration was raised to 9.5 mEq/l. On the third day of admission, his HCO<sub>3</sub> was 11 mEq/l. However, insulin infusion was held due to a lower potassium level. The patient suffered from dyspnea and shortness of breath on the next day and was connected to the ventilator. HRCT was requested, and the results were highly suggestive of COVID-19 infection (Figure 2). Additional laboratory data were as follows: potassium of 7 mEq/l, sodium of 138 mEq/l, LDH of 1296 U/L, CPK of 5130 U/L, phosphorus of 2 mg/dl, and Cr of 5.3 mg/dl.\n\n【20】  \n**(a)**\n\n【21】  \n**(b)**\n\n【22】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【23】Figure 2 \n\n【24】Bilateral and peripheral ground-glass pulmonary opacities.\n\n【25】Prompt therapeutic measurements were done, and because of decreased urine output, a temporary dialysis catheter was inserted, and he underwent hemodialysis. During the hospital admission, he experienced an attack of hypotension managed with norepinephrine as well as hydrocortisone. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed due to increased amylase (142 U/L) and lipase (351 U/L) levels. The findings of imaging studies and the analysis of ascites fluid favored pancreatitis (Figure 3(a)). Moreover, this CT was highly suggestive of concurrent splenic vein thrombosis (Figure 3(b)). All appropriate therapies were implemented, and most of the laboratory data were improved consequently. The hemodialysis course was discontinued, and he was discharged from the hospital after the second abdominal CT examination indicated resolved signs of pancreatitis. On the 45th day, his general condition was good. He received insulin twice a day and daily orally administered warfarin with a dosage of 5 mg adjusted to keep the patient’s international normalized ratio (INR) value of over 2.\n\n【26】  \n**(a)**\n\n【27】  \n**(b)**\n\n【28】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【29】Figure 3 \n\n【30】Heterogeneity and edema of the pancreatic tail with low enhancement (a) and splenic vein thrombosis with multiple collaterals (b).\n\n【31】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【32】A 47-year-old woman came to the hospital with respiratory symptoms, including fever, cough, and dyspnea, for two weeks. She had a long history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and asthma, which had been medically controlled. Other vital signs were in normal ranges. She did not complain of muscle pain. Due to high suspicion for COVID-19 infection, she was tested, and the results of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and HRCT were suggestive of this viral infection (Figure 4). She was transferred to the infectious ward. Her laboratory findings showed LDH of 5580 U/L, CPK of 16480 U/L, Cr of 1.7 mg/dl, AST of 951 IU/L, ALT of 874 IU/L, and ALP of 394 IU/L. With the assumed diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis, serum therapy was prescribed. The shortness of breath worsened on the fifth day and resulted in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class of IV worsening cardiac function with severe hemoglobin oxygen desaturation due to bronchial secretions. Despite receiving 100% oxygen via a face mask, oxygen saturation only reached 80%. Therefore, the decision was made in order to intubate the patient. She was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), and the proper treatments were continued. Her laboratory findings were improved during the next week (LDH: 1204 U/L, CPK: 560 U/L, Cr: 0.7 mg/dl, AST: 135 IU/L, ALT: 234 IU/L, and ALP: 562 IU/L). The patient remained stable hemodynamically; however, she became unable to wean from a ventilator secondary to probable acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Unfortunately, in the third week, she had a sudden cardiac arrest. She underwent cardiorespiratory resuscitation but could not be resuscitated from her pulseless electrical activity arrest and died.\n\n【33】  \n**(a)**\n\n【34】  \n**(b)**\n\n【35】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【36】Figure 4 \n\n【37】Multifocal multilobular consolidation and ground-glass opacities.\n\n【38】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【39】Since the emergence of COVID-19, several other manifestations rather than pulmonary symptoms have been reported. Here, we presented three cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection with concomitant rhabdomyolysis as well as hypocalcemia and DKA. Rhabdomyolysis is a life-threatening syndrome characterized by skeletal muscle cell breakdown and leakage of cellular components, including potassium, phosphorus, CPK, and myoglobin, to the bloodstream. The typical triad of this disease consisted of myalgia, weakness, and dark-colored urine. However, less than 10% of patients experienced the classic triad \\[8\\]. Multiple etiologies have been suggested, including drug side effects, trauma, autoimmune status, exertion, ischemia, and infection \\[9\\]. Common viral causes include influenza A and B, herpes simplex virus, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and enteroviruses \\[10\\]. Even though our patients were not tested for other viral diseases, clinical status and laboratory data confirmed COVID-19 infection. While the exact pathophysiological mechanism attributed to rhabdomyolysis occurrence in COVID-19 infection has yet to be investigated, several theories have been declared. Due to the genomic similarity between SARS and COVID-19 and the ability of SARS to directly infect muscle cells, it probably seems that this new infective agent can infect myocytes. The formation of immune complexes and their deposition because of cross-reactivity between muscle cells and viral antigens might be responsible for muscular damage. Massive cytokine production and cytotoxic T-cell activation could be categorized as other possible causes in this regard \\[10, 11\\]. On the other hand, other rare comanifestations of COVID-19-induced rhabdomyolysis must be considered. Case 1 was admitted with severe hypocalcemia as the initial presentation. Although the patient had myalgia and experienced seizure, which might be due to rhabdomyolysis complications, the direct virus effect for causing these presentations should be considered. Liu et al. performed a retrospective study to assess the predictive effect of hypocalcemia among patients with severe COVID-19. They figured out that 62.6% of patients had low calcium levels, which was associated with poorer outcomes \\[5\\]. Hypocalcemia is quite common in viral infections and among critically ill patients. The possible factors include malnutrition, decreased intestinal absorption of calcium, cell membrane damage due to hypoxia and calcium influx, vitamin D deficiency, or medication interaction. Moreover, serum calcium is mainly bound to albumin, and hypocalcemia could occur in favor of reduced albumin levels. However, cytokine production during COVID-19 infection is reported to inhibit PTH secretion, and impaired response to PTH might be responsible for the induction of hypocalcemia \\[12\\]. Several studies are required to evaluate the exact pathophysiological mechanism responsible for hypocalcemia among COVID-19-infected individuals. Overall, in our case, it seems that impaired response to PTH, malnutrition, and calcium influx were possible causes of hypocalcemia.\n\n【40】In terms of DKA that occurred in Case 2, several points should be considered. The infection itself might be responsible for the induction of DKA \\[7\\]. Also, abnormal blood glucose has been reported to be associated with worse outcomes in the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the data are still limited, further investigations for the diagnosis of the exact mechanism are required. The Coronaviridae family has the tropism for both exocrine and endocrine pancreatic cells. Like SARS, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been suggested to be a receptor for COVID-19 S-protein \\[13\\]. This receptor has been expressed in pancreatic beta-cells in addition to pulmonary cells \\[14\\]. The primary role of ACE2 is the degradation of angiotensin 2 to angiotensin1–7. Therefore, downregulation of the ACE2 receptor during COVID-19 leads to increased angiotensin 2 concentration resulting in reduced blood supply to pancreatic cells and subsequently delayed insulin secretion, which ultimately results in hyperglycemia and even DKA occurrence \\[14, 15\\]. However, whether the sudden onset alterations of glucose metabolism in severe COVID-19 will be persisted or remitted is still unclear. The presence of this receptor on the exocrine pancreas might explain the incidence of pancreatitis in Case 2. It seems that pancreatic involvement during COVID-19 should be further addressed in clinical settings.\n\n【41】In conclusion, our findings from this case report indicate that rhabdomyolysis could be categorized as one of the complications of COVID-19, and further suspicion for proper diagnosis and therapeutic interventions should be performed. Furthermore, other simultaneous rare manifestations, including hypocalcemia or DKA, must be comprehensively addressed in future studies.\n\n【42】#### Abbreviations\n\n【43】| COVID-19: | Coronavirus disease 2019 |\n| --- | --- |\n| SARS: | Severe acute respiratory syndrome |\n| MERS: | Middle East respiratory syndrome |\n| DKA: | Diabetic ketoacidosis |\n| HHS: | Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state |\n| ECG: | Electrocardiogram |\n| HRCT: | High-resolution computed tomography |\n| LDH: | Lactic acid dehydrogenase |\n| CPK: | Creatine phosphokinase |\n| AST: | Aspartate aminotransferase |\n| ALT: | Alanine aminotransferase |\n| ALP: | Alkaline phosphatase |\n| PTH: | Parathyroid hormone |\n| BUN: | Blood urea nitrogen |\n| Cr: | Creatinine |\n| CPR: | Cardiopulmonary resuscitation |\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| INR: | International normalized ratio |\n| RT-PCR: | Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction |\n| NYHA: | New York Heart Association |\n| ICU: | Intensive care unit |\n| ARDS: | Acute respiratory distress syndrome |\n| ACE2: | Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. |\n\n【44】#### Data Availability\n\n【45】The datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to confidential issues but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n【46】#### Consent\n\n【47】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient or patient’s next of kin (when the death happened) for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【48】#### Disclosure\n\n【49】Maryam Heidarpour and Mehrbod Vakhshoori are considered co-first authors.\n\n【50】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【51】None of the authors had any personal or financial conflicts of interest.\n\n【52】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【53】M.

Effective treatment exists with eculizumab for this condition, but administration of treatment is often delayed because of overlapping symptoms with other causes of thrombotic microangiopathy. We present a case of a 78-year-old male who was eventually diagnosed with complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy. We also discuss the use of the PLASMIC scoring model to assist in more rapid diagnosis and discernment between various thrombotic microangiopathies.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) represents a process where vascular injury in small vessels causes microthrombi to form with subsequent thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), and end-organ injury. TMAs are classically divided into two categories: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) for ADAMTS13 deficiency-mediated TMA and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) for Shiga-toxin-mediated TMAs \\[1\\]. Complement-mediated TMA (C-TMA) is the rarest form of TMA and represents a third categorization of TMAs. C-TMA is a disorder where uncontrolled complement activation causes subsequent platelet activation, microvascular endothelial injury, and widespread microthrombotic disease \\[2\\]. Without proper treatment, up to 50% of cases progress to end-stage renal disease or irreversible brain damage and 25% may die from the acute phase of the disease \\[3\\]. In addition, those that survive the acute phase often require dialysis and are hospitalized more than twice as long compared to those with typical HUS \\[4\\]. With the advent of an extremely effective treatment with eculizumab \\[5\\], early differentiation from TTP/HUS and treatment is vital in minimizing the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The PLASMIC score is a recently developed algorithm that has been shown to demonstrate efficacy in identifying patients presenting with TTP based on rapidly obtainable labs (Table 1) \\[6–8\\]. This report will review the approach to someone with a suspected TMA and highlight the use of the PLASMIC score in distinguishing between TTP and HUS/C-TMA to allow for more rapid treatment of C-TMA.\n\n【4】Table 1 \n\n【5】PLASMIC scoring system.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Discussion\n\n【7】A 78-year-old male with a history of chronic kidney disease stage 2, systolic heart failure with a biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in place, coronary artery disease status after a 5-vessel coronary bypass graft, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presented to an outside hospital with cough and fever. He had been seen by his primary care physician six days prior to admission to an outside hospital and treated for a bacterial upper respiratory infection with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole but continued to have worsening lower extremity swelling and fevers to 103°F. He had no recent travel, sick contacts, or preceding diarrheal illness. During his admission at the outside hospital, further workup was notable for a lactate dehydrogenase level of 6500, total bilirubin 4.0 (unconjugated), platelet count 27K/_μ_L, fibrinogen 193, international normalized ratio 1.4, and mean corpuscular volume 103.6—all of which raised concern for hemolysis with a total PLASMIC score of 4. A peripheral blood smear demonstrated schistocytes, and his creatinine rose to 3.0 from a baseline of 1.0 despite adequate urine output. He was then transferred to our institution on hospital day 3 for initiation of plasma exchange therapy for suspected TTP. The patient’s ADAMTS13 level, which was collected at the previous hospital, returned at 47% on his fifth day of hospitalization; this was inconsistent with TTP. Thus, plasma exchange therapy was never initiated. Workup for systemic lupus erythematosus, cobalamin C deficiency-mediated TMA, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, drug-induced TMA, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), typical HUS, HIV, and malignancy returned negative. His condition continued to deteriorate, with creatinine peaking at 7.4 and continued decrease in hemoglobin and platelet counts, requiring multiple blood transfusions; he was started on eculizumab for clinical evidence of C-TMA on hospital day 6. However, within 24 hours of administration of eculizumab, he had a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction with a troponin level of 16.78. He was urgently transferred to the intensive care unit and was subsequently intubated for worsening tachypnea and increased work of breathing. The decision was then made by his family to transition to comfort care given evidence of acute right ventricular failure complicated by profound acidosis requiring multiple pressors with minimal hope of recovery.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】The syndromes of TMAs have great overlap and can be difficult to discern in a clinical setting. TMAs should be suspected in patients presenting with signs of MAHA (elevated LDH, low haptoglobin, thrombocytopenia, and schistocytes on blood smear). Once TMA is confirmed, systemic causes such as DIC, HELLP/preeclampsia, infections, lupus, and malignancy must be ruled out. It is reasonable to begin plasma exchange therapy for empiric treatment of TTP, as TTP has the highest urgency for treatment, while undergoing workup for other causes of the TMA.\n\n【10】Recent research has demonstrated the efficacy of the PLASMIC scoring system in evaluation of possible TTP. When dichotomized into high risk (PLASMIC score >5) versus low risk (PLASMIC score 0–5), the model predicted severe ADAMTS13 deficiency correlating to TTP with a positive predictive value of 72%, a negative predictive value of 96%, a sensitivity of 90%, and a specificity of 92% \\[8\\].\n\n【11】Once the PLASMIC score has established the patient as having a low likelihood for TTP, other etiologies of TMA outside of TTP can be considered while awaiting ADAMTS13 results. In our patient, drug-induced TMA (DITMA) was a consideration given prior exposure to antibiotics; however, DITMA is either very acute (from drug reaction, occurring over hours) or very chronic (from drug toxicity, occurring over weeks to months). TMA secondary to occult malignancy takes place over weeks to months, and Shiga-toxin HUS usually has a preceding diarrhea illness. This patient had a subacute presentation over a few days without diarrheal illness, normal fibrinogen, and a negative ANA, lowering the likelihood of DIC, drug-induced, HUS, lupus-induced, or occult malignancy-induced TMA. Next, metabolism-induced TMA can be evaluated by checking for homocysteine and methylmalonic acid, as vitamin B12 deficiency has been shown to rarely induce TMAs \\[9\\]. Our patient had normal vitamin levels. In the setting of continued worsening renal failure, C-TMA is the next consideration. If the clinical suspicion for C-TMA is high, eculizumab should be started empirically as early treatment is important for minimization of kidney damage. It is important to keep in mind that eculizumab inhibits C5, and as such vaccination and prophylaxis against meningococcal infections is crucial. In an acute setting such as C-TMA, vaccination with a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine and a four-week course of either penicillin V (250 mg every 12 hours) or ciprofloxacin (500 mg daily) are appropriate \\[10\\].\n\n【12】Our patient presented with generalized malaise and shortness of breath with laboratory findings consistent with a TMA with MAHA. In this patient, eculizumab administration was delayed to pursue treatment for TTP. In addition, the slow turnaround for ADAMTS13 assays created further delays in treatment of a potential C-TMA. Given the low PLASMIC score of 4 at the outside hospital, an alternative cause of TMA should have been considered and empiric treatment with eculizumab initiated.\n\n【13】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【14】TMAs have a variety of causes, notably, TTP, Shiga-toxin HUS, and C-TMA. Rapid diagnosis of the cause is crucial; effective treatment exists and acute mortality remains high. C-TMA remains an important consideration of patients presenting with TMA and MAHA with worsening kidney function, and early administration of eculizumab has been shown to be effective. Future use of the PLASMIC model may help expedite diagnosis.\n\n【15】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【16】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It may occur due to many causes, such as the presence of other disorders such as HIV infection, congenital anomalies like oculocutaneous albinism, or Oliver–McFarlane syndrome. It may be linked to the use of certain drugs and can also be present as an isolated trait by birth. Here, we report a rare case of eyelash trichomegaly in a 19-year-old female having diffused alopecia, diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Eyelash trichomegaly is defined as a condition in which eyelashes exceed their normal length (12 mm or more), curling, pigmentation, or thickness \\[1, 2\\].\n\n【4】Gray, in 1944, for the first time, used the term “trichomegaly” while observing a lymphoma patient with abnormally long eyelashes \\[3\\]. This disease may occur as a clinical feature associated with other acquired or congenital diseases. The common congenital anomalies associated with this condition include oculocutaneous albinism or Oliver–McFarlane syndrome and Cornelia de Lange syndrome, while the most common acquired conditions to which it is linked include HIV infection, alopecia areata, diseases affecting connective tissues like dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Certain medications such as cyclosporines and topical latanoprost can also trigger eyelash trichomegaly. The exact mechanism by which it develops has not been extensively studied. A summary of the conditions which may trigger trichomegaly is given in Table 1.\n\n【5】Table 1 \n\n【6】Eyelash trichomegaly: causes and occurrence.\n\n【7】Here, we present a case of eyelash trichomegaly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Hair loss in a diffused pattern is also present in the patient. All information presented here were obtained with the permission of the patient’s parents.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【9】For nine months, a Jordanian girl, 19 years old (Figure 1), had typical symptoms such as weakness, malaise, joint discomfort, no or diminished appetite, sensitivity to sunlight, and low-grade fever. Since last year, she has seen hair loss as well as an increase in the length and curl of her eyelashes.\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 1 \n\n【13】Eyelash trichomegaly in SLE patient.\n\n【14】Her medical record for the last six months showed that she had taken no medicine except prednisolone orally (20 mg/day). Her family history shows no cases of hypertrichosis. Mild signs and symptoms such as erythema in the paranasal region and diffused hair loss in the scalp were discovered during the examination (classified as type-1 according to Ebling and Rook’s five-stage classification of hair loss pattern for females). Trichomegaly was observed as her eyelashes measured 17 mm long (Figure 2).\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Figure 2 \n\n【18】Eyelash trichomegaly in SLE patient.\n\n【19】Hb 9.8 g/dL, TLC 2800/mm<sup>3</sup>, ESR 72 mm/h, and the number of platelets present were 105,000/mm<sup>3</sup> indicative of thrombocytopenia, which were all found on her hematological reports. No proteins or casts were seen in the urine examination. Antinuclear antibodies (1 : 320, homogeneous pattern) and anti-dsDNA antibodies were detected. The patient was diagnosed with SLE and was directed to consult a rheumatologist for treatment.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】During development at embryonic stages, eyelashes are the first hair to grow. They appear roughly around the 12<sup>th</sup> week of gestation. Their growth completes in a cycle of three stages in six months: anagen phase (30 days), catagen phase (15 days), and telogen phase (over 100 days).\n\n【22】The normal length of eyelashes of the eyelid is 8–12 mm. An increase of this length or thickening, curling, and pigmentation is known to be eyelash trichomegaly \\[1, 2\\]. It may be present at birth in association with other congenital syndromes, which include Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Oliver–McFarlane syndrome (most common), Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome, and congenital heart disease (uncommon) and Aghaei–Dastgheib syndrome, cone-rod syndrome, Goldstein–Hutt syndrome, and phylloid hypomelanosis (rare).\n\n【23】It may also show up as an isolated benign family feature in rare cases. These changes also develop as a characteristic feature of other syndromes developed later in life, such as atopic dermatitis, uveitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and HIV infection. In rare cases, it may also be associated with other acquired syndromes such as alopecia areata, metastatic renal adenocarcinoma, dermatomyositis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【24】Certain drugs are also key players in the development of these changes. The drugs to which this condition is linked most commonly include cyclosporine, inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), cetuximab, and frequent use of prostaglandin analogs such as latanoprost and travoprost \\[2, 4\\] (Table 1).\n\n【25】SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease involving multiple systems. The autoantibodies which are produced cause a wide spectrum of medical complications. Hair growth patterns change as a result of SLE. In the classification criteria, nonscarring alopecia has also been included \\[5\\]. Diffuse alopecia affects up to 50% of patients, and uncontrolled, short, broken-off “lupus hair,” which affects 30% of patients \\[6\\].\n\n【26】The pathophysiology of eyelash trichomegaly has been inadequately explored because of a lack of histology and organ culture data for eyelash hair. A molecular mechanism for trichomegaly development has been proposed. According to this theory, stem cell inactivation in different regions of the hair follicle by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) may lead to eyelash trichomegaly. EGFR regulates the growth cycle of eyelash hairs, and its inhibition may lead to trichomegaly \\[7\\].\n\n【27】In this report, we document a case of trichomegaly associated with SLE along with diffused hair loss. The development of eyelash trichomegaly in our patient may have been caused by EGFR inhibition.\n\n【28】#### Data Availability\n\n【29】The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.\n\n【30】#### Consent\n\n【31】The authors certify that consent from the patient was obtained in written form by them.

{"seq_id": "6af52bfb-e8a9-4bf2-9b07-638293221cf5", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) is rarely massive in size. The great majority is asymptomatic and incidentally found on imaging studies for unrelated causes. We reported a case of an 85-year-old male with bilateral multiple huge acquired renal infected cysts, initially presenting with bowel obstruction-like symptoms. The computed tomography (CT) scan later aided in an accurate diagnosis. Symptomatic huge ACKD has, to our knowledge, scarcely been described. In addition, retroperitoneal lesions resulting in abdominal pain remain unusual and underrecognized in general practice.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A cystic kidney disease is a group of conditions that cause fluid-filled sacs to form in or around the kidneys \\[1\\]. It is attributed to a broad spectrum of etiologies, including inherited, acquired, and systemic disease-related conditions. One of the most common causes is acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) \\[2, 3\\]. Whilst the great majority (approximately 86% of cases) are asymptomatic, certain patients may develop hematuria, lower back pain, and urinary tract infection \\[4, 5\\]. Abdominal pain is thus claimed to be an unusual presentation. Various pain characteristics have been described, including dull, uncomfortable fullness, stabbing, and cramping \\[6\\]. We herein reported a rare case of an elderly patient who was ultimately diagnosed with infected ACKD, initially presented with acute abdominal pain.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 85-year-old male was evaluated at this hospital because of acute abdominal pain. His comorbidities included essential hypertension, old myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease, and gouty arthritis. No family history of early-onset chronic kidney disease was documented. Two years earlier, he had the first episode of urinary tract infection (UTI), which was resolved with a ten-day course of oral antibiotics at another hospital. One week after treatment, he underwent a kidney ultrasound examination to evaluate the possibility of complicated UTI. However, it revealed no abnormalities. The patient had been in his usual state of health until ten days before admission to our hospital, when acute abdominal pain, constipation, early satiety, and nausea developed. Abdominal pain was generalized, dull, 6 out of 10 in severity, and gradually worsened. He denied other organ-specific symptoms, except for a low-grade fever. He had never undergone abdominal surgery. On examination, the temperature was 38.4°C, the blood pressure was 127/73 mm·Hg, the heart rate was 86 beats per minute, and the respiratory rate was 18 breaths per minute. His abdomen was soft and moderately distended with slight but diffuse tenderness to soft touch and normal bowel sounds. The remainder of the examination was normal. A digital rectal examination revealed hard, brown stool with no blood or mucus. Plain film of the abdomen demonstrated a large well-defined high-density shadow on the left upper quadrant abdomen, deviating left colon to the central abdomen, without significant bowel dilatation (Figure 1). He then underwent computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, which disclosed multiple, variable-sized, thin-walled, well-marginated cysts in both kidneys (Figure 2). The diameter of the cysts ranged from 3.5 to 13.0 cm, and it showed internal hyperdensity (16–20 Hounsfield units). Both kidney sizes were of normal size and had normal parenchyma without solid components. A complete blood count revealed a leukocyte count of 12,000 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> with neutrophil predominance (79%). His serum creatinine was 2.13 mg/dL without proteinuria. Urinary analysis showed leukocyturia (a urine white blood cell count of 30–50 cells/high power field) with nitrite positive. After he was diagnosed with bilateral multiple infected acquired renal cysts, ciprofloxacin was administered intravenously. Four days later, his fever and abdominal pain had largely diminished. The hemoculture was reported negative and urine culture grew _Escherichia coli_. After his clinical conditions improved, ciprofloxacin was switched to oral form, and he was referred to a urologist for further evaluation and considering an evaluation for kidney transplantation.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】Supine (a) and upright (b) abdominal radiographs revealed a large well-defined soft tissue opacity at the left upper quadrant of abdomen, deviating left-sided colon medially. No signs of bowel obstruction were noted.\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 2 \n\n【13】Coronal (a) and axial (b) CT images of the abdomen revealed multiple, variable-sized, thin-walled cysts in both kidneys. The diameter of the cysts ranged from 3.5–13.0 cm. Some renal cysts had higher attenuation with perinephric fat stranding, representing infected renal cysts.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】A spectrum of adult renal cystic diseases was categorized into hereditary and non-hereditary conditions. The common causes in patients with multiple renal cysts remain autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), ACKD, and simple renal cysts \\[2, 3\\]. Our patient was diagnosed with acquired renal cysts since his kidney sizes were of normal size and he had normal parenchyma. Yet, there were neither extrarenal cysts nor a positive family history of early-onset chronic renal diseases nor other organ-specific manifestations. His impaired renal function made the diagnosis of simple renal cysts unlikely \\[7, 8\\]. In addition, the congenital causes are less likely attributed to his clinical presentations because of his old age and no abnormal findings on the previous kidney ultrasound.\n\n【16】The four cardinal symptoms of bowel obstruction are pain, vomiting, obstipation (or constipation), and distention \\[9\\]. However, these tetrads were neither specific (28–61%) nor sensitive (56–75%) \\[10\\]. Therefore, the clinical features alone might not aid in recognizing and promptly managing bowel obstruction. Our patient presented with bowel obstruction-like symptoms with no history of abdominal surgery. Aside from partial bowel obstruction, conditions that had to be considered in a differential diagnosis included acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, mesenteric ischemia, and mesenteric artery ischemia \\[11\\]. A plain film of the abdomen revealed a mass-like shadow on the left upper quadrant abdomen without any evidence of bowel dilatation. Furthermore, CT abdomen revealed bilateral multiple huge renal cysts extended anteriorly toward intra-abdominal organs. The stretched peritoneum reasonably explains his generalized abdominal pain \\[12\\]. This case reminds us that a pattern recognition process or an intuitive approach in diagnosis has its limits in certain situations, particularly with highly incoherent data. Alternative strategies for generating differential diagnosis include anatomic approach, and systems approach, under a hypothetico-deductive method with critical thinking and clinical reasoning, may provide a more comprehensive range of possible conditions in this clinical setting \\[13\\].\n\n【17】ACKD is a condition commonly found in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, presenting with multiple bilateral cysts, which are usually between 0.5 and 3 cm in diameter \\[4\\]. The prevalence of ACKD was approximately 7% and 22% in pre-dialysis patients and dialysis patients, respectively \\[14\\]. Common imaging techniques including ultrasonography, CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play an indispensable role in the diagnosis, prognostic staging, and management. In spite of the fact that ultrasound provides the most cost-effective option, CT and MRI demonstrate greater resolution with a high sensitivity and specificity particularly for detecting renal cysts less than one centimeter in diameter \\[15, 16\\]. Whilst its pathogenesis had not been well understood, it was postulated that nephron loss contributed to compensatory kidney hypertrophy, resulting in tubular hyperplasia and cyst formation. The process was mediated by activation of proto-oncogenes—which was presumably attributed to renal cell carcinoma (RCC)—and release of growth factors \\[17, 18\\]. The cyst stems from proximal tubules, and its fluid derives from the ultrafiltrate, transepithelial solute, and fluid secretion \\[19, 20\\]. The incidence of RCC was 4–7% over 7–10 years of follow-up \\[21,22\\]. To date, there is no consensus regarding the proper modality and frequency of imaging to detect RCC progression from ACKD. However, modalities—reported in previous studies—included ultrasound, CT, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\[21, 23–25\\]. Among imaging studies for diagnosing renal cell carcinoma, the diagnostic performance of unenhanced ultrasound was poor. Vogel et al. revealed that median sensitivity and specificity of CT abdomen were 88% and 75%, respectively. Also, median sensitivity and specificity of MRI abdomen were 87.5% and 89%, respectively \\[26\\].\n\n【18】According to his cyst infection, common pathogens included _Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, Citrobacter diversus, Enterococcus faecalis,_ and _Enterococcus_ spp. \\[27\\]. Lipid-soluble antibiotics—for instance, fluoroquinolones—demonstrated excellent penetration into cysts; however, resistant strains were increasingly being identified \\[27, 28\\]. Because of their properties, these regimens were favored \\[29\\]. The ACKD patients with pain or abdominal fullness from mass effect are treated symptomatically. Because of the rarity of cases with symptoms, the gold standard of definite treatment in patients with ACKD has not been well established. Based on previous studies of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, nephrectomy may be needed in cases with intractable pain and cyst-related complications including retroperitoneal bleeding, persistent or severe hematuria, recurrent and severe cyst infection, infected stones, and suspicion of renal cell carcinoma \\[30\\]. Moreover, a recent study revealed that trans-arterial embolization of enlarged polycystic kidneys appears to be an advantageous alternative to nephrectomy before renal transplantation \\[31\\]. In patients with kidney transplants, the recipient kidney was smaller in size and had milder grade of severity compared to those treated with hemodialysis \\[32\\]. Although no recurrence of his symptoms had been detected, he was referred to experienced nephrologists and urologists for an early discussion of the surgical intervention. After discussion, the preferred management was close monitoring and the invasive intervention would be re-considered if indicated. In our case, no evidence of RCC had yet been found in CT abdomen findings. We advised our patient to undergo CT abdomen scanning to assess the progression of the disease and screen for RCC every 1-2 years, based on its growth rate of 1 cm per year \\[33, 34\\].\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【20】Our case exemplifies the importance of constructing a wide differential diagnosis in patients without prior abdominal surgery presenting with bowel obstruction-like symptoms. Retroperitoneal lesions, although rare, can cause abdominal pain and bowel obstruction-like symptoms.

Several complications of this infection have been reported. However, a spontaneous pneumomediastinum has rarely been described. We report the fourth case of this extremely rare complication in a 65-year-old male patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia, discovered during his therapeutic management by a CT scan control.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】COVID-19, originally reported in December 2019 in China, is currently spreading worldwide. It represents a major challenge for intensive care medicine, mainly due to the high number of intensive care admissions, the prolonged stay of patients, and the increased mortality in the presence of comorbidities.\n\n【4】Computed tomography of the chest has been proposed as triage and diagnostic tool for suspected COVID-19 patients. Although many parenchymal and extraparenchymal abnormalities have been observed, the presence of spontaneous pneumomediastinum remains a rarely described lesion.\n\n【5】We present a clinical case of a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 with spontaneous pneumomediastinum.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】We report the case of a 65-year-old patient who was admitted to intensive care for the management of respiratory distress and who has no medical or surgical history, with no history of cigarette smoking and not under any treatment.\n\n【8】His history reveals an influenza-like illness, a fever at 39.2 °C, arthralgia, myalgia associated with a dry cough, and anosmia with the notion of contact with a positive COVID-19 patient.\n\n【9】On admission, clinical examination found a conscious, tachypneic patient at 24 cycles/min with O<sub>2</sub> saturation at 88% in ambient air and 93% under 2 L/min of oxygen at the telescope, a heart rate of 82 beats per minute, and blood pressure at 120/80 mmHg. Moreover, the examination confirmed regular heart sounds and no audible breath, and there was no sign of right or left heart failure. Pulmonary auscultation found high-sounding gasps and sibilant in bilateral.\n\n【10】The blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.3, PaO<sub>2</sub> of 53 mmHg, PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 46 mmHg, and of 22 mmol/L<sup>−1</sup>.\n\n【11】The biological assessment found an aspecific inflammatory syndrome, with lymphopenia at 2400 cells/_μ_L, C-reactive protein at 110 mg/L, and procalcitonin at 0.17 ng/ml, a normal hemoglobin rate at 14.8 g/dL, a normal kidney function with urea at 5.66 mmol/L, and creatinine at 8 _μ_mol/L.\n\n【12】A chest CT scan was carried out objectifying bilateral, peripheral, and subpleural ground-glass opacities, with foci of band condensation (Figure 1), suggestive of an infection by SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 1 \n\n【16】Chest CT scan in the axial section of the mediastinal window showing ground glass images with an asymmetrical peripheral arrangement under the pleural layer, producing a crazy-paving appearance characteristic of typical COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【17】Our patient gradually presented with dyspnea at rest with signs of struggle associated with moderate to severe basal thoracic pain, requiring oxygen therapy with a high concentration facial mask reaching up to 12 L/min. Front chest radiographs showed a stationary aspect of the lesions with bilateral reticulonodular opacities especially basal and more marked on the right side in connection with an interstitial syndrome.\n\n【18】Faced with the nonimprovement of the clinical picture after a therapeutic protocol associating hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, the patient received an immunoglobulin treatment at a rate of 1 g/kg for 5 days and then administration of two doses of tocilizumab 400 mg at 48 h interval. On the 16th day, a computed tomography of the chest was performed for a better study of the parenchyma (millimeter sections in high resolution with an injection of contrast product) revealing a spontaneous pneumomediastinum with no sign in favor of subcutaneous emphysema or pulmonary embolism (Figure 2).\n\n【19】  \n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Figure 2 \n\n【22】Chest CT scan in the axial section of the pulmonary parenchymal window showing a low-to-medium abundant pneumomediastinum (arrow) dissecting the large mediastinal vessels in a 65-year-old patient with COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【23】The management of this rare complication was monitoring of respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure with analgesic treatment for chest pain.\n\n【24】The clinical course is favorable with a partial improvement in respiratory symptoms, and our patient is declared cured after 31 days and 2 negative PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs taken 24 hours apart.\n\n【25】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【26】Since December 2019, a series of cases of viral pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus identified on samples of the airways named SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan in China and quickly propagated all over the world.\n\n【27】The main clinical signs during SARS-CoV-2 infection described in three studies by Guan et al. were associated with a fever higher than 37.5°C, a cough, sputum, and dyspnea, occurring in the first day of infection \\[1\\]. Also, myalgia was frequent, and digestive signs, which may be inaugural events, were also reported, such as diarrhea and nausea/vomiting.\n\n【28】The chest CT plays a pivotal role in the triage of patients arriving in the emergency room, and the most frequent characteristic CT abnormalities of COVID-19 pneumonia are areas of ground glass, multifocal, bilateral, and asymmetrical. The involvement classically predominates in the peripheral, posterior, and basal regions. Other atypical CT signs appear in the form of pseudonodular condensations, sometimes accompanied by an inverted halo sign \\[2, 3\\].\n\n【29】Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is rare in SARS-CoV-2 lung infection. Only 3 cases were reported to date \\[4–6\\]. It is characterized by the presence of air in the mediastinal structures with no apparent cause (trauma and iatrogenicity).\n\n【30】Physiopathologically a spontaneous pneumomediastinum is secondary to an endobronchial hyperpressure (effort with closed glottis) causing an alveolar rupture and then gas dissemination in the peri-broncho-vascular space up to the pulmonary hilum and the mediastinum \\[7\\].\n\n【31】The most common symptom of spontaneous pneumomediastinum is acute retrosternal chest pain, followed by dyspnea, while subcutaneous emphysema is not systematic. Treatment is symptomatic, and no specific treatment seems necessary. Oxygen therapy is not systematic although it would accelerate the resorption of pneumomediastinum (absorption of free air by increasing nitrogen concentrations) \\[8, 9\\]. In the case of lung infections due to SARS-CoV-2, the virus causes the degradation of the integrity of the alveolar membrane because it infects type II pneumocytes. Consequently, the damage of the alveolar membrane due to SARS-CoV-2 infection may be one of the mechanisms leading to alveolar rupture and the appearance of spontaneous pneumomediastinum \\[10\\].\n\n【32】Our case represents the 4th case described in the literature and the 2nd case described in Morocco. Two hypotheses could explain the mechanism of pneumomediastinum in our case: firstly, the coughing effort, and secondly, the spontaneous rupture of the alveolar partitions secondary to the alveolar and interstitial lesions induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【34】Spontaneous pneumomediastinum remains a presentation rarely encountered in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19 and can potentially be an aggravating factor in the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Indeed, the association of a pneumomediastinum and a parenchymal lesion extended on the thoracic scanner witnessing significant destruction of the alveolar membrane. However, the occurrence of pneumomediastinum in a patient hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia requires close monitoring of the patient.\n\n【35】#### Data Availability\n\n【36】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【37】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【38】None of the contributing authors have any conflicts of interest, including specific financial interest or relationships and affiliations relevant to the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Acupuncture is a form of complementary medicine and has gained popularity worldwide in the last few decades. It is mainly used for the treatment of chronic pain. Acupuncture is usually considered a safe procedure but has been reported to cause serious complications including death. It has been associated with transmission of many viruses and bacteria. Two cases of Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ have been reported recently following acupuncture therapy. We are reporting a case of a 57-year-old Korean female who developed vertebral osteomyelitis and intraspinal and paraspinal abscesses as a complication of acupuncture. Blood cultures, skin lesion culture, and body fluid culture yielded Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA). Good anatomical and medical knowledge, good hygiene standards, and proper acupuncture techniques should be followed to prevent the complications. Acupuncturists should consistently review the infection control guidelines to acupuncture. This case should raise awareness of such condition and hazards of presumably benign procedures such as acupuncture.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Acupuncture in Latin words means “acus” (needle) and “puncture” (penetration). Acupuncture is one of the oldest medical procedures in the world and originated in China about 2,000 years ago. In United States it appeared in the early 18th century but gained popularity after 1971 when New York Times journalist, James Reston, reported his experience with acupuncture. He was visiting China for President Nixon’s visit. He had an emergency appendectomy in China and was given acupuncture for postoperative analgesia \\[1\\]. Acupuncture is mainly used for the treatment of chronic pain such as back pain, neck pain, and joint pain and for conditions like fatigue, insomnia, and depression. However, acupuncture, presumably a benign procedure, is related to the transmission of infectious agents and can cause devastating complications. We are reporting a first case of community acquired Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) acute osteomyelitis with intraspinal and multiple paraspinal abscesses related to acupuncture.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 57-year-old Korean female presented with complaints of two-day history of nausea, vomiting, and generalized weakness along with subjective fever and night sweats. The patient also complained of intermittent chronic back pain for years that worsened over last week and made her go to have acupuncture therapy for the first time two days priorly for her chronic back pain but unfortunately pain got worse. Her physical examination revealed tenderness in the lumbosacral region without any redness or erythema. Laboratory tests showed normal white count with bands of 34% (normal range: 0–5%). Chest X-ray showed patchy opacities in the bilateral lower lung fields. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【6】The next day after admission the patient developed urinary retention. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar spine was done to rule out disc herniation, which instead showed enlargement of the right psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles with induration of paraspinal soft tissue. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine showed fluid in the soft tissues posteriorly, which was reported as nonspecific but could be related to acupuncture.\n\n【7】Blood cultures came back positive for MRSA and only Vancomycin was continued. The patient developed multiple 2 mm new skin pustules over her legs and cultures from the skin lesions were also positive for MRSA. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram failed to show any vegetation. A chest CT and abdominal MRI were done to discover the occult source of infection. The chest CT showed multiple necrotizing nodules suggestive of septic emboli. The abdomen MRI showed fluid collection posterolateral to the right psoas muscle, which was likely due to abscess formation. Multiple new small microabscesses in the paraspinal muscles and early osteomyelitis of the L2 vertebral body were also reported (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). A new small (0.6 × 0.5 cm) intraspinal fluid collection was also seen at the L2 vertebral body. CT-guided aspiration of the right paraspinal abscess was done and cultures were sent, which came back positive for MRSA as well. The patient was continued on Vancomycin.\n\n【8】  \n**(a)**\n\n【9】  \n**(b)**\n\n【10】  \n**(c)**\n\n【11】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【12】Figure 1 \n\n【13】MRI lumbar spine. (a) MRI of the lumbar spine with contrast showing L2 vertebral osteomyelitis. (b) MRI of the lumbar spine showing paraspinal abscess. (c) Follow-up MRI of the lumbar spine showing resolution of the osteomyelitis and the paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【14】MRI and CT of the lumbar spine after four weeks of antibiotic therapy again demonstrated osteomyelitis of the L2 vertebra. The paraspinal fluid collections demonstrated interval decrease in size and resolution of the intraspinal fluid collection. The patient reported improvement of back pain and was discharged on a 12-week course of intravenous Vancomycin. An MRI of the lumbar spine (Figure 1(c)) eight weeks following antibiotic therapy showed significant improvement of osteomyelitis and almost complete resolution of abscesses. The delayed CT scan showed complete resolution of abscesses. During a follow-up visit the patient stated that her back pain had resolved.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Acupuncture is gaining popularity as a common therapeutic procedure for chronic pain control in the United States. However, due to failure to follow infection control guidelines for acupuncture therapy (Australian Acupuncture Association Limited, 1997) \\[10\\], there has been transmission of various infectious agents (Table 1). A review of the literature revealed that infectious agents such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus in 1988 and 1993 \\[11, 12\\], Human Immunodeficiency Virus in 1989 \\[13\\], Mycobacteria in 2001 and 2002 \\[14, 15\\], Methicillin Sensitive _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MSSA) in 1997, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006 \\[2–7\\], and Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) in 2008 \\[8, 9\\] were reported to have been transmitted by acupuncture. Now in 2015 we are reporting a first case of acupuncture associated MRSA acute vertebral osteomyelitis with intraspinal and multiple paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【17】Table 1 \n\n【18】Infectious complications related to acupuncture (MSSA and MRSA).\n\n【19】Along with infectious complications, acupuncture is also known to be associated with mechanical organ injuries. Three deaths have been reported in which acupuncture was claimed as the cause, with one patient who died from endocarditis, another from bilateral pneumothorax, and a third due to severe asthma during acupuncture therapy. The adverse effects of acupuncture can be prevented with sound anatomical and medical knowledge, proper hygiene practices, and adequate acupuncture education \\[16\\].\n\n【20】Vertebral osteomyelitis is classified as being acute, subacute, or chronic. Acute osteomyelitis develops in a few days or weeks while subacute or chronic occurs over weeks to months before treatment is initiated. Vertebral osteomyelitis occurs via hematogenous, direct inoculation, or contagious transmission. The lumbar spine is most commonly involved (58%), followed by the thoracic spine (30%) and the cervical spine (11%) \\[17\\].\n\n【21】Patients with vertebral osteomyelitis usually present with back pain and fever and may have some form of neurologic deficit. MRI has a high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (92%) for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis \\[18\\]. However, response to treatment is determined by clinical assessment and inflammatory markers since radiologic improvement by MRI is delayed and always follows clinical improvement \\[19\\]. Follow-up MRI is only indicated when there are no signs of clinical improvement after four weeks of therapy or an abscess is suspected \\[20\\].\n\n【22】A high index of clinical suspicion is required for vertebral osteomyelitis since the presentation can be very vague. Early imaging studies and empiric antibiotic therapy covering MRSA should be initiated to prevent serious complications, since _Staphylococcus aureus_ is the most common organism causing vertebral osteomyelitis \\[21\\]. Treatment duration for osteomyelitis is generally recommended for six weeks but a longer course should be considered in complicated infections \\[22\\]. In the present case, the patient received parenteral Vancomycin for three months and CT-guided aspiration of paraspinal abscess which resulted in a favorable outcome.\n\n【23】In the present case, back pain worsened over weeks which is the natural course of mechanical low back pain but having acute worsening after acupuncture directly suggests that bacterial inoculation at the time of procedure which was further complicated by bacteremia although there was no local skin abscess at the site of acupuncture temporal correlation is evident. The patient had been in the United States for years and this was her first hospitalization and she did not have any other medical problem suggesting that she could be carrier for MRSA so it was assumed that this infection was acquired from acupuncture as reported from previous literature.\n\n【24】To best of our knowledge, only two cases of MRSA associated with acupuncture have been reported in the literature to date. Lee et al. \\[8\\] reported acupuncture associated MRSA necrotizing aortitis in April 2008 and Woo et al. \\[9\\] reported MRSA causing septic arthritis following acupuncture in August 2008. We are reporting a third case of MRSA associated with acupuncture. However, this is the first case of MRSA associated vertebral osteomyelitis with spinal and paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】Vertebral osteomyelitis and/or abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis in a patient presenting with worsening back pain following acupuncture therapy. Diagnoses of vertebral osteomyelitis can easily be missed or delayed due to its vague presentation. Careful history taking and early initiation of therapy is of paramount importance for a favorable outcome. Acupuncturists should possess sound anatomical and medical knowledge and adhere to proper hygiene standards and techniques with consistent review of the infection control guidelines pertaining to acupuncture to prevent the devastating complications and significant financial expenditure due to prolonged hospitalization. This case raises awareness of the possible hazards of presumably benign procedures such as acupuncture.\n\n【27】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【28】There is no conflict of interests for the authors of this paper.\n\n【29】#### Acknowledgment\n\n【30】Deborah Goss, MLS (Director, Health Sciences Library, Queens Hospital Center), reviewed and edited the paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We report a case of a 12-year-old boy who presented with a five-month history of weight loss and anorexia, associated with vomiting episodes, dizziness, fatigue, and dyspnea. On physical examination, a palpable abdominal mass was noticed on the right hypochondrium and flank. An imaging study was performed, which showed a solid mass on the right colon. The patient underwent incisional surgical biopsy, and subsequent histopathologic analysis revealed a colon mucinous adenocarcinoma.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pediatric colon adenocarcinoma represents less than 1% of all neoplasms in the first two decades of life \\[1, 2\\]. Histologically, the aggressive mucinous carcinoma subtype accounts for most cases of this cancer \\[1, 3–5\\]. Although colorectal carcinoma has a good prognosis in adults when diagnosed early, in children, the rarity of the tumor and its high potential for dissemination usually lead to late diagnosis and poor prognosis \\[1–5\\]. In this report, we describe a case of colon adenocarcinoma in a 12-year-old boy, with emphasis on the imaging findings.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 12-year-old boy presented with a five-month history of significant weight loss (5 kg in one month) and anorexia, associated with vomiting, dizziness, weakness, and dyspnea. On physical examination, a palpable abdominal mass was noticed on the right hypochondrium and flank. The patient was also slightly pale, and a systolic murmur was observed by cardiac auscultation. Blood tests showed microcytic and hypochromic anemia and eosinophilia as the only abnormalities. The patient was negative for both acid-alcohol resistant bacillus and human immunodeficiency virus.\n\n【6】An abdominal X-ray showed a soft-tissue mass with no calcification, on the right flank and mesogastrium, with inferior deviation of the bowel (Figure 1A). Based on these findings, an ultrasonography (US) exam was performed, showing a hypoechoic stenosing mass of about 7.7 centimeters at the greatest diameter, in the right colon. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were also identified (Figure 1B).\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】| Abdominal X-ray (A) showing a soft-tissue mass with no calcification, on the right flank and mesogastrium, with inferior deviation of the bowel. Abdominal US (B) demonstrates a hypoechoic stenosing mass (curved arrow) measuring about 7.7 centimeters at greatest diameter, in the right colon. Enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were also identified (arrows). CT of the abdomen (C) confirmed the presence of an infiltrating tumor, slightly enhanced by the contrast media (curved arrow), extending from the cecum to the hepatic flexure on the right colon wall, causing bowel lumen reduction and irregularity (black arrow). The adjacent meso and abdominal wall were also involved. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】Based on the imaging findings, computed tomography (CT) was performed on the abdomen. The scan confirmed the presence of an infiltrating tumor, with slight enhancement from the contrast media, located on the right colon wall, extending from the cecum to the hepatic flexure. The adjacent meso and abdominal wall were also involved. Mesenteric hypodense masses that might correspond to neoplastic implants were observed (Figure 1C). Chest and brain CT scans were normal. A colonoscopy demonstrated a stenosing and infiltrative blastomatous lesion in the right colon, blocking the equipment passage. Based on these findings, an incisional surgical biopsy was performed, and pathological analysis showed epithelial cells associated with numerous signet-ring cells inside mucinous lakes, consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma.\n\n【12】The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy, with an end-to-end anastomosis between the ileum and the transverse colon (Figure 2). During the procedure, an unresectable macroscopic residual tumor was left near the emergence of the superior mesenteric artery, preventing a curative resection. Two enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes with macroscopic involvement were also found. No peritoneal effusion or macroscopic liver metastases were found. The patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Oxiplatin) and radiotherapy, but died 16 months after surgery.\n\n【13】  \n**(a)**\n\n【14】  \n**(b)**\n\n【15】  \n**(c)**\n\n【16】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【17】Figure 2 \n\n【18】| Surgery images.

Discussion\n\n【20】Colon adenocarcinoma is a rare tumor in pediatric patients, with an incidence of one in one million \\[1, 2\\]. This causes a low index of suspicion in physicians. Pediatric colon adenocarcinoma is associated with poorly differentiated histological type, and neoplasms are usually at an advanced stage at presentation, with liver and lymph node metastasis and in some cases, peritoneal carcinomatosis \\[1–5\\]. In this case, residual disease remained after surgery, with macroscopic lymph node involvement.\n\n【21】Histologically, mucinous adenocarcinoma is the most common histotype in pediatric colon cancer \\[1, 3–5\\]. The literature is not clear about the tumor distribution in the colon; however, the disease does not appear to have a predisposition for any particular portion of the colon \\[1–4\\]. In this case, the lesion was in the right colon. The clinical features are similar to adults, with abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, weight loss, rectal bleeding, abdominal palpable mass, and anemia \\[1–6\\]. Our patient also presented with dizziness, weakness, dyspnea and anorexia, but no bleeding. Although mucinous adenocarcinoma can be a complication of familial polyposis of the colon and ulcerative colitis, most cases occur in children with no predisposing factors \\[5, 6\\]. According to published reports, the lag time between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis is usually 3 to 6 months and in general, patients present with several symptoms \\[1, 3\\].\n\n【22】Barium enema studies suggest that colon carcinomas in adults are generally small polypoid masses (early carcinoma), irregular annular lesions with abrupt margins, or large intraluminal masses \\[7–9\\]. By US abdomen examination, bowel wall thickening from colorectal carcinoma may result in a target or pseudokidney configuration, in which the central echogenic mucosa is surrounded by an abnormally thick hypoechoic rim \\[7\\]. Carcinoma should be suspected if a CT scan shows a discrete mass or focal thickening of the colonic wall. In advanced stages, a large soft-tissue mass containing calcification might be found, causing bowel obstruction. Evident wall thickening, enlarged lymph nodes, surrounding organs or mesenteric fat invasion, hydronephrosis, liver metastasis (seen as focal calcifications), and peritoneal effusion may also be noted. Other complications including perforation, abscess, and fistulas may also be observed \\[7, 9–11\\].\n\n【23】In this case, disease was at advanced stage at diagnosis, with CT and US exams showing a large mass in the right colon wall, causing significant reduction and irregularity of the lumen, and infiltrating the mesenterium and adjacent abdominal wall, consistent with the literature. Enlarged lymph nodes were also identified.\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【25】Prognosis in colorectal cancer is usually determined by the degree of intestinal wall invasion, lymph node involvement, and hematogenous metastases. For this reason, early detection increases the chance of cure. Therefore, the rarity, low level of suspicion, and aggressive histological type normally seen in children can lead, in most cases, to late diagnosis and poor prognosis.\n\n【26】In our case, imaging revealed extensive metastatic disease, disseminated throughout the peritoneal cavity, reflecting the delay in diagnosis that is described in the literature in similar cases. These findings were confirmed during surgery, which determined the impossibility of curative resection, and led to a poor prognosis, despite adjuvant therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Multiple organs may be affected, including the nasal mucosa, skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and brain. The following case highlights a unique manifestation of HHT in a patient with a gastrointestinal hemorrhage and epistaxis, resulting in hyperammonemia and diffuse cerebral edema and herniation. Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication in such patients and initiate ammonia-reducing agents early to avoid this devastating consequence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), eponymously known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by widespread angiogenesis. HHT has a wide geographic and ethnic distribution. In North America and Europe, the prevalence is estimated to be 1:10,000 \\[1, 2\\]. In geographically isolated populations, the prevalence of HHT is higher, such as an estimated 1:5000 in Japan \\[3\\] and 1:1330 in the Afro-Caribbean islands of Curaçao and Bonaire \\[4\\]. However, the true prevalence is likely underestimated, given its broad array of phenotypic presentations \\[5, 6\\].\n\n【4】HHT is a clinical diagnosis, which has been codified by the Curaçao Criteria (Table 1) \\[7\\]. The presence of recurrent epistaxis is the most sensitive clinical manifestation of HHT, with average onset of epistaxis at 12 years and nearly 100% of patients affected by age 40. However, visceral lesions, which are the greatest contributor to HHT mortality, are often undetected and asymptomatic. The mortality rate increases with age, with the cumulative death rate at age 50 estimated to be 14% in one study \\[8\\]. Thus, early HHT detection, screening, and intervention are essential for improving patient outcomes \\[9\\]. HHT can be diagnosed by looking for specific genotypic mutations. Over 97% of patients with HHT possess mutations in _ENG_, _ACVRL1_, or _SMAD4_, which modulate TGF-_β_ signaling \\[9, 10\\]. However, diagnosis is not contingent on the presence of these mutations.\n\n【5】Table 1 \n\n【6】Curaçao Criteria for clinical diagnosis of HHT.\n\n【7】HHT’s most life-threatening manifestations arise in the form of visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which may result in high-output heart failure, portal hypertension, and hepatic encephalopathy \\[11\\]. Gastrointestinal bleeding and hepatic dysfunction are relatively common, and cohort imaging studies have shown that over two-thirds of patients with HHT possess hepatic AVMs \\[12\\]. Hepatic AVMs in HHT rarely lead to hyperammonemia and resultant hepatic encephalopathy \\[13–19\\]. This case illustrates the presentation of the first reported occurrence of subsequent transtentorial herniation as well as management strategies.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【9】A 64-year-old female with HHT presented to the hospital with a 24-hour history of nonbloody diarrhea and new onset hematemesis. Her HHT was diagnosed 40 years prior and had been complicated by refractory epistaxis, recurrent gastric bleeding from gastric ulcers and AVMs, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and hepatic AVMs resulting in hyperammonemia and hepatic encephalopathy. She had been treated with steroids, danazol, doxycycline, aminocaproic acid, and bevacizumab and had undergone septodermoplasty and posterior nosebleed cauterizations. Most recently, she was receiving thalidomide 50 mg nightly with clinical improvement. She was also prescribed lactulose for her history of hepatic encephalopathy and iron supplementation. She had never smoked and did not drink alcohol.\n\n【10】On arrival to the emergency department, she had large volume hematemesis. She was hypotensive and tachycardic. On examination, she was lethargic but arousable. Her skin and conjunctiva were pale, and she had abdominal distension with generalized tenderness to palpation, along with melena and hematochezia on rectal exam. Her labs on admission were notable for a hemoglobin of 5.0 g/dL, platelet count of 103 k/_µ_L, prothrombin time of 15.4 seconds, fibrinogen of 149 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 38 mg/dL. She had an ammonia level of 120 mmol/L. A nasogastric tube (NGT) was placed, and the patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection and transferred to the intensive care unit where she received numerous transfusions of packed red blood cells (pRBC), platelets, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and cryoprecipitate. In addition, infusions of pantoprazole, octreotide, norepinephrine, and normal saline were given. Emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) performed at bedside showed a large volume of blood at the lower third of the esophagus and stomach, along with a few nonbleeding cratered gastric ulcers (Figure 1). Computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed, demonstrating extensive arteriovenous (AV) shunting from underlying vascular malformations in the liver, though there was no localizable source of bleeding (Figure 2).\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Figure 1 \n\n【14】Endoscopy images showing gastrointestinal bleeding.

On assessment, she had dysconjugate gaze, was minimally responsive to verbal or tactile stimuli, and had clonus with a positive Babinski sign bilaterally.

The cEEG did not demonstrate evidence of active seizures but showed low-voltage activity with a severely depressed background consistent with a diffuse disturbance in brain function. The following day magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and suggested diffuse hypoxic injury (Figure 4).\n\n【30】  \n**(a)**\n\n【31】  \n**(b)**\n\n【32】  \n**(c)**\n\n【33】  \n**(d)**\n\n【34】  \n**(e)**\n\n【35】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)**   \n**(e)**\n\n【36】Figure 4 \n\n【37】Slices of axial brain MRI performed 15 hours after CT head.

Repeat CT head without contrast performed twelve hours later showed diffuse cerebral edema (Figure 3). Although 3% hypertonic saline was started, serial CT scans demonstrated progressive worsening of the cerebral edema with impending transtentorial herniation (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)).\n\n【39】Because her ammonia levels did not improve with pharmacologic management, she was started on renal replacement therapy (RRT) for the sole purpose of ammonia clearance, though this proved to have limited success. Eventually, a combination therapy of sodium benzoate, sodium phenylacetate, and L-arginine dropped her serum ammonia levels to a nadir of 31 _µ_mol/L (Figure 5). Ornithine and phenylalanine amino acid levels were within reference ranges, ruling out an inborn disorder of the urea cycle.\n\n【40】  \n\n【41】  \n\n【42】Figure 5 \n\n【43】Trend of ammonia level over the course of this patient’s hospital admission.

She required numerous blood products, and her bleeding slowly improved over the course of one week. While her ammonia normalized and serial imaging showed improvement in the cerebral edema, she remained in a persistent vegetative state and was ultimately transitioned to hospice.\n\n【45】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【46】This case highlights the significant neurologic sequelae of uncontrolled gastric hemorrhage in an HHT patient with hepatic AVMs. The majority of HHT cases with hepatic involvement are asymptomatic, although some individuals can develop high-output cardiac failure, biliary ischemia, or portal hypertension \\[20\\]. There are reports published in the literature of patients with HHT and hepatic AVMs who develop portosystemic shunting, hyperammonemia, and subsequent encephalopathy. However, the patients in these cases responded to treatment with lactulose, without reaching the level of acute decompensation and cerebral herniation seen in this case \\[18, 21\\]. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hyperammonemia-induced transtentorial herniation occurring in HHT.\n\n【47】When blood is digested following gastrointestinal hemorrhage, globin breakdown results in a rise in circulating amino acids and ammonia which are subsequently converted to urea by hepatocytes in the liver via the urea cycle \\[22\\]. However, for patients with impaired hepatic function, the liver is unable to efficiently convert ammonia to urea, which results in a toxic accumulation of ammonia. Ammonia is able to cross the blood-brain barrier where it is converted to glutamine by glutamine synthetase within cerebral astrocytes. Glutamine accumulation within astrocytes leads to increased osmotic pressure and cerebral edema, putting patients at risk for elevated intracranial pressure and cerebral herniation \\[23\\].\n\n【48】Portosystemic encephalopathy due to hyperammonemia is rarely reported in HHT and has been attributed to the presence of hepatic AVMs. There are three categories of hepatic shunting that occur in patients with HHT, including those between the hepatic artery and hepatic vein; hepatic artery and portal vein; and the portal vein and hepatic vein \\[21\\]. Shunting between the portal vein and hepatic vein is the mechanism by which hepatic encephalopathy is thought to occur \\[16\\]. In patients with refractory GI bleeding and hepatic AVMs or cirrhosis, determining the optimum therapy to reduce a toxic accumulation of ammonia is paramount in reducing patient morbidity and mortality. Though there are no guidelines for RRT use in hyperammonemia, it appears to be a plausible treatment option \\[24\\]. However, as this case demonstrated, it may not always be efficacious. Another option is to facilitate removal of ammonia via the urea cycle. L-Arginine acts to increase the activity of _N_\\-acetylglutamate synthetase and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase-1, key enzymes within the urea cycle, by increasing the availability of L-citrulline and lessening hyperammonemia \\[25\\].\n\n【49】Sodium benzoate/sodium phenylacetate is a combination medication used in hyperammonemia. Its mechanism involves the conjugation of benzoate with glycine and phenylacetate with glutamine to yield hippuric acid and phenylacetylglutamine, respectively. Because glycine and glutamine contain nitrogen from ammonia, by combining these substances with benzoate and phenylacetate, their end-products can be renally excreted \\[26, 27\\]. These treatments substantially reduce ammonia levels.\n\n【50】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【51】This case uniquely demonstrates a neurologic catastrophe that may occur in patients with HHT who have hepatic AVMs and GI bleeding but also suggests potential treatment strategies that should be initiated early. Patients with hepatic AVMs may have a predisposition to encephalopathy after experiencing bleeding events, including GI bleeds and epistaxis. As this case illustrates, cerebral herniation can occur regardless of expedient management, but early treatment with amino acid therapy, RRT, rifaximin, and rectal lactulose should be considered.\n\n【52】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【53】This case report was written under the employment of Houston Methodist Hospital.

Introduction\n\n【3】Hyperphosphatemia may arise from various conditions including exogenous ingestion, extracellular shifts due to cell death or alterations in acid-base status, increased bone resorption, hormonal abnormalities leading to reduced renal excretion, and/or reduced kidney function. Hormonal dysregulations or abnormalities that could lead to hyperphosphatemia include hypervitaminosis D, hypoparathyroidism (including inactivating PTH/PTHrP signaling disorders), or fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) deficiency or nonfunction \\[1, 2\\]. Additionally, hyperphosphatemia may result from minor problems associated with the phosphate-measuring technique or presence of phosphate-containing products in blood samples, referred to as pseudohyperphosphatemia \\[1, 3\\]. Although pseudohyperphosphatemia is well-described in the literature, it may be under-recognized in routine practice because, unless severe, mild to moderate hyperphosphatemia lacks immediate life-threatening consequences and, accordingly, likely receives a high threshold for clinical concerns and proper evaluation.\n\n【4】We herein present a case of a young pregnant female who presented with mild acute kidney injury (AKI), invasive mucormycosis receiving liposomal amphotericin, and hyperphosphatemia out of proportion to the degree of kidney injury. While the patient was initiated on a phosphate-binding agent by her primary care team for presumed AKI-associated hyperphosphatemia, a full investigation by the renal consulting team for contributing factors other than kidney injury was performed. A thorough evaluation revealed that the patient actually had pseudohyperphosphatemia associated with the use of liposomal amphotericin and promptly averted erroneous phosphate-lowering therapy. A review of the literature for conditions associated with pseudohyperphosphatemia will be discussed.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Clinical History\n\n【7】A 35-year-old 7-week-pregnant woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus was admitted for a fungating mass involving the clivus and cervical vertebrae, presumed to be invasive mucormycosis. On hospital day 1, the patient was initiated on liposomal amphotericin (10 mg/kg) with normal saline support. On day 4, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim and ampicillin/sulbactam were added for methicillin-sensitive _Staphylococcal aureus_ and _Prevotella buccae_ cultured from the fungating mass. On day 10, the patient was noted to have acute kidney injury (AKI) when her creatinine increased from 0.4-0.5 mg/dL to 1.46 mg/dL in association with a progressive increase in serum phosphorus up to 10.7 mg/dL. Nephrology consulting service was consulted for AKI and concurrent multiple electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Laboratory findings are presented in Table 1. Urinalysis was benign with no proteinuria or blood; 3 white blood cells, less than 1 red blood cell, and 2 squamous cells were noted per high power field. Patient’s primary team promptly replaced her potassium and magnesium and started sevelamer carbonate 2400 mg t.i.d with meals for hyperphosphatemia. Other medications included aspirin 81 mg q.d, atorvastatin 80 mg q.d, insulin glargine 40 units q.d, metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours, midodrine 10 mg q.d, and pantoprazole 40 mg q.d.\n\n【8】Table 1 \n\n【9】Patient’s laboratory findings.\n\n【10】Physical exam: temperature 36.7°C, heart rate 66 beats per minute, respiratory rate 17 beats per minute, and blood pressure 98/55 mmHg. Head, neck, heart, lungs, and abdomen exams were all within normal limits. Extremities had no edema or rash. Neurological exam revealed no focal abnormalities.\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Additional Investigations\n\n【12】Chart review was notable for a prolonged hypotensive episode on day 6 when patient’s blood pressure dropped from a baseline of 100/80 mmHg to 75–85/50–60 mmHg over a duration of 4 hours. Additionally, the patient received a computed tomogram with intravenous contrast on the same day.\n\n【13】The underlying etiology of AKI was relatively straight forward and thought to be multifactorial that could be related to the hypotensive episode, tubulointerstitial injury and/or decreased tubular secretion of creatinine unrelated to kidney injury associated with trimethoprim, contrast-induced kidney injury, amphotericin-induced reduced renal blood flow with or without direct tubular toxicity, and possibly early acute tubulointerstitial disease associated with the use of different antibiotics or pantoprazole \\[4\\].\n\n【14】Electrolyte abnormalities including acute onset of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia were attributed to amphotericin-induced tubular cell membrane injury with resulting electrolyte wasting \\[4\\]. The mild metabolic acidosis was attributed to the ongoing AKI and possibly some degree of proton back-flow induced by amphotericin \\[4\\]. Mild chronic respiratory alkalosis was attributed to the pregnancy state.\n\n【15】Hyperphosphatemia, however, was thought to be significantly elevated and out of proportion to the degree of kidney injury. A systematic investigation for hyperphosphatemia was performed and is summarized in Table 2. Based on patient’s clinical history and laboratory findings, both her pregnancy state and chronic respiratory alkalosis could have contributed to hyperphosphatemia, but only to a mild degree \\[5, 6\\]. In a nonpregnant adult female, serum phosphorus generally ranges from 2.5 to 4.3 mg/dL but may increase slightly to 3.1 to 4.6 mg/dL during pregnancy \\[5\\]. With chronic respiratory alkalosis, renal resistance to parathyroid has been reported to occur which could lead to hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. Nonetheless, the rise in serum phosphorus would only be expected to be within 20% from baseline \\[6\\]. Furthermore, patient’s serum calcium level was within normal limits after correction for hypoalbuminemia which likely excludes hypoparathyroidism as a contributing factor.\n\n【16】Table 2 \n\n【17】Evaluation of hyperphosphatemia.\n\n【18】Discussion with our institutional laboratory staff for the possibility of pseudohyperphosphatemia revealed that our institution uses the Beckman-Coulter DxC 800 instrument to measure phosphorus. Unbeknown to all involved clinicians, this instrument is known to measure falsely elevated phosphorus levels in patients receiving liposomal amphotericin B.\n\n【19】While the Beckman-Coulter analyzer revealed a phosphorus level of 10.7 mg/dl for our patient, measurement of phosphorus from the same blood sample on the Roche Cobas instrument from a nearby medical center resulted in a phosphorus level of 4.8 mg/dL.\n\n【20】Diagnosis: pseudohyperphosphatemia due to intravenous administration of high dose liposomal amphotericin.\n\n【21】##### 2.3. Clinical Follow-Up\n\n【22】Phosphate-lowering therapy with sevelamer was promptly discontinued. Patient’s AKI slowly improved with fluid support and avoidance of further administration of nephrotoxins. Of interest, within 24 hours of amphotericin switch to micafungin from the infectious disease perspective, patient’s phosphorus level returned to 4.0 mg/dL as measured by our own Beckman-Coulter analyzer. The patient was discharged within two weeks with resolution of AKI and normal electrolytes.\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Measurement of inorganic phosphate relies on the binding of phosphate anions to the acidified ammonium molybdate to form a yellow molybdenum-phosphate complex that absorbs light at 340 nm. Phosphate concentration is subsequently determined based on the absorbance of molybdenum-phosphate complex with ultraviolet spectrophotometry. Chemical analyzers that use very low pH reagent to acidify ammonium molybdate may also hydrolyze organic phosphate from compounds that are present in the serum, which is then measured as part of serum phosphate concentration. Theoretically, administration of any drug that is formulated with phosphorylated liposomal bilayer may also similarly cause pseudohyperphosphatemia. The extent of pseudohyperphosphatemia, however, would depend on the concentration of the culprit drug \\[7\\]. Clinicians are advised to consult with their own institutional laboratory staff for the accuracy in the measurement of phosphate by their instrument when phosphate levels are measured among patients receiving drugs formulated with phospholipids.\n\n【25】Of interest, pseudohyperphosphatemia has also been reported in situations involving paraproteinemia (multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), heparin or alteplase-containing blood samples, hemolysis, and hyperlipidemia \\[7–9\\]. The precipitation of paraproteins and associated turbidity caused by the acidic reagent used in the phosphate measurement assay has been suggested to interfere with light absorbance by ultraviolet spectrophotometry and erroneous measurement of phosphate \\[9\\]. Similarly, turbidity has also been suggested to be the cause of pseudohyperphosphatemia reported with hyperlipidemia \\[7–9\\]. Turbidity alone as the cause of pseudohyperphosphatemia associated with paraproteinemia, however, has been challenged \\[10\\]. Excess binding of phosphate to certain paraproteins or the actual physicochemical property of the paraprotein or both have also been implicated as a cause of pseudohyperphosphatemia \\[11–14\\]. As for heparin and alteplase-contaminated blood samples, phosphate is therein present as a pH buffer agent \\[15–17\\]. In the case of hemolysis or any other forms of cell death including tissue infarction and rhabdomyolysis, hyperphosphatemia may be expected as phosphate is a predominant intracellular anion which is released with cell lysis. In essence, hyperphosphatemia in these conditions is “true” hyperphosphatemia. Although hyperbilirubinemia and prolonged blood storage at cold temperature have also been reported to be associated with pseudohyperphosphatemia, these associations have not been confirmed \\[9, 18, 19\\]. For the case report on hyperbilirubinemia-associated pseudohyperphosphatemia, concurrent hemolysis was thought to be the underlying etiology rather than the hyperbilirubinemia per se \\[9\\].\n\n【26】In summary, any abnormal laboratory finding that is out of proportion to a patient’s clinical history deserves a thorough and systematic investigation. The investigation into the hyperphosphatemia out of proportion to the degree of AKI in our current case led to the diagnosis of pseudohyperphosphatemia associated with liposomal amphotericin and averted erroneous phosphate-lowering therapy. Table 3 summarizes clinical scenarios associated with pseudohyperphosphatemia and the respective reasons for the erroneous laboratory measurement.\n\n【27】Table 3 \n\n【28】Causes of pseudohyperphosphatemia.\n\n【29】#### Data Availability\n\n【30】No data were used to support this case report.\n\n【31】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【32】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has become the standard approach in the treatment of benign gallbladder disease. It may lead to serious complications, some of which can be disastrous if they are not recognized and managed immediately. Duodenum injury is extremely rare complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with potentially fatal consequences. It was commonly unrecognized at the time of procedures and was diagnosed later when the patients experienced sepsis, peritonitis, intraperitoneal abscess, or enterocutaneous fistula. Over the past 13-year period, 3000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed in our institution. Duodenum injury only occurred in one case recently. Herein we present this case of duodenum injury secondary to selective laparoscopic cholecystectomy presenting as fever and abdominal abscess on the fourth postoperative day. He was treated successfully with sonographically guided percutaneous needle aspiration and catheter drainage. The diagnosis and management of this rare complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy are described, and the literature is reviewed.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 74-year-old man with mild right upper quadrant pain for 2 years was admitted to the hospital for acute onset of severe upper abdominal pain radiating to the right shoulder. His medical history was remarkable, expect for subtotal gastrectomy 20 years ago owing to diverticulum at duodenal bulb. His vital signs and physical examination were normal. Laboratory data at presentation were as follows: white blood cells 5.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L (reference 3.6–9.7 × 10<sup>9</sup>); hemoglobin 13.0 g/dL (reference 12–16); alanine aminotransferase 28 _μ_/L (reference 0–40); direct bilirubin 4.3 _μ_mol/L (reference 0–8.6); and alkaline phosphatase 63 _μ_/L (reference 40–150). Abdominal ultrasonography (US) demonstrated one big stone with 2.5 × 1.7 cm in the gallbladder, and the thickness of gallbladder wall was 0.4 cm. No evidence was seen of biliary obstruction.\n\n【6】The patient underwent selective laparoscopic cholecystectomy successfully. The operation lasts for 55 minutes. The patient resumed food intake on postoperative day 2. The temperature was elevated between 37.5°C and 38.6°C from the postoperative day 4. Abdominal Computerized Tomography (CT) demonstrated a cyst-mass in the area of hepatic portal (see Figure 1(a)). Sonographically guided percutaneous needle aspiration was performed. During the course, contrast agent was found to flow into the duodenal stump directly and duodenal stump leakage was confirmed (see Figure 1(b)). Gastrointestinal X-ray showed that contrast agent in stomach flow into jejunum directly and this demonstrated that Billroth II subtotal gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy have been done in this patient (see Figure 1(c)). The catheter drainage was kept. The patient was treated conservatively with fasting and nutritional support for one week. He did not complain of peritonitis and fever after that. And then a liquid diet was taken again. The catheter was closed two weeks later. Abdominal CT demonstrated that the cyst-mass disappeared (see Figure 1(d)). Then the catheter was removed. He was discharged from the institution and the hospital stay was 26 days. There was no abscess recurred during the follow-up period for one year.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】  \n**(c)**\n\n【10】  \n**(d)**\n\n【11】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【12】Figure 1 \n\n【13】| (a) A cyst-mass in the area of hepatic portal pneumonia was seen through abdominal CT.

Discussion\n\n【15】Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the standard treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Growing experience with various laparoscopic techniques and the rapid advance in instrumentation have led to the use of the procedure not only electively but also in complicated gallstone disease or in patients with previous abdominal surgery with extensive adhesiolysis.\n\n【16】Duodenum injuries are extremely rare complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with potentially fatal consequences if not promptly recognized and treated. It was reported more frequently during 1990s when laparoscopic cholecystectomy was at its initial stage. In Marakis GN’s report, 1225 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed and duodenum injury happened in one case (0.08%) \\[1\\]. Duodenal perforations were usually caused by the improper use of irrigator-aspirator device, or by electrosurgical and laser burns, or compressed by Titanium clips \\[2\\]. Over the past 13-year period, 3000 laparoscopic cholecystectomies were performed in our institution. Duodenum injury only occurred in one patient who had undergone gastrectomy owing to duodenal diverticulum in 2010. The case in our report was asymptomatic during the immediate postoperative period. We had described a presumed conductive burn injury of the posterior second portion of the remaining duodenal diverticulum during retracting the duodenum. However, during dissection in the triangle of Calot, the remaining duodenal bulb diverticulum is at risk for direct contact burn or energy conduction burn. This unrecognized injury resulted in full-thickness necrosis of the thin wall of duodenal bulb with delayed perforation. In order to avoid the electrothermal injury of electrosurgical generator we often use ultrasound scalpel during the laparoscopic surgery. But the special history and anatomical abnormalities should be paid more attention during the operation.\n\n【17】Duodenum injuries are extremely fatal consequences if not promptly recognized and treated. El-Banna et al. reported four duodenal injury cases in 2000, three of them died \\[3\\]. Patients with a perforated duodenum usually present with an acute abdomen pain and more than 95% require emergency operative intervention. Testini et al. reported their experience of managing 5 patients affected by descending duodenal injuries secondary to laparoscopic cholecystectomy \\[4\\]. In all cases an emergency laparotomy was done. Two patients underwent direct suture of the duodenum and external biliary drainage through a T-tube; 1 case underwent a duodenojejunostomy and another duodenopancreatectomy.\n\n【18】In our report, this patient was successfully managed without laparotomy and the total costs of this patient were little more than those with no complications. It was due to the following factors. Firstly, delayed perforation of a duodenum creates a full-thickness hole, but free spillage is prevented by creation of a walled-off area with contiguous organs. The widespread peritonitis was not complained in this patient. Secondly, he has undergone Billroth II subtotal gastrectomy. Oral food does not transit through the duodenum and the healing of the duodenal perforation was not affected. Third, perforation in the duodenal cap had a better result than that at the descending duodenum or the duodenal papilla. And the latter is a more complicated anatomical position which can be affected by pancreatic fluid and bile severely.\n\n【19】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【20】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Signs and symptoms depend on the tumor location and size. The intrapericardial lipoma we report has massive dimensions and mimics a pericardial effusion. A 38-year-old male complained of dyspnea and precordial pain. On physical examination, heart sounds were diminished. The patient had received extensive medication for a clinically suspected pericardial effusion due to heart failure. A voluminous mass resembling fat within the pericardial sac was revealed by transesophageal echocardiography and a computed tomography scan. The tumor was removed successfully by a subxiphoid surgical approach. The diagnosis of a 635 gram intrapericardial lipoma was confirmed by pathological examination. After surgery, the patient recovered well and was completely asymptomatic at a follow-up at 90 days. No medications were being taken since. The diagnosis of a pericardial effusion should be secured by imaging exams to avoid unnecessary medications. Cardiac lipomas can be readily recognized by their typical features on radiologic imaging. The surgical pathology examination confirms the diagnosis and rules out malignancy criteria.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary heart neoplasms are rare diseases, and their incidence rate is up to 0.4% in necropsy series \\[1, 2\\]. Approximately 75% of these lesions are benign tumors, such as myxomas, rhabdomyomas, lipomas, fibromas, and teratomas \\[3–5\\]. Lipomas represent approximately 10% of all primary cardiac tumors \\[4–9\\]. Additionally, about 25% of cardiac lipomas are intramyocardial, 25% are extracavitary with an epicardial origin, and 50% are intracavitary with a subendocardial origin \\[4, 10, 11\\]. They usually appear on the walls of the right atrium or left ventricle \\[4, 8, 11, 12\\]. Typically, lipomas are found in adults by the fifth and sixth decades of life. However, they can occur at any age. Cardiac lipoma frequency is about equal in both genders \\[5, 11, 13–15\\].\n\n【4】Signs and symptoms vary according to the size and localization of the tumor. Cardiac lipomas can cause thoracic pain, fatigue, dyspnea, syncope, arrhythmias, or even sudden death. Nevertheless, most cases are asymptomatic \\[4, 5, 8, 11, 16, 17\\]. Imaging exams are essential for guiding the diagnosis, such as echocardiography, tomography, or magnetic resonance. To exclude a malignant neoplastic process, the surgical pathology examination is necessary. Encapsulated lesions constituted of typical and mature adipocytes favor a benign neoplasm \\[5, 11\\]. In this article, we report the case of a young male patient with a large intrapericardial lipoma compressing the heart and mimicking a pericardial effusion.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 38-year-old male has complained of progressive dyspnea and sporadic precordial pain related to moderate effort for 5 months. Physical examination showed normal peripheral perfusion, and no edema was detected. On auscultation, no murmurs were heard; however, heart sounds were diminished. Clinically, a pericardial effusion due to heart failure was suspected and treated with pharmacologic drugs. The patient received digoxin, aspirin, furosemide, spironolactone, and carvedilol for 8 weeks until imaging exams were performed.\n\n【7】Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a 79% ventricular ejection fraction and a hypoechoic mass within the pericardium attached to the free wall of the right ventricle and atria. A computed tomography scan showed an expansive mass in the anterior region of the pericardium with a homogeneously low density similar to fat. The tumor had a regular shape and measured 14.0 × 10.0 × 16.0 cm. The cardiac lesion extended from the upper to the lower thoracic region, displaced the heart backward, and reduced the right cardiac chambers (Figure 1).\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Voluminous pericardial mass. Pericardium tumor with a density similar to fat on a computed tomography scan. Note that the tumor causes posterior displacement of the heart and signs of a reduction in the dimensions of the right heart chambers.\n\n【12】The patient was submitted to a pericardial window via a subxiphoid surgical approach, in which a pedunculated epicardial tumor inserted in the right ventricle was resected. No cardiopulmonary bypass was needed. At gross examination, the tumor was split into two irregular fatty fragments measuring 22.5 × 9.0 × 4.0 cm and 21.0 × 15.0 × 2.0 cm and weighing 635 grams (Figure 2(a)). The histological exam revealed an encapsulated neoplasm formed by mature adipocytes (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)). No lipoblasts, cellular atypia, or mitosis were seen, and the diagnosis of lipoma was stated.\n\n【13】  \n**(a)**\n\n【14】  \n**(b)**\n\n【15】  \n**(c)**\n\n【16】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【17】Figure 2 \n\n【18】Voluminous intrapericardial lipoma. (a) Gross examination—fatty lobulated massive tumor covered by a fine fibrous capsule. (b) Microscopy—delicate fibrous capsule delineates the mass. (c) Mature adipocytes form the tumor. No atypia is observed.\n\n【19】Ten days after surgery, the patient was discharged from the hospital without any medications. At a follow-up at 90 days, the patient was completely asymptomatic.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】Most cardiac lipomas are asymptomatic. Therefore, the diagnosis of these benign neoplasms is frequently done on autopsies. Medical literature may underestimate their real prevalence \\[18\\]. Generally, they remain indolent for many years since clinical symptoms depend on the growth speed, position, and tumor size \\[19\\].\n\n【22】The majority of cardiac lipomas is sessile or polypoid masses implanted in the subendocardium or epicardium. Only 25% of cardiac lipomas arise within the myocardium \\[11, 20\\]. Often, lipomas arise from the epicardial fat and grow into the pericardial sac \\[11\\]. However, there are case reports of distinct sites, such as the right atrium \\[10\\], left atrium \\[21, 22\\], tricuspid valve \\[23, 24\\], mitral valve \\[25\\], right ventricle \\[26\\], left ventricle \\[20, 27\\], interventricular septum \\[12, 28\\], and inside the ventricular cavities themselves \\[29\\]. Size ranges from 1 to 15 cm in diameter, and weight such as 2 kg is described \\[20\\].\n\n【23】Symptoms occur when the mass compresses the cardiac chambers and causes hemodynamic changes. Sometimes, it may cause pericardial effusions \\[30\\]. Intrapericardial lipomas can cause dyspnea by reducing the pulmonary volume or by elevating the ventricular filling pressures \\[31\\]. Fatigue and thoracic pain, possibly by coronary artery compression, are less common clinical manifestations \\[11, 17\\]. Intracavitary lipomas can lead to heart failure, syncope, and sudden death \\[19\\]. Intramyocardial lipomas may result in conduction system disorders and arrhythmias \\[4, 32–35\\]. Our patient presented thoracic pain and dyspnea due to a voluminous intrapericardial lipomatous tumor compressing the cardiac chambers.\n\n【24】Chest radiography, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram, tomography scan, and magnetic resonance imaging play an important role in identifying the lipoma location and relationship to the heart \\[4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 36–38\\]. On chest radiography, cardiac lipomas may mimic hilar neoplasia, diaphragmatic herniation, or mediastinal mass \\[19\\]. An echocardiogram can usually define the position and size of the lipoma \\[11\\]. Tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging establish the fatty differentiation of the tumor, define precisely its insertion and relationship to the cardiac structures, and give additional information to rule out malignant neoplasms, such as liposarcomas \\[4, 8, 11, 39\\]. Coronary angiography can be useful in cases of coronary compression \\[4, 19\\].\n\n【25】Imaging exams are important to evaluate the biological behavior of heart tumors. However, malignancy and the definitive diagnosis can be made by histopathological examination only \\[18\\]. On gross examination, lipomas are bright yellow fatty nodules with a delicate capsule. The cut surface is greasy with fine fibrous trabeculae. Under the microscope, lipomas are constituted by mature adipose tissue. There may be areas of steatonecrosis and calcification. Ruling out well-differentiated liposarcomas can be problematic in some cases. The latter contains a few lipoblasts \\[11\\]. In our case, the histological exam excluded malignant criteria.\n\n【26】Although lipomas are benign and slow-growing tumors, the surgical approach is to prevent heart compression and hemodynamic changes \\[4, 11\\]. Surgery has satisfactory results and low mortality \\[8, 11, 40\\]. The complete removal of the tumor pedicle is crucial to avoid relapses \\[8, 11, 16, 26, 41\\]. Surgery scheduling depends upon many factors, especially on the tumor size and location \\[42, 43\\]. Our patient underwent an elective surgery with no complications nor relapses at his follow-up.\n\n【27】Pericardial lipomas’ signs and symptoms are variable. Indeed, most of the patients are asymptomatic. Conversely, surgical removal is necessary to prevent cardiac compression and to exclude malignancy through the histopathological examination.\n\n【28】#### Data Availability\n\n【29】The medical data used to support the findings of this study are restricted in order to protect patient privacy.\n\n【30】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【31】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

However, there is only little literature about cornu cutaneum on the nasal vestibule. We present an 82-year-old male patient with a necrotic, irregular shaped lesion with pedicle on the left nasal vestibule excised and diagnosed as cornu cutaneum.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cornu cutaneum is a relatively uncommon projectile, irregular, hyperkeratotic nodule that can be seen in places such as scalp, forehead, eyelids, ear, nose, lips, and upper extremities which are subjectable to sunlight \\[1\\]. Mostly they are believed to be benign lesions; but researches showed that they might be related to malignant or premalignant lesions \\[2\\]. It is believed that there is a relation between actinic keratosis, molluscum sebaceum, sebaceous carcinoma, warts, trichilemmoma, Bowen’s disease, epidermoid carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and basal cell carcinoma and cornu cutaneum \\[3–5\\].\n\n【4】Cornu cutaneum is a painless, avascular, necrotic, or keratotic lesion with histopathological examination with no living cells. Certain diagnosis is always made with biopsy.\n\n【5】Treatment is surgery with radical margins \\[6\\]. Excisional biopsy is enough for treatment of the lesion on head and face \\[6\\]. Shaving is an option only when there is no possibility of total excision and in sensitive cosmetic areas. Electrocauterization, cryotherapy, and laser ablation are alternative methods \\[7\\]. A yearly postoperative examination should be done to control the primary malignancy and check if there are any additional malignancies.\n\n【6】We present an 82-year-old male patient with a necrotic lesion on the left nasal vestibule excised with excisional biopsy and diagnosed as cornu cutaneum.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【8】A male patient of 82 years of age attended our clinic with pruritus and incrustation on nasal cavity. Incrustation was increasing and, after scratching, mass has fallen to pieces without any bleeding. Mass was increased in size again in the recent month and became visible from the outside of the nose (Figure 1). Patient had hypertension and benign prostate hypertrophy. He had no history of smoking. Physical examination showed a keratotic, irregular shaped crust with a pedicle on left lateral nasal vestibule. Lesion was excised by pedicle from vestibule (Figure 2). Bleeding did not occur. Pathological examination showed keratin lamellas which showed papillomatous improvement without any living cells (Figure 3). Patient had no necrotic tissues on his vestibule after 4 months postoperatively (Figure 4).\n\n【9】  \n\n【10】  \n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】Mass was developed as seen from the left nasal cavity of lateral wall of vestibule.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】Lesion was excised by pedicle from vestibule.\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Figure 3 \n\n【20】Pathological examination showed keratin lamellas which showed papillomatous improvement apart from any living cells.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 4 \n\n【24】Normal physical examination was seen after 4 months postoperatively.\n\n【25】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【26】Cornu cutaneum is a projectile, hyperkeratotic nodule in places of the body which are sensitive to sunlight and called cutaneous horns because of their similarity of their macroscopic shape \\[8\\]. Apart from sunlight, traumas are also included in their etiology as a case reported as cornu cutaneum on the feet of the patient \\[6\\]. Our patient had a lesion in nasal vestibule supporting the traumatic etiological factors. He felt itching as the mass grew and he scratched; therefore, repeated traumas were made by the patient himself.\n\n【27】Cornu cutaneum is generally a slow developing mass. Our patient had nasal obstruction symptoms for more than 3 months and the mass became visible from outside the nose within a month. Cornu cutaneum is generally a benign lesion but is reported to have relation with malignant or premalignant diseases. Histological researches show that basal membrane invasion supporting differential diagnosis should include a wide range from seborrheic keratosis to squamous cell carcinoma \\[8, 9\\]. Predisposing factors include benign (seborrheic keratosis, viral verrucae, and molluscum contagiosum), premalignant (solar keratosis, arsenic keratosis, and Bowen’s disease), and malignant (squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, granular cell tumours, sebaceous carcinomas, and Kaposi’s sarcoma) diseases. Differential diagnosis can only be made by careful histopathological investigation of the basal lamina \\[1\\].\n\n【28】Excisional biopsy can be made for diagnosis and treatment. We treated and diagnosed our patient with excisional biopsy. Isolated cornu cutaneum has dead keratin cells without any living tissues \\[1\\]. Our pathological examination also showed papillomatous keratin lamellas without any alive cells.\n\n【29】As a result, as mostly seen in places which are sensitive to sunlight, cornu cutaneum from nasal vestibule is a rare disease \\[10\\] which is a slow developing benign lesion characterized by necrotic tissues without any living cells microscopically.\n\n【30】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】Apart from sunlight, traumas are included in etiology of cornu cutaneum. As mostly seen in places sensitive to sunlight, cornu cutaneum from nasal vestibule is uncommon suggesting the effect of traumas. Pathological examination also showed papillomatous keratin lamellas without any alive cells. There are a few reported cases of cornu cutaneum resulting from nasal vestibule. Our case is important as nasal vestibule is a rare place for cornu cutaneum to be seen.\n\n【32】#### Consent\n\n【33】The patient in this paper has given his informed consent for the case report to be published.\n\n【34】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【35】All the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "2e011d76-40f0-49bd-aa97-8d5f1193f555", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Angiomyofibroblastoma (AMFB) is a rare benign mesenchymal tumour that occurs almost exclusively in the vulvovaginal region of women but can also occur occasionally in the inguinoscrotal region of men. It is a well-circumscribed lesion that clinically is often thought to represent a Bartholin's gland cyst and usually does not form a pedunculated mass. To our knowledge, only five cases of vulvar AMFB with pedunculated mass have been reported in the English literature and all cases involving the labia majora and middle-aged women. We report the first case of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva occurring in a young woman of 21 years old and involving the left labia minora. After excluding the most common diseases, pedunculated AMFB should be part of differential diagnosis in the workup of any pedunculated vulvar mass even in young women with a lesion involving the labia minora. We reviewed the literature and summarized all reported cases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Angiomyofibroblastoma (AMFB) is a rare benign mesenchymal tumor usually occurring in the vulvovaginal area of middle-aged women \\[1–3\\]. Histologically, the tumor is a well-circumscribed lesion composed of alternating hypo- and hypercellular areas with numerous delicate capillary-sized vessels \\[4\\]. AMFB can be distinguished from the aggressive angiomyxoma by its circumscribed borders, the presence of plump stromal cells, and perivascular condensation of the stromal cells \\[5\\]. Immunoreactivity for both desmin and vimentin is detected in almost all tumor cells, which also reveal estrogen and progesterone receptors \\[6\\]. Clinically, AMFB shows a slowly growing mass which is often misdiagnosed as a Bartholin’s gland cyst and usually does not form a pedunculated mass \\[7\\]. To our knowledge, only five cases of vulvar AMFB with pedunculated mass have been reported in the English literature and all cases involving the labia majora and middle-aged women \\[1, 7–10\\]. We report the first case of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva occurring in a young woman of 21 years old and involving the left labia minora.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 21-year-old woman came to our observation reporting the presence of a painless vulvar neoformation starting four years before, which had grown during the last months. She ignored the mass, despite its gradual enlargement during her disease course, and the complaint was of discomfort when seated and a localized burning sensation. Her personal history was noncontributory for previous surgery and laboratory data (emocrome, transaminase, sideremia, ferritin, creatinine, coagulation) showed no significant abnormalities. Clinical examination showed a pedunculated bilobulated neoformation of ten centimeters in diameter of tense elastic consistency, at the level of the left labia minora (Figure 1). On gynecological examination and vaginal ultrasound, the uterus and bilateral uterine adnexae showed no abnormalities. Inguinal lymph nodes were not swollen and tumor markers (cancer antigen (CA) 125, CA-19.9, CA-15.3, Alphafetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen) were negative. These markers were performed to exclude a concomitant malignancy in other locations. On ultrasound examination the mass revealed a well-demarcated soft tissue tumor with homogeneous echo and normal vascularity. In order to exclude a surgical disease, such as perineal hernia \\[11–13\\], the patient was evaluated by surgeons that, according with personal history, clinical examination, and ultrasonography, excluded a lesion of their interest.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】| The tumor shows a pedunculated large mass arising from the labia minora with a subtle stalk. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】The mass gave a clinical impression of vulvar fibroid, and a simple tumor excision was subsequently performed at the site of the stalk. During surgery, to exclude a malignancy lesion, a rapid intraoperative pathologic diagnosis of the tumor was performed, and it was reported as a benign soft lesion of the vulva. On gross examination, the lesion was well circumscribed, weighed 1230 gr, had a soft to firm consistency, and appeared homogeneously light gray to tan in color on the cut surface. No foci of hemorrhage nor necrosis was detected.\n\n【11】Microscopically, the mass consisted of fibroconnective tissue with abundant vessels of various wall thickness (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). No mitotic or atypical cells were seen, and the stroma was edematous. In immunohistochemistry, tumor cells were strongly positive for desmin and estrogen receptors (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)) and negative for 𝛼 \\-smooth muscle actin, S-100 protein, cytokeratin, and CD34. All these features were in favour of the diagnosis of AMFB. Surgical margins of the lesion were clear, and the pedicle was not involved by the tumor.\n\n【12】  \n**(a)**\n\n【13】  \n**(b)**\n\n【14】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】| (a) Photomicrograph (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×2) showing pedunculated lesion covered with skin.

Discussion\n\n【24】This distinctive tumor was first delineated by Fletcher et al. in 1992 who described 10 cases involving the vulva \\[8\\] with only one case reporting a large pedunculated mass. There is a marked predilection for the female genital tract, predominantly the vulva, although rare cases have also been reported to arise in the scrotum and the inguinal area in males \\[8, 14\\]. The female patients have an average age of 45.8 years \\[5\\]. They usually complain of a painless mass that has been present from a few weeks to up to 13 years \\[5\\]. Clinically, these tumors are frequently thought to be a Bartholin gland cyst, although a preoperative differential diagnosis includes labial cysts, inguinal hernia, leiomyoma, and mesenchymal tumors such as lipoma and liposarcoma \\[15\\].\n\n【25】On gross examination they are typically well circumscribed and ranged from 0.5 to 12 cm. They have a soft to rubbery consistency and a bulging, pink, and somewhat lobulated sectioned surface \\[5\\]. Microscopic examination confirms the well-demarcated nature of the lesion and shows alternating hypercellular and hypocellular edematous regions with abundant blood vessels. There is minimal nuclear atypicality, and mitotic figures are rare. The cells tend to cluster around blood vessels, sometime forming compact foci \\[5\\]. Adipocytes can be sparsely scattered within the neoplasm and in rare cases fat predominates; these tumors have been classified as the “lipomatous” variant of angiomyofibroblastoma \\[16\\]. The angiomyofibroblastoma can be distinguished from the aggressive angiomyxoma by its circumscribed borders, the presence of plump stromal cells that are occasionally overtly epithelioid, and perivascular condensation of the stromal cells \\[17\\]. A single case of a malignant transformation of an AMFB in angiomyofibrosarcoma has been reported \\[18\\]. In that tumor, areas of typical AMFB merged imperceptibly with high-grade sarcoma resembling a myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma.\n\n【26】Immunohistochemical stains show uniform staining for vimentin and staining of a variable number of cells for desmin in most cases. The tumor cells also show variable expression for muscle actin and smooth muscle actin and are frequently positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors \\[5\\]. The expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors suggests that it might arise as a neoplastic proliferation of hormonally responsible mesenchymal cells \\[3\\]. Some tumors have also stained for CD34, although some authors question whether these CD34 positive tumors might present fibroepithelial polyps, which are frequently positive for this marker \\[16\\].\n\n【27】The tumor usually exists as a sharply circumscribed mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the vulva and usually does not form a pedunculated mass, which represents an exceptional event \\[7\\]. To our knowledge, only five cases of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva have been reported in the English literature \\[1, 7–10\\].\n\n【28】All cases are reported in Table 1. All patients underwent simple excision. The mean age of patients was 46.4 years with a range of 41–50 years. The lesion always involved the labia majora. The average size of the pedunculated AMFB was of 14.2 × 13.6 centimeters in diameter (range 4 to 23 cm). Except for one case, the presence of the lesion had existed for several years. The real problem is the preoperative clinical diagnosis, as the vulvar AMFB is a rare event revealed only by histological examination after surgery. All patients had an uneventful postoperative course, and the mean followup was of 20 months (ranging from 8 months to 3 years) with no recurrence.\n\n【29】Table 1 \n\n【30】Clinical features of pedunculated AMFB of the vulva.\n\n【31】Table 2 shows immunohistochemical staining for the most common antibodies in the AMFB. Almost all tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin and desmin, but uniformly negative for cytokeratin and S-100 protein. Not all tumor cells were negative for 𝛼 \\-smooth muscle actin and CD34. Staining for estrogen and progesterone receptors was observed in the nucleus of all tumor cells.\n\n【32】Table 2 \n\n【33】Immunohistochemical staining for the most common antibodies in the AMFB.\n\n【34】Given the data reported in the literature on the pedunculated AMFB of the vulva, our case is the first concerning a young woman of 21 years old and involving the labia minora. The patient underwent simple excision with clear margin of the lesion and currently is in followup performing clinical examination every six months for two years with no recurrence.\n\n【35】This paper aims to emphasize that, after excluding the most common vulvar diseases, the appearance of a pedunculated AMFB should be part of differential diagnosis in the workup of any pedunculated vulvar mass even in young women with a lesion involving the labia minora. The treatment of choice is a surgical excision with clear margins, which is resolutive as demonstrated by reported cases in the literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present the case of a 48-year-old male patient on chronic prednisone therapy for rheumatoid arthritis with a history of mitral valve replacement with prosthetic valve. He presented with fever, dizziness, dyspnea on exertion, intermittent chest pain, and palpitations. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed two medium-sized densities along the inner aspect of the sewing ring and one larger density along the atrial surface of the sewing ring consistent with vegetation. Two separate blood cultures grew _Corynebacterium propinquum_, which were sensitive to ceftriaxone but highly resistant to vancomycin and daptomycin. The patient completed a course of ceftriaxone and repeat TEE study and after 6 weeks demonstrated near complete resolution of the vegetation. To our knowledge, this case represents the first in the literature of _Corynebacterium propinquum_ causing prosthetic valve endocarditis. The ability of these organisms to cause deep-seated systemic infections should be recognized, especially in immune-compromised patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) remains a rare but very serious complication of valve replacement. The incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis ranges from 1% to 6% of valve implantations \\[1\\]. The most commonly reported pathogens causing PVE are coagulase-negative staphylococci, _Staphylococcus aureus_, and Gram-negative bacilli \\[2\\]. _Corynebacterium propinquum_ is primarily isolated from the human respiratory tract \\[3\\]. It has been shown to be the pathogenic organism in two cases of native valve infective endocarditis, one in an adult and one in a child with congenital heart disease \\[4, 5\\]. It was also shown to be the causative agent in a handful of respiratory tract infections worldwide \\[6–8\\]. We present the case of a 48-year-old male with late PVE caused by _Corynebacterium propinquum_. To our knowledge, this case represents the first in the literature of _Corynebacterium propinquum_ causing prosthetic valve endocarditis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 48-year-old male presented with five to six weeks of dizziness with episodes of subjective fever. Patient also reported having increasing dyspnea on exertion associated with intermittent sharp chest pain, unrelated to exertion, and palpitations lasting 20–30 seconds per episode. Additionally, he complained of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea but denied orthopnea, peripheral edema, recent dental work, surgical procedure, or intravenous drug use. He has a significant past medical history of hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis on chronic low dose prednisone therapy, and rheumatic heart disease not on antibiotic prophylaxis. The patient had a mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve 27 years priorly, which was subsequently replaced with a metallic valve 12 years ago. The patient had a pacemaker placed for symptomatic bradycardia 12 years ago.\n\n【6】On admission, the patient was an ill appearing male and was complaining of a dull aching chest pain 4/10 in intensity. Vital signs were significant for fever of 101.6°F (38.6°C). Physical examination revealed tactile fever, clear breath sounds, and metallic S1. Laboratory findings showed a hemoglobin of 8.3 g/dL, leukocytosis of 17,900/uL with 91% PMNs, INR of 6.1, Troponin-I of 0.534 ng/mL, ESR of 85, and C-reactive protein of 20.70 mg/dL. Patient also had an elevated creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL. Prosthetic valve endocarditis was suspected and the patient received broad-spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin, cefepime, and gentamicin. Vancomycin was changed to daptomycin due to worsening renal function. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed mild left ventricular dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 50%. It also showed a mechanical prosthesis in the mitral position with two medium-sized, strand-like, echogenic, highly mobile densities along the inner aspect of the sewing ring and one larger echogenic, spherical density, measuring 9 × 5 mm along the atrial surface of the sewing ring, consistent with vegetation as shown in Figure 1.

Discussion\n\n【19】The genus _Corynebacterium_ has more than 80 published species of which over 50 can cause occasional or rare infections in humans \\[9\\]. _Corynebacterium_ species are normal colonizers of the skin and mucous membranes and are often dismissed as culture contaminants. It is thought that the incidence of nondiphtheria _Corynebacterium_ is increasing, especially as a cause of nosocomial infections and infections in immunocompromised patients \\[3\\]. In our case, the patient was on prednisone, which could have contributed to development of infection with _Corynebacterium_. In recent literature, there have been an increasing number of reports of _Corynebacterium_ species causing prosthetic valve endocarditis \\[10\\].\n\n【20】_Corynebacterium propinquum_ is primarily isolated from the human respiratory tract \\[3\\]. It has been shown to be the pathogenic organism in two cases of native valve infective endocarditis, one in an adult and one in a child with congenital heart disease \\[4, 5\\]. It has also been reported as the causative agent in a handful of respiratory tract infections worldwide \\[6–8\\]. It has also been reported to cause acute nongonococcal urethritis in one patient from Iran \\[11\\]. To our knowledge, this is the first report of _Corynebacterium propinquum_ causing prosthetic valve endocarditis. The susceptibility pattern for the strain of _C. propinquum_ from our case showed high resistance to vancomycin and daptomycin, which is unusual for this species. As in other studies, it was susceptible to beta-lactams and an aminoglycoside as well as other antibiotics \\[4, 5\\]. Due to the rarity of infections caused by this bacteria, it would be premature to make assumptions regarding resistance patterns.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】_Corynebacterium_ species are becoming recognized as an increasing cause of opportunistic infections. In our case, the patient had risk factors of immune suppression as well as a prosthetic valve resulting in this very rare infection. _C. propinquum_ has now been shown to be a cause of not only infective endocarditis but also prosthetic valve endocarditis and nosocomial infections. Physicians should be cognizant of potential serious infections caused by _C. propinquum_ in the correct clinical context. Proper identification of _Corynebacterium_ species and recognition of its ability to be pathologic is important in order to inform prompt and appropriate treatment.\n\n【23】#### Competing Interests\n\n【24】The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Bowel perforation in a pregnant patient with COVID-19 infection is a rarely reported complication. With the uncovering of the different treatment modalities and complications of this disease, this case highlights diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas and limitations in a special population. _Clinical Presentation_. A 35-year-old female, Gravida 2 Para 1 at 31 weeks age of gestation (AOG) who underwent cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status in 2019, was admitted for severe COVID-19 infection presenting with dyspnea. During her hospitalization, she developed progressive dyspnea from worsening of COVID-19 infection. Patient was eventually intubated and was given a total of two doses of tocilizumab, adequate antibiotic treatment, remdesivir, and dexamethasone. An emergency repeat cesarean section was performed due to maternal deterioration and poor variability of the fetus. She delivered to a live preterm baby girl, with an Apgar score of 1 and 7 on the 1st and 5th minute of life respectively. During the postoperative days, patient remained intubated and sedated. Increasing residuals were noted per nasogastric tube (NGT). Serial scout film of the abdomen (SFA) and medical management were performed. Upon weaning from sedation, patient complained of right lower quadrant pain. A whole abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast was requested which revealed large bowel obstruction. Patient was referred to surgery service. Upon assessment, abdomen was noted to be rigid with guarding during palpation. A scout film of the abdomen was requested and revealed extensive amount of pneumoperitoneum with scanty to absent colonic gas suggestive of bowel perforation. Patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy. Upon opening the peritoneum, free air was evacuated. Approximately 1.4 liters of fecaloid peritoneal fluid was suctioned and adhesive band was noted at the pelvic area. A 2 cm full thickness perforation at the cecum with 17 cm serosal tear from the cecum to ascending colon was noted. Bowel loops proximal to the perforation were dilated. Nasogastric tube was inserted for bowel decompression. Right hemicolectomy was performed. Specimen was sent for histopathology. Acute inflammatory cells infiltrating the blood vessels and possible microthrombi and beginning thrombus formation were noted in the subserosa. Patient eventually expired on the 14<sup>th</sup> hospital day from sepsis. _Conclusion_. This case highlights a rarely reported complication of COVID-19 infection. Confluence of factors that predisposed the patient include pregnancy, COVID-19 infection, use of tocilizumab, and recent surgery. High index of suspicion is vital in the management and improvement of outcomes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2), was initially characterized with respiratory symptoms. However, patients with severe to critical COVID-19 infection are at a particularly high risk for developing gastrointestinal complications due to prolonged hospitalization \\[1\\].\n\n【4】Pregnant people may be particularly susceptible to COVID-19 because the physiologic changes of pregnancy involve alterations in immune system, which may result in an altered response to infection during pregnancy \\[2\\]. Morelli et al. in 1953 were the first to propose the concept of immune tolerance during pregnancy \\[3\\]. They hypothesized that the semi allogeneic fetus is able to survive due to regulation of the immunologic interactions between the mother and the fetus. Such regulation can be caused by a lack of fetal antigen expression and/or functional suppression of maternal immune response which could possibly predispose a pregnant patient to severe COVID-19 infection.\n\n【5】The conception of different therapeutic modalities for this disease has been evolving. The COVID-19 treatment guidelines panel recommends against withholding treatment for COVID-19 infection in a pregnant patient \\[4\\]. Termination of pregnancy and mode of delivery are also important issues in this population. Cesarean delivery should not be considered medically reasonable until it becomes, ethically or medically obligatory for either maternal or fetal indications \\[5\\].\n\n【6】This is a case of bowel perforation in a 35-year-old female patient with critical COVID-19 infection with no past history of gastrointestinal disease.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 35-year-old female, Gravida 2 Para 1 at 31 weeks age of gestation (AOG) who underwent cesarean section for nonreassuring fetal status in 2019, coming in for dyspnea. She had no history of gastrointestinal disease and had no COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n【9】At the time of admission, the patient was conscious, coherent, and in mild cardiorespiratory distress and with desaturation as low as 88% at room air. Examination of the chest revealed bibasal crackles. The abdomen was globular, normoactive, with palpable good fetal movement and good fetal heart tones were appreciated, and was nontender on all quadrants. She was initially managed as a case of severe COVID-19 infection and was given adequate antibiotics, a total of two doses of tocilizumab, remdesivir, and dexamethasone.\n\n【10】During her admission, patient had progression of dyspnea and hemodynamic instability, hence intubation was performed. It was also noted that the fetus had poor variability in the fetal cardiotocogram. A decision was made to perform an emergency repeat cesarean section. She delivered to a live preterm baby girl, with an Apgar score of 1 and 7 on the 1st and 5th minute of life respectively. Apgar score 1, 7 with a birth weight of 1520 grams. After the first week of admission, residuals of 150 milliliters per nasogastric tube (NGT) with no bowel movement for 3 days was noted. Medical management was conducted. Serial scout film of the abdomen (SFA) revealed only the presence of ileus with no evidence of pneumoperitoneum (Figure 1).\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Figure 1 \n\n【14】Serial scout film of the abdomen. Description: regression of ileus; there is a decrease in number and amount of air-filled small bowel segments with no organizing pattern.\n\n【15】While weaning from sedation, she complained of right lower quadrant pain. On assessment, abdomen was soft but with direct tenderness at the right lower quadrant with consideration of possible appendicitis. Hence, A whole abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan with contrast (Figure 2) was requested which revealed large bowel obstruction. Patient was then referred to surgery service.\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 2 \n\n【19】Whole abdominal CT scan with contrast. Description: large bowel obstruction with transition point at the rectosigmoid junction, likely from postoperative adhesions; pneumatosis coli in the cecum and ascending colon; no ascites, pneumoperitoneum, or enlarged lymph nodes; prominent-sized appendix without inflammatory changes; and anteverted and globularly enlarged uterus with a prominent endometrium.\n\n【20】On assessment, abdomen was noted to be rigid with guarding during palpation. A scout film of the abdomen (Figure 3) was requested and revealed extensive amount of free intraperitoneal air (as pointed by the blue arrows) with lucency in the subdiaphragmatic area (as pointed by the red arrow). The patient underwent emergency exploratory laparotomy.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 3 \n\n【24】Scout film of the abdomen. Follow-up study to the previous scout film of the abdomen, now demonstrates extensive amount of free intraperitoneal air as pointed by the blue arrows with lucency in the subdiaphragmatic area as pointed by the red arrow. Description: interval demonstration of extensive amount of pneumoperitoneum with scanty to absent colonic gas in the present study; regression of the ileus; gastric distention.\n\n【25】Upon opening the peritoneum, free air was evacuated. Approximately 1.4 liters of fecaloid peritoneal fluid was suctioned and adhesive band was noted at the pelvic area. A 2 cm full thickness perforation at the cecum with 17 cm serosal tear from the cecum to ascending colon was noted. Bowel loops proximal to the perforation were dilated. Bowel decompression was performed via NGT. Right hemicolectomy was performed. Specimen (terminal ileum to proximal transverse colon) was sent for histopathology (Figure 4) which revealed acute inflammatory cells infiltrating the blood vessels and possible microthrombi and beginning thrombus formation were noted in the subserosa. Patient eventually expired on the 14th hospital day from sepsis.\n\n【26】  \n\n【27】  \n\n【28】Figure 4 \n\n【29】Gross specimen. Description: upon opening the peritoneum, free air was evacuated.

Discussion\n\n【31】Pregnant women do not appear to have an increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection. However, those who are infected (Figure 5) seem to be at higher risk (Figure 6) for developing severe illness \\[2\\]. Majority of symptomatic gravid COVID-19 patients were at their third trimester of pregnancy \\[6\\]. In a study conducted by Allotey et al., it was reported that the prevalence of all-cause mortality was 0.63%, severe COVID-19 was 13%, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) was 4%, and pregnant women requiring invasive ventilation was at 3% \\[7\\]. For the fetal considerations, impact of prolonged maternal hypoxemia, which may be significant, given the protracted clinical course of COVID-19, balanced against the risks associated with delivery at a given gestational age. The fetal risks associated with prematurity are well known and decrease with increasing gestational age at delivery \\[5\\]. Failure to perform cesarean delivery when this deliberative clinical judgment is justified increases risk of harm, bothto the fetus and the pregnant patient. Hence, ethically speaking, the mother may be allowed to subject herself and the fetus to a reasonable risk for their mutual benefit.\n\n【32】  \n\n【33】  \n\n【34】Figure 5 \n\n【35】Blood vessel infiltrated with acute inflammatory cells and areas in the subserosa with possible microthrombi and beginning thrombus formation.\n\n【36】  \n\n【37】  \n\n【38】Figure 6 \n\n【39】Serosal congestion and periappendicitis.\n\n【40】Although adhesions from previous abdominal surgery could have predisposed the patient to developing bowel obstruction leading to subsequent bowel perforation, we explored other contributory factors that led to this complication.\n\n【41】Throughout pandemic it appears that patients with COVID-19 fulfill the classic Virchow’s triad required for development of thrombosis \\[8\\]. Endothelial injury associated with immune complex-mediated vasculitis has also been postulated as one of the mechanisms behind vascular damage in COVID-19. Both of these in combination can cause endothelial dysfunction and predispose a patient to thrombus formation. Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state with increased thrombin production and increase in intravascular inflammation. During pregnancy, there are higher levels of circulating coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, such as plasmin, and these may be implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pregnant women are at increased risk of thromboembolic events with associated mortality. Therefore, pregnant women with COVID-19 may have additive or synergistic risk factors for thrombosis. Stasis can be expected in all critically ill patients because of isolation in a confined area, prolonged bed rest, immobilization in the intensive care unit, and possible limitations to physiotherapy. Lastly, although not part of Virchow’s triad, hemodynamic instability in severe COVID-19 infection leading to hypotension and shock can be a possible mechanism of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia seen in these patients.\n\n【42】Another possible but rare etiology for bowel perforation is the use of tocilizumab infusion. Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist that is being used for the profound inflammatory state associated with COVID-19 infection. In mice, interleukin-6 stimulates intestinal epithelial proliferation, decreases intestinal injury, and improves barrier function following ischemia reperfusion of the small bowel. Interleukin-6 null mice exhibited impaired recovery following massive enterectomy and increased apoptosis \\[9\\]. Therefore, tocilizumab may interfere with recovery from intestinal injuries caused by diverticulitis or other gastrointestinal conditions.\n\n【43】Pregnant women with COVID-19 infection had worse consequences compared with nonpregnant women \\[10\\]. In critically ill patients with COVID-19, prognosis is poor with mortality ranging from 12 to 78% with a mean average of 25 to 50 percent, and 92% of the deaths occurring within the immediate postoperative days due to multiorgan failure or refractory septic shock \\[11\\].\n\n【44】Our patient was pregnant with COVID-19 infection. The modulations of the maternal immune system in pregnancy may affect the response to infections, and specifically to viruses. The altered inflammatory response to viruses during pregnancy is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by the certain mechanisms which can predispose the patient to severe to critical COVID-19 infection in pregnancy necessitating an emergency repeat cesarean section delivery because of deteriorating maternal status which predisposed her to developing adhesions. These adhesions could have predisposed the patient to developing large bowel obstruction and subsequent bowel perforation. Pregnancy placed the patient in a hypercoagulable state that may lead to formation of microthrombi causing ileus. Other factor such as recent surgery could also lead to ileus, which again could lead to large bowel obstruction and subsequent bowel perforation. In severe to critical COVID-19, tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 antagonist, is used on compassionate grounds for treatment of COVID-19 cytokine storm \\[12\\]. In a study conducted by Nakajima et al., they noted that there is no increased rates of spontaneous abortion or congenital abnormalities secondary to exposure to tocilizumab during pregnancy \\[13\\]. However, tocilizumab may interfere with recovery from injuries due to impaired intestinal cell proliferation leading to bowel ulceration. Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation is an uncommon but serious adverse effect in tocilizumab therapy.\n\n【45】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【46】The modulations of the maternal immune system in pregnancy may affect the response to infections, and specifically to viruses. Pregnant women do not appear to have an increased risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection. However, those who are infected seem to be at higher risk for developing severe illness. Patients with severe COVID-19 are at a particularly high risk for developing gastrointestinal complications. Gastrointestinal perforation is an uncommon but serious adverse event in tocilizumab therapy and COVID-19 related vasculitis. High index of suspicion is vital in the management and improvement of outcomes.\n\n【47】#### Data Availability\n\n【48】The article is a case report written regarding a gravid patient who developed COVID-19 and its complications.

{"seq_id": "df10b951-6b76-4a67-9d7b-36be860e6a91", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Leiomyosarcoma arising from the external iliac vein is uncommon. This is a report of a 51-year-old Japanese man with venous leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein. The tumor was found during a medical examination, and the patient had no symptoms. Computed tomography showed a 72 × 49 mm mass adjacent to the left external iliac vein. The tumor was resected en-block along with ligation of the external iliac vein due to strong adhesion with the tumor. Histological examination showed venous leiomyosarcoma, and its origin was thought to be a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein. The patient has remained free from recurrence at 30 months after surgery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Leiomyosarcomas account for approximately 6% of all soft tissue sarcomas, and venous leiomyosarcomas account for 2% of all leiomyosarcomas \\[1\\]. Venous leiomyosarcomas commonly arise from the inferior vena cava, pulmonary vein, femoral vein, great saphenous vein, and jugular vein \\[2\\]. A venous leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein is rare, and this may be the first report of this finding. Generally, the prognosis of leiomyosarcoma is poor. Chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy can be performed to improve the prognosis, but their efficacy remains debatable. Only complete resection of the tumor is necessary for long-term survival. In the present case, there has been no evidence of recurrence at 30 months after complete surgical resection along with ligation of the left external iliac vein.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 51-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for abnormal ultrasound findings during a medical examination. He had no complaints or relevant family history. His past history included diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. Physical examination showed nothing of note. Laboratory findings, including serum concentrations of oncological markers such as alpha fetoprotein, cancer antigen 19–9, neuron-specific enolase, and carcinoembryonic antigen, were within the normal range. A contrast computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 72 × 49 mm mass closely adjoining the left external iliac vein. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the mass was isointense with muscle in the T1-weighted image (Figure 1(a)). A positron-emission computed tomography (PET-CT) scan showed abnormal integration at the tumor site (Figure 1(b)). These findings suggested that the tumor was a leiomyosarcoma probably derived from the left external iliac vein.\n\n【6】  \n**(a)**\n\n【7】  \n**(b)**\n\n【8】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】(a) Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the tumor (T) was isointense with muscle (M) in the T1-weighted image. The tumor adjoins the left external iliac vein (arrow). (b) Positron-emission computed tomography scan showed abnormal integration at the tumor site.\n\n【11】Before surgery, we discussed with the vascular surgeons how to deal with the left iliac vein. In general, blood vessel reconstruction and subsequent anticoagulation therapy are performed. However, the patient was engaged in physical labor and did not want to take an anticoagulant after surgery. So, we finally decided to perform combined resection of the left iliac vein with the tumor. Extirpation of the tumor was performed. We could easily peel the tumor from surrounding tissue except at the left external iliac vein where, as predicted, the tumor was strongly adhered. Therefore, complete tumor resection was achieved by combined resection of the external iliac vein.\n\n【12】Pathological examination revealed a gross, well-defined, firm tumor of 60-mm at the greatest diameter. The cut surface was gray-white with a whorled appearance. Microscopically, the tumor was mostly composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with a mild to moderate degree of cellular pleomorphism and was considered to be a low-grade leiomyosarcoma. Furthermore, there were focal areas of high cellularity and bizarre nuclei (Figure 2(a)). Immunostaining for _α_\\-SMA (Figure 2(b)) was positive, and that for S-100, c-kit, and DOG-1 were negative. The positive ratio of MIB-1 was low at 5–10% (Figure 2(c)). Contrary to expectation, the tumor was separated from external iliac vein, where only fibrous adhesions without infiltration were present (Figure 2(d)). There was a thick blood vessel in the tumor that was thought to be a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein (Figure 3(a)). Its vessel intima was preserved, and immunochemical staining for CD31 was positive (Figure 3(b)). However, the tunica media and tunica externa of this vascular wall were diminished and completely replaced by tumor cells (Figures 3(c) and 3(d)). Therefore, we definitively diagnosed venous leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein.\n\n【13】  \n**(a)**\n\n【14】  \n**(b)**\n\n【15】  \n**(c)**\n\n【16】  \n**(d)**\n\n【17】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【18】Figure 2 \n\n【19】(a) There were areas with high cellularity and bizarre nuclei.

(c) The tunica media and tunica externa of this vascular wall were diminished and completely replaced by tumor cells. (d) The vessel intima was completely replaced by tumor cells, and the vessel wall structure was diminished.\n\n【27】Immediately after surgery, the patient developed left leg pain and swelling. However, the painful swelling of his left thigh improved one week later and ultimately disappeared by about 3 months after surgery. The patient has remained free from recurrence at 30 months after surgery.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【29】Vascular leiomyosarcomas usually arise from a vein, approximately 5 times more often than from an artery \\[1, 3\\]. A preference for the female sex has been reported: 82.6% of all patients are female, and leiomyosarcomas usually appear around 50–60 years of age \\[4\\]. Primary venous leiomyosarcomas arise from vascular smooth muscle cells, and the growth pattern may progress from intramural to endoluminal, extraluminal, or mixed forms \\[5, 6\\]. The endoluminal pattern has a worse prognosis than the extraluminal pattern because of its high rate of metastasis.\n\n【30】Standard treatment for vascular leiomyosarcoma is surgical resection, and 40–60% of patients undergo surgery \\[7\\]. Optimal treatments with chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not yet been established. When curative surgical resection is performed, the rates of 3- and 5-year survival are 76% and 33%, respectively. If a curative operation is not performed, the prognosis is bad \\[8\\]. However, an aggressive surgical approach assuring a free en-bloc tumor resection can be curative despite a reported local recurrence rate of 53.7% in selected cases at an average of 25 months after surgery \\[4, 9, 10\\]. In our investigation, we found a few reports of leiomyosarcomas arising from the external iliac vein, but no report of leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of this vein. These reports showed that such leiomyosarcomas may have a relatively good prognosis. The reason for this may be that the tumor growth pattern likely progresses from intramural to extraluminal. When the tumor progresses endoluminally, symptoms such as leg pain, swelling, and leg numbness appear immediately due to constriction of the external iliac vein. For this reason, a leiomyosarcoma originating from the external iliac vein can be detected early and the patient can undergo a curative operation; thus, their prognosis is relatively good.\n\n【31】In most of the reports of vascular leiomyosarcomas originating from the external iliac vein, blood vessel reconstruction was performed. However, a recent report revealed that blood vessel reconstruction had a higher incidence of thrombosis while providing no additional benefit in reducing symptomatic extremity edema compared to ligation in patients with isolated external iliac vein injuries \\[11\\]. Furthermore, patients who underwent blood vessel reconstruction must permanently take anticoagulants. We ligated the left external iliac vein in our patient immediately after surgery; although he suffered left leg pain and swelling, it had resolved by 3 months later. He does not take anticoagulants. Thus, ligation of the external iliac vein as curative surgery for vascular leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the external iliac vein may be one viable treatment option.\n\n【32】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【33】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "bad8a629-49ee-4a34-8ea5-b969ca56c1f3", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Although tibial end avulsions of the anterior cruciate ligament are relatively common in clinical practice, avulsions of the femoral end of this ligament are by comparison rare. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a bony avulsion injury, which was presumed to have arisen from the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament but turned out instead to be an osteochondral avulsion fracture of the femoral origin. This unexpected finding that was not detected during preoperative workup resulted in the first attempt at surgical fixation being aborted. The need for a second planned definitive fixation procedure emphasises the importance of combining a thorough history and examination in association with appropriate imaging in the patient workup. The patient’s definitive operative treatment and outcome are described. Although rare, surgeons (and emergency room doctors) treating such patients should include femoral end avulsion injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament in the differential diagnosis of a child presenting with an acute haemarthrosis of the knee. Furthermore, once diagnosed, early onward referral to an experienced knee surgeon is advocated.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In the skeletally immature because ligamentous structures are stronger than their osseous attachments, intrasubstance ligament injuries are rare \\[1\\]; therefore, in the context of the paediatric knee, injuries that stress the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) usually result in chondral or osteochondral avulsion fracture, characteristically from the tibial attachment of the ligament \\[2\\], resulting in a tibial spine avulsion fracture. By comparison, avulsions of the ACL from the femoral origin are rare, and to date only nine other cases of femoral end avulsion injuries of the ACL have been reported in the English-speaking literature. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a femoral ended osteochondral avulsion injury of the ACL. Despite their rare occurrence, femoral end avulsions of the ACL should be included in the differential diagnosis of a child with an acute haemarthrosis of the knee.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 11-year-old male patient presented to our institution after sustaining trauma to his left lower extremity. On the day of presentation, there had been high winds in the vicinity resulting in the corrugated iron roof of a garage he had been walking nearby blowing off and landing on his left leg. The patient was trapped under the sheet of metal until freed by attending paramedics. In the emergency department, primary and secondary survey assessments of the patient revealed injuries to the knee and distal fibula only. A full formal examination of the knee was not possible due to pain and a tense haemarthrosis. Subsequent plain radiographs revealed an intra-articular avulsion fracture (Figure 1), as well as fracture of the distal fibular diaphysis. A working diagnosis of displaced tibial spine avulsion fracture was made, and the patient was scheduled for surgery the following day to assess and fix the injury. Examination under anaesthesia revealed a ten-degree block to neutral extension of the knee and a positive Lachmann test with a soft end point. Arthroscopic examination of the knee revealed a lesion at odds with the preoperative diagnosis of tibial spine avulsion. A femoral end osteo-chondral avulsion fracture of the ACL was revealed (Figure 2). Due to the unexpected findings and uncertainty about the optimal method of fixation in a skeletally immature patient, the fragment was reduced back into its normal position, the arthroscopic portals were closed, and the knee was splinted in extension in a plaster of Paris splint. With the benefit of hindsight, the treating team acknowledged that if a bone fragment this large had been avulsed from the tibial insertion of the ACL, this should have been reflected in the architecture of the tibial spine footprint on the preoperative X-ray. But as the appearances of this region appeared normal, this avulsion was unlikely to have occurred from the tibial end of the ACL, rather occurring from the less common femoral origin. A CT scan was subsequently obtained (Figure 3), and the literature was scrutinised to aid preoperative planning of definitive fixation. Subsequent definitive fixation was perfomed nine days following the index procedure using a part arthroscopic and part open approach. Initial arthroscopic manoeuvres (including the use of a direct anterior portal in addition to the two standard portals) involved gentle curettage of the residual crater over the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle from where the ACL had been avulsed. Then two 2.4 mm Beath pins were passed in transosseous manner from the lateral supracondylar ridge into the centre of the defect (crossing the physis) using a posterior cruciate ligament targeting guide. 2 loops of 1 PDS suture were passed via these tunnels from the outside of the knee to the centre of the defect. Then a medial parapatellar approach to the knee joint was performed to formally expose the knee, two No. 2 Vicryl Bunnell sutures were passed across the femoral end of the ACL, and these sutures were placed into the PDS loops that had previously been passed into the knee. Pulling on the PDS sutures allowed the No. 2 Vicryl sutures to be passed through the tunnels previously drilled with the Beath pins and to be delivered to the lateral supracondylar ridge of the femur. The sutures were then tied to one another over a bone bridge thereby reducing the avulsed fragment back into its normal anatomical position (Figure 4). Postoperatively, the patient was splinted in extension for the first four weeks. At this stage, the patient was placed into a range of motion knee brace (allowing up to sixty degrees of flexion) and allowed to partially weight bear with crutches. At six weeks following surgery, the patient’s brace was slackened to allow a full range of motion. Radiographs performed nine weeks following definitive fixation showed union of his fracture (Figure 5). He was allowed to ambulate free of his brace at this stage. At six-month follow up, the patient was able to ambulate without walking aids with a normal gait pattern and had a negative anterior drawer and Lachmann test and full restoration of knee flexion. No deformity or leg length discrepancy was noted at this follow up interval.\n\n【6】  \n**(a)**\n\n【7】  \n**(b)**\n\n【8】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】| (a) Anteroposterior and (b) lateral views of the patient’s knee depicting an intra-articular fracture fragment. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】  \n**(a)**\n\n【12】  \n**(b)**\n\n【13】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】| Intraoperative arthroscopic images depicting (a) an empty lateral wall of the intercondylar notch resulting from an osteochondral avulsion fracture of the femoral end of the ACL and (b) an arthroscopic hook reducing the fragment (outlined by black dots) to its normal position. |\n| --- |\n\n【16】  \n**(a)**\n\n【17】  \n**(b)**\n\n【18】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【19】Figure 3 \n\n【20】| CT scan depicting (a) sagittal and (b) axial views of the patients knee depicting the avulsed osteochondral fragment. |\n| --- |\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 4 \n\n【24】| Schematic diagram depicting the method of repair. |\n| --- |\n\n【25】  \n**(a)**\n\n【26】  \n**(b)**\n\n【27】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【28】Figure 5 \n\n【29】| (a) Anteroposterior and (b) lateral views of the patients knee at three-month follow up. |\n| --- |\n\n【30】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【31】Epidemiologically femoral end avulsions of the ACL may be subdivided into either purely cartilaginous avulsions \\[3–5\\] or osteochondral avulsion injuries \\[6–11\\], the latter being found in our patient whose case we have presented in this article. Furthermore, femoral end avulsion injuries may occur in isolation \\[3, 4, 7, 9–11\\] (as seen with the child we treated), simultaneously with a tibial end avulsion as well \\[5, 6\\], and also in tandem with a tibial end avulsion with a significant gap of time between the two injuries \\[8\\]. The youngest patient to have sustained such an injury was three years of age \\[3, 4\\]. The last two of these reports differed in their length of follow up with the latter reporting good outcome at 13-year follow up (as opposed to 10 weeks in the former report) with only slight laxity of the ACL. Almost universally these injuries occur as a result of relatively high-energy mechanisms as was the case with our patient.\n\n【32】Robinson and Driscoll \\[6\\] were the first group to report such an injury where it was seen in conjunction with a simultaneous avulsion of the tibial end of the ligament as well. The first report of an isolated avulsion of the femoral origin of the ACL was reported by Eady et al. \\[7\\]. Tohyama et al. \\[8\\] reported a case of consecutive avulsion fractures involving the ACL in which a tibial-sided avulsion fracture was successfully treated and was followed 35 months later by a second injury in which the femoral attachment of the ACL was avulsed.\n\n【33】Our technique of repair was in essence similar to that described by Robinson and Driscoll \\[6\\] with our transosseous tunnels for passage of the sutures attached to the femoral end of the ACL crossing the physis. As noted in the article by Corso and Whipple \\[3\\], concerns have been raised in treating such injuries using transosseous tunnels which cross the physis. In the report by Robinson and Driscoll \\[6\\] whose tunnel configuration we also utilised, the authors, however, reported no resulting distal femoral deformity. To counteract possible iatrogenic growth disturbance from transphyseal methods of ACL fixation, transepiphyseal methods of fixation have been advocated \\[12\\]. The technically demanding nature of this method of fixation mandates that surgery be performed by soft tissue knee surgeons with expertise in the treatment of ACL injuries in the skeletally immature.\n\n【34】In summary, the case presented in this paper illustrates the pitfalls that may be encountered when treating children presenting with acute injuries to the knee.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】The battered child syndrome consists of a constellation of signs that may be either apparent or covert. Many patterns of injury have been described in the child abuse syndrome. Bone scintigraphy is a valuable imaging modality in the examination of the battered child. It is often used to evaluate skeletal trauma and identify fractures which previously would have been ignored \\[1–5\\].\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】An eleven-month-old infant weighted 1780 g with a premature birth age of 34 weeks was in the intensive care for seizure attack, aspiration pneumonia, and subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage. He developed progressive lower limbs swelling and his left elbow skeletal malformation following a fall. To protect the privacy of our patients, their full transcripts are not openly available. The radionuclide bone scan with 185 MBq (5 mCi) Tc-99m MDP was performed for an evaluation of suspicious malunion fracture, bone infection, or preexisting medical conditions because metabolic disorders and bone diseases may make a child’s bones more vulnerable to fracture \\[6\\]. Multiple increased radioactive foci throughout the whole body (Figure 1) were unexpectedly found. There was a strong probability of child abuse. A series of plain film radiographs demonstrated calvarial fracture lines at left temporoparietal region, bony anomaly of the spine, multiple old fractures with callus formation involving posterior aspect of left 10th, 11th ribs, right proximal humerus, bilateral proximal femurs, and metaphyses of tibias (Figure 2). The above findings were also consistent with child abuse. Radiographic skeletal survey and radionuclide images are complementary procedures for diagnosis and documenting this type of injury \\[7\\].\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】Bone scan: multiple increased radioactive foci throughout the whole body (arrows) were accidentally found.

The above findings were also consistent with child abuse. Radiographic skeletal survey and radionuclide images are complementary procedures for diagnosis and documenting this type of injury (Figure 3). The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for diagnosing whenever typical skeletal injuries associated with extraskeletal injuries \\[8\\]. The MRI T2-weighted coronal images showing metaphyseal fractures of distal left femur and proximal bilateral tibias with extensive periosteal hemorrhage or edema favored child abuse, too. This case was reported and social workers dealt with this event. The previous multiple bony fractures with callus formation were not prominent on the following plain film radiograph, which was taken 6 months later (Figure 4).\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Figure 3 \n\n【18】MRI of both lower legs: the T2-weighted coronal images show metaphyseal fractures involving distal left femur and proximal bilateral tibias with extensive periosteal hemorrhage or edema, favored child abuse.\n\n【19】  \n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Figure 4 \n\n【22】X-ray: the previous multiple bony fractures with callus formation are not prominent on the following plain film radiograph 6 months later.\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】The estimated incidence of reported child abuse has increased from 3% in 1985 to 4.5% in 1992 \\[7\\]. The incidence of skeletal injury in these children is approximately 20% and is more common among those under 1 year of age. Children older than 3 years of age tend to have predominantly soft tissue injury. Cerebral injury is common at any age. The fractures are usually multiple, involving the long bones, skull, vertebrae, ribs, and facial bones in addition to frequently showing different stages of healing.\n\n【25】Bone scintigraphy is a valuable imaging modality in the examination of these young children, especially in detecting injury in ribs, costovertebral junctions, hands, feet, spine, and diaphyses of long bones \\[2, 9\\]. Child abuse should be considered when diagnosing increased lone bone uptake on bone scintigraphy, which may indicate nonaccidental trauma.\n\n【26】The combination of bone scan and X-ray with experienced hands can reduce the false-negative rate from 12.3% to 0.8%. Although the bone scan may be positive as early as 7 hours after injury, the child is usually brought to a hospital so late that the bone healing has begun \\[10\\].\n\n【27】The image modalities play a key role in the investigation and documentation of the battered child syndrome. The primary diagnostic imaging study in suspected child abuse is either a bone scan and X-ray series or a complete radiographic skeletal survey by X-ray series in babies and infants \\[11\\]. Skeletal survey and bone scintigraphy are complementary studies in the evaluation of nonaccidental injury and should both be performed in cases of suspected child abuse \\[7, 12, 13\\]. Further studies should be undertaken in this circumstance to search for coexisting injuries, especially as the history and mechanism of injury may often be unclear. Bone scan may require sedation, and this modality is now less commonly used, especially in the emergent setting \\[14\\]. However, in cases where children are potentially being lost to follow-up, this will aid the diagnosis of the majority of fractures during the initial assessment and, therefore, help ensure the safety of the child \\[3\\].\n\n【28】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【29】The authors declare they have no conflicts of interest in publishing this case study.\n\n【30】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【31】Ya-Wen Chuang and Chin-Chuan Chang contributed equally to this work.\n\n【32】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【33】This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (Research Grants MOST 103-2320-B-037-025), Kaohsiung Medical University (KMU-TP105E12, KMU-TP105PR06, KMU-M106029, 105KMUOR02, and KMU-O104003), and NSYSU-KMU Research Project, Taiwan (NSYSUKMU106-P011).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is important to consider GBS in COVID-19 patients who present with acute ascending weakness or cranial nerves involvement. More studies are needed to evaluate correlation between COVID-19, GBS, and development of psychiatric disturbances besides investigating the discrepancy between lung parameters and respiratory failure.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threat has led to more than 245,373,039 confirmed cases and 4,979,421 deaths globally as of 30 October 2021 \\[1\\]. Neurological manifestations have become more frequent, affecting central as well as peripheral nervous systems. Hypogeusia, hyposmia, and headache are among the cardinal presentations \\[2\\]. Furthermore, more serious complications have been described during the course of illness, such as cerebrovascular disease (CVS), neuromuscular diseases, encephalopathy, and meningitis/encephalitis \\[2, 3\\]. Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) was reported in some cases, first in Italy by Toscano et al. as they reported five cases of COVID-19 with GBS \\[4\\]. Here, we report two cases of COVID-19 complicated by GBS from a public hospital in Damascus, Syria.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case I\n\n【5】A 49-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department of Tishreen Military Hospital with a one-day history of ascending paresthesia followed by ascending symmetric weakness. Ten days prior to presentation, he had upper respiratory infection symptoms with a positive RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (_SARS-CoV-2_) infection. He was unvaccinated. In the emergency department, on neurological examination, there was no cranial nerve involvement. However, motor examination revealed quadriparesis: Medical Research Council Grade (MRC) is 4/5 in upper limbs, while it is 2/5 in the lower limbs. Tendon reflexes were all absent. Hughes score was 4/6. Computed tomography (CT) of chest demonstrated bilateral glass ground opacities. Antibodies test of _SARS-CoV-2_ was positive for both Immunoglobulin-M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin-G (IgG). Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis (WBC: 14980 C/µL) with mild lymphopenia (1100 C/µL), slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR: 24 mm/hr1), C-reactive protein (CRP: 7 mg/dL; reference range: up to 5 mg/dl), ferritin (398.6 ng/ml; reference range: 12–300 ng/ml), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH: 536 U/L; reference range: 140–280 U/L). Lumbar puncture (LP) revealed marked elevation of CSF protein level (1.82 g/L) and no cell. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) were not performed. Clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy/GBS (Brighton criteria 2). Plasma exchange (PE) (50 ml/Kg) was started with four sessions planned, one every other day.\n\n【6】Two days later, after the second session of PE, paresis progressed to become MRC 1/5 in all extremities. He developed dysphagia, bilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy, and dyspnea. One day later, he developed confusion and episodes of visual and auditory hallucinations. Then, after the third session, high-grade fever was observed, and LP was repeated, which showed classic albuminocytologic dissociation with elevation in protein levels (2 g/L) with no cell. Arterial blood gases and laboratory tests were within normal limits. Few hours after PE, gas exchange and blood pressure worsened dramatically with sudden desaturation that required intubation. He was treated for multi-organ failure with no improvement. He died the next day.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Case II\n\n【8】A 34-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of ascending symmetric numbness and tingling, followed by severe distal weakness of the lower limbs in addition to severe dysesthesia**.** Three weeks earlier, he had upper respiratory infection symptoms. He had not been vaccinated for SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【9】On admission, the patient was febrile (38.5 C). On neurological examination, cranial nerves were spared. Examination of lower limbs showed distal paralysis (MRC 0/5) with proximal paresis (MRC 4/5), knee jerk reflexes were decreased, and the ankle jerk reflexes were absent, while upper limbs were normal. Hughes score was 3/6.\n\n【10】Chest CT scan demonstrated bilateral glass ground opacities. _SARS-CoV-2_ RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Lumbar puncture revealed high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein (0.51 g/L) and normal cell count (5/µL). Nerve conduction studies (NCS) of four extremities were consistent with acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) subtype, predominantly in lower limbs (Table 1).\n\n【11】Table 1 \n\n【12】Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies.\n\n【13】Nerve conduction studies show reduced sensory action potientals in lower limbs with absent motor action potentials. In upper extremities, there is prologation in distal motor latencies for both median nerves. Findings are consistent with acute diffuse motor-sensory neuroradiculopathy.\n\n【14】These clinical findings with the NCS and CSF findings were consistent with GBS (Brighton criteria 1). Two days later when the fever resolved, he underwent 4 sessions of plasma exchange (50 ml/kg), one every other day. After the fourth session, there was no evident clinical change.\n\n【15】Because he was stable, he was discharged four days after the end of plasma exchange course and continued rehabilitation at home.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (_SARS-CoV-2_) is considered to be related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) viruses as it has similar nucleotide sequences with other SARS-like coronaviruses, reaching 89.1% \\[3, 5\\]. They share similar viral structure as well as receptor-binding domain \\[5\\]. In general term, they are neurotropic viruses with studies suggesting two routes of invasion into the nervous system \\[5\\]. First is the retrograde axonal route and second is hematogenous \\[3, 5\\]. They act through specific receptors: angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACEII), which are present in respiratory epithelium as well as glial cells in brain and spinal nerves, thus becoming a target to these viruses \\[3, 5\\]. Reviewing literature, there are some studies suggesting that beta coronaviruses MERS-CoV may cause GBS. It was suggested that there is a prominent post-infection immune-mediated mechanism, besides the release of cytokines, which are massively released contributing to the amplification of dysimmune response in GBS \\[6\\]. On the other hand, other studies regarded this relation unlikely and no homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 surface epitopes and peripheral nerve tissue \\[7\\]. In some studies, virus was not observed in CSF analysis; besides, no solid evidence is available about direct invasion of peripheral nerves \\[8\\]. So, the exact relation and mechanism are not yet fully determined. Later, other cases of GBS were reported post some types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines \\[9\\]. We presented two cases of GBS that may relate to COVID-19. Comparing information of our patients (age, time from onset of systemic illness to the manifestation of neurological symptoms, CSF findings plus electrophysiological findings) were all similar to previously reported cases worldwide. Generally, age of patients ranged between 23 and 77 years old, while a review of 73 cases reported mean age of 55 \\[6, 10\\]. Time from onset of systemic disease to clinical GBS ranged between 3 and 28 days \\[10\\]. Most cases of COVID-GBS were parainfectious \\[10\\]. Few cases were preceded by COVID-19 by only few days \\[10\\]. Clinical features of the COVID-GBS patients did not differ from those reported with other causes as sensorimotor syndrome was the most dominant compared to other variants as Miller Fischer \\[6\\]. In another study from Italy including 34 patients with COVID-19, AIDP was significantly more frequent in COVID-19-positive patients, while AMAN had higher rate in COVID-19-negative patients \\[8\\]. Occasionally, there were some cases reporting involvement of cranial nerves, ataxia, and gait abnormalities at presentation or during the course of the disease \\[6, 11\\]. There was rarity in autonomic disturbances \\[6\\]. Besides, there was worse MRC score or outcome (admission to ICU and arterial hypotension) in GBS following COVID-19 \\[8\\]. The presence of respiratory involvement was notable; a previous review of 39 patients reported respiratory failure in about 40% of patients compared to 20–30% in previous GBS patient cohorts \\[10\\]. Tassorelli et al. published an observation that may explain the discrepancy between lung parameters and chest imaging; they suggested a mechanism of direct invasion of _SARS_\\-_CoV_\\-_2_ virus to cardiopulmonary centers in brainstem, supported by autopsy results of many patients \\[11\\]. Nonetheless, further studies are required \\[11\\]. Other causes may include GBS affecting respiratory muscles. These two possibilities may explain rapid deterioration of the first case we presented. Considering CSF analysis, reviews showed typical findings of albuminocytologic dissociation as seen in non-COVID-GBS patients \\[10\\]. Electro-neurophysiological studies showed predominance of demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, followed by axonal type; however, only few cases were compatible with mixed pattern \\[6\\]. A distinguishable point reported here is the development of hallucination in the first case. Unfortunately, rapid deterioration prevented from determining possible causality. Searching literature, several theories have been postulated. On the one hand, this may reflect psychological complications or presentations of COVID-19 \\[12\\]. Hallucination was found in 11% of patients, including visual as well as auditory types, and was related to delirium or more probably neuroinflammatory process \\[12\\]. On the other hand, it was not unusual to note the onset of psychiatric symptoms during acute phase of GBS, although it might be interpreted as intensive care unit (ICU) delirium \\[13\\]. These symptoms included visual hallucinations, paranoid delusions, disorientation, and psychosis \\[13\\]. Risk factors were autonomic dysfunction, assisted ventilation, and high CSF protein \\[13\\]. One of the earliest cases published on this topic suggested that sensory and motor denervation in GBS might cause confusion in thoughts that are generated internally and externally, similar to ones studied in alteration of sleep sensations \\[14\\]. This results in hallucinations and dream-like thoughts \\[14\\].\n\n【18】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】It is evident that _SARS_\\-_CoV_\\-_2_ may have variable neurological manifestations. The present cases emphasize the importance of considering GBS in COVID-19 patients who present with acute ascending weakness or cranial nerve involvement. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to evaluate correlation between COVID-19, GBS, and development of psychiatric disturbances, as well as to investigate the discrepancy between lung parameters and respiratory failure.\n\n【20】#### Data Availability\n\n【21】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【22】#### Consent\n\n【23】Written informed consent to publish case details was obtained from the patient or the next of kin for both cases.\n\n【24】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【25】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【26】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【27】TA and SH collected the data and drafted the manuscript.

Agammaglobulinemia is most commonly associated with diffuse nodular lymphoid hyperplasia. Duodenal polyps are a rare entity; however, due to wide use of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, incidental diagnosis of duodenal polyps appears to be increasing. Although inflammatory duodenal polyposis has been reported in the literature, its association with common variable immunodeficiency has not been reported till date to the best of our knowledge. We report a case of a 59-year-old male with chronic symptoms of agammaglobulinemia associated with inflammatory duodenal polyposis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Duodenal polyps are rare entity; however, due to wide use of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, incidental diagnosis of duodenal polyps seems to be increasing. Similarly, agammaglobulinemia is a form of B-cell primary immunodeficiency disease characterized by reduced levels of IgG, IgA, or IgM and recurrent bacterial infections with normal T-cell immunity in 60% of patients. Being the largest immune organ, gastrointestinal tract is affected by agammaglobulinemia in a wide spectrum of symptoms and signs. Herein, we present a case of inflammatory duodenal polyposis associated with agammaglobulinemia in a male patient admitted for evaluation of chronic diarrhoea in our hospital. To our knowledge, there is no such case in literature which depicts inflammatory duodenal polyposis seen in primary immunodeficiency disease. We emphasize the importance of considering agammaglobulinemia as a close differential diagnosis in a patient with duodenal polyposis by presenting this index case in a patient of chronic diarrhoea. Prevalence of duodenal polyps is nearly 0.3%–0.5% and 4.6% as revealed by various retrospective \\[1, 2\\] and prospective study \\[3\\], respectively, on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Although duodenal polyps may be pedunculated in nature, these polyps are sessile and small, measuring 3 mm–10 mm. Most of polyps occurring in duodenum are nonneoplastic, which include ectopic gastric mucosa, hyperplastic polyps, and Brunner’s gland hyperplasia. Inflammatory polyps contain ectopic gastric mucosa and are frequently present in duodenum \\[1, 2\\]. In the duodenal bulb, multiple polyps smaller than 10 mm do not need biopsy or treatment, whereas endoscopic surveillance and biopsy of duodenal polyps are important in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis \\[3\\], in which malignant transformation into adenomas or carcinoid tumours can be seen even if size is less than 10 mm and, hence, they need treatment.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 59-year-old male, Kurdish in origin, came to our hospital with history of recurrent chronic diarrhoea for last eighteen years. Each episode of diarrhoea was lasting for more than a month and used to get relieved with antibiotics. The patient had also history of pulmonary tuberculosis and recurrent sinopulmonary infections. We evaluated him thoroughly for his chronic diarrhoea. His stool examination showed cyst of _Giardia lamblia_. His routine blood examination reports were normal. His chest X-ray showed hyperinflated lungs; there was pleural thickening with inhomogeneous opacities suggestive of fibrosis in right upper zone. Ultrasonography of whole abdomen was normal. His contrast-enhanced computerized tomography of chest and abdomen revealed right apical pleural thickening and fibrosis in upper lobe and bronchial wall thickening, paraseptal emphysema, and subcentimetric mediastinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1). Transbronchial nodal aspiration done was inconclusive. His esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed duodenal polyposis (Figure 2). His total colonoscopy and capsule endoscopy for small bowel were normal. His histopathological examination of duodenal specimen was consistent with features suggestive of inflammatory polyps (Figure 3). His 24-hour urinary protein was within normal limits. Immunological work-up was done. His human immunodeficiency viral serology was nonreactive. CD3, CD4, and CD8 counts were 1208/microlitre, 475/microlitre, and 707/microlitre, respectively. Immunoglobulin levels were IgG < 200 mg/dL (791–1643), IgA < 6 mg/dL (60–436), and IgM < 25 mg/dL (43–279). There was selective deficiency of B-cell (humoral) immunity.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】Fibrotic changes with focal pleural thickening in right apex with associated paraseptal emphysema suggestive of old healed lesion.\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 2 \n\n【13】Multiple small polyps in D2 part of duodenum.\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】  \n\n【16】Figure 3 \n\n【17】Duodenal mucosa shows preserved cryptovillus architecture and moderate lymphocytic infiltrate in the lamina propria along with a few neutrophils.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Agammaglobulinemia is a group of inherited immune deficiencies characterized by a low concentration of antibodies in the blood due to the lack of particular lymphocytes in the blood and lymph. Patients suffering from agammaglobulinemia have characteristic features of lack of B lymphocytes, decreased levels of immunoglobulins, chronic diarrhoea, granulomatous disease, recurrent infections, and joint involvement \\[2, 4, 5\\]. Agammaglobulinemia shows X-linked recessive pattern \\[6\\]. Initially, patients with agammaglobulinemia may present with clinical manifestations of loose motions, malabsorption, and loss of weight. Infectious cause of diarrhoea in agammaglobulinemia is seldom established \\[7\\]. Patients suffering from agammaglobulinemia have high prevalence of infectious, inflammatory, and malignant gastrointestinal disorders.\n\n【20】Agammaglobulinemia involves gastrointestinal tract like chronic-atrophic gastritis, giardiasis, sprue-like disorder with atrophied villi, inflammatory bowel disease, nonspecific intestinal malabsorption, nodular lymphoid hyperplasia, and pernicious anaemia \\[8, 9\\]. These gastrointestinal disorders seem to be due to defects in cellular immunity instead of deficiency of antibodies alone \\[9\\]. A broad spectrum of histologic changes ranging from marked atrophy of villi and increased lymphocytes in mucosa resembling celiac disease to nodular lymphoid hyperplasia can be seen in patients with agammaglobulinemia \\[10\\]. Almost every patient with agammaglobulinemia suffers from acute, recurrent, or chronic infections, especially conjunctivitis, otitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia \\[2\\]. However, effects of malabsorption such as deficiency of vitamins and electrolytes may be present in severe cases. Patients with agammaglobulinemia have malabsorption involving carbohydrates, dietary fats, vitamin B12, and folate.\n\n【21】Patients with history of recurrent bacterial infections presenting with gastrointestinal manifestations, specifically chronic diarrhoea, should be assessed for the possibility of agammaglobulinemia as any delay in the diagnosis and, hence, treatment can lead to significant morbidity and complications in patients with agammaglobulinemia. Treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in agammaglobulinemia with intravenous immunoglobulins alone may be ineffective in comparison to combination with immunomodulators such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, because most gastrointestinal manifestations of agammaglobulinemia appear to be due to defects in T-cell mediated immunity \\[1\\].\n\n【22】Prevalence of duodenal polyps is nearly 0.3%–0.5% and 4.6% as revealed by various retrospective \\[1, 2\\] and prospective studies \\[3\\], respectively, on esophagoduodenoscopy. Although duodenal polyps may be pedunculated in nature, these polyps are sessile and small, measuring 3 mm–10 mm. Most of polyps occurring in duodenum are nonneoplastic, which include ectopic gastric mucosa, hyperplastic polyps, and Brunner’s gland hyperplasia. Inflammatory polyps contain ectopic gastric mucosa and are frequently present in duodenum \\[1, 2\\]. In the duodenal bulb, multiple polyps smaller than 10 mm do not need biopsy or treatment, whereas endoscopic surveillance and biopsy of duodenal polyps are important in patients with familial polyposis \\[3\\]. Malignant transformation into adenomas or carcinoid tumours can be seen in some duodenal polyps having size less than 10 mm and, hence, they need treatment. The clinical manifestations of nonneoplastic and neoplastic diseases of duodenum have not been identified so far. Duodenal polyps having hyperplastic (metaplastic) nature have seldom been identified. Data published on these polyps are restricted to case reports or small case reports \\[6, 8, 10\\]. They closely resemble hyperplastic polyps of the gastric type instead of the colonic type as they almost always arise in the context of ectopic mucosa of the stomach. Hyperplastic polyps of the duodenum seem to occur most frequently in patients with peptic ulcer disease or other gastric disorders \\[8\\] and can be associated with colonisation by _Helicobacter pylori_ \\[7\\].\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】In conclusion, though there is no direct evidence of chronic diarrhea with inflammatory duodenal polyposis, the contributing factors for development of inflammatory polyps of duodenum with agammaglobulinemia in our patient may be due to recurrent infections of the gastrointestinal tract. We have described a rare case of inflammatory duodenal polyposis coexisting with agammaglobulinemia in a patient with chronic diarrhoea, and agammaglobulinemia should be considered in the list of differential diagnoses of inflammatory duodenal polyposis, especially when it is incidentally seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy of a patient with chronic diarrhea such as in our case. The study needs further reports to establish cause and effect relationship between chronic diarrhea and inflammatory duodenal polyposis.\n\n【25】#### Competing Interests\n\n【26】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【27】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【28】Irfan Ali Shera, Sheikh Mudassir Khurshid, and Mohd Shafi Bhat were attending doctors for the patient.

This is partly due to the lack of established criteria for the diagnosis of this resistance. However, some clinical aspects may suggest that the diagnosis does not necessarily have to be positive insulin receptor antibodies as such patients could respond to immunosuppressive treatment. _Methods_. We describe a case and have performed a literature review on PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar bibliographic databases to identify all case reports. All available studies from January 1975 through December 2020 were included. Data collected were tabulated, and outcomes were analyzed cumulatively. _Results_. Thirty-one cases of TBIRS associated with SLE have been described. These patients presented with catabolic symptoms and hyperglycemia in most cases, with an average time from the onset of symptoms of four months. In addition to that clinical characteristics related to SLE were variable, along with certain common characteristics such as acanthosis in 60% of patients. Almost all the patients had antibodies against insulin receptors. The insulin doses required by the patients ranged from 450 to 25,000 U daily. Remission was achieved in 80% of the patients with a two-year follow-up. Most patients associated with late-onset SLE, like our patient, achieved metabolic control after immunosuppressive treatment. _Conclusion_. High insulin resistance in patients with de novo diabetes mellitus (DM) without obesity should be considered as a possible clinical manifestation of an autoimmune disease such as SLE, with a good metabolic response to the immunosuppressive management established.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Type B insulin resistance syndrome (TBIRS) is a rare autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies directed against insulin receptors, leading to hyperglycemia secondary to severe insulin resistance; however, it can lead to hypoglycemia as well \\[1\\]. The cases recorded in the literature typically show women of reproductive age, mainly with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in up to 33% \\[2\\]. Patients usually present with weight loss, hyperandrogenism, diffuse acanthosis nigricans associated with insulin resistance, hyperadiponectemia, and hypotriglyceridemia. No standardized treatment exists for this syndrome; however, multiple treatment schemes with variable success rates have been described, including spontaneous remission in up to 33% of patients \\[3\\]. Mortality rates can be as high as 50% and the cause of death is usually related to hypoglycemia complications \\[2\\].\n\n【4】In the present case report, an elderly nonobese patient with de novo diabetes mellitus diagnosis, high insulin requirement since diagnosis, and inadequate metabolic control is described. The systematic workup of differential diagnosis led to the finding of an autoimmune disease which explains the clinical picture of the patient. In addition, an exhaustive review of SLE-associated TBIRS cases is performed.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Methods\n\n【6】A search was performed in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar from January 1975 until March 2021, using the following keywords: “Type B insulin resistance” _o_ “Type B syndrome,” “SLE,” “Lupus,” and “Lupus Erythematosus Systemic” _y_ “autoimmune.” From 55 articles found (Figure 1), we included every single one when the complete text was available, regardless of the methodology used. Therefore, patients with a confirmed disease or even those with no anti-insulin antibodies but a suggestive clinical presentation were included. We included articles in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. The clinical, demographical, laboratory, treatment, and relapse data were analyzed.\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】Flowchart describing the cases selection process.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 62-year-old African American female, with a personal history of de novo diabetes mellitus with insulin requirements, of two to three months, with no micro or macrovascular complications, treated with high insulin doses (50 U glargine twice a day, and 20 U glulisine three times a day), without achievement of metabolic control. The patient was referred to a fourth-level hospital based on a malignant neoplasm suspicion: weight loss of 20–30 kg in the last two to three months (her weight at the time of evaluation was 100 kg) and absence of metabolic control. The patient mentioned occasional Raynaud’s phenomenon. Periocular and perioral acanthosis nigricans (Figure 2), and a left supraclavicular mobile lymphadenopathy of 1 cm diameter, with no inflammatory changes, were observed in physical examination. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. During in-patient stance, glucometer registry was between 350–400 mg/dL, despite receiving glargine insulin 138 U/day and glulisine insulin 44 U three times a day.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】Periocular, perioral, cervical, and mandibular acanthosis.\n\n【17】In Table 1, the main laboratory findings are registered, including lymphopenia and positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) that associated with Raynaud’s phenomenon, suggested a late-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) diagnosis. However, as a malignant neoplasm was suspected, a cervical lymph node biopsy and a bone marrow biopsy were performed, which were unremarkable. The rest of the endocrine and imaging tests were normal.\n\n【18】Table 1 \n\n【19】Laboratory results during patient’s hospital stay.\n\n【20】Due to the high insulin requirements, an insulin drip was started and titrated, with the highest dose up to 43 U/kg/day with capillary blood glucometer around 200 mg/dL. An insulin resistance syndrome mediated by autoimmunity was suspected based on the clinical presentation–in this case, late-onset SLE. Therefore, management with methylprednisolone 250 mg/day for three days and a prednisolone taper starting at 50 mg/day was initiated. Insulin dose was successfully reduced to less than 2 U/kg/day and a bridge with subcutaneous insulin was performed until insulin drip was suspended (Figure 3). Nonetheless, the patient presented catheter-associated bacteremia, which delayed rituximab initiation. Rituximab therapy was finally started, achieving excellent clinical and metabolic results because at discharge, she only required linagliptin for glycemic control without the need for insulin or another hypoglycemic agent. The patient remained on maintenance immunosuppression with prednisolone 5 mg and chloroquine 250 mg daily. Unfortunately, after discharge, she did not return to our institution for reasons related to her health insurance.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 3 \n\n【24】Blood glucose plot.

Discussion\n\n【26】Type B insulin resistance syndrome (TBIRS) is an extremely rare entity, with unknown prevalence. Only 116 cases have been described in the literature \\[2, 4\\]. The first time this disease was described was in 1975 when six patients presented with overt insulin resistance with acanthosis nigricans and high insulin requirements due to a serum-circulating factor which affected insulin binding to its receptor \\[5\\]. These patients required up to 100 times more insulin. Extreme requirements from 700 up to 177,500 insulin units per day were registered \\[6\\].\n\n【27】Some authors like Willard et al. \\[1\\], suggest that the biochemical triad of extremely high levels of fasting insulin, hyperadiponectinemia, and hypotriglyceridemia in patients with acanthosis nigricans and underlying autoimmune disease may be considered as a clinical definition of TBIRS. In addition, other characteristics may lead to TBIRS suspicions, such as slim patients with insulin requirements higher than 3 U/kg/day and persistent hyperglycemia \\[7\\].\n\n【28】Three mechanisms have been described for hyperglycemia in this disorder \\[1\\]: autoantibodies competing for the insulin receptor binding site, the binding of such autoantibodies leading to receptor degradation, and the agonist/antagonist action of these autoantibodies with a biphasic response (hypo and hyperglycemia).\n\n【29】The biggest TBIRS cohort was obtained in the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In this cohort, 24 patients were followed for 28 years, finding that TBIRS is more frequent in African American women, with an underlying autoimmune disease, and an age between 20 and 68 years, although teenager cases have been described \\[3\\]. In these patients, only three of them developed hypoglycemia, and SLE was observed in up to 46% of patients. Most had a BMI less than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and in those with a BMI lower than 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, one third presented with hypoglycemia and two thirds with hyperglycemia, reflecting an insulin resistance profile different to those with obesity. Perioral and periocular acanthosis nigricans were observed in up to 88% of patients; other patients presented with a deeper voice and lower extremity wasting due to overweight. In the autoimmune laboratory, ANA was observed in 83% of patients and hypocomplementemia (C3 predominantly) in 21%. 25% had spontaneous remission and patients treated with glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, plasmapheresis, cyclosporine, and azathioprine had a variable response time from five months up to 54 months.\n\n【30】In a recent systematic review \\[2\\], 115 TBIRS cases were reported. Most were women (76.5%) with a mean age of 42 years. 50% had normal weight and acanthosis nigricans, 45% had hyperglycemia, 42.9% had hypoglycemia at any time of the disease course, and diabetic ketoacidosis was observed in only 11.8%. SLE was the main etiology in 33%, as the NIH cohort. In some patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma, TBIRS was the initial manifestation as a paraneoplastic phenomenon. In relation to laboratory findings, mean HbA1c was 10.8% (5.1–18.7), fasting serum insulin of 1309 _μ_g/dl (0.1–10.584), C peptide of 13.9 ng/mL (0.1–63.0), and triglycerides of 72.8 mg/dL (36–155); autoimmunity laboratory was remarkable for ANA, present in 60%, hypocomplementemia in 20%, and anti-insulin antibodies were ordered in only 36.1% with half being positive.\n\n【31】Out of 115 patients, 83 (70%) achieved disease remission and 20.5% with spontaneous remission. In the first phase, prednisolone was used in 40% of patients (dose of 50–60 mg), cyclophosphamide in 20%, rituximab in 10%, and plasmapheresis in 8–10%. During this phase, remission was achieved in 40% of patients. The mean daily insulin dose was 1747 U/day (54–57.600), which led to admission for intravenous drip titration. Time-to-remission had a mean of four months (0.25–54). No statistically significant relationship could be established between negative anti-insulin antibodies and disease remission. The mortality in this systematic review was 15.38%; one out of four patients died due to intractable hypoglycemia.\n\n【32】Thirty-one SLE-associated TBIRS cases have been described (Tables 2 and 3), these patients had hypoglycemia (35%) or catabolic symptoms and hyperglycemia (66%) as the initial symptoms. The time of symptom onset was from one up to 15 months. The most common ANA pattern was speckled (32%). No single SLE sign or symptom was predominant, as the clinical presentation was variable among all patients. Acanthosis nigricans was present in 60% of patients. Predominant antibodies were anti-insulin receptors (97%). 37.5% TBIRS were associated with late-onset SLE. Insulin doses required were between 450–25,000 U/day. Remission was achieved in 80% of patients with a follow-up of two years. 10% of patients did not respond to the therapy, with persistent hypoglycemia. Most late-onset SLE-associated TBIRS required additional immunosuppressant therapy to achieve remission and metabolic control (other than steroids). Nonetheless, in our patient glycemic control was achieved after glucocorticoid therapy. An interesting finding in our patient was that in addition to anti-insulin antibodies, normal C peptide, and fasting insulin, clinical signs of insulin resistance and high insulin requirements, hypotriglyceridemia was observed, which is suggested as another variable to consider for the diagnosis \\[1\\].\n\n【33】Table 2 \n\n【34】SLE-associated TBIRS patients’ description.\n\n【35】Table 3 \n\n【36】SLE-associated TBIRS patients’ characteristics.\n\n【37】The treatment includes two main goals: glycemic control, and immunosuppression when it is required. No single protocol is established, and no clinical trial has been performed in this population. The treatment has certain details which must be considered, such as mean insulin requirement which was up to 5600 U/day in the NIH cohort; some patients required up to 30,000 U/day. Concentrated insulin products may improve insulin administration when higher doses are required. U-500 insulin is five times more concentrated than U-100 insulin \\[34\\]; therefore, it is considered the cornerstone of therapy in patients with insulin resistance; unfortunately, it is not available in Colombia. In a nine-study meta-analysis, patients with different types of U-100 and U-500 insulin were included: patients treated with U-500 insulin had a higher weight gain of 4.4 kg, but no difference was observed in hypoglycemias \\[35\\]. To administer such high insulin doses safely, the patient must be admitted and an intravenous insulin drip must be started. Treatment schemes have been established by academic medical centers and the main therapeutic goal is normal fasting glucose to achieve metabolic control \\[35, 36\\].\n\n【38】Immunosuppression is directed to resolve the underlying autoimmune process. Multiple treatment schemes have been used as was observed in the systematic review by Martins et al. \\[2\\]. NIH proposed a standardized treatment regime with a combination of rituximab, monthly pulse steroid therapy (dexamethasone 40 mg/day for four days), and cyclophosphamide \\[17\\]. This scheme was used in a 45-year-old patient with 20 kg unexplained weight loss, disseminated acanthosis nigricans, blood glucose higher than 500 mg/dL, anti-insulin receptor antibodies, and lack of metabolic control despite 600 daily insulin units and no improvement with prednisolone, azathioprine, or plasmapheresis. The patient finally improved after rituximab 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup> divided into two doses two weeks apart, associated with oral cyclophosphamide 100 mg/day and dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days. Fasting glucose improved down to 80–100 mg/dL, HbA1c was reduced from 11.8% to 6.5%, and perioral, periocular, and periauricular acanthosis nigricans improved as well \\[37\\].\n\n【39】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【40】In conclusion, TBIRS in nonobese patients with de novo diabetes must be considered secondary to an autoimmune disease such as SLE, with a good metabolic response to immunosuppressant management.\n\n【41】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【42】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest related to the topic addressed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Herein, we experienced a case of atopic myelitis developed during the growth of cervical cavernous angioma caused by bleeding. A 37-year-old woman suffered from hand swelling caused by a house cat licking. At the same time when cavernous angioma had grown, she experienced a numbness in her four extremities, and multifocal peritumoral hyperintense spinal cord signals were seen. The diagnosis of atopic myelitis was made because we observed significantly elevated levels of specific IgE antibody to cat dander. Symptoms disappeared immediately after steroid pulse therapy. We subsequently resected a cavernous angioma, and eosinophil invasion was found inside it. This is the first case report of atopic myelitis which developed in association with spinal cord vascular lesions. A local blood-brain barrier breakdown due to hemorrhagic lesions of the spinal cord may have contributed to the onset of atopic myelitis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Atopic myelitis is a type of myelitis which has received attention along with the recent dramatic increase in atopic disease. It develops in patients with elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) or allergic predisposition, such as atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, or bronchial asthma. Atopic myelitis occurs more commonly in the cervical spinal cord \\[1, 2\\]. There has been no report of atopic myelitis which occurs in association with vascular lesions of the brain and spinal cord. Herein, we report our experience with a case of atopic myelitis developed along with cervical cavernous angioma growth caused by bleeding.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】At the age of 35, the patient developed cervical cavernous angioma on the right side of spinal cord on ventral aspect at the level of the right sixth cervical (C6) vertebra due to subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A mild numbness of the four extremities remained after SAH. One year later, cavernous angioma had grown, and a numbness of the right upper extremity had been exacerbated. One year and a half after SAH, a numbness had extended from the trunk through both lower extremities, and a new T2-weighted intramedullary high-signal intensity area was found in spinal cord situated at the first to the second thoracic (T1-2) vertebral level (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). A numbness of the left upper extremity appeared 1 year and 9 months after SAH, and a new T2-weighted intramedullary high-signal intensity area was also observed in the left side of spinal cord on dorsal aspect at the third to the fourth cervical (C3-4) vertebral level (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)).\n\n【6】  \n**(a)**\n\n【7】  \n**(b)**\n\n【8】  \n**(c)**\n\n【9】  \n**(d)**\n\n【10】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】MRI images of atopic myelitis.

An intramedullary change in signal intensity is observed on both sides of the spinal cord and around the dorsal side of the spinal cord.

Neuroradiology\n\n【16】Cavernous angioma was observed in the ventral side of the spinal cord at C6 vertebral level (Figure 1(a), white arrowhead). Cavernous angioma was present in the ventral side of the right half the spinal cord (Figures 2(c), 2(d), and 2(e)) and partially extramedullary (Figure 2(c)). Intramedullary high-signal intensity on T2 weighted image (T2WI) was observed in the spinal cord at T1-2 vertebral level (Figure 1(b)) at the same time that a numbness of both lower extremities appeared. A high-signal intensity area spread forward to the anterior part of the posterior funiculus of the spinal cord, but the anterior funiculus and lateral funiculus were retained. A new intramedullary high-signal intensity area on T2WI appeared at C3-4 vertebral level when the patient experienced a numbness of the left upper extremity (Figure 1(c)). A high-signal intensity area existed locally in the left posterior funiculus of the spinal cord (Figure 1(d)).\n\n【17】  \n**(a)**\n\n【18】  \n**(b)**\n\n【19】  \n**(c)**\n\n【20】  \n**(d)**\n\n【21】  \n**(e)**\n\n【22】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)**   \n**(e)**\n\n【23】Figure 2 \n\n【24】MRI images of cavernous angioma.

Cavernous angioma is observed as a heterogenous lesion on T1 weighted image (c). Surrounding rim is seen on T2WI (d) and T2-star image (e).\n\n【25】#### 5\\. Blood Biochemical Findings\n\n【26】The followings were the laboratory results.\n\n【27】Complete blood count results were as follows: white blood cell count 4,400/_μ_L (neutrophils: 65.6%, lymphocytes: 27.3%, monocytes: 4.8%, eosinophils: 1.8%, and basophils: 0.5%), hemoglobin 14.9 g/dL (range: 11.5–15.4), hematocrit 43.7% (range: 33.0–44.0), platelet count 19.8 × 10<sup>4</sup>/_μ_L (range: 13.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>–37.0 × 10<sup>4</sup>), total protein 6.8 g/dL (range: 6.7–8.3), albumin 4.4 g/dL (range: 3.8–5.3), AST 11 IU/L (range: 8–38), ALT 8 IU/L (range: 4–44), CPK 51 IU/L (range: 43–165), BUN 12.5 mg/dL (range: 8.0–20.0), creatine 0.71 mg/dL (range: 0.4–0.8), Na 139 mEq/L (range: 135–147), K 4.2 mEq/L (range: 3.3–108), glucose 92 mg/dL (range: 70–110), and C-reactive protein 0.02 mg/dL (range: 0.0–0.3). A nonspecific IgE level was 497 IU/mL (normal range: 0–170), and a specific IgE level to cat dander was 85.5 UA/mL (reference range: 0–0.34). The patient exhibited patch test positivity to any of the following 12 substances: _Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus_, _Dermatophagoides farinae_, cat, dog, _Cynodon dactylon_, _Dactylis glomerata_, _Ambrosia artemisiifolia_, _Artemisia indica_ var. _maximowiczii_, _Betula platyphylla_, _Cryptomeria japonica_, _Candida_, and _Alternaria_. Antibody against aquaporin-4 was negative. In the meantime, all following test results stayed within a normal range: serum complement level, complement components 3 and 4, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, anti-DNA antibody, anti-ribonucleoprotein antibody, anti-Smith antibody, anti-SSA and anti-SSB antibodies, anticardiolipin and anti–_β_2-glycoprotein I complex, and lupus anticoagulant.\n\n【28】#### 6\\. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Analysis\n\n【29】Results of CSF analysis were as follows: specific gravity 1.006 (range: 1.005–1.007), protein 29 mg/dL (reference range: 8–43), glucose 68 mg/dL (reference range: 50–75), and total number of cells present 3/_μ_L (3 mononuclear cells, 0 polynuclear cells).\n\n【30】No oligoclonal IgG bands were detected.\n\n【31】#### 7\\. Brain MRI\n\n【32】There were no abnormal findings including high-intensity signals in T2 weighted image.\n\n【33】#### 8\\. Medical Therapy and Posttherapy Course\n\n【34】As a reason for multifocal hyperintense spinal cord signal, we considered the possibility of neuroinflammatory disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica, or connective tissue disease, sarcoidosis, Behcet’s disease, and so on \\[3–6\\], other than atopic myelitis, but we were skeptical about these possibilities according to the results of blood biochemical study. The diagnosis of atopic myelitis was made based on the blood biochemical findings, and steroid pulse therapy was performed using methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day, for 3 days). A numbness which has extended from the trunk through the left upper and lower extremities, along with the right lower extremity, disappeared immediately following the therapy. After hospital discharge, efforts were made to segregate a house cat and normalize skin barrier by increasing moisture retention.\n\n【35】#### 9\\. Surgical Management and Postoperative Course\n\n【36】Atopic myelitis did not recur, but cavernous angioma was totally resected because its growth was identified (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Imaging findings presented cavernous angioma inside and outside the spinal cord. The patient had a good postoperative course and was discharged from the hospital with maintaining independence in the activities of daily living.\n\n【37】#### 10\\. Histopathological Study\n\n【38】Pathological examination of the resected cavernous angioma was performed. Hematoma was present inside the cavernous angioma, and irregularly enlarged vascular structure with thin vascular wall was observed (Figure 3(a)) as the typical pathological findings of cavernous angioma \\[7, 8\\].

Discussion\n\n【45】Atopic myelitis, an allergic disease with high serum levels of IgE and antigen-specific IgE, is the concept of disease advocated by Kira et al. in 1997 \\[9\\]. A nationwide survey on atopic myelitis has been conducted by Isobe et al. in Japan \\[2, 10\\].\n\n【46】Atopic myelitis is apt to develop after exacerbation of underlying allergic diseases which include atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and allergic conjunctivitis \\[1, 10\\]. In some way, it seems that atopic myelitis results from the transmission of allergic reaction from the bloodstream to the spinal cord, but the detailed mechanism of atopic myelitis is still unknown.\n\n【47】Symptoms include paresthesia that is not associated with mobility impairment, and most patients initially present with a mild numbness. According to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, high-intensity signal on T2WI is present around the posterior funiculus of the cervical spinal cord \\[1\\], gadolinium enhancement and edematous changes in the spinal cord are found in the acute stage, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown is locally observed \\[11\\]. Atopic myelitis is pathologically considered as vasculitis in the presence of invasion by eosinophils which seem to act as effector cells in myelitis \\[11–13\\]. Steroid pulse therapy is used to treat atopic myelitis, but the efficacy rate is about 70%. Plasma exchange is used if steroid pulse therapy is ineffective \\[2, 14\\].\n\n【48】Cavernous angioma is a type of vascular malformation which grows while repeating extremely light bleeding. Pathologically speaking, vascular structure with irregularly enlarged, thin-walled vessels was observed \\[7, 8\\]. Cavernous angioma is sometimes identified as the cause of SAH, and extremely light bleeding can be confirmed by T2-star-weighted MRI \\[15\\]. Because cavernous angioma grows while bleeding, the resection of cavernous angioma is considered when neurological deficits are observed after the growth \\[16, 17\\].\n\n【49】In this case, the patient did not present with previous major atopic disease or exacerbation of atopic disease, such as atopic dermatitis or bronchial asthma, but because of high serum levels of IgE along with a detailed history of the patient, we diagnosed cat allergy, of which the patient herself was not aware. With regard to a miner allergy, attention is required because a detailed history needs to be taken from the patient. In addition, because cavernous angioma had caused SAH and afterward had grown while repeating mild bleeding, BBB breakdown might have occurred in the cervical spinal cord. During the growth of cavernous angioma, the patient developed atopic myelitis in multiple areas adjacent to the angioma, and eosinophil invasion was observed inside the resected cavernous angioma; therefore, BBB breakdown resulting from vascular lesions associated with bleeding may have facilitated the transmission of allergic reaction from the bloodstream to the spinal cord.\n\n【50】#### 12\\. Conclusion\n\n【51】This article is the first case report of atopic myelitis which developed in association with vascular lesions of the central nervous system. BBB breakdown due to angioma may have been involved in the transmission of allergic reaction to the spinal cord.\n\n【52】#### Disclosure\n\n【53】This work was presented at the 51st annual meeting of the Japan Medical Society of Spinal Cord Lesion \\[18\\].\n\n【54】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【55】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

However, whereas atrophic gastritis caused by _H. pylori_ involves the antrum, the antrum is spared in autoimmune gastritis. Here, we report the use of magnifying endoscopy to identify and distinguish atrophic gastritis caused by _H. pylori_ from autoimmune gastritis. The mucosal pattern in autoimmune gastritis is that of closely arranged small round and oval pits, thus differing from the pattern seen in atrophic mucosa due to _H. pylori_ infection. We speculate that this reflects differences in inflammation between the two types of gastritis. In autoimmune gastritis the inflammation is directed primarily against gastric glands, whereas in _H. pylori_ infection the inflammation is directed against the bacteria on or near the surface and the damage initially affects the surface epithelium. During repair, the normal regular round pits are destroyed, whereas they remain largely intact in mucosa with autoimmune-associated atrophy. Confirmation of the features of autoimmune gastritis revealed by magnifying endoscopy would not only make the endoscopic diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis more accurate, but also help to elucidate changes in the surface epithelial structure of gastritis due to various causes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The two most common causes of atrophic gastritis are an autoimmune mechanism or persistent infection with _Helicobacter pylori_. Ultimately, persistent chronic inflammation may result in severe atrophy of the stomach’s mucosal lining. In autoimmune gastritis the antral mucosa is spared, and characteristically the atrophy is associated with a marked elevation of the serum gastrin level, which may result in type I gastric carcinoid tumors \\[1, 2\\]. In contrast, _H. pylori_ infection affects the gastric antrum and tends to blunt the hypergastrinemic response to hypochlorhydria, gastric carcinoids being uncommon. Although both of these two forms of atrophic gastritis are common, there have been no reports of endoscopically evident features that can reliably distinguish between autoimmune and _H. pylori_ induced atrophic gastritis.\n\n【4】Here we used magnifying endoscopy to identify differences between the two types of atrophic gastritis. The appearance of the gastric corpus in patients with autoimmune gastritis differs from that of atrophic gastritis caused by _H. pylori_ infection, which exhibits either ridged surface structures or a villous to granular surface pattern \\[3–6\\]. In contrast, the magnified endoscopic appearance of the atrophic mucosa in autoimmune gastritis is similar, but not identical, to that of the corpus in the _H. pylori_\\-negative stomach. We report our findings obtained using magnifying endoscopy in three patients with autoimmune gastritis. We found that the atrophic mucosa of the corpus in all three patients exhibited a previously undescribed pattern of closely arranged small round and oval pits.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 48-year-old woman presented with epigastric discomfort. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed severe mucosal atrophy in the gastric corpus. Magnifying endoscopy of the corpus revealed closely arranged small round and oval pits with a surrounding network of capillaries. In the antrum, both conventional and magnifying endoscopy demonstrated no abnormal features, and the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having autoimmune gastritis \\[3–6\\]. Biopsy specimens were taken from both the antrum and the corpus. The histology of the antral mucosa was normal, whereas that of the corpus exhibited severe atrophy. The serum gastrin level was 4440 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL), and the level of antiparietal cell antibody was ×160 positive. The patient was negative for anti-intrinsic factor antibody and anti-_H_.  _pylori_ antibody IgG, and the urea breast test gave a result of 2.2‰  (reference range: <2.5‰). The diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis was therefore confirmed.\n\n【8】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【9】A 72-year-old woman presented for a routine health check. Upper GI endoscopy identified severe atrophy of the mucosa in the gastric corpus (Figure 1(a)), and magnifying endoscopy showed a pattern of closely spaced small round and oval pits (Figure 1(b)). Conventional endoscopy of the antrum demonstrated no abnormality, suggesting a diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis. As this endoscopic examination was part of a routine health check, no biopsy was performed. However, serum samples revealed a gastrin level of 1800 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL) and antiparietal cell antibody ×40 positive, with negativity for anti-intrinsic factor antibody and anti-_H. pylori_ antibody IgG. Autoimmune gastritis was therefore confirmed.\n\n【10】  \n**(a)**\n\n【11】  \n**(b)**\n\n【12】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【13】Figure 1 \n\n【14】| (a) Conventional endoscopic finding in the corpus of Case 2.

Case 3\n\n【16】A 58-year-old man had been found to have gastric nodules by X-ray and endoscopic examinations at another hospital. During the endoscopic examination, three nodules were biopsied and one was suspected to be a carcinoid tumor. The other two were diagnosed as atrophic gastric mucosa. A conventional endoscopic reexamination at our hospital revealed multiple nodules on the greater curvature of the corpus (Figure 2(a)), one of which was reddish (Figure 2(a) yellow arrow). Magnifying endoscopy showed that this reddish nodule had a gyriform-like structure with an irregular vascular pattern (Figure 2(b)). Based on the magnifying endoscopy findings, the reddish nodule was diagnosed as a carcinoid tumor, and this was subsequently confirmed by histological examination of a biopsy sample. Conventional endoscopic examination of the corpus demonstrated severe atrophic gastritis (Figure 2(a)). Magnifying endoscopic examination of the other nodules revealed closely arranged small round pits (Figure 2(c)) and a pattern of closely arranged small round and oval pits was also observed in the mucosa surrounding these nodules (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)). Thus, magnifying endoscopy was able to show that this characteristic pit pattern was present even in the atrophic mucosa of the corpus, leading to a diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis associated with a carcinoid tumor. Analysis of the patient’s serum showed a gastrin level of 2700 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL), antiparietal cell antibody ×80 positive, positivity for anti-intrinsic factor antibody, and negativity for anti-_H. pylori_ antibody IgG. The reddish nodule and some of the surrounding nodules that showed closely arranged small round pits were treated by endoscopic mucosal dissection (ESD). The reddish nodule was 3 mm in diameter and histological examination confirmed that it was a carcinoid tumor. The other small nodules showed remnants of fundic glands within the atrophic mucosa (Figure 2(d)).\n\n【17】  \n**(a)**\n\n【18】  \n**(b)**\n\n【19】  \n**(c)**\n\n【20】  \n**(d)**\n\n【21】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【22】Figure 2 \n\n【23】| (a) Conventional endoscopic findings in Case 3.

One characteristic of autoimmune gastritis is hypergastrinemia, which may lead to the development of gastric carcinoids \\[1\\], the histological features of autoimmune gastritis are a normal pyloric glandular mucosa and severe atrophic changes in the corpus, thus differing from those of atrophic gastritis caused by _H. pylori_ infection, which primarily affects the antrum. The endoscopic diagnosis is based on an apparently normal antral mucosa alongside severe atrophic mucosa in the corpus. However, it difficult to reliably diagnose autoimmune gastritis on the basis of this criterion alone. Histologically, normal pyloric gland mucosa is taken from antrum, although atrophic mucosa is taken from the corpus in biopsy specimens. However, in a real clinical condition, a diagnosis is only rarely decided from biopsy specimens, and instead, is based on the results of serological examinations for gastrin, antiparietal cell antibody and anti-intrinsic factor antibody. A much more practical approach would be to diagnose autoimmune gastritis by imaging of the morphological features, that is, by using magnifying endoscopy, before serological confirmation.\n\n【26】We have previously described the characteristic features of the corpus in _H. pylori_ infection revealed by magnifying endoscopy \\[3–5\\] and classified such _H. pylori_ induced gastritis into four types (the so-called “Z classification”) which excludes an atrophic mucosa \\[4, 5\\]. However, in order to include cases showing an atrophic mucosa, the classification was subsequently modified and renamed the A-B classification system \\[3, 6\\]. The normal mucosa of the corpus without _H. pylori_ infection, as demonstrated by magnifying endoscopy, shows a pattern of regular round pits surrounded by a network of capillaries that coalesce into collecting venules; this is classified as type B-0 \\[3–6\\]. Mild gastritis due to _H. pylori_ shows round pits surrounded by a slightly irregular network of capillaries, and this is classified as type B-1 \\[3–6\\]. Active gastritis showing round pits with dividing sulci is classified as type B-2, and active gastritis with dilated pits and denser sulci is classified as type B-3 \\[3–6\\]. Atrophic mucosa with ridge surface structures is classified as type A-1 and that with villous to granular surface structures as type A-2 \\[3, 6\\].\n\n【27】Magnifying endoscopy shows that atrophic mucosa has an appearance different from that of nonatrophic mucosa. In case 1, closely arranged small round and oval pits were seen in the atrophic mucosa and, based on the above classifications, we considered that the patient had autoimmune gastritis. From this experience, we were able to diagnose cases 2 and 3 as autoimmune gastritis based on these magnifying endoscopic features, which differ from those of the atrophic mucosa in _H. pylori_ infection and are similar but not identical to those of the corpus in the absence of _H. pylori_ (type B-0).\n\n【28】We think that this feature of autoimmune gastritis revealed by magnifying endoscopy is very practical for diagnostic confirmation before ordering serological examination.\n\n【29】Additional cases of autoimmune gastritis studied by magnifying endoscopy are needed to confirm that the pattern described above is truly a unique feature of the corpus in this disease. It is interesting to note that the magnified view of the atrophic mucosa in the corpus of patients with autoimmune gastritis differs from that seen in _H. pylori_ induced mucosal atrophy. We speculate that this may be related to the differences in the pattern and type of inflammation between the two types of gastritis. In autoimmune gastritis, the inflammation is largely mononuclear and directed primarily against gastric glands, whereas in _H. pylori_ infection the inflammation shows an acute on chronic pattern and is directed against the bacteria located on the surface. In _H. pylori_ gastritis, the mucosal damage is largely a bystander effect, and most severe at the surface epithelium. Ongoing inflammation likely influences mucosal repair and does not allow reconstruction of the normal surface epithelium (i.e., the regular round pits are destroyed). In contrast, in autoimmune gastritis, the normal surface structure may remain intact or be subjected to less damage, remaining recognizable in the atrophic mucosa as a pattern of closely arranged round and oval pits.\n\n【30】The changes of surface epithelial structure in various types of gastritis are thought to differ according to cause, and the features revealed by magnifying endoscopy may provide clues for elucidating such changes in surface epithelial structure.\n\n【31】Furthermore, a gyriform-like structure surrounded by closely arranged small round pits in the atrophic mucosa, as seen in Case 3, may be a specific magnifying endoscopic feature of carcinoid arising from autoimmune gastritis. Further accumulation of cases of autoimmune gastritis, observed by magnifying endoscopy, will be necessary.\n\n【32】In conclusion, magnifying endoscopy has shown that, in autoimmune gastritis, the atrophic mucosa in the corpus has a characteristic pattern of closely arranged small and oval pits, thus differing markedly from the appearance of atrophic gastritis caused by _H. pylori_ infection. Magnifying endoscopic observation is thus very useful for diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis. Confirmation of the magnifying endoscopic features of autoimmune gastritis would not only make the endoscopic diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis more accurate but also help to clarify the changes in surface epithelial structure characteristic of gastritis due to various causes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

His thyroid function test confirmed marked hypothyroidism. Severe elevation of serum CK consistent with rhabdomyolysis was noted and an elevated creatinine indicated acute renal impairment. Patient’s condition improved significantly after starting him on thyroid hormone replacement therapy and aggressive hydration. Acute renal impairment with rhabdomyolysis in patients with hypothyroidism is quite rare and we expect that this case report adds to the existing literature on this subject. We also emphasize that thyroid status should be evaluated in patients with unexplained acute renal impairment and presenting with the symptoms of muscle involvement.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The effects of hypothyroidism on the renal function are fairly well established. These effects include histological changes as well as physiological changes. Most notable physiological changes include decrease in renal blood and plasma flow, decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), alterations in water and electrolyte balance especially hyponatremia, and changes in tubular secretory and absorptive capacity \\[1\\]. The changes to renal functions are subtle in most patients with hypothyroidism and are often overlooked in clinical setting. Moreover, this association is often inferred when patient’s renal impairment is improved by thyroid hormone replacement therapy.\n\n【4】Muscle disorders and other muscular manifestations are also common with hypothyroidism. These muscular manifestations may range from mere stiffness, weakness, or elevated creatinine phosphokinase to more serious manifestations such as Hoffman’s syndrome or rhabdomyolysis \\[2, 3\\]. Histological changes in muscles may be observed in hypothyroidism as well. Although the association between muscle disorders and hypothyroidism is well noted, the association of rhabdomyolysis characterized by muscle necrosis and myoglobinuria with hypothyroidism is very rare.\n\n【5】We report the case of a 33-year-old male with hypothyroidism who developed acute renal impairment with rhabdomyolysis. This case report joins the list of the selected few case reports that reported hypothyroid acute renal impairment along with the association of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 33-year-old Caucasian male was transferred to our hospital from outside facility with acute renal impairment. The patient had no significant past medical history other than gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and he was not known to be on any medication. He has history of tobacco use (rubbing and snuffing) for 20 years and drinks 3 cans of beer per week.\n\n【8】Patient presented with the chief complaint of bilateral lower extremities edema and generalized muscle weakness and cramps. These symptoms were noticed two days prior to the admission. Two months prior to the admission, the patient had also complained of tiredness and constipation. He had not been sleeping well at night. He denied being in unusual stress situation. He was also feeling colder than other people around him. Prior to the admission, the patient noted a weight gain of 10 pounds in 2 days. Patient denied any history of seizure, trauma, or fall recently although he mentioned that he had been doing a lot of snow shoveling over the past two weeks before admission.\n\n【9】On presentation, the patient had a body temperature of 36.6°C, pulse of 78 per minute, respiratory rate of 20, and blood pressure of 193/115 mm Hg. The patient was obese with a body mass index of 38.1 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>. On physical examination, he was alert and oriented. His conjunctivas were clear and pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. An enlarged, rubbery thyroid was palpable. Chest was clear on auscultation bilaterally and S1/S2 was normal with no murmur. Abdomen was soft and nontender. Pitting edema was noted in lower extremities bilaterally with slight muscle tenderness. No evidence of dehydration was found. No lymphadenopathy was noted. No motor or sensory disturbances were noted.\n\n【10】Blood tests showed a creatinine of 1.54 (reference: 0.62–1.27 mg/dL). His GFR was 52 (reference: 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was 13 (reference: 8–26 mg/dL). His CK was 7200 (reference: 48–222 U/L). Sodium was 141 (reference: 136–145 mmol/L), potassium was 4.2 (reference: 3.5–5.1 mmol/L), and chloride was 99 (reference: 96–111 mmol/L). Urine electrolytes were also measured. Fractional excretion of sodium (FE<sub>Na</sub>) was 0.88 pointing towards prerenal cause of renal impairment.\n\n【11】His TSH was 145.7 (reference: 0.3–5.9 lU/mL). TSH with free T4 reflex was 117.13 (reference: 0.3–5.9 _μ_IU/mL) and thyroxine free (free T4) was 0.3 (reference: 0.6–1.1 ng/dL). Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody was 150 (reference: 40 IU/mL).\n\n【12】Liver function tests showed an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 148 (reference: 8–48 U/L), alanine transaminase (ALT) of 82 (reference: 7–55 U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 239 (reference: 98–192 U/L). Lipid panel showed cholesterol of 365 (reference: 200 mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of 42 (reference: 39 mg/dL), and triglyceride (TG) of 257 (reference: 150 mg/dL).\n\n【13】White blood cell (WBC) count was 6.9 (reference: 3.5–11 10<sup>3</sup>/_μ_L). Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 12 (reference: 0–15 mm/hr). C-reactive protein (CRP) was 0.27 (reference: 0.8 mg/dL). B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was 20 (reference: 100 pg/mL). Hemoglobin (HGB) was 12.3 (reference: 13.1–17.3 g/dL). Ferritin was 515 (reference: 24–336 ng/mL). Serum iron was 93 (reference: 50–160 _μ_g/dL). Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) was 333 (reference: 260–400 _μ_g/dL). Iron saturation was 28 (reference: 20–50%). Urine analysis was negative for hematuria and proteinuria.\n\n【14】Ultrasound of thyroid showed a small thyroid that was hypoechoic and heterogeneous with diminished vascularity. These findings, although nonspecific, are suggestive of prior episodes of thyroiditis or long standing hypothyroidism. Ultrasound of kidney was unremarkable. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was within normal limit.\n\n【15】The patient was started on levothyroxine at 125 mcg and aggressive hydration. The patient was initially given IV fluids at a rate of 200 mL/hr for 8 hours in addition to the oral hydration. The fluids were subsequently tapered off. His creatinine decreased to 1.44 mg/dL and his CK decreased to 5409 U/L after a day of treatment. Leg edema and muscle cramps started improving rapidly after a day of treatment. At the time of presentation, the patient was also given IV hydralazine 10 mg to lower his blood pressure. He was subsequently continued on hydralazine 25 mg every six hours to manage his hypertension. Patient’s condition continuously showed improving trend over a 2-day period after which he was discharged.\n\n【16】On follow-up after four months, the patient’s creatinine decreased to 0.9 mg/dL and his GFR was 60 (reference: 59 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). His TSH was 0.469 (reference: 0.3–5.9 _μ_lU/mL). TSH with free T4 reflex was 6.22 (reference: 0.3–5.9 _μ_IU/mL). His HGB was 15.3 (reference: 13.1–17.3 g/dL). His AST level was 47 (reference: 8–48 U/L).\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Kidney and thyroid functions are closely interrelated and their interactions have been fairly well established \\[4–9\\]. Thyroid hormones are not only necessary for the growth and development of kidney; they also play a significant role in renal physiology. Hypothyroidism can affect renal hemodynamics and can also induce water and sodium retention leading to hyponatremia. The pathophysiology of renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism is still unclear. Renal impairment with hypothyroidism is thought to be due to reduced cardiac output and increased systemic and renal vasoconstriction leading to reduced renal blood and plasma flow and decreased GFR. Hemodynamic alterations in hypothyroidism, although important, are often subtle and cannot always fully explain the observed renal dysfunction. A study by Den Hollander et al. \\[10\\] noted that variations in the blood pressure during thyroid dysfunction are too small to explain the observed changes in renal function. Apart from the effect of hypothyroidism on cardiac output, triiodothyronine (T3) has a direct effect on systemic vascular resistance which can influence renal blood flow directly thus causing renal dysfunction \\[10, 11\\]. Moreover, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels correlate with free T3 and T4 levels \\[11\\], which may affect cardiac output and GFR. Another mechanism that can explain renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism is the influence that thyroid hormones have on tubular secretion of creatinine. Thyroxine (T4) is known to regulate Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>\\-ATPase activity in the sarcoplasmic reticulum of nephrons \\[12\\]. Another important mechanism of renal dysfunction in hypothyroidism is through muscle involvement. Muscle disorders and other muscular manifestations are common with hypothyroidism as creatinine production in muscles is dependent on thyroid status. These muscular manifestations may range from mere stiffness, weakness, or elevated creatinine phosphokinase to more serious manifestations such as Hoffman’s syndrome or rhabdomyolysis \\[3\\]. Acute renal impairment due to rhabdomyolysis induced by hypothyroid state is quite rare and only a handful of case reports are available \\[13–20\\]. This case report adds to this list and presents researchers with adequate data to characterize the rare occurrence of acute renal impairment due to hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【19】Rhabdomyolysis is associated with a wide variety of causes such as seizures, trauma, alcohol and drug abuse, strenuous exercise, drug induced and others. Rhabdomyolysis occurs frequently, but it is usually asymptomatic with abnormalities limited to lab findings. In severe cases, rhabdomyolysis can lead to electrolyte disorders and acute renal failure. There are many factors that can contribute to the development of more severe clinical symptoms in rhabdomyolysis such as hypovolemia, hyperthermia, electrolyte disorders, congenital muscle disorders, and hypothyroidism. As noted before, hypothyroidism is a quite uncommon underlying factor behind rhabdomyolysis that can not only trigger its onset but also affect its severity. In our case, patient’s rhabdomyolysis was triggered by exertion (snow shoveling) and the underlying hypothyroid status exacerbated its severity leading to acute renal impairment. Rhabdomyolysis was evident in our case based on severe elevation of serum CK to 7200 (reference: 48–222 U/L). Although there is no well-established serum CK level at which rhabdomyolysis is pronounced to occur, a concentration of five times the upper limit of the normal value has been suggested \\[21\\]. Serum CK levels are also considered to be a predictive measure indicating development of acute renal failure \\[21\\]; however, serum CK levels do not correlate with the severity of renal failure \\[22\\]. A creatinine of 1.54 (reference: 0.62–1.27 mg/dL) was noted indicating acute renal impairment. In each of the case reports that reported acute renal failure due to hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis \\[13–20\\], improvements were seen in patients after starting thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Cai and Tang \\[20\\] reported two patients who also required blood purification. Our patient improved significantly after starting him on thyroid hormone replacement therapy and aggressive hydration.\n\n【20】Our patient had edema in lower extremities bilaterally with slight muscle tenderness. Edema has been associated with thyroid dysfunction as studies suggest that thyroid hormones affect small vessel permeability leading to leakage of albumin from the vessels \\[23–25\\]. Decrease in renal plasma flow, GFR, and free water clearance associated with hypothyroidism can also contribute to edema in patients \\[26\\]. Hyponatremia is seen in patients with hypothyroidism \\[27\\], but it was not noted in our patient based on normal serum sodium level thus eliminating hyponatremia as the cause of rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【21】Hypothyroidism can adversely affect the hematological system and lead to development of anemia. In a study designed to measure the prevalence of anemia in patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism, Mehmet et al. \\[28\\] found that the frequency of anemia in patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism is statistically more significant than in the healthy control group. They also noted that anemia of chronic disease is the most frequently seen anemia type in patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism. We note that the patient reported here had anemia of chronic disease with elevated Ferritin and normal TIBC with HGB of 12.3. After treatment with levothyroxine, patient’s HGB returned to normal when followed up four months after hospital discharge.\n\n【22】Our patient had an elevated level of TPO antibody indicating chronic autoimmune thyroiditis as the cause of his hypothyroidism. Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis has been cited as the most frequent cause of hypothyroidism \\[29\\].\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【24】In this case report, we report an occurrence of acute renal impairment due to hypothyroidism induced rhabdomyolysis. Acute renal impairment with rhabdomyolysis in patients with hypothyroidism is quite rare and we expect that this case report adds to the existing literature on this subject and provides researchers with adequate data to characterize this disorder further.

Its use is often complicated by its vast side-effect profile including cardiovascular reactions, agranulocytosis, and seizures. Specifically, the cardiac complications of clozapine have been shown to predominantly cause myocarditis and pericarditis. In this case report, the case of a 58-year-old male being treated for treatment-resistant depression and schizophrenia who suffers from tachycardia is presented. He is treated empirically for orthostatic hypotension with IV fluids without much success. Further imaging and echocardiography demonstrated a pericardial effusion, a rare reaction (≤1 : 10000) that has only been documented in a handful of case reports. This anecdotal evidence highlights the significance of polyserositis/pericardial effusion in the context of clozapine-induced orthostatic hypotension resistant to rehydration. When starting a patient on clozapine, it is important to consider further workup and monitoring with laboratory baseline biomarkers and cardiac evaluation with symptomatic individuals. Upon immediate cessation of clozapine, the pericardial effusion should spontaneously resolve without complication and should not be rechallenged.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Clozapine has been significant in its efficacy as an antipsychotic drug for treatment-resistant psychotic depression \\[1\\]. Despite its lower risk of tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms, its use as an effective agent has been limited and complicated by its adverse side-effect profile. The most severe side effects include agranulocytosis, respiratory depression, and seizures \\[2\\]. However, there have been multiple uncommon adverse cardiovascular effects noted with its use, including hypotension, cardiac conduction abnormalities, tachycardia, myocarditis, polyserositis, and pericarditis \\[3, 4\\]. In particular, there have been very few reports of clozapine-induced pericardial effusion; hence, it is often disregarded as a potential etiology. In this report, we present a 58-year-old male with a history of schizophrenia who is treated with clozapine and has a subsequent moderate pericardial effusion and orthostatic hypotension. We will discuss the initial clinical management and diagnostic rule out during admission, as well as the resolution with immediate discontinuation of the medication.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 58-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of hypertension, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse, and panic disorder was admitted to inpatient psychiatry with symptoms of suicidal ideation and auditory hallucinations. He had failed trials of multiple antidepressants and antipsychotics. A month into his admission, due to treatment-resistant depression, he was started on clozapine 100 mg PO BID and lithium 300 mg PO daily. 12 days after the initiation of the medications, he developed the new onset of tachycardia ranging between 110–130s bpm and had a brief febrile episode of 102.5 F a couple days later. He underwent a U/A which showed cloudy urine with moderate leukocyte esterase, white blood cells 15–30, and few bacteria. The patient at the time did not note any dysuria or other urinary complaints.\n\n【6】He was initially recommended admission and started oral ciprofloxacin, which was immediately switched to IV ceftriaxone x3 days for a presumptive diagnosis of UTI. At initial evaluation, he was empirically treated with a bolus of IV fluids for orthostatic hypotension (supine 115/72, upright 103/59 mmHg). On admission, chest X-ray demonstrated no acute findings (Figure 1) and EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at a rate of 109 bpm with low-voltage QRS. His basic metabolic panel, TSH, fT4, and complete blood count were unremarkable as well. During his stay, he continued to have persistent tachycardia with a peak of 153 bpm despite completing the antibiotic regimen and IV fluids. Given his persistent tachycardia and concern for thrombus, he underwent a CTA chest (Figure 2) with contrast which demonstrated moderate pericardial effusion with subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes. Given the low-voltage QRS findings, he also had a TEE performed which demonstrated grossly normal LV function with small pericardial effusion present, without evidence of tamponade. A repeat EKG demonstrated similar sinus tachycardia at a rate of 118 bpm with low-voltage QRS. For the duration of admission, he had no complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, or discomfort.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Frontal (a) and lateral (b) chest X-ray images demonstrating no abnormalities or signs of pericardial effusion.\n\n【12】  \n**(a)**\n\n【13】  \n**(b)**\n\n【14】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】CTA chest with (a) and without (b) contrast enhancement demonstrating the moderate pericardial effusion. No pleural effusion or other abnormalities are present.\n\n【17】There was a discussion with the psychiatry team regarding concerns for the vast side effects from recently prescribed clozapine vs. moderate dehydration. He received more IV fluids, and clozapine was promptly discontinued. Infectious disease was consulted, and further workup demonstrated negative coxsackie B but a positive coxsackie A virus with titers 1 : 800. This was a confounding etiology for the pericardial effusion, despite limited literature supporting coxsackie A as a cause for a pericardial effusion. Blood and urine cultures were negative at the time as well. Although after discussion, alternative etiologies such as SLE, uremia, or malignancy were considered, limited clinical suspicion rendered further workup unnecessary at that time. Given the subacute presentation in the setting of a probable offending medication, idiopathic etiology was deemed less likely.\n\n【18】Only 3 days after discontinuation of clozapine, his tachycardia had spontaneously resolved, and a repeat EKG showed a resolved normal sinus rhythm at 91 bpm with normal QRS voltage. No treatment of the pericarditis was initiated given the presumed cause related to a medication adverse effect. His vitals continued to remain stable, and he was subsequently discharged home.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic which is often used as a last resort in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The dangerous side-effect profile includes agranulocytosis, seizures, respiratory depression, and a multitude of cardiovascular complications \\[2, 4\\]. This particular case is of interest, as there are only a handful of reported cases of pericardial effusion (polyserositis) and fewer still with concomitant orthostatic hypotension. According to the American College of Cardiology, there is _a_ ≤ 1 : 100 risk of suffering from the adverse effect of orthostatic hypotension. Despite myocarditis/pericarditis being ≤1 : 10000 risk, pericardial effusion was still not established as an adverse outcome \\[4\\]. As per French imputability of casualty assessment, this reaction received a designation of C1S3I2B2. This case report highlights the importance of careful cardiac monitoring in patients that are taking clozapine.\n\n【21】There are no published guidelines for managing and monitoring associated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and pericarditis outcomes from clozapine. However, there is well-documented evidence that markers including CRP, ESR, troponins, BNP, and echocardiography are all potentially useful in evaluating a baseline prior to regimen initiation \\[4\\]. In our case specifically, inflammatory markers including ESR and CRP were not obtained. Having baseline reference labs could have expedited the prediction of the underlying etiology of pericardial effusion/pericarditis. In addition, leukocytosis is another marker of pericardial syndrome. This was not identified during our patient’s hospital course, despite evidence of multiple other case reports with these findings \\[4, 5\\]. Some studies have shown the onset of eosinophilia may also predict cardiac outcomes associated with clozapine \\[4\\]. In patient outcomes of sudden cardiac death, there were found to be cardiac eosinophilic infiltrates with myocytolysis, attributed to a hypersensitivity drug reaction \\[6\\]. However, in this report, eosinophils in serum remained stable and within normal limits for the duration of admission. Despite strong evidence for using laboratory biomarkers in identifying a pericardial complication, they may not always be present. This may necessitate the use of further imaging studies to confirm a diagnosis.\n\n【22】During presentation of subacute tachycardia without any apparent pathology, in the context of clozapine initiation, a more robust cardiac evaluation with necessary imaging is likely to be beneficial. Given that the adverse effect of pericardial effusion can manifest at any point, from one week to years after treatment initiation, serious considerations for monitoring should be taken \\[7\\]. By obtaining a TEE early in the treatment course, we were able to obtain a timely and definitive diagnosis. This allowed for prompt discontinuation of clozapine and helped avoid any severe forms of pericardial tamponade, a potentially fatal complication. Spontaneous resolution of the effusion, as seen in our case, can also be seen in many other studies \\[4, 7, 8\\]. The 9.1 to 17.4 hr half-life of clozapine corresponds well with the several-day resolution seen following cessation of the drug \\[9\\].\n\n【23】The mechanism of the various clozapine-associated cardiovascular side effects is not well understood. Researchers have suggested sympathetic hyperactivity, decreased vagal tone, and cholinergic and adrenergic inhibition as potential causes. Since there is a lack of trials to demonstrate these pathophysiologies, studies that further elucidate the adverse effects and potential intervention and prevention strategies will be particularly valuable \\[10\\].\n\n【24】Following cessation, recommendations include careful supportive care only \\[11\\]. Follow-up EKG has been noted in prior studies, but despite lack of an evidence-based criterion, this is at the provider’s discretion \\[7\\]. A literature review found that patients rechallenged with clozapine after agranulocytosis and myocarditis had poorer outcomes \\[12\\].\n\n【25】An important takeaway from this case was that nonspecific tachycardia in the context of recent clozapine initiation should be closely monitored for an extended spectrum of cardiac toxicity. This should include preliminary laboratory markers for inflammation and leukocytosis (specifically eosinophilia). If IV fluids do not resuscitate the orthostasis, prompt evaluation with TEE should be considered to allow for quick discontinuation of the offending agent, clozapine.\n\n【26】#### Abbreviations\n\n【27】| PO: | Per os (by mouth) |\n| --- | --- |\n| BID: | Bis in die (twice daily) |\n| U/A: | Urinary analysis |\n| UTI: | Urinary tract infection |\n| EKG: | Electrocardiogram |\n| IV: | Intravenous |\n| CTA: | Computerized tomography angiography |\n| TSH: | Thyroid-stimulating hormone |\n| fT4: | Free thyroxine |\n| LV: | Left ventricle |\n| BP: | Blood pressure |\n| TEE: | Transesophageal echocardiogram |\n| CRP: | C-reactive protein |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| BNP: | Basic natriuretic peptide |\n| SLE: | Systemic lupus erythematosus. |\n\n【28】#### Data Availability\n\n【29】Data are available on request.\n\n【30】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【31】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "c14484c5-6d2c-4366-beaa-a2b454eb1a7c", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is a relatively rare condition that occurs in young patients as a result of anomalous anatomic relationships between the popliteal artery and the surrounding musculotendinous structures. Patients usually lack atherogenic risk factors and most commonly present with intermittent claudication in the early stages. In the later stages of undiagnosed PAES, acute ischaemia can occur as a result of complete arterial occlusion or embolism. Hence, early diagnosis and surgical release of the entrapment is crucial for good operative outcome and to prevent limb loss.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The anatomical basis of popliteal entrapment was first described by Stuart in 1879 \\[1\\] and the term “popliteal artery entrapment syndrome” was introduced by Love and Whelan in 1965 \\[2\\]. The condition is more common in men with a male-to-female ratio of 15 : 1 and can sometimes be bilateral \\[3\\]. Its true incidence is unknown but varies between 0.2%–3.5% \\[4\\]. PAES is mostly found in young sportsmen or soldiers with well-developed muscles and has even been described in military personnel who operate armored vehicles \\[5\\]. Typical patients are young and, therefore, lack the risk factors that would predispose them to atherosclerosis. The lack of such risk factors is the main reason for diagnostic delay \\[6\\]. The following case report outlines an unusual presentation of unilateral popliteal artery entrapment syndrome and delves into the importance of early diagnosis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 24-year-old fit-and-healthy ex-army officer presented with a two-day history of a cold, numb, and painful left lower leg; he had been doing vigorous exercises two days prior to admission. Over the past few months, the patient had experienced similar worsening leg pain after running long distances. Apart from smoking (5 pack years), the patient had no other significant cardiovascular risk factors.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed a regular heart rate of 60 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg. There was no palpable abdominal aortic aneurysm. Examination of the right leg was unremarkable. On the left side, there were normal palpable femoral and popliteal pulses, but no palpable distal pulses. The left foot also appeared paler; however, motor and sensory functions were intact.\n\n【7】An angiogram revealed a thrombotic occlusion of the proximal half of the popliteal artery and a small embolus in the mid-peroneal artery (Figure 1). Intraarterial thrombolysis (Alteplase) was commenced. A 24-hour followup angiogram showed a reduction in the size of the thrombus; however, there was still a stricture at the midpopliteal artery with an irregularity of the wall. The stricture was accentuated with the foot in dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. At 48 hours, the angiogram demonstrated that the thrombus had largely resolved; however, the stricture was still present. The site of stenosis was angioplastied which resulted in a marked improvement in blood flow.\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| Angiogram of the left leg before thrombolysis, showing complete occlusion of the popliteal artery. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】An MRI scan was subsequently performed and showed the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle going between the popliteal artery and vein where it inserted in a more lateral position (Figure 2). Having excluded bilateral disease on the MRI, the patient underwent surgery-division of the medial head of gastrocnemius with autogenous saphenous vein interposition graft. A postoperative duplex scan showed that the vein graft was patent with pulsatile signals. The patient’s recovery was uneventful and he was discharged 3 weeks after hospitalisation.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】| Axial T1-weighted MRI images through both knees at the level of the popliteal fossa showing the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle (white arrow) going between the popliteal artery (white arrow head) and vein (black arrow head). |\n| --- |\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Various classifications of PAES exist in the literature. The most commonly used one was proposed by Whelan \\[7\\] and divides this condition into five types (Table 1). Our patient was affected by Type II PAES (Figure 3).\n\n【19】Table 1 \n\n【20】Classification of PAES \\[7–9\\].\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 3 \n\n【24】| _Type 2 PAES_. The medial head of gastrocnemius muscle is attached more laterally. The popliteal artery courses medially and under the gastrocnemius muscle insertion. |\n| --- |\n\n【25】The presenting symptoms are variable and include leg swelling, aching pain, rest pain, and cramping of the calf. Physical signs are usually absent at rest, until complications develop. In young persons, symptoms are limited to intermittent claudication \\[4\\] and this is due to the intermittent compression of the artery during plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. Chronic extrinsic arterial compression leads to vascular microtrauma, early arteriosclerosis, and subsequent thrombosis \\[10\\]. Thrombus formation, in the later stages of PAES, may cause complete obstruction of the popliteal artery leading to acute limb-threatening ischaemia; this is commonly seen in patients who have not developed sufficient collateral circulation \\[11\\]. Hence, this condition needs to be included in the list of diagnoses in young patients who present with symptoms of peripheral vascular disease.\n\n【26】Angiography is the classical screening and diagnostic tool in PAES \\[12\\]. It can demonstrate compression of the popliteal artery with the ankle plantar flexed. Gourgiotis et al. \\[4\\] pointed out that an irregularity of the wall of the popliteal artery (in an otherwise normal arterial tree) should also raise suspicion of PAES. Transverse T1-weighted MR imaging is useful to evaluate the aberrant muscular anatomy of the popliteal fossa and also to demonstrate the deviation of the popliteal artery \\[10\\].\n\n【27】The most common and successful treatment option is muscle division to release the entrapment. If there is significant delay in diagnosis, the popliteal artery may become occluded, stenotic, or aneurysmal \\[13\\]. In such complicated cases, division of the anomalous musculotendinous structure and vascular reconstruction is generally required.\n\n【28】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】PAES is a rare but potentially limb-threatening condition affecting predominantly young male adults. This syndrome is difficult to diagnose and, therefore, poses a diagnostic pitfall. Awareness of this entity is a prerequisite for correct and prompt diagnosis. Careful history and physical examination is of utmost importance. It should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute popliteal artery occlusion or claudication in young patients with no cardiovascular risk factors. Early surgical intervention to release the popliteal artery is the treatment of choice and is important for good operative outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This condition poses a latent risk of bed sores. To prevent those complications, we used electroacupuncutre for decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. A 51-year-old man complained of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Prior to electroacupuncture, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium and baclofen. However, his rigidity had not improved. This patient received total 41 sessions of electroacupuncture. The patient’s Modified Ashworth’s Scale changed from 4 at baseline to 2 after the treatment, indicating an improvement in the rigidity of the upper limbs. Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale and passive ROM of the elbow joints also improved. We report the observed effects of electroacupuncture for decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. Further controlled studies are needed to determine whether electroacupuncture is a useful alternative treatment for decorticate rigidity in patients with anoxic brain damage.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】We report a case of decorticated rigidity due to anoxic brain damage that was successfully treated with electro-acupuncture combined with conventional therapeutic options such as muscle relaxants and physical manual therapy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case History\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Patient Characteristics and Diagnosis\n\n【6】A 51-year-old man complaining of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage was admitted to the Department of Cardiovascular and Neurological Diseases of Kyung Hee University Oriental Medicine Hospital. This patient had collapsed during a marathon and had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The doctors recognized acute myocardial infarction (MI) and provided conventional therapies for this condition. However, anoxic brain damage was caused by insufficient blood supply to the brain. He manifested rigidity, dyspnea, and dysphagia. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Although this patient had underlying hypertension and diabetes mellitus, he and his family had not recognized these conditions until onset of MI. At admission, he revealed GCS score 7 (E4 V0 M3) and used tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube. The brain computed tomography (CT) image taken at admission (Figure 1) revealed severe cerebral cortical atrophy. Laboratory data did not reveal abnormal values for all items. He was admitted to Kyung Hee University Oriental Medicine Hospital 3 months after onset. Prior to his admission, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium (25 mg) and baclofen (5 mg). However, his rigidity had not improved, and his condition had remained the same since onset.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| The brain computed tomography (CT) image at onset and admission time.

Treatment\n\n【13】Electro-acupuncture was performed as a therapy for symptoms of decorticated rigidity of the upper limbs. Daily electro-acupuncture treatment was performed between 14:00 and 15:00 for 41 consecutive days (PG-306, Japan). The acupoints used in this case were LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4, bilaterally. The following conditions were used: stimulation wave, biphasic (60 Hz); pulse duration, 0.4 ms; and stimulation strength, low. The electrical stimulation power was the same for each treatment (Pulse Generator PG-306, Suzuki Inc., Japan). The patient’s elbow joints and wrists showed mild movement during electro-acupuncture therapy. Each treatment procedure lasted 20 min and was performed by skilled specialists (Korean Medicine Doctor (KMD)) by using stainless steel acupuncture needles (Dongbang Acupuncture Inc., Korea; 40 mm (length) × 0.25 mm (diameter)). Furthermore, Bojungikgitang, a Korean herbal medicine decoction, is administered to control general condition of this patient. There was no change in total daily dose of dantrolene sodium and baclofen before and after electro-acupuncture treatment.\n\n【14】##### 2.3. Evaluation Methods\n\n【15】We used 3 methods to evaluate the effect of electro-acupuncture on the patient’s rigidity: the Modified Ashworth’s Scale (MAS) (Table 1) \\[1\\], Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale (Table 2) \\[2\\], and the measurement of the passive range of motion (ROM) of the elbow joints.\n\n【16】Table 1 \n\n【17】The Modified Ashworth’s Scale for grading spasticity \\[1\\].\n\n【18】Table 2 \n\n【19】Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale \\[2\\].\n\n【20】##### 2.4. Course of Symptoms\n\n【21】The patient was treated for 41 days, and the results are presented graphically in Figures 1, 2, and 3. The initial MAS score of 4 improved slightly during the procedure: the first improvement in this score (3 points) was observed after the 6th treatment, and a further improvement to 2 points was noted by the time of the 24th treatment. The MAS score remained at 2 points at the last session (Figure 2). The initial Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale score of 3 fell to 2 points after the 6th treatment. Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale score of 1 was noted at the time of the 24th treatment, and this value remained unchanged until the last treatment (Figure 3).\n\n【22】  \n\n【23】  \n\n【24】Figure 2 \n\n【25】| MAS score changes.

With continuous electro-acupuncture therapy, the passive ROM of both elbow joints improved. Approximately 24 days after initiating treatment, the passive ROM of left elbow joint increased to 180° and the passive ROM of the right elbow joint increased to 90°. The passive ROMs of the left elbow joint and the right elbow joint remained constant at 180° and 90°, respectively, until the last treatment (Figure 4).\n\n【31】  \n\n【32】  \n\n【33】Figure 4 \n\n【34】| Passive ROM changes of both elbow joints.

Abnormal posturing is an involuntary flexion or extension of the arms and legs, indicating severe brain injury. Decorticate rigidity exhibited as flexion of the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs indicates damage in the cerebral hemispheres, the internal capsule, and the thalamus. Our patient’s rigidity was a result of anoxic brain damage due to myocardial infarction.\n\n【37】This patient exhibited flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticated rigidity. This patient was diagnosed with anoxic brain damage on the basis of his medical history, symptoms, and brain imaging. Although he had been treated with conventional therapies for rigidity (muscle relaxants and physical therapy) after diagnosis, his symptoms did not improve before he was admitted to KyungHee University Oriental Medicine Hospital. The patient’s family and caregiver had trouble in moving the patient owing to his severe rigidity. Furthermore, his rigidity made it difficult to change his position for preventing the formation of decubitus ulcers, and this patient was at latent risk of bedsores.\n\n【38】Several studies have shown that electro-acupuncture can treat rigidity \\[3, 4\\]. One of these studies \\[4\\] has suggested that high-frequency and low-strength electro-acupuncture on LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 can reduce rigidity of the upper limbs in stroke patients. Because the rigidity of the upper limbs of stroke patients exhibits a flexion, the authors of this study used acupoints LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 to stimulate the arm extensor muscle group, which is an antagonist of the arm flexor muscle group. Although the diagnosis of the present case was anoxic brain damage, we observed a form of rigidity in this patient that was similar to that in stroke patients, namely, flexion of the upper limbs. As mentioned above, conventional therapy did not improve his rigidity. Thus, we used electro-acupuncture therapy based on the previous study in stroke patients (acupoints LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 and a high-frequency/low strength stimulation method (60 Hz, 0.4 ms pulse duration, and low strength)) to relieve our patient’s arm rigidity symptoms.\n\n【39】In the present study, the patient’s upper limb rigidity gradually improved during the follow-up period. The MAS score and Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale improved at both the 6th and 24th sessions. The passive ROM of both elbow joints also improved during the 41 sessions, and notably, the passive ROM of the left elbow joint showed a normal value at the endpoint. Therefore, we believe that electro-acupuncture was effective for treating this patient’s upper limb rigidity.\n\n【40】In general, anoxic brain damage which results in coma causes a vegetative state, and these patients will remain in a vegetative state until death. Therefore, prognosis of anoxic brain damage is very poor. And patients who reveal decorticate rigidity are in a coma or vegetative state and have poor prognoses, with risks for cardiac or respiratory arrest \\[5\\]. However, in this case, there were improvements in upper limbs rigidity due to anoxic brain damage. Thus, we could make it easy to move a patient and to change the patient’s position to prevent a decubitus ulcer and related complications such as pneumonia. We think that the use of electro-acupuncture for decorticate rigidity not only decreased tone of muscle of upper limbs but also prevented complications.\n\n【41】Baclofen is used to treat rigidity in conventional drug treatments \\[6, 7\\]. However, patients who have nephropathy cannot use baclofen owing to its toxicity; moreover, a previous study \\[8\\] has suggested that patients on dialysis are exposed to nephrotoxicity during baclofen intake. Therefore, baclofen cannot be used to treat rigidity in patients who have nephropathy. We believe that electro-acupuncture may be an alternative for treating decorticate rigidity in elderly people undergoing dialysis. In our case, treatment with conventional therapy (drugs and physical therapy) for decorticate rigidity did not result in improvement, but improvement was noted in the rigidity of the upper limbs after treatment with electro-acupuncture. Therefore, we propose that electro-acupuncture is a therapeutic option in patients who show no improvement despite therapy.\n\n【42】A limitation of the present case study is that we could not treat the rigidity of the lower limbs. The patient’s lower limbs exhibited extension, but we could not find any studies in the literature that provided therapeutic methods for lower-limb rigidity. In addition, because the symptoms of the lower limbs were less severe than those of the upper limbs at the time of admission, we concentrated our efforts on treating the rigidity of the upper limbs. Studies that provide data about treating lower-limb rigidity are required in the future. Furthermore, additional research is needed to determine the efficacy of electro-acupuncture on decorticate rigidity.\n\n【43】In summary, 41 days of electro-acupuncture treatment of LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 improved the rigidity of the upper limbs in patients with anoxic brain damage. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions based on a case study of only 1 patient, we propose that further studies would help determine whether electro-acupuncture is a plausible alternative in the treatment of decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in patients with anoxic brain damage.\n\n【44】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【45】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Histological evaluation was consistent with high-grade osteoblastic osteosarcoma. After completing chemotherapy we performed an extra-articular resection of the hip. Reconstruction was accomplished by reimplanting the acetabulum after irradiation and modular proximal femur megaprosthesis. Endoprosthetic reconstruction following proximal femur resection is a good treatment alternative achieving good postoperative function. Extra-articular resection of the hip using a periacetabular osteotomy technique enabled us to achieve wide margins and leave an intact posterior column to optimize acetabular reconstruction stability. Extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation is a valuable treatment option in a situation such as this where allograft geometric fit is a priority. We conclude that an extra-articular resection of the hip, followed by reconstruction with an extracorporeally irradiated acetabulum and a proximal femur modular megaprosthesis, is a useful combined treatment option for malignant lesions involving the hip joint, especially in paediatric patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of bone, with an incidence of 2.4% among childhood cancers \\[1\\]. Osteosarcoma commonly occurs in the long bones, near the metaphyseal growth plates; the femur is the most frequently involved bone. Articular cartilage acts as a relative barrier to tumor spread, and extension into the hip joint is extremely rare \\[2\\].\n\n【4】The management of a proximal femur malignant lesion with intra-articular involvement is challenging. The need for adequate excision margins and the anatomical complexity of the pelvis mean that reconstruction procedures are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, as well as poor functional outcome \\[3\\].\n\n【5】We present an unreported case of proximal femur osteosarcoma with intra-articular involvement, treated with extra-articular resection of the hip, reconstructed with an irradiated acetabulum structural autograft and proximal femur modular megaprosthesis replacement.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】We present a case of a previously healthy 8-year-old boy with a 5-month history of intermittent right hip and knee pain. The patient suffered a nondisplaced pathological femoral neck fracture, treated at another centre with closed reduction and internal fixation using two K wires. After two months of follow-up without clinical or radiological signs of fracture healing, the patient was referred to our centre. Plain radiographs of the pelvis, hip, and proximal femur showed mixed osteolytic and sclerotic areas at the right proximal femur and an unhealed femoral neck fracture fixed with two K wires (Figure 1(a)). Suspecting a primary bone tumor, an open biopsy was performed and the K wires were removed. Initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a proximal femur lesion extending distally 13 cm, with a surrounding soft-tissue mass. MRI also showed joint effusion, though there was no evidence of acetabular extension (Figure 1(b)). Histological evaluation was consistent with high-grade osteoblastic osteosarcoma. A chest CT scan and a bone scintigraphy did not show metastasis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the Erasmus 1 Trial protocol (Methotrexate, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin) was initiated and completed without incident.\n\n【8】  \n**(a)**\n\n【9】  \n**(b)**\n\n【10】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】(a) Plain radiographs of the pelvis, hip, and proximal femur showing mixed osteolytic and sclerotic areas in the right proximal femur and an unhealed femoral neck fracture fixed with two K wires. (b) MRI showing a proximal femoral lesion extending distally 13 cm with a surrounding soft-tissue mass.\n\n【13】With the patient in supine position, a utilitarian skin incision, as described by Kabukcuoglu et al. \\[4\\], was used. The iliac vessels and the femoral and sciatic nerves were exposed and mobilized. The intrapelvic portion of the psoas muscle was released and the gluteus maximus muscle was detached from the iliotibial band and femur. The external rotators of the hips were transected near their origins, and the vastus intermedius and lateralis were transected at the level of the femoral osteotomy.\n\n【14】A femoral osteotomy was made 16 cm distally from the tip of the greater trochanter, giving 3 cm of wide margin. The insertions of the adductors were transected from the proximal femur, followed by release of the gluteus medius and minimus. Subsequently an en bloc extra-articular resection of the acetabulum was performed, following the standard steps in a Bernese periacetabular osteotomy; the resected specimen was then transferred to a separate sterile trolley and moved away from the main operative field to avoid any contamination. Under aseptic precautions, a capsulectomy was made through the acetabulum rim, and samples of articular fluid and the proximal femur were sent for histological examination. Head size was measured for bipolar reconstruction. The acetabulum was placed in a sterile container and sent to the radiotherapy department for extracorporeal irradiation (Figure 2). The acetabulum segment, enclosed in a sterile pack, was irradiated to a dose of 50 Gy/1 fraction. Meanwhile we implanted a bipolar femoral modular megaprosthesis (Biomet OSS Compress) for proximal femoral reconstruction. Upon return to the operating room, the excised acetabulum was reimplanted and fixed with two reconstruction plates, achieving perfect geometric anatomic fit.\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Figure 2 \n\n【18】Following the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy, an en bloc extra-articular resection of the acetabulum was performed; the resected specimen was then transferred to a separate sterile trolley. A capsulectomy was made through the acetabular rim, and the articular fluid and proximal femur were sent for histological examination. The acetabulum was placed in a sterile container and sent to the radiotherapy department for extracorporeal irradiation.\n\n【19】Histological analysis revealed wide margin resection with 95% necrosis of the osteogenic osteosarcoma. Microscopic tumor implantations were seen at the distal capsular insertions. Articular fluid cytology showed no evidence of tumor cells.\n\n【20】Postoperatively the patient was immobilized with a spica cast for a period of 12 weeks. Three weeks after the index procedure the patient developed a superficial wound dehiscence which required aggressive surgical debridement and lavage. Tissue cultures were positive for _E. coli_. The patient received a 6-week course of intravenous Ciprofloxacin followed by 12 weeks of oral Ciprofloxacin. The patient initiated non-weight-bearing ambulation at 6 weeks. Three months after surgery the patient was allowed to progressively bear weight. Radiographic follow-up showed correct integration of the autograft and prosthesis (Figure 3). Currently, after 18 months, the patient walks with the use of a cane and there is no evidence of infection or tumor recurrence.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 3 \n\n【24】After 18 months of follow-up, a plain AP radiograph of the pelvis shows correct integration of the autograft and prosthesis.\n\n【25】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【26】Since the routine use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy began in the 1980s, limb salvage surgery reconstruction is generally the favored treatment option when managing extensive primary bone tumours, with limb salvage rates above 90% in most major centers. Endoprostheses have several advantages over biological reconstruction methods, being readily available in both custom-made and modular forms, initially reliable with low complication rates, and allowing rapid return to full weight bearing with predictable function \\[5\\].\n\n【27】Endoprosthetic replacement following tumor resection is a good treatment option for proximal femoral malignant lesions, due to its low complication rate and good postoperative function \\[4, 6\\]; however, the management of a proximal femoral malignant lesion with intra-articular involvement is challenging, especially in pediatric patients. The resection of a tumor at the level of the proximal femur results in loss of abductors and other musculature necessary for hip stability. This often leads to a higher dislocation rate. Hip dislocation is a recognized problem after the use of megaprostheses, with rates of dislocation varying from 1.7% to around 28% \\[4, 7, 8\\]. To reduce the risk of dislocation in our case, we decided to use a bipolar hemiarthroplasty as it is inherently more stable than total hip replacement. We reattached the abductors to a surgical mesh and directly to the prosthesis attachment site.\n\n【28】Periacetabular en bloc resection of the pelvis (Enneking \\[9\\] type II resection) including the anterior and posterior columns is the traditional treatment for malignant bone lesions affecting the hip joint, but this option may result in substantial loss of pelvic bone stock and compromise pelvic stability. Although several other reconstructive procedures have been reported, including pelvic prosthesis arthroplasty \\[10–14\\], allograft reconstruction (with or without a total hip prosthesis) \\[15, 16\\] arthrodesis \\[13, 17\\], and pseudarthrosis \\[13\\], a gold standard has yet to be established owing to poor postoperative function and major complication rates ranging from 33% to 56%.\n\n【29】Rüdiger et al. \\[18\\] described a posterior-column-preserving technique for the treatment of intra-articular malignant lesions, using the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy introduced in the 1980s by Ganz et al. \\[19\\] for the treatment of hip dysplasia. They reported two cases with intra-articular extension of a proximal femoral malignant lesion treated with extra-articular resection of the hip, reconstructed with a structural acetabular allograft and endoprosthetic replacement maintaining the continuity and stability of the pelvic ring. The use of the Bernese periacetabular osteotomy in our case had the main advantage of preserving the stability of the pelvic ring and also preserving a large bone contact area with intact vascular supply from the superior gluteal artery to the supra-acetabular and posterior column bone \\[20, 21\\]. Both facts contributed to early consolidation/integration of the irradiated graft and allowed increased loading of the hip and range-of-motion training \\[22\\].\n\n【30】Extracorporeal irradiation of autogenous timorous bone and its use for reimplantation was first described in 1968, by Spira and Lubin \\[23\\]. Since then, extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation (ECI) has been used as a surgical limb salvage technique for musculoskeletal malignant lesions. The major advantages of this surgical technique are biological reconstruction, no risk of disease transmission or immunological reaction, ready availability, and preservation of bone stock \\[24\\]. A recently published case series of 30 malignant tumours treated with extracorporeal irradiation and posterior reimplantation reported 90% excellent and good results, with two cases of surgical failure, and a 10% infection rate as the main complication \\[24\\]. In our case, although no evidence of tumor extension into the acetabulum was seen on MRI, there was extension into the capsule joint due to the pathological neck fracture. For this reason we considered the tumor as intra-articular and performed an extra-articular resection of the hip joint, in order to secure wide excision margins. Taking into account that we were treating a skeletally immature patient, we decided to reimplant the resected acetabulum after irradiation, in order to guarantee a perfect geometric match and because we did not have access to an acetabulum allograft of pediatric size.\n\n【31】The irradiation of the autologous acetabular graft in a skeletally immature patient may result in a premature fusion of the triradiate physeal cartilage. Fusion of the triradiate cartilage, as seen in young patients with pelvic or acetabular fractures, produces a disparate growth between the femoral head and the acetabulum, with subsequent incongruence of the hip joint resulting in subluxation of the femoral head, similar to the mechanism in developmental dysplasia of the hip \\[25\\]. In our case, although we reimplanted the autologous acetabular graft after extracorporeal irradiation, we replaced the proximal femur with a megaprosthesis, which should avoid future incongruence or mismatch between the prosthetic bipolar head and the acetabulum.\n\n【32】We conclude that an extra-articular resection of the hip using the Bernese periacetabular technique, followed by reconstruction with an extracorporeally irradiated acetabular autograft and a proximal femur modular megaprosthesis, is a useful combined treatment option for malignant femoral lesions involving the hip joint, especially in pediatric patients.\n\n【33】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【34】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

One of these adverse events is agranulocytosis, which, although rare, can be life-threatening if left untreated. The majority of agranulocytosis cases are caused by drugs, including antibiotics. Here, we report a case of severe agranulocytosis in a 96-year-old woman following antibiotic therapy which was successfully managed using recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and the appropriate choice of antibiotics to treat her concomitant infection.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Agranulocytosis is a rare and life-threatening condition, with an annual incidence of 1.1 to 4.9 cases per million population per year \\[1\\]. Up to 50% of agranulocytosis may be induced by nonchemotherapy drugs, such as antithyroid agents and antimicrobial medications \\[2\\]. The risk for developing this adverse event may be higher among elderly patients in Japan, who are often prescribed many types of medication, a phenomenon called polypharmacy \\[3\\].\n\n【4】The problem of polypharmacy is of particular concern in an aging society like Japan because elderly patients tend to have many underlying diseases as well as conditions that require various medications. We herein present a case of severe agranulocytosis following antibiotic treatment with garenoxacin and ceftriaxone. The patient was also prescribed 10 different kinds of medication regularly, making this a case that emphasizes the importance of recognizing severe drug-related adverse events and the potential danger of polypharmacy or unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 96-year-old woman was prescribed garenoxacin for 8 days after complaining of a bad cough, dyspnea, and anorexia at a nearby clinic. This was despite a simple laboratory blood test revealing a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7920/_μ_L (55% neutrophils) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 0.33 mg/dL, findings that were unremarkable. However, she developed high-grade fever on the following day, and intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g daily for 6 days) was added to her treatment regime two days after prescribing garenoxacin. After 5 days of therapy with ceftriaxone, a follow-up laboratory blood test performed showed a WBC count of 1050/_μ_L (0% neutrophils) and a CRP level of 6.67 mg/dL. Severe leucopenia was suspected, and she was referred to our hospital for evaluation.\n\n【7】During presentation, her blood pressure was 136/99 mmHg, her pulse rate was 87 beats per minute, and her body temperature was 37.4°C. Her respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute and peripheral oxygen saturation 97%. Chest sounds were normal, and other findings of physical examination were unremarkable. She was 150 cm in height with mild kyphosis and weighed 40 kg. She had a medical history of atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, hypotonic urinary bladder, lower back pain, and gastritis. Her daily medications included candesartan, lansoprazole, amlodipine, carbocysteine, zaltoprofen, tranexamic acid, rivaroxaban, bisoprolol, brotizolam, and celecoxib.\n\n【8】Full blood count performed at our hospital revealed severe leucopenia with a WBC count of 830/_µ_L (neutrophils 7/_µ_L, eosinophils 8/_μ_L, basophils 18/_μ_L, monocytes 378/_μ_L, and lymphocytes 415/_μ_L). Other laboratory data are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph and computed tomography showed mild infiltrative shadow on her left lung. However, both blood and sputum culture results were negative.\n\n【9】Table 1 \n\n【10】Laboratory data on admission.\n\n【11】She was diagnosed with drug-induced agranulocytosis (presumably from antibiotics used) with mild pneumonia and admitted to an isolated room. Candesartan, lansoprazole, amlodipine, and celecoxib were discontinued because they are also known to cause agranulocytosis. She was given meropenem hydrate intravenously (2 g/day) and levofloxacin hydrate orally (500 mg/day) for 10 days, after which a short course of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (4 g/day) was administered. Subcutaneous injection of filgrastim (recombinant human G-CSF, 75 _µ_g/day) was also given to treat her neutropenia.\n\n【12】Filgrastim was administered for 6 days before the neutrophil count normalized to 2539/_µ_L on day 6. Although her neutrophil count increased to 12,940/_µ_L on day 9, it eventually stabilized around 3000 to 4000/_µ_L after day 13. Table 2 summarizes the changes in WBC count, neutrophil count, and CRP levels during her hospitalization. Her fever receded after day 10, and she was discharged on day 18 without further complications.\n\n【13】Table 2 \n\n【14】Change in laboratory data after admission.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Although there is no clear consensus, polypharmacy may be defined as the concomitant use of five or more medications per day \\[4\\]. Polypharmacy is a major concern in Japan as older patients such as ours are often given many different medications (10 in our patient) on a regular basis. The fact that patients have easy access to different specialists in Japan also increases the probability of polypharmacy as they often see many physicians without a primary care doctor carefully monitoring their medications. Furthermore, our patient was prescribed antibiotics, which may be due to her old age and the risk of developing pneumonia, after presenting with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The questionable practice of treating acute respiratory infections with antibiotics is still common in Japan. Lack of proper patient education has resulted in increased patient satisfaction when they are prescribed antibiotics \\[5\\]. Studies have also demonstrated that the use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections does not result in increased adverse events and may even be slightly beneficial in preventing pneumonia hospitalization \\[6\\].\n\n【17】Nevertheless, a recent study showed that older female patients as well as those with multiple comorbidities and medications (which fit our patient’s profile) have the highest risk of adverse drug reactions in the acute care setting \\[7\\]. This includes life-threatening conditions such as agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis, although rare, can be caused by many different drugs, including antibiotics \\[2, 8\\]. Without early detection, this condition may result in serious infections and subsequently sepsis \\[9\\]. In our patient’s case, due to the timing and development of her agranulocytosis, we believe that it was most probably caused by garenoxacin or ceftriaxone, either directly or through interactions with her other drugs.\n\n【18】Currently, the standard treatment for drug-induced agranulocytosis is discontinuation of the responsible agent(s), antibiotic treatment if the presence of infection is suspected, and proper use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Although their efficacy is not conclusively proven, G-CSF has minimal toxicity and may be beneficial in the management of drug-induced agranulocytosis in elderly patients \\[10\\]. Minor complications include bone pain and leukocytosis, which occurred in our patient but normalized after discontinuing therapy. As for antibiotic treatment, cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) is often employed as a first-line therapy for agranulocytosis with infection. Meropenem can be used as an alternative when cefepime is not tolerated well \\[11\\]. A recent study also demonstrated that, for severe cases (neutrophil count < 100/_µ_L), meropenem may be the superior choice for monotherapy \\[12\\]. Meropenem was used due to the severely low neutrophil count and also because our patient’s agranulocytosis may have been caused by ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin).\n\n【19】In conclusion, we reported a case of severe agranulocytosis in an elderly patient which was managed successfully using rhG-CSF and proper choice of antibiotics. Elderly patients who are being prescribed many different medications need to be carefully managed and monitored for various adverse drug events.\n\n【20】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【21】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Data concerning their adverse effects has been lately describing central nervous system (CNS) demyelination process at escalating basis. _Case Presentation_. A 23-year-old male with autoimmune uveitis and a family history of multiple sclerosis (MS) developed two neurological attacks, after Adalimumab infusion, simultaneously with several cerebral lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hence the diagnosis of Adalimumab induced MS was suspected. _Conclusion_. This case is reported to tell physicians to be cautious when using anti-TNF-_α_ in patients with family history of MS and to reconsider the risk of MS in patients with autoimmune diseases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】TNF-_α_ is a well-known proinflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokine. It mediates inflammatory cell recruitment to the site of the infection by activating endothelial cells. Elevated levels of this cytokine, however, were detected both locally and systemically in patients with inflammatory disorders like arthritis \\[1\\]. Drugs that block the effect of TNF-_α_ have shown beyond dispute role in modulating the activity of many autoimmune diseases. Depending on their mechanism of action, anti-TNF-_α_ drugs are divided into monoclonal antibodies (Infliximab, Adalimumab, Golimumab, and Certolizumab) and soluble TNF-_α_ receptors (Etanercept). Many side effects have been recorded during the relatively short history of utilizing anti-TNF-_α_ in the field of autoimmune diseases such as infectious disease \\[2\\], autoimmune disease \\[3, 4\\], blood dyscrasia \\[5, 6\\], pulmonary fibrosis \\[7\\], congestive heart failure \\[8\\], and malignancies \\[9\\] among other adverse effects such as central and peripheral demyelination of the nervous system and optic neuritis.\n\n【4】CNS demyelination was conducted by several reports suggesting triggering or exacerbating demyelination diseases induced by treatment with anti-TNF-_α_.\n\n【5】In Table 1 we review the most important studies in medical literature concerning this idea.\n\n【6】Table 1 \n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 23-year-old Arabic gentleman from Syria had a positive family history of MS affecting two of his uncles (maternal and paternal uncles; no blood relationship existed between the parents) and idiopathic epilepsy affecting his sister. His past medical history was positive for chronic autoimmune uveitis since the age of 13. It was then treated with Methotrexate with poor response, and thus it was substituted for combination of Cyclosporine and Azathioprine which achieved a better control. A year ago, Azathioprine was suspended for a while because of the political situation and Adalimumab was initiated. Few days following the second dose of Adalimumab, the patient developed right hemibody anesthesia which lasted two weeks and was successfully treated with intravenous methylprednisolone. Adalimumab was then stopped and both of Azathioprine at a dose of 3 mg/kg and oral prednisolone were initiated. Five months later, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was requested and revealed multiple periventricular and juxtacortical lesions with high T2 signal intensity along with T2 hypersignal lesion in the spinal cord at the level of the fourth cervical vertebra C4; none of these lesions were contrast enhancing (Figure 1).\n\n【9】  \n**(a)**\n\n【10】  \n**(b)**\n\n【11】  \n**(c)**\n\n【12】  \n**(d)**\n\n【13】  \n**(e)**\n\n【14】  \n**(f)**\n\n【15】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)**   \n**(f)**\n\n【16】Figure 1 \n\n【17】(a, b, c, and d) Flair MRI slices (axial and coronal slices) show periventricular and juxtacortical high intensity lesions. (e) Axial T2 MRI shows multiple juxtacortical high intensity lesions. (f) Sagittal T2 MRI of the cervical spinal cord shows T2 hyperintense lesion at the level of C4.\n\n【18】Visually evoked potentials (VEP) were also performed and were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was normal and negative for oligoclonal bands (OCBs).\n\n【19】Eight months following Adalimumab infusion, the patient had right lower limb paresis which was also successfully treated with methylprednisolone, and normal strength was restored within three weeks. Six months after then, the patient was referred by a rheumatologist to a neurology clinic for consultation and followup though there has been no new attack since then.\n\n【20】Neurological examination was normal except for anisocoria with slightly irregular pupils and bilaterally sluggish reaction to light (an abnormality that was explained by chronic uveitis) with normal fundoscopy and visual acuity. Mild right facial and body hemihypoesthesia, absent abdominal reflexes over the right side, generalized hyperreflexia (+3), and mild right lower limb spasticity were also noticed. To find out the relationship between the uveitis and the neurological attacks, the type of uveitis was reassessed and revealed hints of anterior and intermediate uveitis with no signs of active inflammation. An X-ray of sacroiliac joints and chest X-ray were then requested to rule out both subclinical ankylosing spondylitis and sarcoidosis and were both normal. Brain MRI with contrast was repeated and revealed no new lesions comparing with the previous one (Figure 2).\n\n【21】  \n**(a)**\n\n【22】  \n**(b)**\n\n【23】  \n**(c)**\n\n【24】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【25】Figure 2 \n\n【26】(a and b) Axial T2 MRI shows multiple periventricular and juxtacortical high intensity lesions. (c) Coronal flair MRI shows periventricular and juxtacortical high intensity lesions.\n\n【27】The previous laboratory study was reviewed and showed normal ordinary labs including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatic factor (RF), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies C-ANCA and P-ANCA were all negative. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) analysis revealed HLA-B27. CSF analysis showed acellular fluid with immunoglobulin G (IgG) index of 0.53, normal protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and glucose levels. Despite the lack of enhancement, diagnosis of Adalimumab induced MS was suspected in this patient with HLAB-27 associated uveitis depending on Mcdonald’s criteria for space and time distribution and the temporal relationship between the first neurological attack and drug initiation besides the positive family history of MS. Since there were no active lesions on MRI, treatment plan was continued with no modification and regular clinical and radiological followup was suggested.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【29】This case describes two separate neurological attacks in a young patient with HLA-B27 associated uveitis and a family history of multiple sclerosis. Although neurological attacks meet Mcdonald’s criteria for time and space distribution, many differential diagnoses are plausible for this presentation, MS with associated uveitis, HLA-B27 associated uveitis and a newly diagnosed MS as two separate entities, and systemic vasculitis induced uveitis and cerebral lesions. Infectious causes and lymphoma, however, are improbable due to the prolonged history and negative laboratory investigations.\n\n【30】A certain type of uveitis, uveitis pars planitis, is considered a manifestation of MS that often precedes or, less often, accompanies the first attacks \\[17\\]. The type of uveitis was reassessed accordingly and revealed both anterior and intermediate uveitis which is, along with the prolonged history of uveitis, less compatible with MS and more compatible with HLA-B27 uveitis with or without seronegative arthritis such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). During 10 years of uveitis, the patient had no arthritis, gastrointestinal symptoms, skin lesions, or even lower back pain. Moreover, AXR of the pelvis revealed no sclerotic changes.\n\n【31】Despite its obscurity, a relationship between MS and autoimmune diseases was deduced because of the high prevalence of MS in patients with autoimmune diseases as suggested by many reports \\[18–20\\]. This speculation added to the positive family history of MS renders this patient highly susceptible to MS. Furthermore, the temporal relationship between the first attack and Adalimumab infusion makes Adalimumab induced or provoked MS the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【32】Suspected MS following anti-TNF-_α_ treatment in patients with family history of MS was reported in many cases \\[14, 18\\] which recommended that anti-TNF-_α_ should be avoided in such patients and advocated requesting cerebral MRI before treatment initiation in patients with high risk of MS \\[21, 22\\].\n\n【33】Several mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the paradox of MS activation in spite of amelioration of systemic inflammation following anti-TNF-_α_ infusion such as the presence of blood brain barrier (BBB). This barrier halts the entry of anti-TNF-_α_ drugs to CNS. Meanwhile, these drugs enhance T cell receptor signaling and the functionality of antigen presenting cells and, consequently, they activate CNS demyelination. This is the essence of lack of entry theory. Presence of BBB was also the culprit in sponge theory wherein TNF-_α_ is supposed to be drawn out of joint synovial fluid following TNF-_α_ antagonism whereas BBB prevents this process in CNS. Thus TNF-_α_ gradient develops across BBB and results in upregulation of TNF-_α_ receptor expression in CNS. Moreover, severely destructed BBB in experimental autoimmune encephalopathy mice models besides the high dose used have been supposed to facilitate anti-TNF-_α_ entry to CNS and permit the subsequent amelioration \\[23\\]. Other theories hypothesized that tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) is a potential regenerator of oligodendrocytes. Hence blocking TNF-_α_ may prevent this natural mechanism and suppress remyelination \\[24\\]. Another hypothesis postulated that anti-TNF-_α_ drugs promote interferon _γ_ (INF-_γ_) expression and this in turn disturbs the balance between INF-_β_ and INF-_γ_ levels which triggers demyelination process \\[23\\]. Whether the precise mechanism is uncovering or inducing demyelination is still undetermined.\n\n【34】Although some points argue against MS such as OCBs negativity and the lack of contrast enhancement, MS negative OCBs are a well-established entity that represents 20–30% of MS patients \\[25\\]. Moreover, OCBs could be detected later on during the circumstance of MS. No clear data is available regarding frequency of OCBs negativity in anti-TNF-_α_ induced MS since most of the reports of similar cases did not mention the results of OCBs analysis. The lack of enhancement, however, may be explained by the time window between performing MRI and the clinical attacks; such window would have guaranteed the resolution of enhancement if it existed in addition to treatment with Azathioprine, a drug that has been accepted as a disease modifying treatment of MS \\[26\\].\n\n【35】Asymptomatic cerebral lesions highly suggestive of MS are widely described in patients with family history of MS under the title of radiographically isolated syndrome (RIS) \\[27, 28\\], but explicit clinical attacks turn RIS into clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or MS. Most of the reported cases depicted several months of using anti-TNF-_α_ agents preceding the development of clinical attacks \\[13, 16\\], while in this case development of the first clinical attack took place days following the second dose, a period that suggests a process of uncovering latent MS rather than inducing it. Even though second clinical attack occurred approximately eight months after halting Adalimumab, MRI performed six months later revealed no active disease; consequently no treatment modification was suggested, and if hints of clinical or radiological activity are noticed later on, Rituximab would be the treatment of choice of both uveitis and MS.\n\n【36】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【37】MS is highly expected in patients with family history of MS and, to a lesser degree, in patients with autoimmune diseases, and physician should consider such risks in patients who are eligible for anti-TNF treatment by detailed history, examination, and close followup as well as performing MRI prior to therapy initiation in highly suspected individuals.\n\n【38】#### Abbreviations\n\n【39】| TNF-_α_: | Tumor necrosis factor _α_ |\n| --- | --- |\n| CNS: | Central nervous system |\n| MS: | Multiple sclerosis |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| VEP: | Visually evoked potentials |\n| CSF: | Cerebrospinal fluid |\n| OCBs: | Oligoclonal bands |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| CRP: | C-reactive protein |\n| ANA: | Antinuclear antibodies |\n| RF: | Rheumatic factor |\n| ANCA: | Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies |\n| HLA: | Human leukocyte antigen |\n| IgG: | Immunoglobulin G |\n| LDH: | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| IBD: | Inflammatory bowel disease |\n| BBB: | Blood brain barrier |\n| TNFR2: | Tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 |\n| INF: | Interferon |\n| RIS: | Radiographically isolated syndrome |\n| CIS: | Clinically isolated syndrome. |\n\n【40】#### Additional Points\n\n【41】_Availability of Data and Materials._ All available data are included within the manuscript.\n\n【42】#### Consent\n\n【43】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【44】#### Competing Interests\n\n【45】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【46】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【47】Rana Alnasser Alsukhni and Ziena Jriekh made substantial contributions to the conception of the manuscript.

The diagnosis is challenging due to the rarity, nonspecific symptoms, and absence of the alarmingly high blood glucose levels, and thus, it could be initially missed resulting in delayed treatment. This is particularly important for sedated patients, as the absence of typical clinical signs and symptoms can obscure the diagnosis. We present the case of a patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus on empagliflozin who developed EDKA while sedated after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) despite stopping the medication 24 hours prior to surgery. We also summarize the current literature on EDKA after CABG. Physicians must be aware and maintain a high index of suspicion for the illness, especially in patients with T2DM taking SGLT-2i and undergoing a major operation such as CABG. Emergent treatment and multidisciplinary follow-up are needed to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications. Physicians should also consider identifying the optimal time to discontinue SGLT-2i before major surgeries and possible ketone studies in such patients, especially those sedated following the surgery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most serious complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). It is characterized by hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.3 and serum bicarbonate <18 mmol/L), and ketosis \\[1\\]. This complication typically develops in patients with type 1 DM and, to a lesser extent, type 2 DM (T2DM). It is commonly associated with stress, such as that associated with major surgery or infection. Rarely, these patients could present with a relatively lower blood glucose (BG) level (<250 mg/dL), which is referred to as “euglycemic” DKA (EDKA) \\[1\\]. Although it is rare, this entity has been described in the literature. In fact, it was reported that approximately 2.6%–3.2% of all DKA admissions are euglycemic \\[2\\].\n\n【4】Among different associated factors, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) (i.e., gliflozins) are believed to be linked to EDKA, with rates ranging from 0.16 to 0.76 events per 1000 patient-years in patients with T2DM \\[2, 3\\]. This rare variant of DKA poses a challenging diagnosis for physicians as patients with normal or near-normal BG levels may be initially overlooked resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment, which can be fatal. EDKA related to SGLT-2i is important to consider in diabetic patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The use of SGLT-2i has become more common in this population after data suggesting a mortality benefit \\[4\\]. T2DM patients with cardiac diseases taking gliflozins are prone to experience many stressors, especially when complicated with an acute CVD event (e.g., myocardial infarction, heart failure exacerbation, and cardiac surgeries), which can further increase their chances of getting gliflozin-induced EDKA. In the same context, we present a case of a T2DM patient on SGLT-2i who developed EDKA, while sedated, after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). Moreover, we sought to conduct a literature search on EDKA after CABG to shed the light and attract the attention of the medical community to this rising issue.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 52-year-old male, with the past medical history significant for T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and ischemic heart disease (IHD), presented to the cardiology clinic complaining of recurrent chest pain. He has had chest pain for a long period of time, which was getting more severe one week prior to hospital admission. He denied any history of smoking, illicit drug use, or alcohol consumption. At that time, his physical examination was unremarkable. He was on vildagliptin-metformin (50/1000 mg), empagliflozin (10 mg), pioglitazone (30 mg), irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide (300/12.5 mg), atorvastatin (20 mg), and aspirin; however, he was not compliant, which was associated with poorly controlled blood pressure and glucose levels. His laboratory results (Table 1) were within normal limits, except for abnormal HbA1c (10.24%) and lipid profile. His ECG showed sinus tachycardia with no acute ischemic changes. Echocardiography showed an ejection fraction (EF) of >50% with no wall motion abnormalities. CT coronaries showed 70% stenosis at the left main coronary artery. Due to these findings, the patient was advised to undergo diagnostic coronary angiography which revealed triple vessel disease. After thorough discussion between the patient, cardiology, and cardiac surgery physicians, the decision was made to operate on the patient with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Owing to his critical lesions, the patient was admitted and closely monitored until the day of surgery. At that time, he was started on insulin sliding scale. Additionally, metformin-vildagliptin was held before coronary angiography, while the other medications, including empagliflozin, were continued until 24 hours prior to the surgery. His laboratory results were normal (Table 1), except for high fasting glucose. He was fasting for a total of 8 hours before the surgery.\n\n【7】Table 1 \n\n【8】Blood tests of our patient at 5 different occasions.\n\n【9】The patient underwent grafting of the diseased vessels. The patient tolerated the surgery well, came off the cardiopulmonary bypass without difficulties, and did not need inotropic support. He was shifted to the ICU in a stable condition. On the same day, the patient was sedated on mechanical ventilation. Initially, he was clinically and vitally stable on minimal noradrenaline dose with no oozing from drain sites. Six hours after leaving the OR, his arterial blood gases (ABG) showed anion gap metabolic acidosis, with high lactate (3.3 mmol/L), that was resistant to IV fluid boluses. At that time, although his random blood glucose measures were ranging between 145 and 188 mg/dL, he had a blood pH of 7.225, with markedly decreased HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> (14.60 mmol/L) and an anion gap of 17.40, consistent with moderate DKA. Urinalysis showed 3+ ketones (Table 2). Therefore, the decision was made to follow the DKA protocol for management in addition to closely monitoring his electrolytes and blood glucose levels. As soon as DKA was detected, he was started on IV fluids and insulin infusion. For fluids, he was given 1000 cc bolus of Ringer’s Lactate followed by ½ Normal Saline (NS) at a rate of 150 cc/hour for one hour. Then, the patient was transitioned to Dextrose 5% ½ NS (150 cc/hour). After a few hours, the rate was decreased to 100 cc/hour. The next day, he was transitioned to 0.9% NS (70 cc/hour). The patient was kept on insulin for 12 hours from the time of EDKA diagnosis. Hours after treatment, the patient began to improve (Tables 1 and 2). His pH normalized, and his K+ level went down to 3.7 mmol/L. Urine ketones went from 3+ to 1+.\n\n【10】Table 2 \n\n【11】ABG and urinalysis of our patient at 4 different occasions.\n\n【12】On the following day, the patient was awake and oriented. He did not have any active complaints. He was clinically and vitally stable. He received two units of packed RBCs due to his low hemoglobin (7.40 g/dL). His ABG normalized with a blood pH of 7.418, K+ of 3.90 mmol/L and an HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> level of 23.3 mmol/L. At that time, his urinalysis was negative for ketone bodies. The next day, the patient was shifted to the cardiology floor with improving overall health status and hemoglobin level. He has had an uneventful hospital course for 8 days during which he was steadily improving. Subsequently, the patient was discharged home in a stable condition with appropriate follow-up appointments.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】The diagnosis of EDKA is challenging for several reasons. The fact that EDKA is rare, and more so in patients with T2DM \\[5\\], the nonspecific symptoms of the illness, and the absence of alarmingly high BG levels (i.e., >250) are all contributing factors that allow the diagnosis to be easily missed. The rarity of such an illness could be due to underdiagnosis, underreporting, and more likely, due to true rarity in occurrence. The recent possible role that SGLT-2i may play in the development of EDKA has encouraged physicians and researchers alike to uncover novel information regarding the incidence and underlying mechanism of the illness associated with these agents.\n\n【15】SGLT-2i are a new class of antidiabetic medications that lower BG levels by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules. It is suggested that SGLT-2i can lead to EDKA by decreasing BG levels, which leads to a reduction in insulin secretion and consequent rise in glucagon. In addition, SGLT-2i can directly stimulate glucagon production. As a result of low insulin and high glucagon levels, ketogenesis will be activated \\[5\\]. One study estimates a 7-fold increase in DKA in patients with T2DM due to SGLT-2 inhibitor use \\[6\\]. However, not all of these cases were euglycemic.\n\n【16】SGLT-2i have demonstrated cardioprotective effects and reduction in cardiovascular negative outcomes making them an excellent choice for patients with diabetes and CVD, such as our case \\[7\\]. The benefits of SGLT-2i in such patients must be outweighed against the risks of adverse effects, especially in times of stress (i.e., CABG), and the current recommendations suggest the omission of SGLT-2i dose one day before surgery \\[8\\]. Nevertheless, there have been cases described of perioperative EDKA in patients who have had these medications omitted for up to 48 hours \\[9\\]. In accordance with the current recommendations of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology \\[8\\], empagliflozin was omitted 24 hours before our patient’s surgery, yet he still developed EDKA postoperatively. The time since the medication is held prior to surgery is an important factor to consider, due to two main reasons: the absence of the offending agent (i.e., gliflozin use) and the patient being put on insulin. Being on insulin for a greater period of time (e.g., >48 hours) is theoretically expected to decrease the chances of gliflozin-induced EDKA. The suggested hypothesis is related to low blood insulin levels and resultant switch of glucose to fat metabolism and subsequent development of ketosis and ketoacidosis. This is of important relevance in patients taking SGLT-2i, as they were most likely put on the medication due to its positive glycemic and cardioprotective effects \\[10\\]. Moreover, the fasting state prior to surgery presents its own added risk to developing EDKA, perhaps due to increased ketogenesis during periods of starvation, adding another factor that can possibly lead to, or exacerbate, this patient’s condition \\[11\\].\n\n【17】In addition to highlighting the relationship between the offending agent (SGLT-2i) and the population at risk, it is worth focusing on the parts of the story that made the diagnosis challenging. In our case, the diagnosis of EDKA was not easy since the patient was sedated after CABG; thus, the common clinical presentation of DKA (abdominal pain, polyuria, excessive thirst, nausea, and vomiting) could not be appreciated, unlike other cases wherein patients were awake, oriented, and had typical symptoms of DKA \\[5, 12\\]. Additionally, his blood glucose levels postoperatively were well below 200 mg/dL; thus, it could have discouraged the caring physician to initiate continuous insulin infusion, which is the usual practice in most of the critically-ill or post-major surgery patients with diabetes. The ABG that showed anion gap metabolic acidosis that is resistant to IV fluids prompted further workup, wherein ketonuria was detected. Supplementary Figure 1 represents the connection between T2DM, SGLT-2I, and major stressors with EDKA development.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Review of the Literature\n\n【19】To better evaluate EDKA after CABG, we performed a literature search on PubMed (19 April 2021) using the following search string: ((Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis) AND (coronary artery bypass surgery)) without time restrictions, in addition to carefully assessing the references of certain EDKA articles for possible matches. Out of 67 PubMed articles, 5 articles were retrieved that reported on a total of 7 patients and were published between 2018 and 2021. Table 3 summarizes the reported cases of EDKA after CABG in the literature. Interestingly, our search string did not include any keywords related to SGLT-2i; however, all the retrieved articles had SGLT-2i use in common. The time since gliflozin was held preoperatively was reported to be within 1 day prior to surgery in most of the cases; however, it was still possible for patients to develop EDKA when withholding the medication was carried out 42 and 48 hours before CABG \\[13, 16\\]. Moreover, most of the patients showed some signs and symptoms that usually accompany DKA, unlike our patient. Serum lactate was normal in the majority of cases, and even the patients who have had high serum lactate (e.g., 2.24, 2.8) did not reach to a clear cutoff level that is equivalent to lactic acidosis (serum lactate >5.0 mmol/L) \\[18\\]. Moreover, the time between CABG and EDKA development can extend up to a few days, as Zhand and Tamilia reported about their patient \\[15\\]. Of note, one article reported on a patient with EDKA after CABG who was on SGLT-2i that was held for >24 hours prior to surgery \\[19\\]; however, this article was not included in our table since it is in Japanese and, thus, could not be thoroughly analyzed.\n\n【20】Table 3 \n\n【21】Reported cases of EDKA after CABG.\n\n【22】Based on the current evidence, physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for EDKA when dealing with cardiac patients on SGLT-2i, especially when these patients are to experience periods of excessive stress. This may be due to the absence of the easy and quick screening measure of typical hyperglycemia and the absence of clinical symptoms, especially in sedated patients. Patients with EDKA need immediate referral for emergency evaluation and management. The treatment includes addressing the underlying etiology, correction of dehydration with intravenous fluids, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, and the use of insulin and dextrose infusions until the anion gap and bicarbonate levels normalize \\[20\\]. The correct diagnosis in our patient was made mainly through laboratory investigations; prompt EDKA treatment protocol ensued that resulted in improvement of our patient’s clinical status and outcome.\n\n【23】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【24】Patients with T2DM and CVD are recommended to be on SGLT-2i due to their positive CV benefits; however, these patients may also be considered having a higher risk for developing EDKA following an acute cardiac or other stressful event. Our case does not underestimate the importance of SGLT-2i use in cases where they are clearly indicated, but rather, it shows a potential side effect that can be avoided.\n\n【25】In conclusion, physicians should be aware and maintain a high index of suspicion for EDKA in patients taking SGLT-2i that have recently experienced high levels of stress (i.e., CABG). The diagnosis is challenging due to the rarity, nonspecific symptoms, and absence of high BG levels. Moreover, it is more challenging to make the diagnosis in sedated patients as the typical clinical presentation may be masked. Emergent treatment and multidisciplinary follow-up are needed to improve patient outcomes and mitigate complications. More studies on bigger scales are required to better understand the prevalence, pathophysiology, and management of this condition. Future guidelines should consider identifying the optimal time to discontinue SGLT-2i prior to a major surgery. In addition, we suggest routine urine ketone check in patients on SGLT-2i after CABG due to the seriousness of this condition, and the cost effectiveness of urine ketones makes them an excellent choice as a possible screening tool for such patients. An effort within the medical community must be put forth in future studies to merge and review similar cases to uncover more information that will help guide clinicians in EDKA prevention, detection, and treatment.\n\n【26】#### Data Availability\n\n【27】The clinical data used in this case report are presented in this article.

One such known extrapulmonary manifestation of disseminated TB is vertebral osteomyelitis, often referred to as “Pott’s Disease.” We present the case of a patient who underwent back surgery with allogenic bone graft who developed vertebral osteomyelitis and subsequently had disseminated tuberculosis, from an infected bone graft. We review current guidelines for allograft tissue screening and discuss the possible need for standardizing tuberculosis screening for bone allografts.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A total of 7163 tuberculosis (TB) cases were reported in 2020 in the USA, of which 29% were in US-born persons \\[1\\]. Extrapulmonary TB is rare and is estimated to happen in 15% of all TB patients. Meningeal involvement in TB is even more uncommon with an estimated incidence of 5.4% of all extrapulmonary TB cases \\[2\\]. While primarily transmitted through aerosolization of respiratory droplets via cough, coughing is not mandatory for transmission. Any respiratory activity has been shown to increase risk of transmission \\[3\\]. We report the first case of a patient who underwent allograft bone graft placement with lumbar fusion and developed disseminated TB from contaminated bone graft.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】Patient is a 66-year-old female with a medical history of peripheral arterial disease status after prior left common iliac stenting and neurogenic claudication secondary to L3-L4 spinal stenosis who presented to the hospital for generalized weakness, fatigue, and headache for 3 weeks. She also complained of intermittent back pain, fever, chills, and night sweats. She described new onset migraine like headache with photophobia in the last month. She denied coughing, shortness of breath, history of headaches, or any other new symptoms. She recently had minimally invasive L3–L5 lumbar fusion surgery with allograft bone graft placement 4 months ago. Her family history was unremarkable. Her social history was positive for 20 pack years of prior tobacco abuse. She quit smoking 2 years ago. She denied any alcohol or recreational drug use. On admission, her vitals including temperature were unremarkable. Her physical showed that patient was oriented to person and place, but not time. She was aware of her reasoning for admission but could not answer all questions appropriately. Healed incisions without any erythema, pus, or drainage were noted in the lower back at the L3–L5 level. Cranial nerves II–XII were grossly intact. Bilateral lower extremity strength was 4/5, unchanged from before, and no other focal deficits were noted. Laboratory evaluation was significant for sodium level of 117 mmol/L from 129 mmol/L two months prior, chloride of 77 mmol/L, and elevated platelet count of 425,000/_μ_L. ESR and CRP were elevated at >130 mm/h and 61.8 mg/L, respectively. TSH was normal at 2.4 mIU/mL. The random cortisol level was elevated at 29.5 _μ_g/dL. Serum osmolality was 256 mOsm/Kg. Urine osmolality was 487 mOsm/kg. Urine sodium and potassium were 32 mmol/L and 47 mmol/L, respectively. Urine toxicology and HIV test were negative. At this time, the treatment team and neurosurgeon who performed the lumbar surgery were informed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) that the bone graft used in her surgery was contaminated with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_. A chest X-ray (Figure 1) was done and showed diffuse miliary nodular pattern of both the lungs, which was confirmed by the presence of innumerable micronodules on CT chest (Figure 2).\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】Chest X-ray of our patient showing diffuse nodular involvement of the lungs.\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 2 \n\n【13】CT scan axial view showing conforming military tuberculosis with numerous 1–3 mm punctuate nodules.\n\n【14】MRI of the brain with contrast did not show any evidence of hydrocephalus, space-occupying lesions, or basilar meningitis. A lumbar puncture was done, and the results are given in Table 1.\n\n【15】Table 1 \n\n【16】Lumbar puncture results of our patient.\n\n【17】MRI of the lumbar spine showed L4-L5 osteomyelitis and postsurgical changes (Figure 3).\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】  \n\n【20】Figure 3 \n\n【21】MRI of the lumbar spine revealing osteomyelitis at the L4-L5 level.\n\n【22】MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine was negative for any structural lesions. Due to the lack of cord compression symptoms and no evidence of compression of the thecal sac of the lumbar cistern, leading to severe stenosis, the risk of reoperating was deemed to be higher than any benefit. The decision was made between the infectious disease team and neurosurgery team to treat the patient medically and not have any further neurosurgical intervention. The patient was treated for disseminated TB from the graft infection with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Ethambutol was switched to levofloxacin. Patient’s mentation and headache improved gradually. Patient was discharged with plan for 12 weeks of total antituberculosis TB therapy. At 3-month follow-up, patient was noted to be doing well, and her symptoms, including back pain, headache, photophobia, encephalopathy, and weakness, had completely resolved. A repeat MRI of the lumbar spine with and without contrast did not show any further osteomyelitis.\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】More than 500,000 bone graft procedures are performed in the United States annually \\[4\\]. Autogenous bone graft, made using the patient’s own bone, is most commonly used. However, due to difficulty in obtaining autogenous bone grafts, their use is often limited. A commonly used viable alternative is allogenous bone grafts. Allografts are obtained from qualified living or recently deceased human donors and are further processed in tissue banks. Tissue banks have patented processes to remove almost 99% of bone marrow blood elements from the internal blood matrix \\[5\\]. Allogenic grafts, however, carry the risk of rejection and infection.\n\n【25】The exact prevalence of allograft-associated bone graft infection is unknown. A single center allogenic bone bank study conducted in 2005 revealed infection rate of 1.7% \\[6\\]. However, updates in screening and bone graft testing have likely reduced the infection rate further. The American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have standardized screening and the testing procedure. Currently, all allograft samples must be collected aseptically in clean rooms. The harvested allograft samples then undergo further microbiological evaluation with HIV testing (antibodies as well as nucleic acid amplification test), hepatitis B (surface antigen, total antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen, and nucleic acid amplification testing), hepatitis C (antibodies and nucleic acid amplification testing), and syphilis (treponemal or treponemal test) \\[7\\].\n\n【26】TB testing is, however, not included in the guidelines for allografts, and as such, our patient’s allograft was not tested for TB. Our patient had not travelled outside the United States and did not have any known risk factors for tuberculosis, such as prior incarceration or intravenous drug use. She obtained the infection from a contaminated lot of bone repair product, and several other patients from multiple states were infected, as was confirmed by CDC \\[8\\]. In Pott’s disease, patients typically acquire spinal TB from a primary site of infection such as the lungs \\[9\\]. Our patient primarily had spinal TB from the bone graft and then subsequently developed disseminated TB, involving the lungs, representing the first case of “Reverse Pott’s Disease.”\n\n【27】Our patient also developed hyponatremia, likely from syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secondary to her TB infection. Hyponatremia is seen in 51% of patients with pulmonary TB \\[10\\]. SIADH has been linked to TB, and subsequent hyponatremia with reports dates back to 1965 \\[11\\]. Hyponatremia also has a similar prevalence (45%) in TB meningitis patients \\[12\\]. In TB meningitis cases, both SIADH and cerebral salt wasting have been noted to be the cause of hyponatremia \\[13\\].\n\n【28】Another plausible explanation for hyponatremia is adrenal tuberculosis. Our patient did not have hypotension or associated hyperkalemia. Her cortisol level was appropriately elevated at 30 _μ_g/dL. Our patient’s CT abdomen/pelvis was negative for adrenal pathology. Moreover, TB-associated adrenalitis typically presents after almost 90% of the adrenals are destroyed and can take 2–4 years following disease onset \\[14\\]. Our patient’s sodium levels also improved from 117 mmol/L to 126 mmol/L gradually with fluid restriction. In summary, our patient’s elevated cortisol levels and lack of hypotension and hyperkalemia makes adrenal TB unlikely and points to SIADH as the likely culprit.\n\n【29】Our patient was successfully treated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and levofloxacin. Levofloxacin was used instead of ethambutol due to better bone and CSF penetration \\[15\\]. She was also treated with dexamethasone for her meningitis. All hospital partners and family members who encountered the patient were tested for TB as per CDC recommendations. Our case highlights the potential benefit of standardizing TB testing in allografts. A study published in 2007 reviewed 15 years of data from 27840 allograft heart valve tissues. These allografts were stained for TB, but all were negative \\[16\\]. The cost associated with tuberculosis treatment, however, per patient in the USA is estimated to be $17,000 (non-multidrug-resistant TB), $134,000 (multidrug-resistant TB), and $430,000 (extensively drug-resistant TB) \\[17\\]. The cost versus benefit analysis of allograft TB testing is an area that certainly needs more investigation.\n\n【30】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】In conclusion, we present the first case of disseminated TB infection from a contaminated bone graft. Eventhough the incidence of TB from bone graft is low, the high morbidity and mortality associated with TB, the cost of treatment, and the high contagion risk in the event of a potential TB infection make standardizing allograft TB screening a notion that needs further research and discussion.\n\n【32】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【33】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The nails had vertical ridges and had cracked to the nail base. Occasionally, she also had mild pallor and bluish discoloration of her fingers on exposure to cold, suggestive of Raynaud’s phenomenon. She had had diarrhea alternating with constipation and mild abdominal cramping for 3 years. Colonoscopy was done a year earlier and showed only diverticulosis of sigmoid colon; she was given a diagnosis of IBS by a gastroenterologist. Other symptoms included diffuse alopecia, dry eyes, fatigue, and numbness in both forearms and fingers bilaterally. She had had unilateral carpal tunnel release in the prior year; tissue was not sent for pathologic examination. Family history was significant for her mother having myelofibrosis and acute leukemia, but there was no family history of autoimmune disease. Her physical examination was normal except for vertical ridging of dystrophic nails of the first, second, and third digits of both hands, diffuse alopecia with no scalp rash, scaling or scarring, and numbness in her first, second, and third digits of both hands with positive Phalen and Tinel test. She had no skin tightening, rashes, or telangiectasias. Complete blood count and complete metabolic panel including serum calcium, urinalysis, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were unremarkable except for total protein of 5.4 g/dL (normal: 6.1–7.9 g/dL). She had a normal serum iron, vitamin B12, folic acid, TSH, free T4, and chest X-ray. Serologic testing revealed an ANA of 1 : 1280 in a nucleolar pattern. Antibodies to SSA, SSB, Smith, RNP, centromere, Scl-70, and dsDNA were negative; C3 and C4 were normal. She was initially diagnosed with Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease (UCTD) by her rheumatologist. But, given her neuropathy, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) was sent and it showed an increase in _α_2-globulin fraction (16.7%; normal: 8.9–14.5%) and decrease in _γ_\\-globulin level and fraction (0.4 and 7.0%, resp.; normal: 0.6–1.9 g/dL; 9.8–24.4%) with an albumin-to-globulin ratio of 1.4. Serum immunofixation did not show any evidence of monoclonal gammopathy. Serum-free light chain assay revealed elevated free lambda light chains of 34.22 mg/dL (normal: 0.57–2.63 mg/dL) with low free kappa light chains of <0.29 mg/dL (normal: 0.33–1.94 mg/dL) and global decrement of IgG, IgA, and IgM. Urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation were unremarkable.\n\n【4】She was referred to the Hematology-Oncology consultation team for further evaluation of the light chain monoclonal gammopathy. A bone marrow biopsy (Figures 1 and 2) showed normocellular bone marrow with 15% plasma cells and lambda light chain restriction; Congo red staining was negative. A skeletal survey, LDH, and _β_2-microglobulin were negative. Given her constellation of symptoms, amyloidosis remained a diagnostic concern. An abdominal fat pad biopsy was performed, revealing positive Congo red staining (Figure 3). Electron microscopic examination revealed clusters of filamentous material with average diameter of 8.7 nm, lined between lipid droplets, compatible with amyloid; no amyloid typing was performed. The patient was diagnosed with free lambda light chain amyloidosis. Echocardiogram, pro-BNP, and Troponin T were obtained for staging; these were within normal limits. The patient was treated with 4 cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone. When near-complete remission was achieved with near-normalization of serum-free lambda light chains, decreasing to 3.07 mg/dL over 3 months, she subsequently underwent autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation after melphalan conditioning. Her posttransplantation serum-free lambda light chains decreased to 2.69 mg/dL at three months and then normalized to 2.57 mg/dL at six-month follow-up. The patient returned to her normal level of excellent function, with resolution of her initial symptoms, and returned to work one month after the transplant procedure. She had no clinical features of autoimmune disease. No posttransplant serologies were obtained.\n\n【5】  \n**(a)**\n\n【6】  \n**(b)**\n\n【7】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】Bone marrow aspirate (a) and biopsy (b) showing scattered interstitial and focally clustered plasma cells and a small bland nonparatrabecular lymphoid aggregate.\n\n【10】  \n**(a)**\n\n【11】  \n**(b)**\n\n【12】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【13】Figure 2 \n\n【14】CD138 immunohistochemistry (a) highlighting interstitial and clustered plasma cells, estimated at 15% of total cells, with lambda light chain restriction by _in situ_ hybridization (b).\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Figure 3 \n\n【18】Abdominal fat pad biopsy showing positive Congo red staining.\n\n【19】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【20】Deposits of amyloid may be distributed in many organs of the body (systemic amyloidosis) or may be restricted to a single organ (localized amyloidosis) \\[1, 2\\]. As demonstrated here, primary (AL) amyloidosis may mimic primary rheumatologic diseases such as SLE and Sjögren’s syndrome. When this occurs, no typical pathologic findings of rheumatologic diseases are found in the biopsies of joints, salivary glands, or blood vessels except amyloid accumulation in these tissues \\[2, 3\\]. Others also have described amyloidosis in rheumatic diseases such as Sjögren’s syndrome, scleroderma, and primary biliary cirrhosis as a secondary phenomenon \\[3, 4\\]. In our patient, dry eyes can likely be explained by the amyloid deposition in lacrimal glands, masquerading as Sjögren’s syndrome \\[2\\]. AL amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma may result in an arthropathy resembling RA \\[5\\]. In this setting, treating the underlying hematologic malignancy is the most important intervention as patients tend to respond better to multiple myeloma treatment than to treatment of the amyloid arthropathy. Sensitivity of selected physical and laboratory findings for detecting amyloidosis in cases of multiple myeloma (MM) associated arthropathy has been illustrated in literature (Table 1) \\[5\\]. While our patient did not have arthropathy, she had bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and hypogammaglobulinemia, which raised the suspicion of AL amyloidosis. The carpal tunnel symptoms of the prior year are consistent with the typical 2-year delay between the onset of symptoms and the recognition of amyloidosis \\[6\\].\n\n【21】Table 1 \n\n【22】Sensitivity of selected physical and laboratory findings for detecting amyloidosis in the setting of multiple myeloma \\[5\\].\n\n【23】Amyloid-associated rheumatic disease manifestations in primary amyloidosis have been associated with an anticentromere antibody pattern of ANA \\[6\\]. However, to the best of our knowledge, a nucleolar pattern ANA has not been previously described in this setting. Given the association of a nucleolar pattern ANA and scleroderma, our patient warrants follow-up for the progression to the development of scleroderma, though this seems unlikely in the setting of a successful stem cell transplantation and resolution of symptoms.\n\n【24】Alopecia or nail dystrophy can rarely present as a sign of occult amyloidosis \\[7, 8\\]. Unusual manifestations of primary cutaneous amyloidosis in association with Raynaud’s phenomenon and livedo reticularis have been reported \\[1\\], but, in this case, Raynaud’s phenomenon preceded the cutaneous amyloidosis by ten years. Histopathology described in scalp biopsies of amyloid patients with alopecia has demonstrated that amyloid deposits were seen to be compressing pilosebaceous units, accompanied by atrophy of these structures and loss of hair from the shafts \\[9\\]. Nail biopsy may show amyloid deposits in papillary dermis of the matrix, nail bed, and perivascular areas, which perhaps cause vascular impairment with subsequent nail brittleness, crumbling, onycholysis, subungual thickening, striation, or anonychia \\[10\\].\n\n【25】Initially, the bone marrow biopsy in our patient was performed for the purpose of diagnosing plasma cell dyscrasia. The biopsy revealed lambda light chain restriction on _in situ_ hybridization but negative Congo red staining. The diagnostic yield of bone marrow biopsy in primary amyloidosis is estimated at 63% \\[11, 12\\]. We interpreted that the false-negative results could be due to variable and sometimes pale staining of amyloid fibrils, inadequate material, or improper use of polarizing instruments. In addition, the correct interpretation of Congo red staining requires experience and is somewhat subjective \\[12\\]. Thioflavin staining is another option to confirm the validity of negative Congo red staining because it can detect smaller deposits, although it is less specific \\[12\\].\n\n【26】Abdominal fat pad aspiration has replaced most of the previously used tissue biopsies because it is easy to perform and safe and involves minimal patient discomfort and morbidity. Studies have shown that, in about 11 percent of cases, fat pad biopsy can be positive in the setting of negative bone marrow staining \\[6\\]. The sensitivity and specificity for abdominal fat pad aspiration are 55–85% and 75–100%, respectively \\[11, 12\\]. Labial salivary gland (LSG) biopsy is a good diagnostic modality to consider for diagnosing amyloidosis mimicking Sjögren’s syndrome because it shares the advantages of abdominal fat pad aspiration with similar diagnostic yield and offers the ability to rule out Sjögren’s syndrome simultaneously. The diagnostic yield of LSG is roughly 58–86%, with specificity of 100% \\[13, 14\\]. Biopsy of another involved organ such as kidney, liver, colon, or heart can be utilized as well due to the high sensitivity (87–98%), if Congo red staining on the bone marrow and abdominal fat pad biopsy is negative, but there is high clinical suspicion of amyloidosis \\[11, 12\\].\n\n【27】To summarize, our patient presented with dystrophic nail changes, carpal tunnel syndrome, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and high titer positive nucleolar pattern ANA and was diagnosed with lambda light chain systemic amyloidosis by abdominal fat pad biopsy. Fortunately, in our case, the diagnosis was made before the development of cardiomyopathy, a complication significantly reducing life expectation \\[15\\]. Based on the Revised Mayo Clinic Staging for amyloidosis \\[15\\], our patient was staged as Stage II, which has median survival of 97 months in stem cell transplant eligible patients versus 19 months in ineligible patients. Thus we treat amyloidosis early on, since prognosis in untreated AL amyloidosis is dismal. We suggest further monitoring for her positive nucleolar pattern ANA due to the possible progression to scleroderma or other rheumatic diseases, though this would be a remote possibility following her bone marrow transplantation. Furthermore, due to the relatively low diagnostic yield of bone marrow biopsy, we employed an alternate diagnostic modality with little morbidity (abdominal fat pad aspiration) to establish this patient’s diagnosis. Our case also highlights the many similarities in the clinical features between systemic light chain amyloidosis and primary rheumatological disorders. It also underlines the importance of the prompt recognition of “red flags” of amyloidosis which are crucial to triggering appropriate diagnostic procedures, since early diagnosis prior to the development of advanced cardiomyopathy is a key to improving outcomes in this disease.\n\n【28】#### Competing Interests\n\n【29】All authors declare that there are no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Bands were determined in ZFX/ZFY wells, whereas no bands were determined in wells of other STS regions. DNA isolation was done from buccal mucosa smear to obtain genomic DNA from patient's own cells and multiplex polymerase chain reaction technique was performed again. Bands were seen in all wells of 13 STS regions. Y chromosome microdeletion was not detected in the patient. In conclusion, genomic DNA isolation in patients undergoing BMT should be done from patients' own cells.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Infertility affects approximately 10–15% of couples, and male factor infertility represents almost 50% of cases \\[1\\]. Among infertile men about 40–50% have azoospermia and severe oligozoospermia. Genetic abnormalities may cause infertility by affecting sperm production or sperm transport. These abnormalities are numerical (e.g., trisomy) and structural (e.g., inversions or translocations) chromosomal abnormalities, Y chromosome microdeletions, and gene mutations (e.g., cystic fibrosis). The frequencies of genetic abnormalities vary between 10–15% in oligozoospermic and azoospermic patients \\[2\\]. Because of this high prevalence, it is important to investigate the chromosomal abnormalities in these patients.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A healthy 27-year-old man with normal phenotype was referred for the evaluation of infertility. In his physical examination, right testis was 10 cc, left testis was 8 cc with grade 1 varicocele. Vasa deferentia were palpable on both sides. Consecutive two semen analyses of the patient revealed azoospermia with normal ejaculate volume. His serum FSH was 24.29 mIU/mL (1.6–12.4 mIU/mL) and total testosterone was 495 ng/dL (260–1600 ng/dL). The patient with the diagnosis of nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) had a history of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from his sister due to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Karyotyping and Y chromosome microdeletion analysis, which are necessary for the evaluation of NOA, were done with peripheral blood leucocytes and buccal mucosa samples because of the probable change in peripheral blood leucocytes after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. There was no family history of infertility.\n\n【6】The patient, who had the diagnosis of CML with positive Philadelphia (Ph) translocation in February 1999, was treated with Hydroxyurea 500 mg/day for two years. The patient was conditioned with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg for two days and TBI with a total dose of 12 Gy in 3 fractionated doses before BMT. In 2001, allogeneic BMT was performed. After allogeneic BMT, the patient was treated with 26 mg methotrexate and 30 gr IVIG. In cytogenetic analysis performed on cultured cells from bone marrow material before allogeneic BMT, no metaphases were examined. After BMT, cytogenetic analysis revealed 6 metaphases examined by trypsin GTG banding, and 4 of them had 46,XX chromosomal constitution.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【8】Molecular cytogenetic and Y chromosome microdeletion analysis was performed according to standard methods on cultured cells from the patient’s peripheral blood. Genomic DNA was isolated in accordance with kit protocol (High pure PCR template preparation kit, Roche). In the laboratory, kit which is used for determination of Y chromosome microdeletion is certified with IVD (in vitro diagnostic). 13 STS (sequence tagged site) regions on Y chromosome (ZFX/ZFY, SRY, AZFa: sY84, sY86, DFFRY, DBY, AZFb: sY117, sY125, sY127, sY134, AZFc: DAZ gene sY254, sY255) were analysed by using 3 different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixes (Genequality AZF MX, AB-Analitica). Multiplex PCR reaction was performed with isolated genomic DNA samples in conformity with kit protocols. PCR products were subjected to 85 V for electrophoresis during 2 hours and 30 minutes in 3% mucinous agarose gel.\n\n【9】#### 4\\. Results\n\n【10】When the results of electrophoresis were investigated with UV transilluminator, band patterns were detected only in ZFX/ZFY wells of all 3 PCR mixes. There was no band pattern in wells of other 12 STS regions (Figure 1). This situation was not compatible with phenotype of patient and could occur due to allogenic BMT from his sister. Therefore, chimerism analysis was done with FISH using CepX/Y DNA probe (Vysis) in order to indicate chimerism rate of sex chromosomes in cells of the peripheric circulatory system of the patient. The CEP X/Y DNA probe is a mixture of a SpectrumOrange labeled CEP X DNA probe (Xp11.1-q11.1 Alpha Satellite DNA) and a SpectrumGreen labeled CEP Y DNA probe specific for the alpha satellite centromeric region of chromosome X and the satellite III (Yq12) region of chromosome Y. Two orange signals of Xp11.1-q11.1 Alpha Satellite DNA were found on the interphase chromosome in 200 cells of peripheric circulatory system of patient. It was determined that chimerism rate was 100% XX (Figure 2). Towards this result, genomic DNA was isolated from buccal mucosa smear in order to obtain the patient’s own cells. Isolated genomic DNA was evaluated with NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, Thermo Scientific, USA) to detect the density of this sample. 1 _μ_L DNA of patient was defined as 11.06 ng and rate of A260/A280 was defined as 1.42 which means that this amount was enough for PCR. Then, PCR was performed in accordance with kit protocol that was used previously. PCR products were subjected to 85 V for electrophoresis during 2 hours and 30 minutes in 3% mucinous agarose gel. Bands in wells of 3 different mixes including 13 STS regions were detected with UV transilluminator. There were band patterns in all wells, and Y chromosome microdeletion was not detected in patient (Figure 3). Sex chromosomes of patient were evaluated in terms of aneuploidy with multiplex PCR in conformity with kit protocol (Aneufast-QF PCR) used with Quantitative Fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR) technique. The QF-PCR Kit contains six multiplex marker sets of short tandem repeats (STRs) that can be used for amplification of selected microsatellites and the Amelogenin-SRY. PCR products were subjected to capillary electrophoresis in automatized device of DNA strand analysis (ABI-3100 Avant). Fragment analysis showed that the patient had XY chromosomal constitution (Figure 4). After PCR, AZF a, b, and c loci that were localized on Y chromosome long arm and did not generate recombination with X chromosome in meiosis were amplified (in the agarose gel, band pattern was positive in wells of 10 STS regions special to AZF loci). This also excludes the situation that patient could have XX sex chromosome in the beginning.\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Figure 1 \n\n【14】| Photos of 3% high-resolution agarose (mucinous agarose) gel electrophoresis of the three multiplex PCR amplicons from the patient’s DNA (genomic DNA was isolated from venous blood cells) and control DNA.

Discussion\n\n【29】The incidence of Y chromosome microdeletions was reported 10–15% and 5–10% in azoospermic and oligozoospermic patients, respectively \\[3\\].\n\n【30】In the literature, there is only one report defining a male with the diagnosis of CML and 46,XX chromosomal constitution \\[4\\]. That patient, like the present case, had bilateral small testes, azoospermia, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Cytogenetic and molecular analysis has demonstrated that male XX is caused by at least three mechanisms, abnormal Y-X interchange (90%), genes other than testes-determining factor (TDF), and mosaicism \\[5\\]. It is anticipated that malignant disease itself and adjuvant or neoadjuvant regimens used for the treatment may result in oligozoospermia and azoospermia \\[6\\]. Thachil et al. reported that cancer itself has negative effects on fertility before application of any treatment modality \\[7\\]. It is also reported that chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of CML, like cyclosphosphamide, hydroxyurea, busulphan, chlorambucil, and radiotherapy, have deleterious effects on germ cells which may result in azoospermia \\[8, 9\\].\n\n【31】The reason of azoospermia in the present case in unclear whether it may be due to CML itself or the treatment regimens used to cure the disease.\n\n【32】In another study, it is reported that the rate of recovery of spermatogenesis was 17% in patients conditioned with cyclophosphamide combined with total body irradiation (TBI) before BMT. Recovery of spermatogenesis never occurred before the fourth year after transplantation and was observed up to 9 years. The incidence of azoospermia in those patients was 70.3% \\[10\\]. The rate of gonadal dysfunction in patients treated with cyclophosphamide with a cumulative dose of less than 400 mg/kg was less than 10% whereas this rate was increased up to 30% in prepubertal and 68–95% in adult patients treated with a cumulative dose of more than 400 mg/kg cyclophosphamide \\[9, 10\\].\n\n【33】During TBI, the diffused testicular dose is estimated to be 1-2% of the total dose applied**.** Direct irradiation (0.15–0.35 Gy) causes oligozoospermia; doses between 0.35 Gy and 0.5 Gy cause reversible azoospermia. Doses of 1.2 Gy are associated with a reduced risk of recovery of spermatogenesis. Time to recovery is also likely to depend on the dose \\[8\\]. Cumulative doses of fractionated radiotherapy of >2.5 Gy generally result in prolonged and likely permanent azoospermia. Radiation doses to the germinal epithelium of the testis given in 3- to 7-week fractionated courses cause more gonadal damage than single doses. An irreversible damage of the spermatogenesis will begin at a cumulative dose of >2.5 Gy when the radiation is fractionated \\[11\\]. The present case was conditioned with cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg for two days and TBI with a total dose of 12 Gy in 3 fractionated doses before BMT. Recovery of spermatogenesis never occurred during the 8-year followup after BMT.\n\n【34】Pretreatment sperm cryopreservation, although not applied in this case, should be offered to young, male cancer patients to prevent infertility due to the therapeutic regimens which causes oligozoospermia or azoospermia.\n\n【35】To the best of our knowledge, the study does not provide a new information methodologically but from the point of clinical view this is the first NOA case with the diagnosis of CML and 46,XX chromosomal constitution due to allogeneic BMT from his sister. In conclusion, genomic DNA investigation in patients undergoing BMT should be done with patients’ own cells (buccal mucosa, tissue biopsy, etc.) to obtain accurate results about the chromosomal constitutions of these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Clinical presentation includes fever, leucocystosis, and abdominal pain. CT SCAN is a must for diagnosis. The preferred treatment is either conservative, with intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, or splenectomy. We report the thirteen case of a splenic abscess after LSG. In our patient, the abscess occurred three weeks after LSG in a 21-year-old man, and it was successfully treated conservatively.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Morbid obesity is nowadays a common disease affecting large amount of adults worldwide. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a simple procedure to treat morbid obesity. However, complications occur and include hemorrhage, leak of luminal contents, obstruction, and infection (wound and intra-abdominal abscess). We report the case of a patient who underwent LSG, complicated three weeks after surgery by a splenic abscess. And to the best of our knowledge, there were only twelve cases reported in the literature \\[1–8\\].\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 21-year-old obese male with a body mass index of 45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> underwent LSG in our department in April 2018. The patient did not have any past medical or surgical history. No systemic CT scan was done preoperatively, only gastroscopy that showed normal mucous of the stomach. The operation was very smooth without any complications: no splenic infarction nor a tear was detectable. No hemostatic agents were used. Immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 2 after tolerating a clear diet. No routine CT scan or opacification was made. Three weeks after surgery, the patient presented high fever and chills and took 24 hours of oral antibiotics before consulting his surgeon who decided to rehospitalize the patient.\n\n【6】At admission, his temperature was 38.5°C, and pulse rate was 120/min with a normal blood pressure. The blood results revealed 17,700 WBC and a CRP level at 295. Abdominal CT scan (Figure 1) showed a splenic abscess of 10 cm with no evidence of leakage. Initial management included hydration, intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam), and percutaneous drainage (Figure 2). The liquid culture was negative. The drain was removed after two days to avoid the risk of splenic hemorrhage without follow-up imaging.\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】Splenic abscess of 10 cm with no evidence of leakage.\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Figure 2 \n\n【14】Percutaneous drainage of the splenic abscess.\n\n【15】The patient got better clinically and a full fluids diet was initiated, but he continued to experience low grade fever with a WBC count of 14,400 and CRP at 240. A new abdominal CT scan showed a residual splenic collection of 2 × 3 cm with a pleural effusion (Figure 3). The pleural effusion was drained, and it revealed a transudate liquid with negative culture. The splenic collection was considered as a residual abscess, and then we decided to upgrade antibiotherapy to a larger broad-spectrum one (imipenem) without radiologic or surgical drainage of the residual splenic abscess. A total of ten days with intravenous antibiotic treatment was necessary before fever disappearance. The patient was discharged under IM ertapenem for 10 days.\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】Pleural effusion and residual splenic abscess of 2 × 3 cm.\n\n【20】Follow-up at 6 months, the patient was completely asymptomatic. Blood tests showed a normal count of WBC and CRP level.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】In general, splenic abscess can result from multiple causes such as neoplasia, immunodeficiency, trauma, splenic infarction, endocarditis, and sickle cell disease \\[9\\]. It was also reported after some gastric procedures like Nissen fundoplication and gastrectomy for cancer \\[10\\].\n\n【23】Splenic abscess after LSG is a very rare condition, and the literature enumerates twelve patients who experienced this condition (Table 1) \\[1–8\\]. The mechanism of formation of splenic abscess described by the previous authors include iatrogenic splenic injury during surgery, splenic ischemia after LSG, extension from a gastric staple-line leak, and temporary immune suppression in the immediate postoperative course.\n\n【24】Table 1 \n\n【25】Characteristics of the different cases.\n\n【26】In our case, there was no evidence of leakage nor a spleen ischemia or a spleen injury during the operation. Therefore, the formation of splenic abscess could be related to temporary immune suppression that results from rapid weight loss, limited oral intake, and a transient bacteraemia as it was noticed by Sakran et al. \\[2\\].\n\n【27】In most of the cases, the patient presented with fever, leucocytosis, and left upper quadrant pain. Our patient experienced the same symptoms. The diagnosis was made on CT scan of the abdomen, as it remains the gold standard for diagnosis of splenic abscess \\[9\\].\n\n【28】Splenic abscesses tend to be polymicrobial \\[11, 12\\], so they should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics \\[2, 4\\]. Enteric Gram negative and Gram positive were the common organisms as presented in Table 1. In our case, the culture was negative because the patient started on antibiotics without our knowledge before being admitted.\n\n【29】Solitary spleen abscesses are actually treated with percutaneous or laparoscopic drainage, in order to preserve the spleen. When symptoms persist or when multiple abscesses exist, splenectomy remains the definitive management \\[9, 11, 12\\]. However, our patient experienced a good evolution and a stable condition under conservative treatment, although a residual collection was documented on the last CT scan.\n\n【30】After all, would a splenectomy be beneficial even if the patient is completely asymptomatic, knowing that he is actually 6 months off treatment postoperatively?\n\n【31】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【32】Splenic abscess is a very rare complication after LSG. The etiology of formation of splenic abscess needs further studies. The patient must benefit from a conservative treatment based on antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. The decision to undergo a splenectomy will be based on clinical status and response to treatment.\n\n【33】#### Consent\n\n【34】The consent was obtained from the patient.\n\n【35】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【36】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Our case was a 15-year-old boy who had a motor vehicle accident. There was swelling, ecchymosis, severe pain, and valgus deformity, because of medial proximal fracture fragment, on the left knee. We deemed that Salter-Harris type III and type IV combination fracture in our case has not been previously reported. We prepared this paper in consideration of its contribution to the literature.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Distal femoral epiphysis comes up in the ninth week of the fetal life and is the only epiphysis with a visible ossific nucleus at birth. Also, it is the biggest and the fastest growing epiphysis of the body, and it contributes to 40% of the lower extremity length \\[1\\]. The most common causes of injuries are traffic accidents and sport activities \\[2\\]. Distal femoral physeal fractures are not common but have a high rate of complications \\[3\\] and are responsible for 1–6% of all physeal injuries and less than 1% of fractures in children \\[4\\]. They generally follow one of the patterns described in the Salter-Harris classification \\[5\\]. Salter-Harris type II fractures are the most common fracture type of the distal femoral physis \\[3, 6\\]. Long-term complications like growth disturbance, with subsequent development of leg length discrepancy and/or angular deformities, are well reported to be seen in these certain types of injuries \\[3\\]. Both Salter-Harris classification and displacement of the fracture are significant predictors of the final outcome. The treatment method may influence the final outcome \\[3\\].\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】Our case was a 15-year-old boy who had a motor vehicle accident. There was swelling, ecchymosis, severe pain, and valgus deformity, because of medial proximal fracture fragment, on the left knee. After evaluating the first radiograph (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)), closed reduction and long leg splint were done, and control X-ray was taken (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). Correlation with computed tomography was performed in order to ascertain the fracture pattern (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). The patient had no neurovascular problems on his first physical examination.\n\n【6】  \n**(a)**\n\n【7】  \n**(b)**\n\n【8】  \n**(c)**\n\n【9】  \n**(d)**\n\n【10】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】| Anteroposterior and lateral radiograph of the left knee: Salter-Harris type III fracture of the medial physis and epiphysis, Salter-Harris type IV fracture of the lateral physis and epiphysis (a-b).

After a full anatomic reduction was achieved in our operation, the metaphyseal fragment was fixed to physis by two transverse cannulated screws. Fixation was also applied to the medial condyle with one cannulated screw (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). Since the patient’s growth continues, we ensured that no screw passes through the physis. The patient was followed up for three weeks with long leg splint in the postoperative period. At the end of the three weeks, the splint was removed, a knee exercise program was implemented, and the patient was asked to walk on tiptoes for three weeks. At the end of the six weeks, knee extension was full, flexion was 150°, and the patient started to walk with full weight. In his last control at the end of the one year, the knee regained full extension and 160° flexion.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】The distal femoral physis is the fastest growing growth plate in the human body at a rate of 1.0 cm per year, producing 70% of the longitudinal growth of the femur and 40% of the overall growth of the lower extremity \\[7, 8\\]. Physeal closure and cessation of growth typically occurs at an age between 14 and 16 years in girls and between 16 and 18 years in boys \\[1, 9\\]. Distal femoral epiphyseal fractures are uncommon but have a high incidence rate of complications \\[3\\] and are responsible for 1–6% of all physeal injuries and less than 1% of fractures in children \\[4\\]. Motor vehicle accidents and sports-related injuries are reported as the most common causes \\[2\\]. The Salter-Harris classification continues to be the most widely used classification system for physeal fractures \\[5\\]. It helps in understanding the mechanism of injury and in predicting the likelihood of complications. Salter-Harris type II fractures are the most common fracture type of the distal femoral physis \\[3, 6, 10\\]. Poor results correlated with severely displaced fractures, nonanatomic reduction, associated injuries, and open fractures. Complications included growth arrest, resulting in leg length discrepancy, permanent decreased range of motion, and angular deformity \\[2, 6\\]. Salter-Harris type I fractures had the lowest incidence of growth disturbance (36%), whereas Salter-Harris type IV fractures had the highest rate of growth disturbance at 64% \\[10\\]. In our case, it was a Salter-Harris type III and type IV combination, and there was a high complication risk due to the existence of displacement, and relatives of the patient were throughly informed about this.\n\n【23】The peroneal nerve is reported to be involved in about 3% of cases of distal femoral epiphyseal injuries \\[4\\]. The direction of displacement has been associated with the development of neurovascular injuries, where anterior displacement puts the popliteal artery at risk, and varus displacement places the peroneal nerve at risk \\[2\\]. In our case, no deficit existed in neurovascular structures.\n\n【24】Our case is a previously unpublished, Salter-Harris type III and type IV combination. We consider that high complication risks of distal femoral physeal fractures should be told to relatives of the patient. In order to decrease this high risk of complication, we consider that full anatomic reduction should be achieved by a sufficiently stabile fixation, and joint movement should be gained in early period.\n\n【25】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【26】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests to the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

No other clinical symptoms or physical findings were observed at admission. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and a small calcified nodule in chest CT were the only abnormal findings. Pus samples from sinuses were examined and confirmed tuberculosis which was in agreement with surgical pathology of lymph nodes. A four- (4-) drug antituberculous regimen was administered. After an initial remission of his symptoms, the patient presented an exacerbation of the cervical swelling with draining sinuses necessitating addition of oral steroids. TL can be symptomless presenting a paradoxical reaction during treatment. The uniqueness of our case lies in the patient’s advanced age, which is uncommon with cervical lymphadenopathy as a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, as well as in the administration of oral steroids to resolve the neck’s clinical deterioration. The patient had a complete recovery and was free of disease after completion of his six-month antituberculous chemotherapy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Tuberculous lymphadenitis (TL) or scrofula was firstly described by Hippocrates \\[1\\]. During the 18<sup>th</sup> century, tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis was known as the “king’s evil” which was believed to be cured by the royal touch \\[2, 3\\]. TL seems to be more common in females than in males with the Asian and black women showing an increased risk for this type of infection \\[4\\]. Cervical lymphadenopathy, which is the most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, is estimated to mainly appear between the ages of 20 and 40 years \\[5\\]. Other studies also report that peripheral TL is usually presented in young adults \\[6–8\\]. Particularly, for the USA and the UK, TL is frequently diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 50 years \\[9, 10\\].\n\n【4】We present the case of a left lateral cervical lymphadenopathy with draining sinuses, resulting from tuberculous infection. Its uniqueness lies in the complete absence of any constitutional symptom of tuberculous disease except the cervical swelling with draining sinuses, in the patient’s advanced age being uncommon for this particular condition, and in the use of oral steroids when a paradoxical deterioration, after an initial remission, of the patient’s neck condition during antituberculous treatment, was observed. The age and the robust response of the patient to steroid therapy, while under antituberculous treatment, despite the conflicting opinions in the literature \\[11\\], are underlined for management of similar conditions.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】An 89-year-old male smoker patient presented at the emergency department of our hospital with left, deep purplish cervical swelling with draining sinuses. The patient reported that three months ago, painless erythematous nodular swellings appeared in the left lateral neck area. No respiratory symptoms, fever, or weight loss were reported except for occasional dry cough and mucous expectoration since he had been a lifelong smoker of 70 pack-years. The patient was a taxi and bus driver. His past medical history included surgery for benign prostate hypertrophy 15 years ago, as well as an unscheduled visit to the emergency department of our hospital, 6 months ago, due to an acute hypertensive episode associated with pulmonary edema, being treated by intravenous diuretics. Since then, he had been on valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide therapy (16 mg + 12.5 mg), once daily. On examination, the patient, a tall and thin man, (BMI = 19.6 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>), with normal skin color, had a normal physical appearance except for his left lateral neck lesion including draining tract sinuses with purulent material (Figure 1) and scarce low-pitched expiratory wheezes. The cardiovascular examination showed a mild systolic murmur in the right second intercostal space compatible with moderate aortic valve regurgitation. On admission, the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were 145/70 mmHg and 86 beats per minute, respectively, while blood and biochemistry tests were as follows: Hct = 37.3%; Hb = 13.8 g/dL; MCV = 81.7 fL; MCH = 29.6 pg; PLT = 214 × 10<sup>3</sup>/_μ_L; WBC = 6.3 × 10<sup>3</sup>/_μ_L (leukocyte type: NEU% = 70%, LYM% = 20%, MON% = 7%, and EOS = 3%); INR = 1.22; serum glucose = 101 mg/dL; urea = 39 mg/dL; creatinine = 1.02 mg/dL; Na<sup>+</sup> = 139 mmol/L; K<sup>+</sup> = 4.2 mmol/L; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) = 52 mm/1st hour. The Mantoux test showed 10 mm induration, and his chest X-ray had no significant findings. The computed tomography (CT scan) showed minimal fibrous bands in the upper zone area of the right upper lobe, while a small calcified nodule (3 mm diameter) was also found in the periphery of the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe (Figure 2). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a diffusely red and hyperemic bronchial mucosa, particularly intense in the segments of the right upper lobe, with the presence of some small anthracotic areas (Figure 3). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) obtained from the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe showed increased (>70%) lymphocytes, 15% neutrophils, few (<8%) macrophages, and scarcity of bronchial epithelial cells with no evidence of malignancy. Direct smear for acid-fast bacilli was also negative. The surgical biopsy and the microscopic examination of the cervical lymph node showed epithelial granuloma with central coagulative (caseous) necrosis and the presence of _M. tuberculosis_ complex, respectively. In addition, the microscopic examination of the purulent content of draining sinuses in the patient’s neck also revealed the presence of _M. tuberculosis_ complex. Final diagnosis for TL was established by histopathologic examination (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)).\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】Lateral cervical area of patient with swollen and draining lymph nodes.\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Figure 2 \n\n【14】Chest CT image showing small (3 mm) nodules (black arrow) in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe.\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Figure 3 \n\n【18】Small area with anthracotic discoloration (black arrow) in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.\n\n【19】  \n**(a)**\n\n【20】  \n**(b)**\n\n【21】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【22】Figure 4 \n\n【23】(a) Tuberculous granuloma with collections of epithelioid macrophages (thin two-direction black arrow) and Langhans giant cells (simple thick black arrow) H-EX400.

One month after the initiation of the antituberculous regimen, and after an initial remission regarding the magnitude of the patient’s neck growth, he experienced an enlargement of his lymph nodes with reappearance of draining sinuses. It was then decided to add oral steroids (20 mg prednisolone daily). Four weeks after steroid administration, there was a spectacular, almost complete remission, of his neck growth. The antituberculous treatment was continued for 6 months, and the patient was free of disease after its completion.\n\n【25】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【26】Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is most commonly diagnosed in peripheral lymph nodes \\[12\\]. In our case, the occasional cough and mucous expectoration were nonspecific symptoms for tuberculous disease (TB). Due to lateral neck mass appearance, the differential diagnosis may include neoplastic, infectious or immunologic diseases, sarcoidosis, abscess, tuberculosis, brucellosis, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, cat-scratch disease, and fungal infections \\[13\\].\n\n【27】The presence of draining sinuses with purulent material was suggestive of infectious, suppurative conditions such as pyogenic abscess \\[14\\] or other infective processes. In our patient, diagnosis of TL was based either on the identification of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ in the pus of the draining sinuses of the lymph node or on the histopathologic examination of the lymph node showing a typical pathology of tuberculosis. For the accurate diagnosis of cervical TL, the contribution of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), while avoiding any complication associated with the open biopsy, is reported in the relevant literature \\[15, 16\\]. The use of fine-needle aspiration cytology in diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculous lymphadenitis was also reported by previous studies \\[12, 17–19\\], with granulomatous inflammation on fine-needle aspiration cytology to be strongly indicative for tuberculosis infection \\[18\\]. However, excisional biopsy compared to the fine-needle aspiration technique seems to be more sensitive and safer in diagnosis of peripheral TL \\[17\\], particularly when multiple lymph nodes should be examined \\[20\\]. Another issue to be discussed is the exacerbation of our patient’s neck growth one month after induction of anti-TB treatment, something which is not an unusual event during therapy of TL, characterized as a paradoxical reaction (PR). Paradoxical reaction is a transitory deterioration of the clinical and/or radiological condition although the patient is under appropriate anti-TB therapy \\[21–23\\], and it is interpreted by two different proposed theories: the first lies in a delayed immune activation and the second one in a hypersensitivity reaction to the antigen released from dying mycobacteria \\[24\\]. Predictive risk factors for paradoxical reaction during treatment for cervical lymph node TB are lymph node size ≥ 3 cm and extralymph node TB (multivariate and univariate analyses), as well as sweating (univariate analysis) \\[25\\]. Age, antigenic load, lymphocyte count, inflammatory status, and vitamin D status are also independent risk factors for paradoxical reaction, when under treatment for extrapulmonary TB \\[22\\]. Moreover, baseline anemia, hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, and a greater change in lymphocyte count are independent risk factors for PR during therapy for pulmonary TB \\[26\\]. The incidence of paradoxical reaction, during anti-TB curative treatment, ranges from 6% to 30% \\[27–29\\] with the respiratory system, central nervous system, and lymph nodes to be mainly affected \\[23, 30\\]. In TL, paradoxical reaction usually occurs within two months, ranging from 14 to 270 days, following administration of anti-TB medication \\[23\\]. Immunotherapy with steroids or an antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-a) inhibitor may help to resolve the paradoxical reaction of lymph nodes during treatment by inhibiting granuloma formation interfering with the penetration of anti-TB chemotherapy \\[31–33\\]. According to the relevant literature, when diagnosis of TL is established and adequate anti-TB regimen is administered, a relapse in adenitis or appearance of draining sinuses could be expected and managed by adding oral steroids along with the anti-TB medication \\[32\\], despite steroids not being prescribed for TL treatment \\[34\\], except for local discomfort \\[20\\]. The use of corticosteroids while receiving therapy for TL seems to resolve paradoxical reaction and improves the clinical outcome \\[30, 35–39\\]. Although steroids seem to be particularly effective against paradoxical reaction during appropriate treatment for intracranial tuberculomas \\[21, 32\\], TB meningitis \\[40\\], and pleural TB \\[41\\], another study showed no significant clinical response \\[42\\]. The rationale for the use of corticosteroids is based on the reduction of the inflammation process \\[30\\]. Specifically, for neuro-TB, the administration of corticosteroids reduces cerebral edema by also influencing cerebral vasculature \\[43\\], while for peripheral lymph node TB, the benefit of corticosteroid therapy seems to be less clear \\[44\\]. Nonetheless, a more recent comparative study showed that the routine addition of corticosteroids for the first 3-4 months in tapering dosage, even without appearance of paradoxical reaction, in patients receiving standard medication for cervical lymph node tuberculosis, is safe with better clinical outcome and complete relief of symptoms \\[38\\].\n\n【28】Also, surgical therapy is the method of choice to manage cervical TL attributed in nontuberculous mycobacteria, specifically in children, due to better response compared to three months of two-drug antituberculous chemotherapy \\[45–47\\].\n\n【29】The learning points, useful in clinical practice, from our case, can be presented as follows: (i) the patient belonged to an age group where cervical TL is particularly uncommon as a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, (ii) the exacerbation of the patient’s neck lymphadenitis was resolved by oral steroids, and (iii) the patient was in complete recovery and free of disease after accomplishment of his 6 month antituberculous chemotherapy.\n\n【30】In conclusion, TL should always be among the differential diagnoses of lymph node enlargement even when no constitutional symptoms exist, as in the presented case. When diagnosis is established and the indicated antituberculous treatment is administered, a relapse in adenitis or draining sinuses presentation is not considered as treatment failure but this effect could be expected and can be managed by adding oral steroids along with the antituberculous medication.\n\n【31】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【32】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【33】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【34】Stylianos A.

{"seq_id": "8b9caeaf-ffb0-4145-8046-c67688def7bf", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】In the past years, the knowledge of eosinophils playing a primary pathophysiologic role in several associated conditions has led to the development of biologics targeting therapies aiming at normalizing the immune response, reducing chronic inflammation, and preventing tissue damage. To better illustrate the potential relationship between different eosinophilic immune dysfunctions and the effects of biological therapies in this scenario, here, we present a case of a 63-year-old male first referred to our department in 2018 with a diagnosis of asthma, polyposis, and rhinosinusitis and presenting a suspicion of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs’ allergy. He also had a past medical history of eosinophilic gastroenteritis/duodenitis (eosinophilia counts >50 cells/high-power field HPF). The use of multiple courses of corticosteroid therapy failed to completely control these conditions. In October 2019, after starting benralizumab (an antibody directed against the alpha chain of the IL-5 cytokine receptor) as add-on treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma, important clinical improvements were reported both on the respiratory (no asthma exacerbations) and gastrointestinal systems (eosinophilia count 0 cells/HPF). Patients’ quality of life also increased. Since June 2020, systemic corticosteroid therapy was reduced without worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms or eosinophilic inflammation. This case warns of the importance of early recognition and appropriate individualized treatment of eosinophilic immune dysfunctions and suggests the conduction of further larger studies on the use of benralizumab in gastrointestinal syndromes aiming at better understanding its relying mechanisms of action in the intestinal mucosa.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Eosinophils are innate immune multifunctional leukocytes that participate in diverse inflammatory pathways, modulate innate and adaptive immune responses and act as effector cells producing tissue-destructive cationic proteins, cytokines, chemokines, and lipid mediators. These cells are associated with host defense against parasitic viral, fungal, and bacterial infections. However, recent studies demonstrated that eosinophils also play a primary pathophysiologic role in the so-called eosinophil-associated disorders (EADs), a wide variety of conditions including rhinitis, eosinophilic asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, dermatitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis \\[1, 2\\].\n\n【4】These disorders have been historically treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, which are often effective at reducing eosinophil counts and associated eosinophilic inflammation but are also associated with serious long-term adverse events \\[3\\]. After 2005-2006, advances in the development of new treatments led to the approval of biological therapies, whose overall mechanism of action targets selective eosinophilopoietic cytokines or other cells interacting with or activating inflammatory pathways. Benralizumab, an antibody directed against the alpha chain of the IL-5 cytokine receptor (IL-5RA), was approved as add-on treatment for moderate to severe eosinophilic asthma grounded on the results of multicenter randomized clinical trials showing significant asthma control improvement and exacerbations reductions (moderate-high certainty of evidence) \\[4–6\\]. More recently, studies have suggested a potential additional effect of benralizumab for depleting both blood and gastrointestinal tissue eosinophilia in some patients with eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID), which may lead to a novel clinical indication for the use of this therapy. Nonetheless, the clinical response among patients using biologics seems heterogeneous, and the possible causative link between this EAD and immunotherapy is not completely known, which requires further investigation \\[7–10\\]. These are especially important given the unmet need in this field for targeted therapies that can normalize the immune response to triggers, reduce chronic inflammation, and limit or prevent remodeling and tissue fibrosis. Currently, conventional treatment of EGID includes diet, proton pump inhibitors, and corticosteroids \\[11\\].\n\n【5】In this context, we aimed to briefly review the literature on the multiple aspects of eosinophilic immune dysfunctions, focus on the potential association between asthma and EGID, and share the outcomes of a case of a male patient with gastrointestinal eosinophilic syndrome, for whom benralizumab has been indicated for managing severe asthma.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Literature Review\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Eosinophilic Immune Dysfunctions\n\n【8】Eosinophils, although representing only the second granulocyte subpopulation in the circulating blood (<6% of the bone marrow resident nucleated cells), are receiving a growing interest from the scientific community given their complex pathophysiological role in immune homeostasis both as effector immune cells committed to the host defense and as modulators of innate and adaptive immune responses. The most relevant mechanisms of actions are the axis between eosinophils and T-cells, more specifically T helper type 2 (Th2) cells \\[12\\]. Th2 cells can stimulate eosinophils either directly through the release of interleukin-5 (IL5), or indirectly by promoting a humoral adaptive response with a particular production of IgE, leading to a cascade of events (e.g., a network of intracellular signaling pathways) in the main tissues in which eosinophils are recruited (i.e., digestive tract, adipose tissue, lung, mammary gland, thymus, and uterus) \\[13\\].\n\n【9】Classically, eosinophils are associated with the combat of helminthic infections and induction of tissue damage in the context of allergies. However, a broad range of other local and systemic inflammatory diseases as well as cancer and thrombosis are being related to deranged eosinophil functions and unbalanced Th2-responses often associated with eosinophilia or eosinophil-mediated tissue damage which highlights the role of eosinophils as biomarkers. Eosinophilia refers to an absolute count of eosinophils exceeding 450–500 cells/𝜇l, while blood type eosinophilia is usually employed to define thresholds of 1500 cells/_μ_l. In this context, eosinophilic immune dysfunctions or eosinophil-associated diseases/disorders (EADs) are being currently defined as a range of heterogeneous conditions in which eosinophils are believed to play a critical pathological role in self-perpetuating inflammatory cycle of diseases \\[1, 2\\]. EADs include common illnesses such as eosinophil-related respiratory diseases (chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyposis, and asthma) and skin diseases (dermatitis, cellulitis, urticaria, and severe drug reactions), and other rare conditions such as hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES, defined as association of blood hypereosinophilia with established eosinophil-related organ damage), hypereosinophilia of undetermined significance (HEUS, defined as clinically silent cases of hypereosinophilia), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders (EGID). Eosinophilia can also be observed in other immune-mediated diseases such as pemphigoid, systemic sclerosis, sarcoidosis, and IgG4-related diseases \\[4, 14\\].\n\n【10】EADs are lifelong conditions requiring monitoring and associated with substantial burdens both for the patient and its family/caregivers (including chronic and debilitating symptoms, decreased health-related quality of life, and increased out-of-pocket costs for treatment) and for the healthcare system (need for multiple different healthcare professionals and increased emergency departments visits and hospital stays). In New Zealand, for instance, severe eosinophilic asthma patients present over 1.5 times as many respiratory treatment prescriptions and 3.6 higher asthma-related healthcare costs compared to other patients \\[15\\]. In the United Kingdom, although the prevalence of severe, uncontrolled eosinophilic asthma is low (1%), the associated health-related costs are four times greater (cost ratio 3.9 (95% IC 3.7–4.1)) \\[16\\]. Moreover, healthcare resource utilization may be particularly high in EGID, with contributing factors including diagnostic delays (poor disease recognition), repeated endoscopy, and lack of approved medications \\[11, 17, 18\\]. The median total annual cost of a single eosinophilic esophagitis case in the United States was estimated at USD $3,300 (outpatient visits, pharmacy, and endoscopy); the total health utilization costs per year vary between $350 and 950 million \\[19–22\\].\n\n【11】##### 2.2. Linking EGIDs and Allergic Diseases\n\n【12】EGIDs are an umbrella term referring to primary eosinophilic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract encompassing a spectrum of diseases characterized by prominent eosinophilic inflammation affecting different regions of the gut (i.e., esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and colon or a combination) that occur in the absence of secondary causes (e.g., infections and drug reactions) \\[23, 24\\]. The strong association of EGID with allergic disorders such as asthma, dermatitis, rhinitis, and food or drug allergies has been recently recognized, and although their shared pathophysiological basis remains partly elusive (e.g., both are characterized by immunologically Th2 responses and allergic sensitizations), this feature may impact on accurate diagnostic and treatment of these conditions \\[6, 24\\]. Moreover, very few mechanistic studies specifically examine both disorders when found concomitantly in patients \\[25\\].\n\n【13】Most of the knowledge about the coexistence or relationship between EGIDs and asthma comes essentially from the eosinophilic esophagitis literature, probably because this is the most frequent form of EGIDs and because gastritis, enteritis, and gastroenteritis are usually considered as a whole nosologic entity given their clinical similarities. The prevalence of asthma in patients with esophagitis is estimated between 25% and 60%, while in eosinophilic gastritis or gastroenteritis cases it may reach 40%. Primary eosinophilic colitis is the least frequent disorder among EGID; asthma is reported in around 15% of these patients \\[25, 26\\]. Recent meta-analyses (21 studies, _n_ = 53,592 adult and pediatric patients) confirm that individuals with EGID have significantly increased probability of having asthma (OR 3.06 (95% IC 2.01–4.66)) when compared to controls \\[27–30\\].\n\n【14】In this scenario, since asthma and EGID may share similar molecular pathophysiology, the possibility of using target therapies has emerged as a potential research area \\[25\\].\n\n【15】##### 2.3. Treatment Options\n\n【16】EADs are typically managed with topical or systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, which are initially effective in controlling eosinophilia and symptoms in many patients. However, chronic use of these therapies often leads to serious short-and long-term adverse effects and resistance, requiring second-line agents \\[4, 5\\]. For EGID, conventional treatments additionally include elimination diet, proton pump inhibitors, and esophageal dilation in patients who have developed strictures. Nonetheless, these treatments also demonstrate variable response rates and may not always provide long-term disease control \\[11\\].\n\n【17】In the past decade, the knowledge of eosinophil biology has led to the development of several biologics targeting eosinophils. These therapies provide the advantage of targeting specific cells or pathways, theoretically increasing efficacy, and limiting complications related to nonspecific effects of more traditional therapeutic approaches. Early research and development efforts of these biologics focused on blocking the action of IL-5; yet, the number of agents approved and under development for managing EAD- especially asthma, has significantly increased in the last years \\[3, 5\\]. A review of the mechanism of action, efficacy, and safety of different biologicals to treat asthma (i.e., benralizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab, and reslizumab) grounded the development of clinical recommendations and practical guidelines in the field with moderate to high certainty. All these biologicals are able to reduce severe asthma exacerbations, improve asthma control, health-related quality of life, and FEV1, without reaching minimal important differences. They can also reduce the daily doses of oral corticosteroids \\[31, 32\\].\n\n【18】Benralizumab is a humanized recombinant monoclonal antibody of the isotype IgG1k immunoglobulin that specifically binds to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor expressed on eosinophils and basophils. This drug is approved since 2017 in the United States (Food and Drug Administration agency) and 2018 in Europe (European Medicines Agency) as a maintenance treatment for patients with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype, grounded mostly on the clinical results from phase III pivotal multicenter randomized trials (SIROCCO, CALIMA, and ZONDA), which are also highlighted in several systematic review with meta-analyses \\[32–35\\]. The usual dose is 30 mg SC every 4 weeks for 3 doses and then every 8 weeks. Other recent studies have also demonstrated potential benefits with the use of benralizumab for managing further respiratory-related EAD such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps \\[36\\] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (at higher doses) \\[37\\]. Table 1 depicts most of the ongoing clinical trials with benralizumab targeting several EADs other than asthma.\n\n【19】Table 1 \n\n【20】Main ongoing clinical trials with benralizumab.\n\n【21】Conversely, so far only the biologic dupilumab has been approved (May 2022) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agency to treat eosinophilic esophagitis (adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older), grounded on the positive results of a phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, and placebo-controlled trial \\[38, 39\\]. Other approvals of biological treatments for these EGID indications are scarce \\[40\\]. Some recently published case reports \\[9, 10\\] demonstrated potential histological remission of gastrointestinal eosinophilia in patients under benralizumab for asthma. However, the clinical response over time seems heterogeneous and may rely on different factors (e.g., gastrointestinal segment affected), requiring further investigation and discussion on the matter.\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Case Presentation\n\n【23】This study followed the standards for scientific research of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from the patient, and anonymity was guaranteed (the study followed the CARE checklist 2013-Supplementary material (Available here)). The overall timeline and major events are depicted in Figure 1.\n\n【24】  \n\n【25】  \n\n【26】Figure 1 \n\n【27】Timeline of the case report: patient journey and main outcomes.\n\n【28】A 63-year-old male, with a diagnosis of asthma, polyposis, and rhinosinusitis was referred to our facility (Lisbon, Portugal) in 2018 due to suspicion of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) allergy and difficult to control asthma. The patient also had a past medical history of eosinophilic gastroenteritis confirmed by biopsy performed in 2006 (eosinophilic duodenitis) and later on in 2017 (gastric, duodenal, and colonic eosinophilic infiltrates).\n\n【29】According to the patient medical record, gastrointestinal symptoms began in 2000, when he started having sporadic abdominal pains that were relieved with proton pump inhibitors. At this time, he also had eosinophilia (1526 cell/_μ_L), but due to clinical resolution on further investigation was performed. In 2006, the patient was admitted to the Gastroenterology Department due to refractory abdominal pain and postprandial infarction. He still had blood eosinophilia (672 cell/_μ_L). Celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and infection were excluded; an upper endoscopy revealed the presence of eosinophilic duodenitis. The patient underwent a course of corticosteroid therapy and was discharged with symptom resolution. In 2009, ulcerative proctitis was assumed, and he was medicated with mesalamine with resolution of symptoms.\n\n【30】In the same year, the patient started exercise dyspnea-later confirmed in a metacholine bronchial provocation test. At that time, budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 _μ_g daily was indicated (regimen maintained until 2018). Between 2015 and 2018, he complained about worsening asthma symptoms, specifically cough, dyspnea, and wheezing (with cold and with little physical effort). Currently eosinophil count: 520/_μ_L.\n\n【31】In 2017, due to uncontrolled abdominal pain, the patient was again admitted to the Gastroenterology Department showing moderate blood eosinophilia (1500 cell/_μ_L). The upper endoscopy and ileocolonoscopy, both revealed (off) esophageal, gastric, duodenal, ileal, and colonic eosinophilic inflammation with eosinophilic infiltrates (namely, >50/cell/high-power field (HPF) in the ileon and colon) besides endoscopic evidence of erosions and hyperemia in the ileocolonosocpy (Figures 2(a)–2(c)). Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis was excluded (negative p-ANCA and C-ANCA; normal ECG, echocardiogram, and normal thoracic CT-scan. Skin biopsy also showed no vasculitis); a diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis was reached.\n\n【32】  \n**(a)**\n\n【33】  \n**(b)**\n\n【34】  \n**(c)**\n\n【35】  \n**(d)**\n\n【36】  \n**(e)**\n\n【37】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)**   \n**(e)**\n\n【38】Figure 2 \n\n【39】Comparison of endoscopic alterations in 2017 (a–c) and endoscopic healing in 2022 (d, e). (a) Hyperemia in the gastric antrum. (b) Erosion and edema in the terminal ileum. (c) Erosions, hyperemia, and edema in the transverse colon. (d) Normal gastric body. (e) Normal colonic mucosa in the transverse colon.\n\n【40】In 2018, the patient was once referred to our department due to suspicious NERD (NSAID exacerbated respiratory disease) as he presented dyspnea while taking nimesulide, acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, and metamizole. As the patient was on systemic corticosteroid therapy, it was not possible to do NSAIDs provocation test; yet, clinical history was consistent, and the diagnosis of NERD was assumed. At this time, the blood eosinophil count was 210 cells/mcL (610 in April 2017), ACT (asthma control test) 19 points, CARAT 22 points, and mini-AQLQ (mini asthma quality of life test) 3.0 points. Inhaler technique and adhesion were reviewed, and the patient was prescribed budesonide/formoterol 320/9 _μ_g twice daily, tiotropium bromide 2,5 _μ_g twice in the morning, and montelukast 10 mg daily. The results from pulmonary tests (2017) were as follows: FEV1 3.35 L, 102%; after bronchodilatation 3.76 L, 115% > 12%; FEV1/FVC 62.37%; FVC 5.35 L; after bronchodilatation 5.24 L, <2%; TLC 8.26 L, 123%; ITGG 4,36 L (normal), raw (slightly increased, theoretical value for this patient ); normal diffusing capacity.\n\n【41】In 2019, it was assumed that the patient had severe eosinophilic asthma as the disease was not controlled despite adequate pharmacological therapy according to the GINA guidelines, therapeutic adherence, and correct inhalation technique. Simultaneously, the patient had worsening gastrointestinal symptoms with the need of using systemic steroids (prednisolone 20 to 40 mg daily). This scenario led to the introduction of benralizumab (October 2019) at conventional dosage (first three doses every 4 weeks and then every 8 weeks). Sixteen weeks after the first benralizumab injection, clinical improvements in both asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms without asthma exacerbation were noted. No adverse reactions were reported. Improvement in asthma scores (ACT 23 points; CARAT 23 points; mini-AQLQ 4.7 points) and a reduction in blood eosinophil count (to 0 cells/_μ_L) were evident. Additionally, since June 2020, it was possible to reduce systemic corticosteroids to 5 mg per day without worsening of gastrointestinal symptoms. In November 2021, no self-reports of both asthma and gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded (blood eosinophil count 0 cells/_μ_L).\n\n【42】Recently, in March 2022, the patient performed a routine upper endoscopy and ileocolonoscopy that still shows no eosinophilic inflammation (Figures 2(d) and 2(e)). He is currently prescribed with benralizumab 30 mg each 8 weeks, montelukast 10 mg, rabeprazole 20 mg, budesonide/formoterol 160/2.5 _μ_g daily, topical nasal budesonide 100 _μ_g daily, and prednisolone 5 mg. No complains of respiratory nor gastrointestinal symptoms were recorded; quality of life has improved (ACT 24 points; CARAT 24 points; mini-AQLQ 6.6). The measuring of exhalated nitric oxide did not show eosinophilic inflammation (19 ppb). Since benralizumab initiation, no hospital admissions were reported. The results from pulmonary tests, under maintenance therapy (2022), were as follows: FEV1 3.56 L, 114%; after bronchodilatation 3.95 L > 11%; FEV/FVC 64.12%; FVC 5.44 L, 137% -after bronchodilatation 5.72 L > 5%; TLC 7.76 L; 115% (see Table 2 for changing in clinical parameters).\n\n【43】Table 2 \n\n【44】Changes in clinical parameters during the patient follow-up (2019–2022).\n\n【45】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【46】This case and updated literature review warn of the diverse organ manifestations of Th2 inflammation and the potential associations between asthma and EGID, whose pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet completely elucidated. Our findings additionally suggest that target therapies such as benralizumab may have an important role in treating different eosinophilic conditions.\n\n【47】Recognition and appropriate treatment of EGID complications (i.e., symptoms, disease activity, continuous monitoring, and maintenance treatment) by means of a multidisciplinary approach are currently of utmost importance to improve clinical outcomes and patients’ quality of life \\[24\\]. Similarly, international asthma guidelines also recommend regular assessment and target treatment of comorbidity conditions such as allergic rhinitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and sinusitis \\[24\\]. Eosinophilic esophagitis, for instance, has been often associated with allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. It is plausible that similar mechanisms exist for EGID to affect asthma given the pulmonary-esophageal relationship in airway disease \\[25\\].\n\n【48】Although ideal biomarkers are still currently needed to better characterize asthma phenotypes, it is also important to recognize blood eosinophil count and its proportion with blood neutrophils and lymphocytes as the most reliable measures to predict airway eosinophilia in severe asthma and, therefore, the response to traditional treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and biologic drugs. In this context, the development, validation, and implementation of further point-of-care devices for the management of these conditions in clinical practice are recommended \\[41\\].\n\n【49】Moreover, translational research has identified potential pathways to target in the treatment of EGID, including Th2 inflammation-targeted systemic pathways, mast cells, and eosinophils \\[40\\]. Preliminary studies reported that cendakimab (IL-13) affect eosinophil count and patients’ symptoms. The IL-5-targeting agents mepolizumab and reslizumab, commonly prescribed for severe eosinophilic asthma, showed histologic improvements in eosinophilic esophagitis (e.g., reduction in eosinophils), but failed to induce symptomatic improvement \\[42, 43\\]. The results of a phase 2 trial using lirentelimab (a monoclonal antibody targeting the eosinophil and mast cell transmembrane protein Siglec8) demonstrated a slightly dysphagia improvement in a subset of patients with eosinophilic gastritis or duodenitis \\[44\\]. Yet, these studies were only powered to assess changes in eosinophil counts rather than any clinical outcomes. Only recently (2022) dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, was approved by the FDA as first target treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis given the improved histologic remission (rates of around 60% when administered weekly vs. 5% in placebo; ) and alleviated symptoms of the disease \\[38, 39\\]. In this context as novel therapies and clinical indications or drug repurposing begin to emerge (i.e., see Table 1 for ongoing clinical trials on the use of benralizumab), there is a growing need for the full characterization and standardization of outcomes to better understand treatment responses and to facilitate the optimization and personalization of treatment \\[11\\].\n\n【50】Nonetheless, different patients may present different responses to treatment. A recent study reported that benralizumab led to histological remission of eosinophilic esophagitis in a 56-year-old patient with severe asthma. Conversely, complete clinical remission was not observed, which exemplified the complex nature of EGID, its associated psychosomatic burden, and the chronification of the disease \\[9\\]. A case series of _n_ = 7 patients with eosinophilic GI disorders (_n_ = 7 of them (71.4%) carrying a diagnosis of asthma) also demonstrated that benralizumab completely depleted blood and GI tissue eosinophilia. However, the clinical response, while encouraging, was heterogeneous. Potential explanations for this variability include a lag between eosinophil depletion and normalization of the mucosa and the involvement of other cells, such as epithelial cells or mast cells, in the pathogenesis of symptoms. Residual symptoms in some patients may reflect persistent epithelial changes in the upper GI tract \\[10\\]. In our case, the use of benralizumab also led to a significant and objective reduction of eosinophilia in peripheral blood samples as well as in the histological examination, with zero eosinophilic granulocytes (0/high power field). More importantly, we noted a reduction in patients’ GI complaints/symptoms and hospital admission after treatment initiation, which may be associated with better clinical outcomes and increased quality of life for the patient and his family/caregivers and a reduced burden for the health system.\n\n【51】It is also important to highlight that no significant adverse events or drug discontinuation were related to benralizumab in this case report. In fact, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that this drug has a low risk of overall adverse events (most commonly reported: headache and pyrexia), serious adverse events, asthma exacerbation, bronchitis, and sinusitis, being relatively safe in both short-and long-term treatments \\[35\\]. Moreover, recent real-world studies on the management of eosinophilic lung diseases confirmed that add-on biological therapy with benralizumab leads to market improvement of severe eosinophilic asthma (including asthma exacerbation rates, prednisone intake, asthma control test, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, quality of life, and eosinophils count) both in patients with and without comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and at no significant safety issues \\[45, 46\\].\n\n【52】Yet, one should be aware that the current approved dose for benralizumab (i.e., as add-on maintenance treatment in adult patients with severe eosinophilic asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus long-acting_β_\\-agonists) is 30 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks for the first 3 doses and then every 8 weeks thereafter. An adjusted dose targeting EGID treatment should be further investigated as it may influence pharmacokinetics/dynamics and outcome achievement. Although a potential synergism between corticosteroids and benralizumab may exist, a recent study indicates that benralizumab causes rapid and near complete depletion of blood eosinophils in the first 24 hours after treatment with a speed of onset effect very similar to that seen with oral prednisolone (time for blood eosinophil level to decrease 50% from baseline was of 1.7 hours (0.7) for benralizumab vs. 2.5 hours (0.3) for prednisolone; ). Authors suggest that benralizumab may be an alternative noncorticosteroid treatment for acute exacerbations of eosinophilic asthma with the potential benefit of inhibiting eosinophilic airway inflammation for at least 30 days after one injection \\[47\\]. In our case, it was possible to reduce patients’ systemic corticosteroids to 5 mg per day, without worsening of GI symptoms and within six months after benralizumab initiation.\n\n【53】Our findings contribute to the emerging body of data suggesting the need for further studies with a larger number of patients with past clinical history of GI syndrome on benralizumab therapy aiming at better understanding its relying mechanisms of action in the intestinal mucosa and the potential benefits for immune disorders. Given the complexity and potential heterogeneity of EGID (e.g., discordance between symptoms, histology, and endoscopic features), there is a need for comprehensive treat-to-target goals, individualized therapy, and continuous monitoring of treatment response.\n\n【54】This study has some limitations. Although a systematic literature review would be methodologically more robust to cover the topic of asthma and EGID conditions, we demonstrated through a narrative review that the literature is still scarce. Our discussion is grounded on the results of a case reported in our center; however, other cases may have slightly different outcomes and thus should be interpreted within their clinical contexts.\n\n【55】#### Data Availability\n\n【56】All information that grounded this case report is available within the main text, tables, and figures.

ED increases the risk for injury, self-extubation, hemorrhages, and prolonged hospitalization and occurs in patients of any age but most often in children and elderly patients. However, ED in young adults is rarely reported. We presented a case of typical ED occurring in a young healthy man following an uneventful appendectomy. The causes of ED can be classified as either predisposing or precipitating factors. In this case, the unnoticeable mental stress may be the predisposing factor and the sevoflurane maintenance of anesthesia may be the precipitating factor. ED occurs at any age of patient and in any minor surgery, and anesthesiologists should do some work to prevent it from happening.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Postoperative delirium (POD) is an acute and fluctuating alteration of mental state of reduced awareness and disturbance of attention, typically occurring between 24 and 72 hours after surgery \\[1\\]. Emergence delirium (ED) is defined as the delirium that occurs during the transition from the sleep state to full consciousness \\[2\\]. ED is an adverse postoperative complication that occurs in patients of any age but most often in children with a variable incidence of 10–80% \\[3\\] and elderly patients between 10% and 15% \\[4\\]. ED increases the risk for injury, self-extubation, hemorrhages, and prolonged hospitalization \\[5\\]. The European Society of Anesthesiology evidence-based and consensus-based guideline on POD \\[6\\] states that the risk factors for POD include advanced age, combination of other systemic diseases (e.g., cerebrovascular including stroke, Parkinson’s disease, depression, and anxiety disorders), alcohol-related disorders, preoperative fluid fasting and dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, drugs with anticholinergic effects, operation site, intraoperative bleeding, operation time, and postoperative pain. Factors contributing to pediatric ED are as follows: preschool age, psychological immaturity, preoperative anxiety, surgical categories (e.g., ear, nose, and throat surgery), inhalational maintenance of anesthesia, pain, and physiological condition (e.g., hypoglycemia and electrolyte imbalance) \\[3\\]. However, ED in young adults is poorly investigated. We presented a case of typical ED occurring in a young healthy man following an uneventful appendectomy and discussed the potential mechanisms.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 29-year-old man, 60 kg, body mass index 21.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, was presented for an emergency appendectomy. The acute right lower quadrant pain occurred a day before. The peripheral blood leukocyte counts (13.23 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and abdominal ultrasound examination indicated acute appendicitis, and other examinations were normal. He had a normal mental state, fair sleep and appetite, normal urination and defecation, and no change in body weight within half a year. He and his relatives had no history of drug abuse, alcohol or nicotine abuse, specific medication intake regularly, metabolic diseases, allergic reactions, treatment with psychiatric drugs, epilepsy, or neurological disorder.\n\n【6】No premedications were given. Upon arrival in the operating room, midazolam 2 mg and dexamethasone 10 mg were administered intravenously. Anesthesia was induced by intravenous injection of propofol 100 mg, sufentanil 20 _μ_g, and rocuronium 35 mg and maintained by sevoflurane inhalation and continuous infusion of remifentanil. A size #4 laryngeal mask airway was inserted for ventilation. The surgery took 2 hours to complete and was uneventful with no significant blood loss. No adverse events, such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, occurred during the procedure. A patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) with sufentanil 100 _μ_g, dexmedetomidine 100 _μ_g, and butorphanol 5 mg was used for postoperative analgesia. To accelerate emergence, a flow rate of 8 L/min with 60% O<sub>2</sub> was used to “wash out” sevoflurane after turning off the anesthesia vaporizer. About 5 min later, spontaneous breathing recovered, but his eyes were closed and he did not respond to anesthesiologist’s commands. Neostigmine 2 mg and atropine 1 mg were intravenous injected to antagonize residual rocuronium, and flumazenil 0.3 mg was injected to reverse midazolam. After 5-minute assessment of the ventilation volume and rate and capnography, the patient was extubated but was still unresponsive, and he tightly closed his eyes and began to sob with no tears and shake his head continuously (Supplementary video 1). He looked very sad. This condition lasted approximately 2 to 3 minutes, followed by somnolence with eyes closed and continuous opening and closing of his jaw that lasted approximately 3 to 5 minutes (Supplementary video 2). These two situations were repeated continuously. Vital signs were stable, and oxygen saturation remained at 97% to 100% during this period. The patient was transferred to the postanesthesia care unit. His wife was invited to comfort the patient, but he was still unresponsive and had no alleviation of the symptoms. This patient completely self-recovered within 5 hours without drug intervention. After recovery, the patient could not recall what happened in the past several hours. However, he felt a voice was calling him and he could not wake up. Moreover, he denied having experienced any pain associated with the surgical procedure. After a detailed history review, the patient had a little worry about his occupation mobility in the past year, but that did not meet the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder according to the 5th Edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, his mental status based on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) was 24, which belongs to mild anxiety disorder. Additionally, no mental disorder and cognition impairment occurred in this patient during the 6-month follow-up.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【8】The causes of POD can be classified as either predisposing or precipitating factors. It is often difficult to pinpoint a specific cause, and most of the time, it is the sum of predisposing and precipitating factors. Thus, we screened preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative risk factors for pediatric ED and POD to discuss the potential predisposing and precipitating factors for this patient.\n\n【9】##### 3.1. Preoperative Risk Factors\n\n【10】Although preschool age and advanced age are recognized as risk factors for pediatric ED and POD, respectively \\[3\\], ED did occur in young adults as reported in this case and other previous cases \\[7–10\\], indicating that ED can occur at any age.\n\n【11】Many patients may suffer different degrees of anxiety, tension, and other adverse emotions from surgery, life, and work \\[7\\]. These abnormalities can result in continuous mental stress, which affects their sleep quality \\[11\\] and the central nervous system, and are risk factors for POD. According to the analysis of the published ED case reports \\[7–10\\], most of the young patients had mental state abnormalities after medical history review. In our case, the patient had a mild anxiety disorder based on BAI, which may be the predisposing factor for this ED.\n\n【12】##### 3.2. Intraoperative Risk Factors\n\n【13】Surgical type, duration, emergency surgery, blood loss, and transfusion are risk factors for POD \\[6\\]. Surgery duration greater than 3 hours in cardiac surgery or 6 hours in head and neck cancer resection \\[12\\] is an independent predictor of POD. In this case, the appendectomy was a small surgery with no obvious blood loss and was completed in 2 hours. Moreover, the case of POD or ED after appendectomy had never been reported in the literature.\n\n【14】Nearly most of the anesthetic drugs have been reported to be the risk factors of POD. Midazolam was implicated in a 26-month-old child who developed delirium following 0.5 mg/kg of an oral dose \\[13\\]. Corticosteroids have been reported to be a probable cause of delirium in a dose-dependent manner or under continuous use \\[14, 15\\]. Our patient received a small dose of midazolam and dexamethasone. Thus, they are unlikely to contribute to this ED. The effect of opioids is unclear, but studies found remifentanil \\[16\\] and sufentanil \\[17\\] could reduce the incidence of ED. As far as we know, no studies found that rocuronium is associated with POD. Thus, remifentanil, sufentanil, and rocuronium are unlikely to be risk factors for ED in this case.\n\n【15】Propofol and volatile anesthetics are commonly used anesthetic agents. Propofol had been implicated in delirium, hallucinations, and amorous behavior in the postoperative period \\[9\\]. A case reported a 20-year-old female patient who had ED after propofol anesthesia \\[8\\]. However, recent findings suggest that low-dose propofol sedation reduces the risk of delirium in the elderly \\[18\\]. Moreover, this patient received only 100 mg propofol for induction. Considering the short time of elimination and the small dose, propofol is an unlikely culprit.\n\n【16】Inhalational maintenance of anesthesia is a high-risk factor for pediatric ED, but in adults, it has not been frequently reported. The incidence of ED in adults following sevoflurane anesthesia reached 11.8% \\[19\\]. Compared with total intravenous anesthesia, inhalational anesthesia is associated with a higher rate of ED in adults \\[5, 20\\]. Thus, sevoflurane maintenance is likely to be the precipitating factor for this patient.\n\n【17】##### 3.3. Postoperative Risk Factors\n\n【18】Length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and postoperative pain were recommended as postoperative risk factors for POD \\[6\\]. Clearly, the length of ICU stay is not the cause of ED. In this case, a PCIA was used after surgery and the patient reported no pain during the perioperative period, indicating that postoperative pain is unlikely to be the cause of ED.\n\n【19】Taken together, in this case, the likely predisposing factor for ED is his worry about occupation mobility and the precipitating factor is inhalational maintenance with sevoflurane. However, what are the potential mechanisms of the ED occurrence caused by mental stress and inhalational maintenance with sevoflurance?. The most accepted theory holds that delirium is a neuropsychiatric manifestation caused by disturbances in brain metabolism and neurotransmitters \\[21\\]. Constant stress or anxiety may lead to hypersensitivity of neural communication. The higher incidence of ED after inhalational anesthesia than total intravenous anesthesia may be primarily related to the low blood solubility and “fast in and fast out” nature of inhalational agents \\[3, 22, 23\\]. Therefore, it is possible to cause nonsynchronous neural excitation and abnormal neural communication; as a result, ED occurs. Although no difference of recovery time between the inhalational anesthesia and total intravenous anesthesia was found \\[23\\], which seems inconsistent with our hypothesis, we cannot ignore that the “fast out” of inhalational agents is usually achieved by manually increasing the air flow as done in this case (8 L/min), while the intravenous anesthetics are automatically eliminated. To demonstrate this hypothesis, a study comparing high “wash-out” with low “wash-out” flow rate after sevoflurane anesthesia will be carried out in our hospital.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】ED occurs at any age of patient and in any minor surgery. The unnoticeable mental stress may be the predisposing factor and the sevoflurane maintenance of anesthesia may be the precipitating factor for ED in young healthy patients who underwent minor surgery.

What Is Your Diagnosis?\n\n【18】##### 2.1. Diagnosis: Human Orf (Ecthyma Contagiosum)\n\n【19】_Case Synopsis_  \nA 61-year-old sheep farmer presented with a painful nonpruritic ulcerated lesion on the left hand that had been present for approximately 5 weeks. He neither had previous history of similar lesions nor did he have a history of cancer or other dermatologic conditions. Physical examination demonstrated a 1 cm pearly, umbilicated papule with raised borders (Figure 1).  \nA biopsy (Figure 2) showed an asymmetrical nodule with parakeratotic crust and acanthosis with thin epidermal strands extending deeply in the underlying dermis. The upper dermis showed marked edema and capillary proliferation. The deeper dermal part of the lesion showed extensive lymphocytic infiltration. One red intranuclear inclusion was identified in the epidermal keratinocyte (Figure 3).\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】Our patient was a sheep farmer who presented with a raised umbilicated pearly lesion of his left hand that was ulcerated with raised borders. Clinically, it could easily be mistaken for a basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The central umbilication could also suggest keratoacanthoma or a lesion caused by molluscum infection though such lesions are usually much smaller. Milker’s nodules should be considered too. Both the clinical history of sheep farming and the microscopic features including the eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion body in the keratinocyte suggest a diagnosis of human orf (ecthyma contagiosum). The diagnosis may be further confirmed by electron microscopy done on the fluid obtained from the orf lesion showing ovoid cross-hatched virions \\[1\\]. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), although not readily available, can definitely identify orf virus from frozen tissue specimens, vesicle material, or scab debris from orf lesions \\[2\\].\n\n【22】Ecthyma contagiosum is a zoonotic disease caused by the parapoxvirus that causes “sore mouth” in sheep and goats and orf in human. In ruminants, it is evidenced by exudative lesions found on the muzzle, eyelids, oral cavity, feet, or external genitalia. It is more common in younger animals. The disease in ruminants is highly contagious to humans and other animals; infected sheep and also freshly vaccinated sheep or goats are the source of infection to people. Transmission can be by direct contact with lesions or indirectly from contaminated object such as hair or clothing \\[3\\].\n\n【23】Parapoxvirus is made up of a dense DNA core surrounded by a less dense capsid and 2 narrow electron dense outer layers. After an incubation period of 3–7 days, parapoxvirus infections produce 1–3 painful lesions measuring 1-2 cm in diameter. During the next 6–8 weeks, the lesion passes through 6 clinical stages: maculopapular, target, acute weeping, nodular, papillomatous, and finally regressive stages \\[4\\].\n\n【24】Microscopically, in the maculopapular stage, there is vacuolization of cells in the upper third of the stratum malpighii leading to multilocular vesicles. Eosinophilic intranuclear or cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be seen. Vacuolated epidermal cells with inclusion bodies characterize the target stage. Ballooning degeneration also occurs in the target stage and affects keratinocytes rupture with a tendency to coalesce and produce reticulated vesicles. Additionally, in the epidermis, there is an elongation of the rete ridges. Many newly formed dilated capillaries and a mononuclear infiltrate are present in the dermis. This is followed by the acute weeping stage which is characterized by necrosis and a massive infiltrate of mononuclear cells throughout the dermis. Some biopsies of orf may have a marked reactive lymphoid infiltrate with CD30 positive T cells mimicking lymphoma. On progression to the nodular stage, a lichenoid reaction with a high percentage of histiocytes is seen in the skin. In the final papillomatous stage finger-like downward projections are displayed in the epidermis along with vasodilatation and chronic inflammation in the dermis. This results in resolution and regression of the lesion \\[5\\].\n\n【25】The natural history of the disease is complete resolution and no treatment is indicated. But antiseptic agents to prevent the superinfection and in some selected cases imiquimod can be applied \\[6\\]. Although, immunity is short lived, reinfection frequently appears but no human-to-human transmission occurs. Investigation into prevention of ecthyma contagiosum in ruminants through vaccination is thought to be the best way to control infection. Vaccines are available that offer some efficacy in sheep but do not prevent disease in goats. Research into effective and economical vaccines is ongoing. If infection is controlled in the ruminant population, human infection and its economic and environmental consequences should decrease \\[5, 7\\].", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The physical examination revealed subcutaneous emphysema in zone II of the neck. The tomography revealed an anterior and proximal tracheal lesion, a 2-mm solution of continuity of the anterior infraglottic airway in the proximal third with subcutaneous emphysema and a decrease in the diameter of the airway at the level of the glottis. The PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. The medical procedure consisted of orotracheal intubation to guarantee the safety of the airway, in addition to close surveillance in the intensive care unit and constant monitoring of vital signs. In tracheal perforation due to closed neck trauma, it is recommended to evaluate the clinical parameters periodically, including the stability of respiration and subcutaneous emphysema.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Tracheobronchial injuries occurring after penetrating or blunt trauma are rare, although unfortunately they can be life-threatening. It has been indicated that a high percentage of these patients die before being admitted to the hospital, and a significant number die within the first hours after admission \\[1\\]. Penetrating injury to the airways can occur from sharp objects, or from wounds firearm injury \\[2\\], while iatrogenic airway injury can occur during surgery, endotracheal intubation, or bronchoscopy \\[3\\]. However, the incidence of airway injury is likely to be underestimated since these injuries are often poorly recognized and reported \\[4\\]. According to some case reports, the therapy of choice for these tracheal injuries is early surgical repair. However, conservative management using endotracheal tubes has also been reported \\[4, 5\\]. This article reports the case of a patient with tracheal perforation due to closed neck trauma, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2, who had conservative medical management through orotracheal intubation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The case of a 42-year-old female patient with no medical history is described. She was admitted to a high-complexity hospital after suffering a traffic accident. The patient presented amnesia of the event and an altered state of consciousness. She also presented facial trauma, closed trauma to the neck and left arm, and lacerations to the lower extremities.\n\n【6】Upon her admission, the following vital signs were observed: blood pressure 130/64 mmHg, heart rate 90 per minute, respiratory rate 17 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The physical examination revealed an alert patient, oriented in the three spheres, with left periorbital ecchymosis, wound in the upper eyelid on its medial side, with little active bleeding and limited eye-opening. She was immobilized with a rigid collar, with a nonpulsatile hematoma in the neck area, with pain on palpation in the left lateral face, and with subcutaneous emphysema in zone II of the neck. Moreover, she had no stigmata of the chest (Figure 1) or abdominal trauma.\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】Chest X-ray: emphysema is observed in the cervical region, the cardiothoracic index was within normal limits, and no rib fractures, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion are identified, without consolidations or interstitial infiltrate.\n\n【11】High-risk mild cranial brain trauma was suspected with a left orbital fracture, without compromise of visual acuity, with closed cervical trauma, with soft signs of the airway and/or vascular injury. Initially, continuous monitoring was requested, intravenous fluids (500 cc bolus), angiotomography of neck vessels, and tomography of the paranasal sinuses and face, in addition to contrast-enhanced tomography of the chest and abdomen. Administration of tetanus toxoid, analgesics, and paraclinical were also ordered. Furthermore, the patient incidentally reported 5 days of dry cough, no runny nose, no fever, no signs of respiratory distress, and no diarrhea. However, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an antigen test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were requested to detect the virus. The patient was isolated in the acute respiratory care unit.\n\n【12】The computerized axial tomography (CT) of the neck, thorax, and abdomen showed anterior and proximal tracheal injury and dissolution of continuity of 2 mm of the anterior infraglottic airway in the proximal third (Figure 2), with emphysema subcutaneous dissecting the visceral, carotid, and prevertebral space and causing anterior and middle pneumomediastinum, with a decrease in the diameter of the airway at the level of the glottis (Figures 1–3). The tomography of the paranasal sinuses showed fractures of the nasal bones, local and left periorbital edema. Simple skull CT showed no pathological findings. No lesions were found in large vessels of the neck (Figure 4). It was decided to intubate the patient on an emergency basis in the hands of anesthesiology with all protective measures in the context of a patient suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】A 2 mm continuity solution of the anterior infraglottic airway is observed.\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Figure 3 \n\n【20】Subcutaneous emphysema is observed dissecting the visceral, carotid, and prevertebral space and causing anterior and middle pneumomediastinum, with a decrease in the diameter of the airway at the level of the glottis.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 4 \n\n【24】No lesions are evident in large vessels of the neck.\n\n【25】The patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit due to anterior and proximal tracheal injury of the anterior infraglottic airway in medical management with orotracheal intubation. In addition, the result of the PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, an issue that could complicate the outcome of the case. The medical conduct consisted of orotracheal intubation to guarantee the safety of the airway, in addition to close surveillance in the intensive care unit and constant monitoring of vital signs. During clinical surveillance, there was no evidence of an increase in subcutaneous emphysema, nor the presence of signs of respiratory distress.\n\n【26】In these cases, bronchoscopy should also be performed to confirm the diagnosis and see the injury site. However, considering that the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2, the bronchoscopy was not performed because the risk of contagion could be increased during the procedure. Moreover, at that time, the patient already showed signs of improvement.\n\n【27】The patient was discharged on the eighth day after her admission with anterior and proximal tracheal injury and nasal fractures; she was given follow-up and outpatient rehabilitation.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【29】In the present case, the conservative medical management of a tracheal perforation after blunt trauma in a patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 is described. Although the tracheobronchial injury is more common among women, men tend to have a higher risk of mortality \\[6\\]. Moreover, the most frequent cause of tracheobronchial injuries due to blunt trauma is motor vehicle accidents \\[7\\].\n\n【30】As observed in the present case, the typical findings in the context of tracheobronchial injury include subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax \\[8\\]. In the diagnosis of tracheal injury, the degree of clinical suspicion, CT, and bronchoscopy are helpful. Radiographic images may reveal pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or the tracheal tear itself \\[9\\].\n\n【31】The treatment of tracheobronchial injury in most cases must be individualized, depending on the patient’s comorbidities, the clinical presentation, and the anatomy of the tracheobronchial injury. As in the present case, it has been described that in tracheobronchial lesions involving the mucosal layer with mediastinal or subcutaneous emphysema (level II lesions), patients are treated according to their manifestations with nonsurgical therapy. However, it has been reported that if managed conservatively, tracheal perforations are associated with a 10-fold increase in mortality \\[7\\], although in the absence of progressive deterioration, open lesions, or mediastinitis, conservative treatment has not been associated with increased mortality \\[10\\].\n\n【32】As described in this report, it is recommended to periodically assess clinical parameters, including stability of respiration and subcutaneous emphysema \\[4\\].\n\n【33】The prognosis for the patient with tracheobronchial injury depends on several factors related to the underlying clinical status of the patient, the degree of the tracheobronchial injury, and the type of repair \\[4\\]; consequently, the prognosis of the patient in the present case was good. However, it is necessary to highlight that when a tracheal perforation occurs, in addition to an infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there could be a greater risk of causing a ventilatory failure that could cause complications such as severe pneumonia due to COVID, a longer stay in intensive care unit and even death.\n\n【34】#### Data Availability\n\n【35】The clinical data utilized in this report are described in this article.\n\n【36】#### Consent\n\n【37】The patient’s legal representative signed the informed consent related to hospital care and for academic purposes.

To report the outcome of pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with intraoperative endolaser focal photocoagulation (PC) on eyes with idiopathic macular telangiectasis (MacTel) type 1. _Methods_. This was a retrospective study of two female patients with MacTel type 1 who were resistant to focal photocoagulation, sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection, and/or antiangiogenic drugs. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was determined, and fluorescein angiography (FA) and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) were performed before and after surgery for up to 19 months. _Results_. After surgery, the BCVA gradually improved from 20/100 to 20/20 at 19 months in Case 1 and from 20/50 to 20/13 at 13 months in Case 2. Fluorescein angiography (FA) showed leakage at the late phase, and OCT showed that the cystoid macular edema was resolved and the fovea was considerably thinner postoperatively. _Conclusion_. Patients with MacTel type 1 who are refractory to the other types of treatments can benefit from PPV combined with intraoperative endolaser focal PC with functional and morphological improvements.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Idiopathic juxtafoveal macular telangiectasia (MacTel) is characterized by vascular anomalies affecting the macular capillary network. It was first described by Gass and Oyakawa \\[1\\] and Gass and Blodi \\[2\\] and named idiopathic juxtafoveolar retinal telangiectasis (IJRT). It was recently renamed macular telangiectasis (MacTel) by Yannuzzi et al. \\[3\\]. There are two types of MacTel: type 1 with aneurysmal telangiectasia and type 2 with parafoveal telangiectasia. MacTel type 1 or unilateral parafoveal telangiectasis (Group 1B IJRT) typically occurs in one eye of relative young men. The temporal half of the macula is involved by the telangiectasis, and the macular oedema and hard exudates lead to vision reduction. No treatment has been established although some encouraging effects have been obtained by argon laser photocoagulation (PC) \\[4, 5\\], intravitreal or sub-Tenon’s capsule injection of triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA or STTA) \\[5–7\\], or intravitreal bevacizumab (IVR) or ranibizumab (IVB) injections \\[8–10\\] in small case series.\n\n【4】We present two patients with MacTel type 1 who were refractory to photocoagulation (PC), STTA, and IVB but responded to pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with intraoperative endolaser focal PC.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【6】This was a retrospective study of two eyes of two patients with MacTel type 1 who did not respond to focal PC delivered by an integrated slit lamp, to STTA, and/or to IVB. After discussing the possible treatment options including repetition of earlier treatments, an informed consent was obtained for our technique of PPV combined with intraoperative endolaser focal PC. Both patients underwent PPV combined with endolaser focal PC during the surgery. The diagnosis of MacTel type 1 was based on the fundus examination, FA, and OCT after the exclusion of neovascular maculopathy, secondary macular telangiectasia, and diabetes. Both eyes had cystoid macular oedema (CME) and showed a prompt filling of both the superficial and deep capillary networks of the telangiectatic vessels. There was also late intraretinal staining by fluorescein. The follow-up period was 19 months for Case 1 and 11 months for Case 2.\n\n【7】The ocular examinations included measurements of the BCVA, ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein angiography (FA), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Serial SD-OCT B-scan images were obtained with the Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). The foveal thickness (FT) was measured as the distance between the internal limiting membrane and inner border of the retinal pigment epithelium at the foveal centre with the computer-based caliper built into the OCT system. The vertical and horizontal B-scan images across the fovea were used to determine the foveal thickness.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Case Reports\n\n【9】##### 3.1. Patient 1\n\n【10】A 79-year-old woman complained of blurred vision in her right eye and came to our clinic. Her BCVA was 20/100 OD and 20/25 OS. FA showed telangiectasia temporal to the fovea with pronounced fluorescein leakage in the late phase in the area of the telangiectasia. OCT showed cystoid macular edema (CME) in the area surrounding the leakage (Figure 1). The right eye was diagnosed with MacTel type 1 and received STTA, IVB twice, and focal PC through a slit lamp. These treatments failed to decrease the leakage on FA and resolve the CME. The BCVA was not improved.\n\n【11】  \n**(a)**\n\n【12】  \n**(b)**\n\n【13】  \n**(c)**\n\n【14】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【15】Figure 1 \n\n【16】| Finding of the right eye of Patient 1 with idiopathic macular telangiectasis (MacTel) type 1 on her first visit.

After core vitrectomy, a posterior vitreous detachment was created by suction through the vitreous cutter. The internal limiting membrane was made more visible with triamcinolone acetonide particle (Maqaid), and it was grasped and peeled with a microforceps. Then, focal PC was performed on the fluorescein leakage points with a 25-gauge endolaser probe and 100 to 120 mW power so that the focal retinal edema was treated.\n\n【18】After that, the CME decreased and the BCVA improved gradually to 20/25 in 3 months. The leakage of fluorescein was not present, the CME could not be detected in the OCT images, and the foveal thickness decreased from 420 to 140 _μ_m (Figure 2). During the 19-month follow-up period, the BCVA and the CME progressively improved (Figure 3).\n\n【19】  \n**(a)**\n\n【20】  \n**(b)**\n\n【21】  \n**(c)**\n\n【22】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【23】Figure 2 \n\n【24】| Findings of the right eye of Case 1 taken 3 months after surgery.

Patient 2\n\n【30】A 69-year-old woman with no relevant medical history presented with decreased vision in her left eye of 1-week duration. She had been diagnosed with macular oedema associated with MacTel type 1 and underwent IVB and focal PC in a private clinic. The treatments were not effective, and she was referred to us two months later.\n\n【31】Our examination showed that her BCVA was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS. FA revealed ectatic capillaries temporal to the fovea with leakage in the late phase in both eyes but especially in the left eye. SD-OCT showed severe CME in the left eye (Figure 4). She was diagnosed with MacTel type 1 and underwent PPV with intraoperative endolaser focal PC as in Patient 1.\n\n【32】  \n**(a)**\n\n【33】  \n**(b)**\n\n【34】  \n**(c)**\n\n【35】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【36】Figure 4 \n\n【37】| Findings of the left eye at the first visit of Case 2.

Discussion\n\n【46】Our results showed that PPV with endolaser focal PC can improve the BCVA and reduce the CME in patients with MacTel type 1. Our cases had not responded to focal PC through an integrated slit-lamp system, STTA, and/or antiangiogenic drugs, but after PPV with endolaser focal PC, the vision and CME improved. These findings strongly suggest a causal relationship between the treatment and the improvements.\n\n【47】Several treatments have been reported to be effective for MacTel, especially for type 2 \\[7, 8, 11\\], and there are few reports on the treatment of MacTel type 1 \\[4, 8–10\\]. IVTA or STTA has been reported to be effective in some cases \\[3–7\\] because steroids are anti-inflammatory and might maintain the blood-retina barrier. Recently, antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab or ranibizumab have been reported to be effective in some cases of MacTel type 1 \\[8–10\\]. Antiangiogenic drugs are known to reduce neovascularization and oedema; however the follow-up times in those reports were relatively short and some cases had recurrences. Therefore, the efficacy of those therapies has still not been definitively determined.\n\n【48】At present, there is no consensus regarding the treatment of MacTel. Our two patients had no or only limited improvement clinically and angiographically after PC, STTA, and/or antiangiogenic therapy. Thus, we believed that intraoperative endolaser focal PC may be more effective because it allows for better accuracy in treating the lesions than through an integrated slit-lamp delivery system. Focal PC through a slit lamp has several disadvantages. The site of the lesion can be easily affected by micromotions of the eye, the use of a joystick and manipulation of the contact lens require considerable technique and experience, reflected light from the contact lens can reduce the visibility of the macular region, and the endolaser beam can be delivered at different angles which can reduce the energy to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) over the fovea. The RPE is located in the outer layer and microaneurysm is in the inner layer, and the laser beam that is delivered obliquely from the inner and central side arrives relatively peripheral to the outer layer. This can prevent damage to the RPE. And finally, the endolaser procedure is not influenced by an opaque media, and the intravitreal laser probe can be brought very close to the retinal surface.\n\n【49】However, there are also drawbacks to the endolaser photocoagulation such as the difficulty for repeated treatments because of the risks associated with intraocular surgery.\n\n【50】There are several factors that may have played a role in improving the macular edema after PPV with endolaser focal PC. The removal of the vitreous and/or ILM may have reduced the level of pathological cytokines or chemical mediators adjacent to the telangiectasia. There are several reports showing that ILM peeling is effective treatment for macular edema secondary to diabetic retinopathy (DME) \\[12, 13\\] and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) \\[14\\]. Although the mechanism of the ILM peeling has not been fully understood, it might have contributed to the successful outcome. The intraoperative use of TA may have similar effect as STTA or IVTA although its use was only transient. The effectiveness of PPV alone can be assessed if intraoperative PC was not done. But the therapeutic protocol did not allow it. In addition, Sigler et al. reported that PPV was not effective against nonproliferative idiopathic MacTel type 2 \\[15\\]. MacTel type 1 is mainly exudative and nonfamilial, while type 2 is primarily nonexudative, obstructive, and occasionally familial. This may explain the differences of our results from the results of Sigler et al. In addition, some cases of MacTel type 1 respond well to antiangiogenic drugs but not type 2.\n\n【51】There are some limitations in our study. This was a retrospective study of only 2 patients. In addition, the follow-up period was short, and there were no controls. However, we believe that PPV with endolaser focal PC is effective and should be considered as an optional treatment for selected cases of MacTel type 1 especially in refractory cases. These treatment protocols should lead to an improvement in both the BCVA and macular edema.\n\n【52】In conclusion, we have experienced two patients with MacTel type 1 who were refractory to photocoagulation (PC), STTA, and IVB but responded to pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with intraoperative endolaser focal PC.\n\n【53】Although further investigations are needed to elucidate the rationale and to establish its indication, we think a stepwise approach to the management of the disease with the use of surgical management can be considered when conventional treatment fails.\n\n【54】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【55】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.\n\n【56】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【57】No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.

{"seq_id": "3fbd10e4-9ba8-4751-9964-6ba8a6923cda", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Previous studies demonstrated that while the mandible assumes its resting position in space, antagonistic muscles should assume minimal muscle activity within a spatial range. This zone of mandibular rest has been mapped using physiologic parameters of muscle activity and incisal spatial kinematics. This case study expands on previous research by monitoring incisal and posterior jaw position and includes lateral pterygoid muscle activity, thus allowing for determining the spatial range including additional relevant coordinates and muscle activity. Four positions were evaluated: a maximum physiologic open position, a maximum physiologic closed position, physiologic rest position, and maximum physiologic protrusion position. Within the physiologic zone of rest formed by these 4 positions, the vertical and anterior borders of the envelope of function may be documented for the incisal and posterior mandible in true 3-dimensional fashion to assist the clinician in determining a physiologic interocclusal freeway space and vertical dimension of occlusion. Advantages and limitations are discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Clinical application of a maxillomandibular orthopedic relationship including nerves, muscles, ligaments, dental occlusion, and both temporomandibular joints for optimal function can be challenging. However, failure to consider these basic dynamic elements of dental occlusion in providing temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) treatment may result in a functional compromise. Functional compromise may either predispose or ultimately lead to muscle pathology, destruction of the dentition, supporting structures and/or the temporomandibular joints. Even mild forms of compromise result in dysfunction of the neuromuscular apparatus and associated structures \\[1\\].\n\n【4】In an age that demands evidence-based care, combining objective measurements of physiologic and anatomic components is a natural evolution from treatment based on subjective and mechanical concepts, to computer-assisted technologies when seeking objective answers to complex physiologic functions \\[2\\].\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Mandibular Posture\n\n【6】Posture may be defined as the relative position of the various parts of the body with respect to the egocentric coordinate system, the exocentric coordinate system, and the geocentric coordinate system \\[3\\]. Postural control involves the meaningful integration of many different neural systems that control postural components, including those associated with cognition. The mechanical problem of maintaining the posture of any single region of the body is that there are profound effects on proximal and distal regions.\n\n【7】The orientation of any body part, such as the mandible, may be described in terms of these frameworks and it reflects a dynamic process.\n\n【8】The habitual postural position of the mandible when at rest in the upright position and the condyles are in a neutral unstrained position in the mandibular fossae is also called “postural position” \\[4\\]. Anatomical rest position, or loose packed position, for the TMJ is with the mouth slightly open so the teeth are not in contact \\[5\\].\n\n【9】Through the use of surface electromyography (SEMG), muscle activity of the masticatory system can be objectively measured. The repeatable postural range at minimum baseline SEMG levels has been shown to be consistent with physiologic rest position and jaw posture \\[6\\]. Physiologic rest of the mandible, therefore, may be defined as the minimum amount of muscle activity required to maintain anatomical rest.\n\n【10】To achieve physiologic rest, the masticatory and cervical muscles must be balanced and coordinated with respect to left and right sides and the muscles of the posterior neck must be in balance with the anterior cervical muscles. This represents a stable mandibular position concurrent with a stable head position \\[7, 8\\] as only a few millimeters of increased inter-occlusal distance may influence a large reduction of masticatory muscle activity \\[9\\]. Therefore, interocclusal distance and muscle activity are intimately related and physiologically relevant. The postural range of the mandible should be a repeatable zone where the mandible may return allowing the investing musculature to function from physiologic rest \\[7, 8\\].\n\n【11】Additional research supporting SEMG clinical techniques in dentistry are numerous and conveniently provide guidelines where SEMG may be employed within treatment approaches including appliance therapy \\[10–19\\], orthodontic intervention \\[20–24\\], and dentures \\[25, 26\\].\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Surface Electromyography (SEMG) and Jaw Kinematics in Determining a Mandibular Postural Position\n\n【13】Through the use of incisal based, magnetic kinematic technology and SEMG, Mazzocco et al. \\[27\\] proposed a clinical protocol by which an incisal vertical physiologic envelope may be mapped in the TMD patient (Figure 1).\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】  \n\n【16】Figure 1 \n\n【17】| Adapted and modified from \\[26, page 9\\]. SEMG of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MM), temporalis posterior (TP), and suprahyoid (DA) sites in combination with incisal spatial kinematics. “Maximum physiologic opening” or the bottom of the physiologic zone (incisal position 1) was determined when the suprahyoid activity was above what was determined as normal levels. The top of the zone or “maximal physiologic closing” (incisal position 3) was determined when elevator activity increased to greater than what was determined as physiologic normal levels. Physiologic rest (incisal position 2) position after 45–60 minutes of ULF-TENS. |\n| --- |\n\n【18】A postural envelope defines the limits of stability in space in all directions. As long as the sway envelope stays within the limits of stability, balance is maintained. If sway exceeds these limits, strategies involving neighboring regions must be employed to regain balance. If an individual’s center of gravity is more anterior, posterior, or lateral than center, a smaller sway envelope is tolerated before losing balance \\[28\\]. The demand of neighboring systems then increases to remain within this smaller physiologic envelope. Therefore, if mandibular rest position or mandibular postural sway exceeds the zone of the physiologic resting range, a combined strategy including those of neighboring regions (e.g., the cervical spine, etc.), must be incorporated in an effort to maintain stability. Unfortunately, once the system’s adaptive capacities have been surpassed, pathology would ultimately develop.\n\n【19】A stable, physiologic occlusion would consider the spatial position from which the postural resting position of the mandible is maintained within a spatial zone that offers relatively minimal, balanced muscle activity in order to be able to provide symmetrical and prompt activation of the jaw musculature as the teeth are brought into occlusion, where maximal muscle recruitment is available and where the mandible may return to the physiologic resting range promptly and symmetrically.\n\n【20】Previous clinical works have been limited to incisal vertical dimension and lack documentation of posterior jaw position and an anterior boundary. Knowledge of the anterior border would enable clinicians to establish a jaw position within a boundary which, if exceeded, would require the neighboring systems to accommodate to maintain stability. Furthermore, posterior mandibular position is also of great importance as loss of posterior occlusal support leads to noticeable cranial condyle movement \\[29\\] as well as significantly altered effects on cervical muscle activity and spinal curvature with asymmetrical posterior occlusal support \\[30\\]. Therefore, it would enable the clinician to objectively ascertain if the chosen mandibular position from the anterior and posterior coordinates is within vertical and anterior physiologic boundaries.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Lateral Pterygoid\n\n【22】The concept that disturbance to the activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles plays an important role in the etiology of TMD and is widely accepted; however, there is a dearth of scientific evidence to support this clinical notion and the role of the lateral pterygoid muscle in normal function remains controversial.\n\n【23】Motor unit studies at computer tomography confirmed that sites demonstrate and confirm that the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid (IHLP) and the superior head of the lateral pterygoid (SHLP) are active during opening, protrusion, and contralateral jaw movements, while a minority of SHLP were active during closing movements. These percutaneous results also provide clinically valuable information and have demonstrated that the SHLP and IHLP were minimally active when the jaw was in the clinically determined postural jaw position \\[31–33\\].\n\n【24】The presence of elevated activity in the lateral pterygoid muscle at resting jaw posture may be of clinical significance in that variations in the level of lateral pterygoid muscle activity could influence and/or assist in determining the anterior positioning of the condyle in relation to the disc and eminence, as well as the positioning of the jaw at postural position.\n\n【25】Through the works of Hiyama et al. \\[34, 35\\] and Thomas, \\[36\\] it has been shown that through intraoral recording techniques, it may be possible to monitor the activity of the lateral pterygoids using surface electrodes. Although the nature of the surface electrode disallows distinction between the activities of the superior and inferior heads of the lateral pterygoid muscles, this provides tremendous promise for clinical purposes.\n\n【26】In this case study, the physiologic window of postural rest position inclusive of anterior and posterior mandibular position relative to the maxilla and muscle activity of the intraoral lateral pterygoid placement was explored.\n\n【27】#### 5\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【28】Case study design including a 43 year old male with normal occlusion, with temporomandibular dysfunction. The subject was a unilaterally involved combined myogenous and arthrogenous patient (groups I and II according to RDC/TMD) \\[37\\] and reported moderate to severe muscular pain at rest and during mandibular movements on the right side; pain was also associated with palpation of the TMJ area. Pain was classified as grade I-II according to the chronic pain classification scale (low disability with low to high intensity pain). Clicking (in opening/closing) or articular crepitus, on the right side were subjectively found.\n\n【29】Additional objective data included right joint sounds analysis that revealed possible crepitus, adhesions, scarring, and degenerative issues. Imaging results revealed slight osteogenic degeneration, sclerosis, and posterior and superior displacement of the right condyle.\n\n【30】SEMG data was collected from the bilateral temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), and suprahyoid (DIG) sites using pregelled bipolar Ag/AgCl surface electrodes (Noraxon USA) with a diameter of 1 cm and an interelectrode distance of 2 cm center to center, parallel to muscle fiber direction over the muscle belly as recommended \\[38\\]. The reference electrode was placed on the C-7 spinous process. All SEMG electrode sites were rigorously abraded and cleansed with sterile alcohol prep pads prior to electrode placement.\n\n【31】The activity of the bilateral lateral pterygoid (LP) sites was recorded intraorally by way of surface electrodes per Hiyama et al. \\[34, 35\\]. The electrodes used were a small Ag/AgCl surface electrode Blue Ambu N with a monitoring area of 15/28 mm<sup>2</sup> and a decentralized snap. The electrodes were trimmed and adhered to reach an interelectrode distance of approximately 1 cm and secured on the mucosa in the buccal vestibule distal to the maxillary tuberosity with an adhesive. Prior to electrode placement, the mucosal tissue was dried using a standard paper towel and then cleaned with a sterile alcohol prep pad.\n\n【32】All SEMG data was collected with a telemetry device, preamplified and band-pass filtered in hardware between 20 and 500 Hz (Noraxon USA) with input impedance greater than 100 Mohms and sampled at 1000 Hz with an overall gain of 1000. Data was rectified and smoothed at 100 ms (movag) in WinNMBite software (Zebris GmbH).\n\n【33】Spatial analysis of the lower jaw was determined in conjunction with SEMG using the Jaw Motion Analysis system (JMA) from Zebris Medical GmbH (Figure 2). The JMA system has been determined to be accurate for recording and evaluating jaw motion \\[39–41\\].\n\n【34】  \n\n【35】  \n\n【36】Figure 2 \n\n【37】| Jaw Motion Analysis system mounted on subject. Courtesy of Zebris Medical GmbH. |\n| --- |\n\n【38】The JMA utilizes ultrasonic sensors attached to a light head frame (approximately 3.9 ounces) and emitters (weight—approximately 10 grams) that were attached to the mandibular dentition via Stomahesive (Convatec Inc). The resolution of the ultrasonic path is approximately 0.085 mm with a maximum sampling rate of 200 Hz (sampling rate was 75 Hz for the case study).\n\n【39】Documentation of the subject’s maxillary right and left distobuccal molars and the incisal points were determined using the pointer system. The lower jaw is then referenced to these three points in space. These coordinates used are relative to the maxillary plane and provide incisal and posterior mandibular coordinates relative to the maxilla.\n\n【40】The subject was seated upright comfortably in a straight-back chair without head support, with the Frankfurt occlusal plane parallel to the floor. After SEMG electrode placement was completed, baseline/postural resting values of each site were recorded (Figure 3).\n\n【41】  \n\n【42】  \n\n【43】Figure 3 \n\n【44】| SEMG activity of the bilateral temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS) suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoids (LP) at the initial baseline/postural resting position (Pre-TENS). |\n| --- |\n\n【45】Following the baseline recording, the subject was instructed on how to perform a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for the masseter, temporalis anterior, and pterygoids. SEMG baseline/postural data of the temporalis anterior and masseter sites were normalized to their corresponding mean SEMG values recorded during a two second maximal clench. With the teeth apart where maxillary and mandibular incisal position was even, a recording during a 2 second maximally resisted protrusive effort was performed (Figure 4). SEMG baseline/postural data of the lateral pterygoid sites were normalized to their corresponding mean SEMG values recorded during the two second maximum resisted protrusion effort.\n\n【46】  \n\n【47】  \n\n【48】Figure 4 \n\n【49】| Recorded during jaw protrusion against resistance while the teeth are separated. Baseline values of the lateral pterygoids were normalized to this maximal effort. |\n| --- |\n\n【50】Ultralow frequency transcutaneous electrical stimulation (ULF-TENS,) was chosen as the relaxation method due to research demonstrating the efficiency in relaxing masticatory muscles \\[42–44\\]. Following application of ULF-TENS, (Dolotens, Neuromuscular Technologies, Inc.) for 25 minutes, the subject was seated in a comfortable head-supported upright position with the Frankfort horizontal plane parallel to the floor and an additional baseline recording was taken to ensure that relaxation of all muscles was achieved (Figure 5). Then, the physiologic rest position was determined utilizing a traditional protocol as described by Hickman et al. \\[45\\].\n\n【51】  \n\n【52】  \n\n【53】Figure 5 \n\n【54】| SEMG activity of the bilateral temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS) suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoids (RLP/LLPT) after 25 minutes of ULF-TENS. Recording demonstrates that baseline levels from all sites are low and balanced. |\n| --- |\n\n【55】Physiologic rest position of the mandible may be described as a position assumed by the mandible within the physiologic window (Figure 6). This position was identified after appropriate SEMG values were established to maintain balanced, relatively minimal muscle activity of the jaw elevator and depressor muscles.\n\n【56】  \n\n【57】  \n\n【58】Figure 6 \n\n【59】| Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral SEMG activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites. Coordinates listed are representative of mandibular position relative to centric occlusion and physiologic rest. |\n| --- |\n\n【60】As the masticatory muscles are stimulated to contract, under the influence of ULF-TENS, the mandible is propelled through interocclusal rest (freeway space) forming an extended computed trajectory (Figure 6). The first spatial position/border, “maximum physiologic opening” was identified based upon SEMG parameters using similar methods described by Lynn and Mazzocco (Figure 7) \\[19\\]. Maximum physiologic opening was obtained by having the subject slowly open the mouth until suprahyoid or lateral pterygoid SEMG activity demonstrated a consistent elevation in excess of physiologic rest activity. The subject was instructed to perform this motion 3 times to evaluate consistency. The spatial position when either the lateral pterygoid or suprahyoids demonstrated a consistent “burst” of activity above physiologic rest values was documented (Figure 7).\n\n【61】  \n\n【62】  \n\n【63】Figure 7 \n\n【64】| Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites. Coordinates listed are representative of mandibular position relative to centric occlusion and physiologic rest and were documented during the “burst” of suprahyoid (DIG) activity, and determined to be “Maximum Physiologic Opening”. |\n| --- |\n\n【65】The second position, “maximum physiologic closure” was identified based upon resting SEMG parameters and has been described by Mazzocco et al. \\[27\\]. Maximum physiologic closure was obtained by having the subject to slowly close the mouth until it was determined that the elevator muscle activity (masseter, temporalis anterior, or lateral pterygoids) demonstrated a consistent elevation in excess of physiologic resting activity and greater than 2% of their MVC. The threshold of 2% was chosen based on previous work that demonstrated a mathematical calculation of normal subjects having a resting baseline of less than 2% of MVC for the mandibular elevators \\[19\\]. Acceptable baseline amplitudes, may be operationally defined as less than a 1% to 2% MVIC amplitude for tasks that are functionally performed for about 1 hour or longer (e.g., posture of the mandible) \\[46\\]. The subject performed this motion 3 times to evaluate consistency. The spatial position where the lateral pterygoid, masseter or, temporalis anterior sites demonstrated a consistent “burst” above 2% MVC was documented (Figure 8).\n\n【66】  \n\n【67】  \n\n【68】Figure 8 \n\n【69】| Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites. Coordinates listed are representative of mandibular position relative to centric occlusion and physiologic rest and were documented during the “burst” of LPT activity and determined to be “Maximum Physiologic Closing”. |\n| --- |\n\n【70】A third position, “maximum physiologic protrusion” (Figure 9) was identified based upon resting EMG parameters and was obtained by having the subject to slowly push the jaw forward (protrude) from physiologic rest position until the mandibular elevators or lateral pterygoid activity demonstrated a consistent elevation in excess of physiologic rest activity (greater than 2% MVC).\n\n【71】  \n\n【72】  \n\n【73】Figure 9 \n\n【74】| Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites.

Results\n\n【76】Spatial position for incisal, right and left posterior jaw positions relative to their corresponding physiologic positions are presented in Table 1.\n\n【77】Table 1 \n\n【78】Summary of associated mandibular coordinates relative to physiologic parameters, determined by simultaneous monitoring of masticatory muscle activity.\n\n【79】Physiologic rest was spatially determined when all elevator muscle levels were at relatively minimal levels and balanced. Incisal vertical demonstrated the greatest discrepancy. When establishing a spatial position of “maximal physiologic opening”, the suprahyoids demonstrated an initial elevation in activity in 2 of the 3 efforts. The 2nd effort demonstrated a simultaneous response of the right lateral pterygoid and suprahyoids. When establishing a spatial position of “maximal physiologic closing”, the lateral pterygoids consistently demonstrated a bilateral elevation in activity prior to the temporalis anterior and masseter recording sites in all 3 trials. When establishing a spatial position of maximal physiologic protrusion, the right lateral pterygoid site was consistently the first to demonstrate an elevation in activity over all muscles, in all 3 trials.\n\n【80】#### 7\\. Discussion\n\n【81】As previously indicated, once adaptive capacities have been surpassed, pathology develops. This is obvious within the masticatory and associated structures. Shortened muscles can initiate pain by affecting intramuscular nociceptors \\[47\\] or through metabolic effects \\[48\\]. As muscles shorten, tension increases and concurrent mechanical stress and pain may be induced by additional tension on tendons, joints, ligaments, as well as occlusion of the vascular bed prohibiting metabolic turnover. Tenderness within these tissues contributes to the sensitization of the associated neurons lowering the pain threshold. This nociceptive input arises from muscular hypertonicity and fatigue. Therefore, treatment directed towards muscle components that limit muscle hypertonicity can decrease pain related to the dysfunction present \\[26\\].\n\n【82】In the case study presented, each spatial position was documented when there was evidence of muscle activity above clinically acceptable baseline levels (hypertonicity). Therefore, the resting physiologic envelope of postural jaw function in this subject would be slightly superior to maximal physiologic opening, slightly inferior to maximal physiologic closing, and posterior to maximal physiologic protrusion, and it approximates the computed trajectory to be within a physiologic muscular position (Figure 10).\n\n【83】  \n\n【84】  \n\n【85】Figure 10 \n\n【86】| Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites. Coordinates listed are representative of mandibular position relative to centric occlusion and physiologic rest, maximal physiologic opening (position 1), maximal physiologic closing (position 2), and maximal physiologic protrusion (position 3). |\n| --- |\n\n【87】The data would suggest that in this subject, an increase in vertical dimension may be considered to be compatible within the physiologic range. The vertical dimension compared to anterior/posterior positioning may require the largest change to reach a homeostatic state with mild differences between right and left posterior mandibular positions. If vertical dimension changes were to be considered on this subject, the vertical dimension would allow relatively moderate changes (less than 3.6 mm left and 3.3 mm right posterior jaw positions, resp.) and suggest mild changes in 3-dimensions to the subject’s right in 3 of the 4 positions documented. Also, any anterior change may be limited in this subject as all positions were less than a millimeter anterior to CO to be within the physiologic range. These data suggest that the vertical dimension of both the anterior and posterior jaw may endure the greatest change, where the anterior/posterior range is much more sensitive to change.\n\n【88】Furthermore, it was found that in establishing the resting physiologic envelope, during maximal physiologic closing, the lateral pterygoid sites, not investigated in previous studies, were consistently found to be responsive prior to prime mover sites (temporalis anterior or masseter). During maximal physiologic protrusion, the lateral pterygoid consistently demonstrated earlier activation than any other site, and during maximal physiologic opening, it was found to be elevated approximately 30% of the time concurrent with the suprahyoid sites.\n\n【89】This information presents a number of appealing implications as follows.(1)This physiologic resting range of the anterior and posterior mandibular positions may be documented utilizing jaw motion analysis (e.g., Zebris Medical GmbH) when combined with SEMG. (2)The vertical physiologic envelope may be smaller than previously suggested in TMD subjects. The function and activity of the lateral pterygoid suggest that this may be the limiting factor. (3)The anterior border (maximum physiologic protrusion) may be documented if concurrent lateral pterygoid activity is recorded. (4)Caution should be exercised if jaw positioning is considered anterior to a trajectory created by TENS if the lateral pterygoid activity is not measured.(5)Intraoral lateral pterygoid recordings may lend important information in the construction of “pull-forward” appliances for sleep apnea patients to ensure the chosen appliance and/or position is within the physiologic range.(6)Establishing the physiologic borders through the combined use of SEMG and posterior jaw position during a bite registration procedure may allow the clinician to objectively document the range of physiologic rest of the anterior and posterior lower jaw in the vertical and anterior dimensions. Theoretically, this would allow the clinician to ensure the chosen bite registration position is within physiologically tolerable limits, thereby lessening the amount of adaptation that would be required. Within the physiologic zone of rest formed by these 4 positions, the vertical and anterior borders of the envelope of function may be documented for the incisal and posterior mandible in true 3-dimensional fashion to assist the clinician in determining a physiologic interocclusal freeway space and vertical dimension of occlusion.\n\n【90】This and previous works demonstrated tremendous promise for clinical applications for intraoral SEMG of the lateral pterygoid sites if commercially available customized miniature intraoral surface electrodes became available and an established electrode placement protocol based on verified CT sites is tested more thoroughly for clinical applications. Should these parameters be met, use of surface electromyography of the lateral pterygoids would provide noninvasive, functionally diagnostic treatment information not attainable by other means.\n\n【91】In the computed trajectory, one limitation is that functional anatomy dictates that the mandible does not move in a straight line. Therefore, it is seemingly intuitive that any sort of computer generated trajectory is an approximation and the addition of SEMG may be necessary to ensure that any chosen treatment position is within physiologic parameters.\n\n【92】Furthermore, there are obvious biomechanical implications related to the cranial-skeletal system that should be considered. Cranial asymmetries are not uncommon, often associated with craniofacial asymmetries, as well as cerebral asymmetries \\[49–51\\]. In view of the fact that the masticatory muscles have attachments to the cranium, if asymmetries or skeletal anomalies exist, muscles are disallowed a biomechanically symmetrical alignment among homologous pairs, predisposing them to dysfunction. Without initially correcting these biomechanical issues, treatment success is likely to be limited with or without the technique or technologies presented.\n\n【93】The author acknowledges some clear limitations. In addition to the aforementioned parameters, the dimensional changes by way of orthodontic or reconstructive or other methods that were considered when referring to the data are speculative only and were not explored and thus, the rigorous research is required to establish validity of the concept. The analyzed individual represents only a convenient sample, and the extrapolation of the results or to different TMD diagnostic groups, should be done with caution. However, the concept does follow basic physiologic principles and appears to be promising.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

As class III obesity leads to hip joint deterioration, black women frequently present for orthopedic care. Weight loss associated with bariatric surgery should lead to enhanced success of hip replacements. However, we present a case of a black woman who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with the expectation that weight loss would make her a better surgical candidate for hip replacement. Her gastric bypass was successful as her BMI declined from 52.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, her hip circumference after weight loss remained persistently high. Therefore, at surgery the soft tissue tunnel geometry presented major challenges. Tunnel depth and immobility of the soft tissue interfered with retractor placement, tissue reflection, and surgical access to the acetabulum. Therefore a traditional cup placement could not be achieved. Instead, a hemiarthroplasty was performed. After surgery her pain and reliance on external support decreased. But her functional independence never improved. This case demonstrates that a lower BMI after bariatric surgery may improve the metabolic profile and decrease anesthesia risk, but the success of total hip arthroplasties remains problematic if fat mass in the operative field (i.e., high hip circumference) remains high.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】According to NHANES 2009-2010, the prevalence of class III obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in black, white, Hispanic, and Mexican American women is 18.0%, 7.3%, 6.1%, and 6.7%, respectively \\[1\\]. For men, the prevalence also varies by ethnicity but is lower than 8% in all groups \\[1\\]. Due to their high rate of obesity, black women are highly likely to come to the attention of orthopedic surgeons after bariatric surgery for hip replacement. Bariatric surgery is associated with many benefits including the eradication or improvement of hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and obstructive sleep apnea \\[2\\]. All of these metabolic changes lead to decreased risk of anesthesia and postsurgical metabolic complications. But in our urban orthopedic clinic, we are observing persistently high hip circumferences in black women, even after major weight loss (MMM). Therefore we frequently encounter an unpublished and unexpected orthopedic risk: inadequate loss of subcutaneous fat in the operative field. To demonstrate the challenges, a representative case is presented.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】With the expectation that her back and hip pain would resolve, a 51-year-old black woman, with a BMI of 52.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Within three years she achieved a BMI of 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. At this lower BMI, she reported that her back pain had improved but due to persistent severe right hip pain, her ability to ambulate remained compromised. She requested surgical relief.\n\n【6】At her preoperative orthopedic evaluation, she had a Harris Hip Score of 17, and even though her BMI was 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, her hip circumference was proportionately much higher. Preoperative photographs of her with a BMI of 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were not taken. Photographs from 3 years later when her BMI had increased to 42.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> have been obtained (Figure 1). At the time these photographs were taken, her waist and hip circumferences were 107 cm and 155 cm, respectively. Her overall proportions with a BMI of 42.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were visually similar to her preorthopedic surgery measurements when her BMI was 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| 51-year-old black woman with BMI of 42.0 kg/m2 after bariatric surgery, waist circumference of 107 cm, and hip circumference of 155 cm.

The massive soft tissue mass in the surgical field totally obstructed bony landmarks and precluded both computer and image navigation techniques. She underwent a 4-hour operation during which extensile incisions were utilized to improve access and component positioning. Due to the 15 cm depth of the soft tissue tunnel, combined with the inability to reflect the soft tissue flaps, a traditional cup placement could not be achieved. Therefore, instead of the more optimal total hip replacement, a hemiarthroplasty was performed. Postoperatively, a chronically draining wound which took months to stabilize occurred.\n\n【13】Nonetheless she had transient improvement in hip score. However, her ambulation at 1 and 3 years after hemiarthroplasty was only minimally improved and she is categorized as housebound ambulatory with a Harris Hip Score of 18.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】For the woman presented, bariatric surgery was successful in achieving weight loss so that BMI declined from 52.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to 33.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. However, her persistently high hip circumference left her with the same technical challenges during hip replacement surgery as if she had not undergone the weight loss intervention. Even with a BMI in the category of class I obese, her body fat distribution was such that a total hip replacement could not be accomplished. Due to the size, shape, and mobility of the soft tissues in the operative field, adequate exposure and access to the acetabular component were not achievable.\n\n【16】This case raises awareness that neither absolute weight nor BMI is sufficient to define whether the subsequent orthopedic risks have been minimized. Attention needs to be paid to the mass of fat in the operative field. Importantly, this large mass of subcutaneous fat can be predicted preoperatively by simply measuring hip circumference and performing hip axial imaging by CT (Figure 2). Consistent with our clinical experience, the importance of hip circumference as a way to predict high body fat content has recently been validated. The ratio of hip circumference to height known as the Body Adiposity Index (BAI), has been shown to be superior to BMI as a measure of body fat \\[3\\] (Body Adiposity Index = (hip circumference/(height<sup>1.5</sup>)) − 18).\n\n【17】  \n**(a)**\n\n【18】  \n**(b)**\n\n【19】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【20】Figure 2 \n\n【21】| CT imaging to demonstrate soft tissue geometry and gravitational changes with position.

These scans are presented as an example and are from a black woman with BMI of 45.0 kg/m2. |\n| --- |\n\n【22】Overall, this case presentation has special relevance for black women. Women have more subcutaneous fat than men and black women have more subcutaneous fat than white women \\[4, 5\\]. Therefore even after successful weight loss black women are likely to continue to have a relatively high volume of subcutaneous fat. To optimize orthopedic outcomes related to total hip replacement, surgeons need to evaluate patients independent of BMI for this possibility and plan accordingly. At this time, bariatric and orthopedic surgeons focus on BMI rather than hip circumference.\n\n【23】We bring this issue forth because there appears to be an absence of appreciation of this issue. A literature search led us to the identification of only two articles discussing hip replacement surgery following bariatric surgery \\[6, 7\\]. Both of these articles described the benefits of bariatric surgery and neither addressed the orthopedic issues we describe. Because extensive fat in the surgical field is so commonly encountered in our practice, we have developed modifications that have been helpful (MMM) (Table 1). We appreciate the limitations in waist and hip circumference measurements being made 3 years following her hip replacement surgery. However her body mass distribution, including her pear shaped body habitus, was preserved allowing for some of the observations and recommendations we have made. We hope this case presentation will lead to improved outcomes and bring attention to the need to focus not just on BMI but also hip circumference when considering the options for hip arthroplasty.\n\n【24】Table 1 \n\n【25】Modifications to consider for hip arthroplasty with high hip circumference.\n\n【26】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【27】The patient described in this paper gave permission for the use of her case history and picture.\n\n【28】#### Disclosure\n\n【29】This work was performed at Mercy Philadelphia Hospital, 501 South 54th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19143.\n\n【30】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【31】None of the institutions involved received any funding in this matter.

It is important to recognise Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in electrocardiograms (ECG), as it may mimic ischaemic heart disease, ventricular hypertrophy, and bundle branch block. Recognising WPW syndrome allows for risk stratification, the identification of associated conditions, and the institution of appropriate management. _Objective_. The present case showed that electrophysiological study is indicated in patients with abnormal ECG and syncope. _Case Report_. A 40-year-old man with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome was presented to emergency with syncope. A baseline ECG was a complete right branch block and posterior left hemiblock. He was admitted to the cardiac care unit for pacemaker implantation. The atypical figure of complete right branch block and posterior left hemiblock was thought to be a “false positive” of conduction abnormality. But the long anterograde refractory period of the both accessory pathway and atrioventricular conduction may cause difficulty in diagnosing Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, _Conclusion_. A Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome may mimic a conduction disease. No reliable algorithm exists for making an ECG diagnosis of a preexcitation syndrome with conduction disorders. This can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in the context of syncope.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a conduction disturbance in which atrial impulses are transmitted to the ventricle by an accessory pathway besides normal atrioventricular conduction. The result of these multiple fronts of depolarization is a short PR interval, the delta wave, and a widened QRS complex. The preexcitation syndrome (PS) is diagnosed by the surface ECG in sinus rhythm with a typical pattern associating a short PR interval (<0.12 s in adults) and a widening of QRS complex with a delta wave \\[1, 2\\]. Patients with WPW syndrome may usually present palpitation, syncope, and sudden death. Pattern of PS is noted among 0.1 to 0.5% of the population \\[3\\]. The pattern is dependent not only on the location of accessory pathway (AP), but also on the properties of atrioventricular (AV) node and His-Purkinje system, and there is a wide spectrum of ECG types encountered. Spontaneous normalization of ECG with intermittent preexcitation is reported in 20% to 30% of WPW; dynamic QRS variations in WPW syndrome were noted several years ago \\[4\\].\n\n【4】This case reported unexplicated syncope with unusual patterns of PS related to an atrioventricular accessory pathway (AP) was identified at electrophysiological study.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】This case is about a 40-year-old man who was presented to emergency with syncope that happened at work. He had no prior history of cardiac disease. The physical examination was normal. The ECG showed a regular sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, a complete right branch block, and posterior left hemiblock (Figure 1), and PR interval was 120 ms. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal echocardiographic findings with normal left ventricular systolic function.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| (a) Regular sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, a wide QRS and PR interval was 120 ms (b) post ablation we show a normal QRS. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】Electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed by intracardiac route in this patient with unexplained syncope and atypical ECG. We recorded a regular sinus rhythm, an AH interval was 150 ms, and HV interval was −24 ms. Programmed atrial stimulation was performed in the basal state and showed an effective atrial refractory period of right atrium at 200 ms and effective refractory period of accessory tract was 300 ms (Figure 2). The QRS had the same morphology during atrial pacing. We found a dissociation atrioventricular conduction in retrograde. We inserted a catheter of exploration in coronary sinus; we recorded a shorter AV at the distal electrode of decapolar that confirmed the diagnosis of a left accessory bypass (Figure 3). The use of isoproterenol (isuprel) showed a classic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with slurred initial QRS. This ECG showed fusion of antergrade conduction from both the left sided accessory pathway (AP) and AV node (Figure 4). AH interval with isuprel was 100 ms and HV interval was 42 ms. This was explicated by an accelerated atrioventricular conduction with isuprel in addition to accessory pathway (Figure 5). The effective refractory period of accessory pathway was 210 ms with isuprel (Figure 6). We supposed that atrial fibrillation caused ventricular fibrillation responsible for syncope. Thus, we had decided to ablate the accessory pathway (Figure 7).\n\n【13】  \n**(a)**\n\n【14】  \n**(b)**\n\n【15】  \n**(c)**\n\n【16】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【17】Figure 2 \n\n【18】| In atrial pacing, effective accessory pathway refractory period was 290 ms effective ((a) and (b)).

In Atrial pacing, an anterograde Wenckebach cycle length was 130/BAT (suprahisian AV block). The patient became asymptomatic.\n\n【44】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【45】Unapparent preexcitation syndrome was defined as a normal ECG at the time at electrophysiology which can be related to a masked preexcitation or an intermittent preexcitation. Masked preexcitation was defined as overt antegrade conduction over AP masked by the normal AV conduction. These patients have a minimal preexcitation on the ECG \\[5\\].\n\n【46】We reported a case of a patient with WPW and syncope. The preablation ECG showed fusion of antegrade conduction from both the left sided accessory pathway (AP) and AV node with predominance from left sided accessory pathway. Therefore, the ECG showed atypical presentation of preexcitation that is considered as rare in PS. This patient was studied because he complained of syncope. Similar findings could be expected in apparently asymptomatic subjects; systematic ECG in subjects at risk of arrhythmias as athletes is probably not sufficient to eliminate the presence of a masked electrical abnormality as a PS sometimes at risk of serious events. The most frequent unusual ECG of PS was the masked pattern of PS, associated with minor signs of preexcitation retrospectively visible when ECG became slightly different after AP ablation \\[5\\]. Although the ECG mimics RBBB, a more careful inspection of the baseline ECG indeed reveals a small delta wave and relatively short PR interval. A differential diagnosis of AP could be made after careful analysis \\[6\\].\n\n【47】It is important to recognize Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in electrocardiograms (ECG), as it may mimic ischaemic heart disease, ventricular hypertrophy, and bundle branch block. In addition, ECG can aid in the localization of the accessory pathway. Recognizing WPW syndrome allows for risk stratification \\[1, 7\\], the identification of associated conditions, and the institution of appropriate management. More than 50% of APs are located at the left free wall, 5%–10% at the anteroseptum, 20%–30% at the posteroseptum, and 10%–20% at the right free wall \\[8\\]. In patients with an antegradely conducting AP, ventricular activation during sinus rhythm occurs simultaneously via both the AP and the atrioventricular (AV) node, resulting in a fusion complex. APs may be classified into several types \\[9\\]. Manifest APs are those that conduct more rapidly in the antegrade direction than the AV node, resulting in a discernible delta wave on the surface ECG. Concealed APs conduct only in the retrograde direction, and no delta wave is documented in the ECG. Several algorithms have been developed to localize the site of APs from the surface ECG \\[10, 11\\]. In our case, the anterograde conduction in accessory tract and atrioventricular node both slowly explain this ECG figure. Charron et al. \\[12\\] reported a particular electrocardiographic pattern in four members of the same family with conduction defects (RBBB and occasionally left anterior hemiblock), short PR interval, pseudoappearance of atrial hypertrophy, and occasionally sinus dysfunction or supraventricular extrasystole. This clinical entity is related to R302Q mutation of the _γ_2 subunit producing AMP protein kinase, coded by the gene PRKAG2, but, in our case, there was not a similar case in his family.\n\n【48】In conclusion, a Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome may mimic a conduction disease and this can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in the context of syncope.\n\n【49】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【50】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Currently, the incidence and prevalence of DMI are difficult to conclude, and there is no clear algorithm or standard of care in managing this condition. Pathogenesis of the microangiopathy of DMI remains unclear. A major finding in this investigation of DMI emphasizes that, within 2–17 weeks, patients who initiate low-dose acetylsalicylic acid, bed rest, and close outpatient follow-up see significant size reduction of lower extremity mass and complete resolution of pain without being subjected to invasive muscle biopsy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Diabetic Muscle Infarction (DMI), also referred to as Diabetic Myonecrosis (DM), is a rare complication of poorly controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes affecting the thigh muscles in 80% of cases and lower leg muscles in 17% of cases \\[1\\]. DMI can mimic other conditions such as cellulitis, deep vein thrombosis, or even necrotizing fasciitis leading to misdiagnosis and inappropriate management due to scarce literature \\[2\\]. It is usually seen in those with microvascular complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and most commonly, nephropathy. The incidence and prevalence of DMI are difficult to conclude. In a 2006 systematic review, 115 cases were reported, but the actual incidence of diabetic muscle infarction is speculated to be much higher with a predilection for those who are middle aged and of female sex \\[3\\]. A systematic review published in 2015 reported 170 cases of DMI since its first introduction to the literature in 1965. This included 126 initial presentations and 44 episodes of recurrence, with a mean age of presentation being 45 years and a range of 20 to 67 years \\[4\\]. There is still no clear algorithm or standard of care in managing this condition. In this case report, we explore both presenting signs and efficient management of DMI in an effort to prevent subjecting patients to invasive and unnecessary procedures such as biopsies and surgical debridement that ultimately may lead to significant morbidity.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 52-year-old Hispanic male with newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and ischemic cardiomyopathy presented with a one-month history of nonradiating right thigh erythema, pain, and swelling. He worked as a warehouse clerk; however, due to the severe, debilitating pain to his right thigh, the patient was on disability. He required maximal assistance in ambulation and, at times, even a wheelchair. He denied a history of fever, physical trauma, or intravenous drug use. The patient reported several emergency department and urgent care visits prior to our evaluation with no significant improvement on oral antibiotics for presumed cellulitis. Vital signs on presentation included blood pressure 108/69 mm Hg, heart rate 77 beats per minute, temperature 37.5°C, respiratory rate 18, and 96% on room air. On physical examination, a hard, tender, erythematous 7 × 4 inch right anterior thigh mass with accompanying right upper thigh edema was noted (as shown in Figure 1). Distal pulses were 2+ on palpation. Right lower extremity had 3+ pitting edema, while the left lower extremity had 2+ pitting edema. Severe tenderness was also noted in the right groin region with associated painful groin lymphadenopathy.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】Physical exam showing significant edema of the right thigh.\n\n【10】White blood cell count was 10.7 × 10^3 cells/mcl; other laboratory tests did show signs of systemic inflammation including elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate 49 mm and elevated C-reactive protein 7.98 mg/dL. Aldose value was 3.8 units/L. The patient had an elevated creatinine 1.31 mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL, urine albumin/creatinine ratio 1,342.8 mcg/mg Cr, and creatinine kinase 844 unit/L, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 10.3%, and blood cultures were negative. Laboratory values to diagnose polymyositis and dermatomyositis were negative. A venous Doppler ultrasound of the right leg was negative for deep vein thrombosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast of the femur demonstrated bilateral inflammatory changes with disproportionate enlargement and diffuse heterogeneity of the right vastus medialis muscle with patchy areas of intramuscular hemorrhage, extensive subcutaneous edema, interfascial free fluid, and severe myositis (as shown in Figure 2).\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Figure 2 \n\n【14】MRI without contrast of the right femur: bilateral inflammatory changes manifested by extensive subcutaneous edema with interfascial free fluid as well as severe myositis. Disproportionate enlargement of the right vastus medialis muscle which is diffusely heterogeneous with a patchy area of intramuscular hemorrhage is shown.\n\n【15】Due to lack of improvement of symptoms on antibiotics and poorly controlled diabetes, the diagnosis of diabetic muscle infarction was considered. The treatment consisted of analgesia, low-dose aspirin, bed rest, and close outpatient follow-up. Upon discharge from the hospital, the patient was referred to a tertiary center for muscle biopsy; however, this was delayed due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Three months after being discharged from the hospital, the patient endorsed a significant size reduction of right thigh mass, complete resolution of pain, and endorsed being able to ambulate without assistance. With time, rest, and excellent adherence to low-dose aspirin, he no longer required a biopsy due to complete resolution of symptoms.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Diabetic muscle infarction (DMI) is a rare, often-missed diagnosis that causes significant pain and disability for patients. The mean duration of symptoms before presenting for care is about four weeks, and the time to resolution ranges from 2 to 17 weeks with an average of four weeks \\[5\\]. As discussed by Smith et al., typical clinical presentation of DMI includes abrupt onset of pain in the affected muscle accompanied by local swelling with subsequent partial resolution and appearance of a palpable painful mass. DMI most frequently affects the thigh, and the quadriceps was the most commonly affected muscle; calf involvement has also been reported. It is mostly unilateral; however; bilateral lower extremity involvement has been reported. The muscles more frequently affected were the vastus lateralis and the vastus medialis, as seen in our patient’s case with Figure 2 showing significant inflammatory changes of the right vastus medialis muscle. The characteristic feature of DMI in MRI is an increased signal from the affected muscle area (intramuscular and perimuscular tissues) in _T_2-weighted, inversion-recovery, and gadolinium-enhanced images and isointense or hypointense areas on _T_1-weighted images, secondary to increased water content from edema and inflammatory changes that accompany the infarction \\[6\\]. DMI may be diagnosed by means of a combination of clinical presentation and radiological imaging. The most valuable diagnostic technique is MRI; axial images are the best plane for diagnosis, although coronal and sagittal images may be useful to document the extent of involvement \\[7\\]. Muscle biopsy is not recommended, but typically shows muscle fiber necrosis, inflammatory cell infiltrates, and hyalinization of the blood vessels with luminal narrowing \\[8\\].\n\n【18】The pathogenesis of DMI remains to be clarified. The most likely hypothesis is that muscle infarction is caused by vascular disease such as arteriosclerosis and diabetic microangiopathy. Epidemiologic data suggest that the presentation of acute or insidious lower limb pain may be linked to arteriosclerotic factors such as endothelial and platelet dysfunction \\[9\\]. Some literature suggests an alteration in the coagulation-fibrinolysis system as the cause of DMI which is supported in a case series by Palmer and Greco who reported two patients with DMI and antiphospholipid syndrome \\[10\\]. Although it is difficult to assess the relative contribution of microvascular complications of diabetes versus antiphospholipid antibodies to the DMI, the experiences of Palmer and Greco were further supported by Gargiulo et al. that indicate the antiphospholipid antibodies as contributing factors in the progression of diabetes complications, acting as a link between the immunological and hemostatic systems in the pathogenesis of diabetic microangiopathy. Our patient tested negative for antiphospholipid antibodies.\n\n【19】Treatment with low-dose aspirin decreases mean recovery time by 2.5 weeks through its antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory process \\[11\\]. Aspirin irreversibly blocks prostaglandin _H_ synthase (cyclooxygenase-1) in both platelets and megakaryocytes, preventing the formation of thromboxane _A_2, a potent vasoconstrictor and platelet aggregant \\[12\\]. This further supports its use in slowing the microischemic complications seen in poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The delay in muscle biopsy due to the COVID-19 pandemic was a blessing in disguise for our patient as it gave him the time to heal with over-the-counter low-dose aspirin. An astute physician will carry a high index of suspicion for this underdiagnosed condition when evaluating thigh pain and swelling in patients with poorly controlled blood glucose levels. Patients who see significant improvement after the initiation of appropriate glycemic control, rest, and low-dose cetylsalicylic acid within 2–17 weeks should not be subjected to invasive muscle biopsies.\n\n【20】#### Consent\n\n【21】Informed consent for patient information to be published in this article was obtained.\n\n【22】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【23】The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Dengue is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It is an endemic virus in tropical countries. In Colombia, 4 serotypes are present (DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, and DENV4) and the disease is a burden for public health, social programs, and the economic sector. It is transmitted in two ways: the vertical one (from mother to child) and the vector through the bite of infected mosquitoes \\[1\\], and it has also been reported during transfusion of blood components and organ transplant. The main vector is _Aedes aegypti_, although transmission through the _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito is also described in the literature, which has a lower transmission capacity \\[2, 3\\], and most infections are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. The hemorrhagic appearances of severe dengue are due to plasma leakage as a result of increased vascular permeability, severe thrombopenia, and hemoconcentration.\n\n【4】In 2020, 78,979 cases of dengue were reported in Colombia. 38,836 (49.2%) of them reported warning-free signs, 39,246 (49.7%) with warning signs, and 897 (1.1%) of severe dengue. Dengue incidence in Colombia on a regional basis is 295.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants at risk. For Huila, incidence rates higher than 500 cases per 100,000 inhabitants are estimated \\[4\\].\n\n【5】Dengue is a disease that has a wide spectrum of signs affecting different organs and systems; sometimes, special therapies are required to maintain the proper functioning of the different affected organs. Among the main cardiovascular complications of dengue, it is the dengue shock, which is considered as the clearest way of plasma leakage and the main cause of the potential fatal outcome of the disease. This is an acute state of cardiovascular dysfunction leading to an inability to carry enough amounts of oxygen and nutrients to meet metabolic needs \\[5\\]. As it is well-known, viral diseases are immune system activators, triggering off a loss of tolerance in it. Dengue is not an exception, and it is able to explain different autoimmune phenomena including macrophage activation. Mechanisms have been described by which an exacerbated response of the disease is triggered through the increase of infected cells, formation of immune complexes, and complement pathway activation, which lead to a cross-reaction of viral antigens with epithelial cells and platelets with subsequent endothelial dysfunction and bleeds \\[6\\].\n\n【6】The first description of Evans syndrome was made in 1951 by Evans et al. \\[7, 8\\]. This syndrome is characterized by the combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and, less common/usual, immune neutropenia \\[9–14\\]. This disease’s etiology is unknown, and the dysregulation of the immune system is among its possibilities \\[11, 13, 15\\].\n\n【7】Here, we present the case of an unusual hematological and immunological complication of a patient who developed Evans syndrome during severe dengue, taking into account the concomitantly limited literature available for these two diseases, the need for a broader diagnostic approach, multidisciplinary intervention, and a more complex therapeutic approach.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Clinical Case\n\n【9】A 6-year-old male patient (weight: 19 kg, SD: −0.70; height 113 cm, SD: −0.56; BMI: 14.9 SD: −0.41) with no significant medical history, coming from the first level of care with clinical manifestation of 5-day evolution, consistent nonquantified fever, asthenia, adynamia, myalgia, arthralgia, emetic episodes, abdominal pain, and headache. The patient was hospitalized with a probable dengue diagnosis with warning signs. He shows a torpid clinical course, with epistaxis, progressive thrombopenia, dengue hepatitis, oligoanuria, 20% right pleural effusion, fever persistence, and hepatosplenomegaly. The patient was taken to the pediatric ICU due to his proven severe dengue diagnosis. In follow-up tests, positive IgM serology for dengue, hematological affection was documented due to bicytopenia (anemia and thrombopenia) without evidence of external or hidden bleeding (Figure 1) requiring platelet transfusion on two occasions; it was decided to transfuse because the patient had already overcome the dengue critical phase, and this decrease was progressive until high-bleeding risk values from vital organ are associated with severe hemodynamic affection, secondary to Evans syndrome and not to a hematological manifestation of dengue.\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 1 \n\n【13】Platelet and hemoglobin behavior of the patient with severe dengue and Evans syndrome.Hemoglobin levels are shown in area form, and their values appear on the left axis Platelet levels are shown as a line, and their values are shown on the right-hand axis.\n\n【14】Given the atypical course of the disease, an interdisciplinary approach was used on the part of the pediatric subspecialties of infectious diseases, hemato-oncology, and rheumatology. Studies were prolonged including autoimmunity profile, bone marrow aspiration, and biopsy (findings: nonnecrotizing epithelioid granuloma), polycultures (negative blood cultures 1 and 2, negative urine culture, and negative myeloid culture), negative infectious profile (IgM and IgG serologies for negative _Toxoplasma gondii_; negative cytomegalovirus; negative Epstein–Barr; negative hepatitis A, B, and C studies; nonreactive HIV ELISA; and nonreactive VDRL), and biomarkers (positive Coombs test). The patient was considered to have Evans syndrome, and treatment with immunoglobulin was suggested, 2 g/kg/total dose, with a partial response and subsequently a steroid cycle with prednisolone, a dose of 1 mg/kg/day initially with programmed titration until suspended. Outpatient follow-up was carried out for 6 months after discharge, and the patient was discharged due to pediatric hemato-oncology and rheumatology. Clinical improvement was documented with supervision of the described condition without relapse on cytopenia and nonadministration of the oral steroid.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】The first description of Evans syndrome was made in 1951 by Robert Evans, who studied 24 patients with ages between 3 and 78 years \\[7, 8\\]. This disease consists of the combination of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombopenia and less usual, immune neutropenia (between 15 and 55%) and can be classified as primary or secondary \\[9–14\\]. Its etiology is unknown and among the possible causes it is the dysregulation of the immune system which leads to the production of IL-10 and interferon gamma, leading to activation of Autoreactive T Lymphocytes and production of autoantibodies by B lymphocytes \\[11, 13, 15\\].\n\n【17】In the literature review, reports of dengue hemolytic anemia cases are considered to be of low prevalence. These reports are about adult patients. In the description by Aye et al., it is reported a male patient who develops hemolytic anemia during the dengue recovery phase. This finding could be related to the severity of the disease and this etiological agent should be taken into account as a cause of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, so much that it is compared with Mycoplasma pneumoniae \\[12\\]. The case report by Kulkarni and Sharma describes a 52-year-old patient with Dengue and warning signs. Hemolytic anemia is subsequently documented with a positive Coombs test. In general, patients with dengue have anemia due to viral medullary aplasia and documented bleedings; having hemolytic anemia is considered an atypical manifestation of the disease \\[16\\].\n\n【18】Although the diagnostic criteria are clearly described, underreporting may take place in relation to the number of cases diagnosed and published since, in some situations, the direct Coomb's test may be negative. One reason is because in some commercial antiglobulin reagents, the IgG sensitization is below the detection threshold. Another cause is that if the optimal conditions are not found in the analytical phase, for example, if the preparatory wash is not carried out at 4°C or with a low ionic strength, the elimination of the low affinity IgG can be generated. As a third cause, sensitization of red blood cells with just one IgA or with low molecular weight (monomeric) IgM, not accompanied by complement fixation, may result in a negative test since a large variety of commercial antiglobulin reagents have only anti-IgG and anti-C3 \\[17\\].\n\n【19】Nowadays, treatment is based on immunomodulatory therapy schemes depending on the clinical conditions of the patient and comorbidities. The first line of treatment includes oral corticosteroids at a dose of 1-2 mg/kg/day and IV immunoglobulin at a dose of 2 g/kg/total dose; both options were used in this case for the management of cytopenia secondary to Evans syndrome. In severe cases, the use of steroids is recommended at initial doses of 4–6 mg/kg/day during the first 72 hours \\[18\\]. Although transfusions are not recommended due to the risk of exacerbation, they are only prescribed in cases of severe hemodynamic affection and risk of vital organ affection, as it is evidenced in our case \\[13\\]. The second line of management is the immunosuppressive drugs: azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, ofetil, vincristine, danazol, sirolimus, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab or surgical management with splenectomy, especially in patients with frequent relapses or in those who receive high doses of corticosteroid aimed at reducing doses and minimize their side effect \\[11, 14, 15\\]. In severe and refractory cases, hematopoietic stem cell transplant is considered \\[9, 13\\].\n\n【20】In the multicenter study published by the French group led by Aladjidi, conducted at the Bordeaux University Hospital, 156 patients were analyzed in 26 clinics during the period from 1981 to 2014. Given the characteristics of this cohort and the disease severity, azathioprine and rituximab were used as a second line of treatment \\[8\\].\n\n【21】About 50% of Evans syndrome cases are associated with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematous, lymphoproliferative diseases, and common variable immunodeficiency, with a higher prevalence in the pediatric population \\[8, 9\\]. Some immune deficiencies can occur with autoimmune manifestations without active infections; cases with immunological alterations have been documented in controls after the first-line management (steroids or immunoglobulin), proving the diagnosis of mainly humoral immunodeficiency \\[10, 14\\].\n\n【22】When faced with an endemic tropical disease in many regions with a wide spectrum of clinical and paraclinical manifestations and with a wide range of severe complications, we think it is important to identify unusual clinical patterns that require timely interventions to avoid definitive secondary injuries or fatal outcome. Until the date of completion of this paper, no case was found in the most important international, regional, and local databases describing the association between both diseases in pediatric patients; therefore, we consider this to be the first case reporting an association between dengue disease and Evans syndrome in a child.\n\n【23】#### Data Availability\n\n【24】The data can be accessed by searching the references included in the current case report.\n\n【25】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【26】The authors obtained an endorsement of the ethics committee in order to publish the data obtained from clinical record.\n\n【27】#### Consent\n\n【28】The authors obtained a written informed consent to publish the data collected from clinical record.\n\n【29】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【30】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.\n\n【31】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【32】The authors thank Uros Clinic and the entire staff of the pediatric intensive care unit.

The patient was a 67-year old man who received 70 Gy radiation therapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Eight years later, he suffered a pathological fracture of the right clavicle. One year after the fracture, surgical treatment was performed due to persistent pain and weakness. Radiographs demonstrated atrophic nonunion. Bone scan demonstrated hot uptake at both ends of the fractured bone. MRI demonstrated a formation of pseudoarthrosis with fluid collection and suggested bone marrow edema at both ends of the fracture fragments. In surgery, fibrous pseudoarthrosis tissue was excised and both ends of the fracture fragments were refreshed to identify bleeding. Open reduction and internal fixation using a 7-hole locking plate and autologous bone grafting were performed. Successful bony union was obtained 1 year postoperatively, and no adverse events were observed up to 52 months after the operation. Our case suggests that a locking plate provides sufficient fixation and autologous bone grafting is effective in enhancing bone healing in a radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle in which it is difficult to achieve bony union.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Radiation-induced complications in the mature bone include osteoradionecrosis, pathologic fracture, and radiation-induced neoplasms \\[1\\]. All types of cells can be injured or killed by radiation \\[1\\], and management of fractures caused by radiation is generally considered to be difficult due to the biologically inactive bone \\[2\\]. A high nonunion rate has been reported in the past literature \\[3, 4\\]. There are only two reports written in English that describe open reduction and internal fixation using a plate \\[5, 6\\]. Locking plate is a new technology, which provides excellent angular stability even in poor-quality bone, such as in osteoporosis patients, and can avoid the deterioration of periosteal circulation \\[7\\]. There has been no previous reports detailing the use of locking plate for the treatment of radiation-associated fractures of the clavicle. We report a case of radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle, which was treated by locking plate fixation and autologous bone grafting.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient gave the informed consent prior being included into the study. The patient was a 67-year old man who received 70 Gy radiation therapy for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. He received 20 Gy radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and 50 Gy to the supraclavicular fossa. He had concomitant hypothyroidism. He suffered osteoradionecrosis and osteomyelitis of the mandible and received hemimandibulectomy 6 years after the radiation therapy. He was also a smoker.\n\n【6】Eight years after the radiation therapy, he suffered a pathological fracture of the right clavicle without apparent trauma. The fracture was treated conservatively at an orthopaedic clinic; however, bony union was not obtained. The displacement increased over time, and he was referred to our hospital. One year after the fracture, surgical treatment was performed due to persistent pain and weakness.\n\n【7】Radiographs demonstrated atrophic nonunion with displacement (Figure 1). Bone scan demonstrated hot uptake at both ends of the fractured bone (Figure 2). MRI demonstrated a formation of pseudoarthrosis with fluid collection and suggested bone marrow edema at both ends of the fracture fragments (Figure 3).\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| Preoperative radiograph of the fractured right clavicle demonstrating atrophic nonunion. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】| Preoperative bone scan demonstrating hot uptake at both ends of the fractured bone. |\n| --- |\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】| Preoperative MRI STIR images demonstrating a formation of pseudoarthrosis with fluid collection and suggesting bone marrow edema at both ends of the fracture fragments. |\n| --- |\n\n【20】In surgery, fibrous pseudoarthrosis tissue was excised and both ends of the fracture fragments were refreshed to identify bleeding.

Three locking screws were inserted into both fragments to fix the fracture.

No further followup could be done due to the patient’s death.\n\n【26】  \n\n【27】  \n\n【28】Figure 5 \n\n【29】| One-year postoperative radiograph demonstrating successful bony union. |\n| --- |\n\n【30】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【31】Past reports suggest that fractures occur primarily with radiation doses >50 Gy \\[4, 8\\]. Our patient received 70 Gy radiation, and fracture occurred without apparent trauma; therefore, the fracture was diagnosed as a radiation-associated pathological fracture. Biopsy for pathology and culture are required for further investigation in these cases. The nonunion rate of radiation-associated fractures is reported as high at around 50%, and healing times tend to be long in fractures that eventually heal \\[3, 4\\]. The fracture developed atrophic nonunion radiographically. Difficulties in achieving bony union were predicted by the radiographic appearance. On the other hand, hot uptake at both ends of the fracture fragments was observed by a bone scan, and the finding suggested the existence of some biological bone activity. We hypothesized that the MRI finding of bone marrow edema suggested some biological bone activity even though the finding might be considered to show postirradiation change in the bone. However, because biological activity is considered to decrease as a result of radiation, we tried to achieve bony union by osteosynthesis with autologous bone grafting. If the bone activity was totally eliminated by radiation, vascularized bone graft should be necessary.\n\n【32】Due to the difficulty in obtaining bony union in radiation-associated fracture nonunions of the clavicle, past reports have recommended claviculectomy or resection of the pseudoarthrosis site \\[9, 10\\]. These procedures have been reported to be effective for pain relief and patient comfort. Only two clinical reports have described successful open reduction and internal fixation of radiation-associated clavicle fractures. Wera et al. reported on open reduction and internal fixation of radiation-associated clavicle fractures for 3 patients \\[5\\]. Two patients obtained bony union, and the remaining patient did not appear to achieve radiographic union but showed no loss of reduction at 28 months postoperatively. Fuchs et al. described the plate fixation and free vascularized corticoperiosteal bone graft for the treatment of radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle in two patients \\[6\\]. The fractures healed with good clinical results.\n\n【33】Wera et al. used autologous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest and demineralized bone matrix for the first patient, bone cement and allograft cancellous bone chips for the second patient, and demineralized bone matrix for the third patient as a void filler and enhancer of bone healing \\[5\\]. Fuchs et al. used a free vascularized corticoperiosteal bone graft from the medial femoral condyle to enhance bone healing \\[6\\]. We believe some supplementary bone healing enhancement is necessary and used autologous cancellous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest. Other tools enhancing bone healing, for example, bone morphogenetic proteins may also be useful; however, we consider that autologous bone grafting is better as it is osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive. Vascularized bone graft is also a good option; however, it is technically challenging. Our treatment result suggests that autologous cancellous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest is sufficient for bony union. If a nonvascularized bone grafting fails, a vascularized bone grafting may become salvage \\[11\\].\n\n【34】Locking plate is a new technology which provides excellent angular stability and also preserves biology \\[7\\]. Irradiated bone results in a decrease in the circulation to bone and bone quality. Therefore, we think fixation using locking plate is superior to conventional plate fixation in both the biological and mechanical aspects. Locking plate fixation is thought to be a good choice for surgical treatment of radiation-associated fracture/nonunion of the clavicle.\n\n【35】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【36】Our case suggests that a locking plate provides sufficient fixation and autologous bone grafting is effective in enhancing bone healing in a radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle in which it is difficult to achieve bony union.\n\n【37】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【38】The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This case report represents a unique case of using multiple spinal cord stimulators for widespread small fiber neuropathy pain. This case report concerns patient JJ who first presented with generalized neuropathic pain. His pain was an intermittent burning, stinging quality that originally focused in both of his feet and progressed to include his legs and arms and eventually involved his entire body. The pain would last moments to hours at least daily. He reported a poor quality of life. He was diagnosed with small fiber neuropathy with anhydrosis, suggestive of idiopathic erythromelalgia. He had a spinal cord stimulator trial involving both cervical and lower thoracic percutaneous leads. After two spinal cord stimulators were implanted, the patient began to report an improvement in pain. The patient continues to report excellent pain relief. The patient uses the stimulator intermittently as needed, in an abortive fashion for pain flares. The patient is very pleased and has increased his activity. He now attends graduate school full time. This case report hopes to illustrate a unique use of multiple spinal cord stimulators in treating widespread neuropathic pain caused by small fiber neuropathy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Neuromodulation has been classically defined by the International Neuromodulation Society as “the alteration of nerve activity through targeted delivery of a stimulus, such as electrical stimulation or chemical agents, to specific neurological sites in the body” \\[1\\] and spinal cord stimulation is a type of neuromodulation where epidural leads are placed in the body and attached to an implanted pulse generator to create a current that helps modify different types of neural signals. In our context, the desire is to decrease pain signaling.\n\n【4】Spinal cord stimulators (SCS) have been commonly used to treat multiple pain conditions including complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), failed laminectomy/failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), and severe low back pain refractory to other treatments \\[2\\]. Now as the use of spinal cord stimulators has increased so have the potential indications. Recently, SCS have been used to effectively treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy \\[3\\]. SCS has increasingly been used in various neuropathic pain syndromes when standard treatments had already failed \\[4\\]<sub>.</sub> SCS is already being used for small fiber neuropathy. In 2015, a retrospective study by Hayek et al. found that out of the 345 patients who underwent SCS trial, 18 patients had a SCS implanted for small fiber neuropathic pain \\[5\\]. Also, in 2017, Maino et al. described a case of a patient with small fiber neuropathy whose pain was treated successfully with spinal cord stimulation but that was using dorsal root ganglion stimulation and treating pain in only one limb (left foot) \\[6\\]. While these studies help to establish SCS as a reliable treatment for small fiber neuropathic pain, our case report hopes to illustrate a unique use of two SCS implants and four leads to treat whole body pain in a patient with small fiber neuropathy.\n\n【5】Small fiber neuropathy is a sensory neuropathy manifested usually by painful paresthesias, along with findings of abnormal small fiber nerve function seen on neurological examination, specialized electrodiagnostic testing, and/or pathological studies. Common etiologies include diabetes, B12 deficiency, metabolic disorders, and autoimmune disorders. It is commonly treated with medications such as antidepressants (TCAs and SSRIs), anticonvulsants, opioids, and topical capsaicin \\[7\\]. There are also case reports and studies of spinal cord stimulation being used to successfully treat small fiber neuropathic pain; few however have included dual implants with one set of leads and battery to treat the upper extremity pain and another set of leads and battery for the lower extremity.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Methods\n\n【7】This case report concerns patient JJ who first presented to a neurologist for generalized neuropathic pain in 2013. On August 7, 2013, patient JJ was a twenty-year-old male and visited neurology for the first time that day. He had already suffered numbness and tingling in his feet with sharp stinging pain that had progressed into his legs, hands, arms, trunk, and face. The pain started about a year earlier. His triggers included heat and physical activity and lifting things for a long period of time or high intensity short bursts of activity would cause the pain. Pain episodes would also happen while he was sleeping and wake him up. At that point, he had already tried gabapentin, pregabalin, and escitalopram and he was on buprenorphine and fentanyl patches with still no relief. An MRI of his brain and cervical spine were normal.\n\n【8】The neurologist stated that the history was suggestive of small fiber neuropathy but that other differentials had to be ruled out. A NCS/EMG, skin biopsy, and multiple labs were ordered. The NCS showed no evidence of large fiber neuropathy and the other labs helped to rule out other differential causes. Quantitative sudomotor axon reflex testing (QSART) showed reduced sweat volumes at all sites with a non-length dependent reduction providing evidence of non-length dependent painful small fiber neuropathy. The neurologist determined that JJ had small fiber neuropathy with anhydrosis, suggestive of idiopathic erythromelalgia. A trial of prednisolone was attempted but patient had no relief of pain. By this time, patient JJ stopped the buprenorphine and fentanyl patches and had no relief with other medications including carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or duloxetine. JJ began to report a poor quality of life. He felt unable to go to any uncontrolled environments due to the severe episodes of sharp debilitating pain. He, along with his family, was becoming desperate for other pain relief options. His neurologist referred the patient to the UTHSCSA pain management consultants for more options.\n\n【9】On January 27, 2014, JJ presented to our pain clinic for the first time. At that point, we considered JJ to have diffuse episodic neuropathic pain that occurred at least daily and had an unclear etiology. We discussed the various options with the patient including infusion therapy, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, and spinal cord stimulation. After that initial visit, the patient and family elected to try other pharmacologic options, including orphenadrine, dextromethorphan, and mexiletine. The patient also received two ketamine infusions: 150 mg over one hour on 04/17/2014 and 360 mg over one hour on 09/04/2014. During this time, the patient was still receiving work-up including being referred for whole exome sequencing but no abnormality was found in the relevant genes. JJ wanted to try a lidocaine infusion before SCS so he received a lidocaine infusion on 11/12/15. Unfortunately, the lidocaine infusions like all the previous therapies did not offer him much pain relief. On November 2015, JJ began to seriously consider SCS therapy and eventually agreed to a SCS trial. Due to his pain pattern with bilateral upper and lower extremity pain, the decision was made to try both cervical and thoracic leads.\n\n【10】On February 9, 2016, our clinic performed a SCS trial with one lead tip ending at the top of the T8 vertebral body level and a second lead tip at the top of the C3 vertebral body level. JJ had a great response with the trial and wanted to move on to implantation.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【12】On March 22, 2016, JJ had two SCS generators and two cervical and two thoracic leads implanted in conjunction with neurosurgeon Dr. Papanastassiou (Figures 1 and 2).\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 1 \n\n【16】Two 8-contact epidural leads lying in their final position in the mid-thoracic spine.\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Figure 2 \n\n【20】Two 8-contact epidural leads from the spinal cord stimulator lying in their final position in the cervical spine.\n\n【21】After the two spinal cord stimulators and generators were implanted, the patient began to report an improvement in pain. This stimulation was tonic and paresthesia based. The patient continued to report excellent pain relief six months after implantation. Within six months, patient had 100% abolition of pain in his extremities and lower body half while using stimulation. This represented about 90% of his overall pain. The stimulation covered his arms, his waist down to his legs, and most of his trunk with one small gap. The patient uses the stimulator intermittently as needed, in an abortive fashion for pain flares. JJ had had no complaints of autonomic or erythromelalgia symptoms.\n\n【22】The patient was extremely pleased and increased his activity. He is no longer taking any analgesic or antiepileptic medications. He is able to ride his scooter and wear a backpack and now attends graduate school full time.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Plenty of discussion and research has been done on treatment of FBSS, CRPS, and axial low back pain through neuromodulation but very little literature exists about the possible role of neuromodulation and specifically SCS in the treatment of small fiber neuropathy.\n\n【25】Patient JJ had a long and complicated medical course and underwent over three years of medical testing, including numerous imaging studies as well as invasive tests like skin biopsies. Earlier neuromodulation intervention could have saved him years of suffering. It is debatable whether the implantation of the two batteries is cost-effective. However, it is clear that neuromodulation has done more for the patient’s refractory pain than any other treatment while also avoiding the risks associated with medications and side effects. In addition, JJ’s use of spinal cord stimulation in an abortive manner is a unique use of the therapy. Typically, patients have their SCS on throughout the day, changing modes as needed, but JJ seemed to only need SCS before attacks to prevent them or during attacks to stop them.\n\n【26】This case report indicates a small sample of what is possible with neuromodulation and the emerging role neuromodulation can play in addressing atypical and neuropathic pain conditions. As previously stated, SCS is already being used for diabetic and small fiber neuropathy pain. In 2015, a retrospective study by Hayek et al. found that, out of the 345 patients who underwent SCS trial, 18 patients had a SCS implanted for small fiber neuropathic pain \\[5\\]. Also, in 2017, Maino et al. described a case report of a patient with small fiber neuropathy whose pain was treated successfully with spinal cord stimulation but that was using dorsal root ganglion stimulation and treating pain in only one limb (left foot) \\[6\\]. While the Hayek et al. study and Maino et al. case report help to establish SCS as a known treatment for small fiber neuropathic pain, our case report hopes to illustrate a unique use of multiple spinal cord stimulators in treating widespread neuropathic pain caused by small fiber neuropathy \\[5, 6\\].\n\n【27】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【28】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【29】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【30】The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of the entire Westgate Pain Clinic team, including Dr. Sameer Solimon.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors that resemble developing skeletal muscle. There have been case reports of patients with concurrent SLCT and RMS with limited treatment options. We aim to demonstrate treatment strategies used in our patients, which seemed to have prolonged survival when compared to prior case reports of patients not cured by surgical resection. Herein we describe 22 cases of SLCT with RMS elements as discussed in prior case reports and three cases from the authors’ institution. Of the 19 cases from prior case reports, five were lost to follow-up and two had NED after surgical intervention. Eleven patients had recurrence and were deceased within one year. Of those patients not surgically cured, only three patients were documented as living beyond two years, all of whom received chemotherapy. The three patients presented from our institution had clinical evidence of response to chemotherapy that is traditionally used for RMS. In conclusion, chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide has activity in patients with SLCT and RMS as does salvage chemotherapy with vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide.\n\n【2】* * *\n\n【3】Sertoli-Leydig Cell Tumors (SLCTs), also known as arrhenoblastomas, make up <0.5–1% of all ovarian tumors and are benign or malignant, androgen-secreting tumors originating from the ovarian stromal sex cords \\[1\\]. In up to half of cases, SLCT can be associated with signs of virilization, such as hirsutism and amenorrhea, and SLCTs occur more often in women of reproductive age \\[1, 2\\]. There are five histological subtypes of SLCT as follows: well differentiated, intermediate differentiation, poorly differentiated, retiform, and heterologous or mixed \\[3–5\\]. Twenty percent of SLCTs are variants with heterologous elements, which are mostly benign gastrointestinal epithelium, but 5% of SLCTs contain heterologous mesenchymal elements \\[4\\]. Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality to identify adnexal masses. Serum levels of AFP and _β_\\-hCG may be elevated in patients with SLTC \\[2\\]. SLTC immunocytochemical characterization is positive for testosterone and estradiol of the Sertoli and Leydig cells \\[1\\]. A mutation of the DICER1 gene has been associated with SLCTs in up to 63% of patients, and patients with this mutation should be screened for thyroid disease \\[6, 7\\]. The immunohistochemical testing of antibodies against alpha-inhibin and myogenin is needed to diagnose rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and accurately grade the SLCT \\[8\\]. The TMN and FIGO stages are listed in Table 1. The treatment and prognosis of SLCT depend on the patient’s age, tumor stage, and degree of tumor differentiation \\[1, 2\\]. Various types of surgery with or without adjuvant chemotherapy are the primary treatment modalities for treatment of SLCT \\[2\\]. Malignant SLCT ten-year survival rates are approximately 87% for intermediate differentiation and 41% for poor differentiation \\[9\\].\n\n【4】Table 1 \n\n【5】TMN and FIGO classifications for ovarian tumors \\[23, 24\\].\n\n【6】Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a heterogeneous group of malignant tumors that resemble developing skeletal muscle \\[10–12\\]. These tumors are 1.4 times more common in males without differences among races or ethnic groups \\[13\\]. RMS is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood, and common sites of primary disease include the head and neck area, genitourinary tract, and extremities \\[10, 11\\]. Most cases of RMS appear to be sporadic, but the disease has been associated with familial syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and neurofibromatosis \\[10\\]. There are two histologic subtypes of RMS, embryonal and alveolar; Alveolar RMS is more aggressive with small, round cells while embryonal RMS has a more favorable prognosis with spindle-shaped cells with a stromal-rich appearance \\[10, 11, 14\\]. Embryonal variants include leiomyomatous RMS that is predominantly of paratesticular origin and the botryoid variant with subepithelial aggregates of tumor cells known as the cambium layer \\[14\\]. Sarcoma botryoides can arise from the mucosal surfaces of the cervix, bladder, or vagina \\[15\\]. Radiologic evaluation of RMS should include CT scan or MRI of the primary and surrounding structures. Treatment approaches to RMS incorporate chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery based on risk stratification. Complete surgical resection is considered if it will not be cosmetically damaging. The five-year overall survival rate for adults with RMS is approximately 27% \\[16\\].\n\n【7】The association between cervical sarcoma botryoides and ovarian SCLT has been described in at least eight patients from prior case reports \\[15, 17–22\\]. Adjuvant ifosfamide and epiadriamycin were used in one of these patients who had recurrence of uterine disease after 6 years, and conservative polypectomy was encouraged by some authors \\[20\\]. A genetic linkage to abnormalities on chromosome 12 was suggested by one paper \\[19\\]. One patient with concurrently diagnosed pleuropulmonary blastoma and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the cervix had a DICER1 germline mutation \\[21\\]. This patient was treated with vincristine, actinomycin, and cyclophosphamide with recurrence of SLCT 7 years later \\[21\\].\n\n【8】Herein, we report three cases of patients with ovarian SLCT with RMS components. To our knowledge, there have been cases reported in literature with limited treatment options. We aim to demonstrate treatment strategies used in our patients, which seemed to have prolonged their lives when compared to prior case reports of patients not cured by surgical resection, in order to provide treatment options for clinicians treating patients with these concurrent rare malignancies.\n\n【9】Patient 1 was a 32-year-old Caucasian female noted to have a left sided ovarian mass on CT scan after presenting for left lower quadrant abdominal pain. She was status post resection and pathology was consistent with stage Ia poorly differentiated SLCT. Five months later, recurrent pains lead to a trans-vaginal US that showed a right pelvic mass. She underwent radical hysterectomy and debulking procedure that showed pathology consistent with recurrent poorly differentiated SLCT with heterologous RMS. A follow-up PET scan showed uptake bilaterally in the pelvis. A month later, she was started on doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and vincristine. She was hospitalized for a small bowel obstruction with stable metastatic abdominal nodules on CT. She received cycle 2 doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and vincristine while hospitalized and had a palliative PEG placed. Her chemotherapy was changed to ifosfamide and etoposide because of mucositis and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia. After a total of 6 cycles of chemotherapy, she was found to be in complete clinical remission by CT. Approximately 10 months later, CT showed a liver lesion and pelvic mass consistent with recurrent poorly differentiated SLCT on repeat biopsy with no RMS elements seen. She was given 3 cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP). Bleomycin was held for cycles 4 through 8 due to side effects. A follow-up PET showed stable disease. Three months later, she was found to have a left lower quadrant mass consistent with recurrent SLCT at which point radiation therapy was given with good response with only a small amount of residual disease. Eight months later, a biopsy of a liver lesion was consistent with recurrent SLCT with no definitive RMS identified. She underwent further radiation with stable disease for approximately five months before repeat imaging showed marked disease progression with symptoms that lead to hospice care. The time from diagnosis until death was approximately four years.\n\n【10】Patient 2 was a 30-year-old, black female with a left sided ovarian mass found incidentally during a cesarean section that was initially called a granulosa tumor on pathology but later deemed SLCT with focal poor differentiation when reviewed. At the time of initial diagnosis she was thought to have stage IA disease that was cured surgically. She was lost to follow-up for 13 months at which time a follow-up CT showed a right sided ovarian mass that increased on serial imaging. Surgery for recurrence revealed a left adnexal mass, left pelvic sidewall, cul-de-sac, and anterior abdominal wall nodules with pathology consistent with high-grade sarcoma ultimately deemed embryonal RMS consistent with recurrence of the poorly differentiated SLCT. Two months later, she was started on doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and vincristine for a total of 6 cycles with follow-up CT showing NED. A repeat CT performed 7 months after chemotherapy completion showed an increasing pelvic mass that was resected. Pathology was consistent with recurrent SLCT with RMS, and a liver mass was discovered during surgery that was not seen on CT scan. She was started on salvage chemotherapy for RMS with vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide for a total of 6 cycles. Follow-up CT after cycle 4 showed NED. The patient developed massive progression 5 months after her last cycle of chemotherapy with small bowel obstruction requiring debulking surgery with colostomy placement and ultimately hospice care. The time span from diagnosis until death was approximately 3.5 years.\n\n【11】Patient 3 was a 23-year-old female who presented with nausea and vomiting with an US showing a right ovarian mass. She underwent exploratory laparotomy with debulking and removal of a large abdominal pelvic mass with a right salpingo-oophorectomy (RSO) and appendectomy. Pathology was consistent with stage IA poorly differentiated SLCT with some elements of RMS, and she was found to have a DICER1 mutation. She underwent 6 cycles of doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and vincristine and is currently NED on follow-up imaging approximately 10 months after chemotherapy was initiated.\n\n【12】In one case report, a patient with SLCT of intermediate differentiation and RMS of FIGO stage 1C was treated with surgery alone and remained with no evidence of disease (NED) at four years after surgery \\[8\\]. These authors report two similar case reports with SLCT of intermediate differentiation and RMS where one patient was found to have NED at ten months after unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (USO) for stage IA disease while another patient with capsular invasion was initially treated with oophorectomy alone but had reoccurrences at months six and ten, at which time she was treated with unspecified adjuvant chemotherapy \\[8, 25, 26\\].\n\n【13】Another case report describes a patient who after a unilateral oophorectomy was found to have an SLCT with focal rhabdomyoblastic differentiation, and she developed an omental mass with features consistent with high-grade sarcoma one year later. She underwent further surgery with a plan for adjuvant chemotherapy but was lost to follow-up \\[27\\]. Chougule et al. report a case where ovarian SLCT with RMS and borderline mucinous neoplasm was found in a 26-year-old patient after USO but no further information on treatment or follow-up was provided \\[28\\].\n\n【14】Zaloudek and Norris described a 16-year-old patient with stage Ia poorly differentiated SLCT with RMS elements who was treated with USO and later thiotepa and 5-fluorouracil after recurrence at 1.4 years. She was found to have peritoneal metastases on autopsy after her death four months later \\[29\\].\n\n【15】The most recent case report of SLCT with RMS elements describes a 70-year-old patient who was diagnosed with stage Ia disease and underwent hysterectomy with left salpingo-oophorectomy (LSO), appendectomy, and omentectomy without evidence of macroscopic disease after the procedures. At 7 months postoperatively, she represented with a large abdominal mass, ascites, unilateral hydronephrosis, and a massive pulmonary embolism. She was treated palliatively and died 15 days later without subsequent autopsy performance \\[30\\].\n\n【16】The largest number of case reports was presented by Prat et al. who document nine cases of SLCT with skeletal muscle elements. With one exception, all of these subjects were initially treated with surgery alone. Of those with available information, all subjects had recurrence within one year of initial treatment. Most subjects had recurrence surgically treated and most were deceased within one year. For full information on these subjects, see Table 2 \\[31\\].\n\n【17】Table 2 \n\n【18】Summary of cases of patients with SLCT and with RMS elements.\n\n【19】_Discussion_. Herein we describe 19 cases of SLCT with RMS elements as discussed in prior case reports as well as three cases from the authors’ institution. Of these 19 cases, five were lost to follow-up and two were documented as being NED after surgical intervention alone. Of the remaining cases, eleven patients had recurrence within one year and five of these patients were deceased within that year. Of those patients not surgically cured, only three patients were documented as living beyond two years, and all three of these patients received chemotherapy.\n\n【20】In patients with RMS, chemotherapy regimens considered in recurrent disease include vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide; ifosfamide and etoposide; and vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide \\[32, 33\\]. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy regimens include cisplatin based combinations with etoposide/bleomycin or etoposide/ifosfamide \\[6\\]. The three patients presented from our institution with concurrent SLCT and RMS all had clinical evidence of response to chemotherapy that is traditionally used for RMS on follow-up imaging. In conclusion, chemotherapy with doxorubicin and ifosfamide has activity in patients with concurrent SLCT and RMS as does salvage chemotherapy with vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide.\n\n【21】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【22】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Carotid body tumors classically cause splaying of internal and external carotid arteries demonstrating the Lyre sign on imaging. Also interestingly, both of these cases were seen in younger ages and include cervical sympathetic chain schwannoma and vagal schwannoma. However, these schwannomas revealed hypovascularity on imaging studies allowing differentiation from hypervascular carotid body tumors. Preoperative distinction between carotid body tumors and schwannomas is very important.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Carotid body tumors, cervical sympathetic chain schwannomas, and vagal schwannomas have common location in neck that is the retrostyloid compartment of parapharyngeal space \\[1–3\\]. Among these, vagal schwannomas are most common followed by carotid body tumors \\[1, 3\\]. Various imaging features had been described to differentiate them, which consist of typical displacement pattern of adjacent vessels and internal vascularity. This case report includes two histopathologically proven rare cases of cervical sympathetic schwannoma and vagal schwannoma having similar vascular displacement pattern as that of carotid body tumor. However, both of these tumors revealed hypovascularity on imaging unlike hypervascular carotid body tumors.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case One\n\n【5】An 18-year-old female was referred to the otolaryngology department with a swelling on the left side of the neck since 4 months. On examination, nonpulsatile mass near angle of the left mandible was seen. Cranial nerve examination was normal. Doppler ultrasonography revealed hypoechoic mass in the left carotid space showing mild peripheral vascularity (Figure 1). Computed tomography of the neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing hypodense mass in the left carotid space causing splaying of carotid bifurcation (Figures 2 and 3). On MRI examination, the mass was predominantly hypointense on T1- and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (Figures 4 and 5). Also MR angiography confirmed splaying of external and internal carotid vessels on the left side (Figure 6). The patient underwent surgery. At surgery encapsulated mass was found at the carotid bifurcation extending posteriorly which was separated by blunt dissection from carotid vessels. Vagal and glossopharyngeal nerves were separately seen from the mass. At surgery, the tumor was easily peeled off from carotid and jugular vessels without significant bleeding. Histopathology confirmed diagnosis of cervical sympathetic chain schwannoma with distinct Antoni A areas (Figure 7). Postoperatively patient developed Horner’s syndrome on the left side which recovered 3 months after surgery.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】| The Doppler ultrasonography of neck reveals a heterogeneous predominantly hypoechoic mass on the left carotid space showing mild peripheral vascularity. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 2 \n\n【13】| Computed tomography of the neck shows a heterogeneously enhancing hypodense mass on the left carotid space causing splaying of carotid bifurcation. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】  \n\n【16】Figure 3 \n\n【17】| Computed tomography of the neck shows heterogeneously enhancing hypodense mass in left carotid space causing splaying of carotid bifurcation. |\n| --- |\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】  \n\n【20】Figure 4 \n\n【21】| T1-weighted MR image reveals isointense mass on the left carotid space. |\n| --- |\n\n【22】  \n\n【23】  \n\n【24】Figure 5 \n\n【25】| T2-weighted MR image shows hyperintense mass with central cystic component. |\n| --- |\n\n【26】  \n\n【27】  \n\n【28】Figure 6 \n\n【29】| MR angiography image is showing splaying of external and internal carotid vessels on the left side. |\n| --- |\n\n【30】  \n\n【31】  \n\n【32】Figure 7 \n\n【33】| Histopathology slide of the surgical specimen is consistent with diagnosis of Antoni A schwannoma. |\n| --- |\n\n【34】#### 3\\. Case Two\n\n【35】A 17-year-old female came with history of painless swelling on the left side of the neck and change in voice since 2 months. On examination, there was nontender swelling noted posterior to the angle of the left mandible. USG neck revealed hypoechoic mass on the left parapharyngeal space showing mild vascularity on the Doppler study (Figure 8). On CT scan, large heterogeneous predominantly isodense to hypodense mass was seen in the left parapharyngeal space showing mild heterogeneous contrast enhancement (Figure 9). Mass was seen insinuating between internal and external carotid arteries with resultant splaying of internal and external carotid arteries (Figure 10). Digital subtraction angiography revealed hypovascular mass causing splaying of internal and external carotid arteries (Figure 11). The patient underwent surgery. Intraoperatively, tumour was seen arising from the left vagus nerve and was separating internal and external carotid arteries. On histopathology, mass was proven to be vagal schwannoma (Figure 12).\n\n【36】  \n\n【37】  \n\n【38】Figure 8 \n\n【39】| On USG neck, hypoechoic mass is seen on the left parapharyngeal space showing mild vascularity on Doppler study. |\n| --- |\n\n【40】  \n\n【41】  \n\n【42】Figure 9 \n\n【43】| On CT scan, neck with contrast reveals a predominantly isodense mass on the left parapharyngeal space showing mild heterogeneous contrast enhancement.

Discussion\n\n【57】Vagal schwannomas, carotid body tumours and cervical sympathetic chain schwannomas are the most common tumours of the retrostyloid parapharyngeal space \\[1, 2\\]. Carotid body tumors are rare neoplasms, although they represent about 65% of head and neck paragangliomas \\[1, 2\\]. These tumors are derived from embryonic neural crest cells and arise in the chemoreceptoric, nonchromaffine paraganglia at carotid bifurcation \\[1–3\\]. Epidemiologically they are common in young people, with female preponderance \\[2, 4\\]. Since these tumours are located at carotid bifurcation they typically cause splaying of internal and external carotid arteries which can be assessed with CT, MRI, Digital subtraction angiography and ultrasound colour Doppler \\[1\\]. This characteristic feature of carotid body tumors helps to distinguish it from other retro styloid pharyngeal mass lesions \\[1\\]. Carotid body tumours are hypervascular and enhance intensely on contrast enhanced CT and MRI scans \\[1\\].\n\n【58】Schwannomas or neurilemomas, are derived from schwann cells. They are common in middle age with female preponderance \\[1–3\\]. In the parapharyngeal space, common sites of the origin of schwannomas are the vagus nerve and the sympathetic chain. Anatomically, vagus nerve is situated within the carotid sheath posterior to the internal carotid artery. As a result, vagal schwannomas typically displace internal carotid artery anteriorly and medially \\[1, 3, 5, 6\\]. Cervical sympathetic chain is situated along medial and posterior borders of the carotid sheath, so cervical sympathetic chain schwannomas usually displace internal carotid artery anteriorly \\[1, 3\\]. On CT and MRI, both vagal and cervical sympathetic chain schwannomas are hypodense or isodense to the muscles and may have internal cystic areas. Usually, these tumors are hypovascular and show mild contrast enhancement \\[1–3\\]. However, sometimes, these tumors also tend to be hypervascular and can show moderate heterogeneous enhancement \\[1\\]. On MRI, these masses are hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images \\[1\\].\n\n【59】Preoperative diagnosis is very important in these retrostyloid parapharyngeal masses as management of carotid body tumors varies from surgery to radiation to observation, while complete surgical excision is the therapy of choice in vagal and cervical sympathetic schwannomas \\[2\\]. Also, risk of intraoperative hemorrhage is high in carotid body tumors. In carotid body tumor surgery is preferred in younger patients, and radiation is reserved for the elderly or unresectable cases \\[2\\].\n\n【60】Both of the described tumors displayed splaying of external and internal carotid arteries on CT contrast study, MRI, and DSA which was also confirmed at surgery. However both of these tumors demonstrated mild vascularity on the Doppler USG, CT, and DSA.\n\n【61】Although characteristic vascular displacement, that is, splaying of carotid bifurcation helps to distinguish carotid body tumor from other retrostyloid parapharyngeal masses, similar vascular displacement can be seen in vagal and cervical sympathetic chain schwannomas. So, this imaging pitfall should be taken into account while considering differential diagnosis of retrostyloid parapharyngeal tumors.\n\n【62】Both of these tumors showed hypovascularity, hence favor schwannomas rather than carotid body tumors. Internal vascularity and enhancement characteristics of the tumor should be given more importance while differentiating schwannomas from carotid body tumors. Hence enhancement pattern is the imaging pearl in differentiating carotid body tumors from schwannomas.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Case report followed by a retrospective review of 1000 MR imaging studies of the foot for the presence or absence of a bipartite medial cuneiform. _Results_. The incidence of the bipartite medial cuneiform is 0.1%. _Conclusion_. A bipartite medial cuneiform is a rare finding but one with both clinical and surgical implications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The bipartite medial cuneiform is a rare tarsal developmental variant at the Lisfranc joint that was first described in 1942 \\[1, 2\\]. Prior case reports have described how this rare anomaly could impact clinical care, either as a source of unexplained chronic midfoot pain or as a potential for misdiagnosis as a fracture in the setting of midfoot trauma \\[3–6\\].\n\n【4】We present a case report of a Lisfranc fracture in a patient with a bipartite medial cuneiform, an association that has not yet been described in the literature. Our case furthered exemplifies how knowledge of the bipartite medial cuneiform plays a role in both conservative and surgical treatment. Additionally, as we have encountered this anomaly only very rarely, we sought to determine the prevalence of the bipartite medial cuneiform with a retrospective review of 1,000 consecutive magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Materials/Method\n\n【6】The clinical and imaging findings of a patient with a Lisfranc fracture with a bipartite medial cuneiform were reviewed. This case led to a retrospective, cross-sectional, observation study that was approved by the Institutional Review Board with waiver of informed consent. One thousand MR imaging scans of the foot that were performed at our institution from January of 2007 to February of 2013 were reviewed. The typical MR imaging protocol included axial T1, axial proton density (fat sat), sagittal T1, sagittal T2 fast spin echo (fat sat), coronal T1, coronal T2 fast spin echo (fat sat) and coronal proton density (fat sat) sequences. Patients were selected on the basis of availability of MR imaging scans for review. Exclusion criteria were lack of available images (off-site storage) or artifacts due to excessive motion or metal. The findings in the case report were reviewed in consensus by a radiology resident (Geraldine Chang) and fellowship trained musculoskeletal radiologist (Eric Y. Chang, two years of experience) and thereafter the remainder of the MR images in the retrospective review were reviewed by the radiology resident (Geraldine Chang). Age and biological sex were also recorded.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【8】##### 3.1. Case Report\n\n【9】A 31-year-old man presented to the emergency department after a skateboarding accident. The patient stated that he twisted his left foot and struck the dorsum of the foot against a curb. Pain was localized to his midfoot and worsened with weight bearing. Patient also reported a feeling of foot instability.\n\n【10】Physical examination revealed ecchymosis and edema on the dorsum of the left foot. There was extreme tenderness throughout the Lisfranc articulation, but mostly in the region of the first and second rays. Overall, alignment of the foot was within normal limits. Range of motion of the ankle was preserved. Motor strength was decreased secondary to discomfort. Intact sensation and brisk capillary refill were also noted.\n\n【11】Radiographs, computed tomography (CT) images, and MR images (refer to Figures 1 and 2) revealed a Lisfranc injury in the setting of a bipartite medial cuneiform. MR images demonstrated the attachment site of the plantar Lisfranc ligament to the plantar segment of the medial cuneiform and the attachment site of the Lisfranc ligament proper and dorsal Lisfranc ligament to the dorsal segment of the medial cuneiform. Orthopedic consultation was obtained and patient underwent operative exploration, which demonstrated a dislocation of the first and second tarsometatarsal joints and a comminuted fracture of the medial and intermediate cuneiforms. Patient underwent open treatment with internal fixation.\n\n【12】  \n**(a)**\n\n【13】  \n**(b)**\n\n【14】  \n**(c)**\n\n【15】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【16】Figure 1 \n\n【17】| (a) Axial CT images at the level of the midfoot show a Lisfranc fracture of the medial cuneiform.

Subjects’ age ranged from 17 to 92 years with a mean age of 45 years. There were 803 male and 197 female subjects. There was a 0.1% incidence of the bipartite medial cuneiform based on our review of 1000 MR imaging studies of the ankle.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【24】The bipartite medial cuneiform is a rare tarsal developmental variant at the Lisfranc joint \\[1, 2\\]. Differentiating this osseous variation from a fracture is important to both clinicians and radiologists. In addition, the bipartite medial cuneiform can be a potential source for nontraumatic or traumatic midfoot pain, and knowledge of this entity can play a role in both conservative and surgical treatment. A previous anthropologic population study in 1942 found this anomaly to occur in approximately 0.3% of persons \\[2\\]. A case series and literature review by Elias et al. described the MR imaging features of the bipartite medial cuneiform \\[3\\]. To our knowledge, however, our case report is the first to show a Lisfranc fracture in the setting of a bipartite medial cuneiform. These findings prompted a retrospective review to determine the frequency of the bipartite medial cuneiform based on MR imaging.\n\n【25】The bipartition of the medial cuneiform is a malsegmentation defect of the foot characterized by separation of the normal cuneiform into dorsal and plantar segments due to the presence of two primary ossification centers \\[1, 3, 6–9\\]. It is the failure of fusion of these two ossicles that results in a bipartite medial configuration. The ossification process in this bone begins in the second to third year of life \\[4, 7–9\\]. In many cases, these segments are held together by means of a cartilaginous or fibrocartilaginous bridge.\n\n【26】In this anomaly, the cuneiform bone is divided horizontally by a synchondrosis, partitioning the medial cuneiform into plantar and dorsal segments. The plantar ossicle is typically larger than the dorsal ossicle \\[2, 3\\]. The tibialis anterior tendon attaches to the proximal superomedial aspect of the dorsal segment. The posterior tibialis tendon attaches to the distal inferolateral portion of the plantar segment. The peroneus longus tendon attaches to the proximal inferomedial and distal inferolateral portions of the plantar segment. The Lisfranc ligament proper (interosseous portion) and the dorsal Lisfranc ligament extend from the dorsal segment of the bipartite medial cuneiform to insert into the base of the second metatarsal. The plantar Lisfranc ligament extends from the plantar segment of the bipartite medial cuneiform \\[3, 10\\].\n\n【27】Based on our review of the literature, the bipartite medial cuneiform is generally an incidental finding but one that rarely can be symptomatic \\[5, 6, 10\\]. Chiodo et al. reported a patient who failed conservative treatment, demonstrating that surgical excision may be indicated \\[5\\]. Therefore, it is important for radiologists and clinicians to keep bipartition of the bone in mind when evaluating acute or chronic midfoot pain.\n\n【28】In the setting of trauma, it is important to differentiate a bipartite medial cuneiform from a fracture \\[11\\]. The bipartite articulation is best visualized on a 30-degree external oblique radiograph of the foot. The site of partition should demonstrate smooth, well corticated margins, and the two portions of the bipartite cuneiform together are larger than the expected normal or fractured medial cuneiform. In addition, all cases of a bipartite medial cuneiform demonstrate bipartition along the long axis of the foot, and this orientation is uncommon for a fracture. Furthermore, with MR imaging, an asymptomatic bipartite medial cuneiform should not have been associated with bone marrow edema. Due to the well-defined joint space between the base of the first metatarsal and the distal portion of the medial bipartite cuneiform as well as between the two bipartite portions, a “E” joint space configuration is demonstrated on MR imaging in the sagittal plane, the so-called E-sign \\[3, 12\\].\n\n【29】We are the first to report a Lisfranc fracture in the setting of this anomaly. Our patient had both CT and MR imaging. The Lisfranc ligament proper and the plantar Lisfranc ligament attached to different portions of the bipartitioned bone. In our case, both ossicles were fractured and the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation.\n\n【30】To our knowledge, our series is the only one to date dealing with the frequency of the bipartite medial cuneiform in persons undergoing MR imaging. In our retrospective review of 1000 patients, we found a 0.1% incidence, which is lower than that reported in anthropological studies.\n\n【31】There are limitations to our study. Our subjects included an uneven distribution of male and female subjects. In addition, the age range of our subject population was 17–92 with the exclusion of the pediatric population. Further studies that include a more diverse patient population with more female and pediatric subjects are required to validate our findings. However, the reported incidence in the literature of a bipartite medial cuneiform bone has ranged from 0.3% to 2.4% in cadaveric studies \\[3\\]. Our study confirms that the bipartite medial cuneiform is, in fact, very rare.\n\n【32】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【33】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.\n\n【34】#### Acknowledgment\n\n【35】Eric Y.

Traumatic and iatrogenic disruption of the limited blood flow to the distal end of the humerus resulting in avascular necrosis of capitellum or trochlea is a major pitfall of the this technically challenging procedure. Two cases are presented which illustrate the potential problems of intra-articular osteotomy for malunion of the distal humerus.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Distal humerus fractures are uncommon, accounting for only 2 percent of all fractures \\[1\\]. Open reduction and internal fixation to restore articular anatomy and allow early motion to prevent stiffness \\[2\\] is the preferred treatment \\[3, 4\\]. Despite rapid improvements in operative management, fractures of the distal end of the humerus are still among the most difficult fractures to treat. Complex articular anatomy with little cancellous bone support makes operative fixation challenging \\[1\\]. Although challenging, in young active patients early fixation is recommended, despite the complexity of the fracture. An unsatisfactory outcome is common for this patient population when minimal treatment is used to treat the initial fracture \\[5, 6\\].\n\n【4】In the rare case of malunion, intra-articular or supracondylar osteotomy to restore humeral alignment and provide a more useful arc of motion is legitimate. In the case of an extra-articular osteotomy to correct flexion or extension alignment, treatment can be indicated despite the presence of posttraumatic arthrosis of an incongruent elbow joint. However, intra-articular osteotomy treatment is only considered when the patient is seen early and secondary post-traumatic arthritis is at an early stage \\[1, 6\\].\n\n【5】Intra-articular corrective osteotomy for malunited fractures of the distal humerus is technically demanding and the literature on this subject scarce \\[6–9\\]. This manuscript documents surgical technique and reports on a case of intra-articular osteotomy for distal humerus malunion.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】Our patient was a 48-year-old dentist who was seen 10 months after a high energy fall that resulted in a complex type C3 intra-articular fracture of her left nondominant distal humerus (Figure 1(a)). Initial treatment performed at an outside institution consisted of static external fixation with the arm in flexion and the forearm in neutral rotation (Figure 1(b)). The external fixator was removed after 8 weeks and the follow-up radiographs revealed delayed union which resulted in intra-articular malunion of the distal humerus. The patient was referred to the senior author (RKM) with substantial overlength of the capitellum resulting in 25 degrees cubitus varus deformity. Flexion extension arc was 95 degrees with a 35-degree flexion contracture. Her forearm rotation was normal. She did not have pain and did not opt for surgery at this point. Four months later, she reported substantial pain and lost all her active motion. The patient opted for surgery mainly to regain extension in order to return to work. Neurological examination was unremarkable. She had no signs of ulnar neuropathy.\n\n【8】  \n**(a)**\n\n【9】  \n**(b)**\n\n【10】  \n**(c)**\n\n【11】  \n**(d)**\n\n【12】  \n**(e)**\n\n【13】  \n**(f)**\n\n【14】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)**   \n**(f)**\n\n【15】Figure 1 \n\n【16】| (a) Our patient was a 48-year-old dentist who was seen 10 months after a high energy fall that resulted in a complex intra-articular fracture of her left nondominant distal humerus.

(c) The external fixator was removed after 8 weeks and follow-up the radiographs revealed distal humerus intra-articular malunion. (d) An oscillating saw was used to create a trapezoid wedge to correct overlength varus of the lateral column and flexion of the capitellum in order to realign capitellum and trochlea.

(f) Patient opted for removal of hardware and extra-articular excavation of the prominent ventral distal humerus creating a new fossa coronoidea in order to gain flexion. |\n| --- |\n\n【17】She underwent corrective a transverse osteotomy 18 months after her initial injury. A midline posterior incision, with medial and lateral skin flaps elevated, was used. The olecranon osteotomy provided a complete overview of the dorsal distal humerus, including the radiohumeral joint and the ulnar nerve. An oscillating saw was used to create a trapezoid wedge to correct overlength varus of the lateral column and flexion of the capitellum in order to realign capitellum and trochlea. Extreme caution was taken no to disrupt the anterior blood supply of the capitellum. A second supracondylar wedge was resected to correct cubitus varus and 20 degrees of internal rotation. The capitellum radii was fixed to the ulnar condyle using an isolated lag screw (Figure 1(c)). Iliac crest bone graft was used to improve bone healing and fixation was achieved with a lateral 7hour-LCDC plate and screws. The olecranon osteotomy was fixed with screw-tension band technique (Figure 1(d)). Intraoperative ulnohumeral motion was 90 degrees of flexion with full extension after debridement of the olecranon fossa. The elbow was placed in a cast in full extension for 24 hours.\n\n【18】She had loss of anterior translation of the distal end of the humerus resulting in 90 degrees of flexion and 5 degrees of hyperextension of the left elbow (Figure 1(e)). The patient was satisfied initially with her stable function elbow and 95 degrees of ulnohumeral motion. However, 18 months postoperatively she decided to have removal of hardware and an extra-articular excavation of the prominent ventral distal humerus creating a new fossa coronoidea in order to gain flexion. Her final flexion improved to 110 degrees with 5 degrees of hyperextension (Figure 1(f)). She had a functional outcome, quantified as 95 points by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Elbow Evaluation Instrument and the Mayo Elbow Performance Index. Continuous passive motion was initiated 24 hours after surgery and therapy was started.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to specifically address intra-articular osteotomy to treat distal humerus malunion. However, small series have been published as part of surgical technique and clinical outcome papers on intra- and extra-articualar malunion \\[5\\]. McKee and Jupiter reported on two malunited fractures of the distal humerus that underwent intra-articular osteotomy in a series of distal humerus malunion and nonunion with good results \\[6\\].\n\n【21】The cornerstone of treatment of fractures of the distal humerus is operative reduction and internal fixation \\[6–13\\]. Pessimism regarding these fractures is not justified with contemporary methods of internal fixation \\[10\\]. However, routine in treatment does not exist due to the rarity of these fractures. In addition, the complex articular surface and meager amount of cancellous bone still makes operative treatment a substantial challenge.\n\n【22】Nonunion and malunion of distal humerus fractures treated operatively is rare. Only 2% of all fractures involve the distal humerus, and 2% of these result in malunion. Intra-articular osteotomy for malunion to achieve a functional arc of motion and to prevent subsequent posttraumatic arthritis in the elbow joint is rarely indicated in the young demanding patient. Therefore, experience with treatment of intra-articular malunited fractures is very limited and reports seldom appear in literature \\[6–9\\]. We feel that total elbow arthroplasty for malunion of the distal humerus is a treatment option reserved for low-demand elderly patients \\[12\\].\n\n【23】If the patient present at an early stage, an intra-articular osteotomy is considered if original fracture lines can be osteotomized and posttraumatic arthrosis is limited. Extra-articular osteotomy is indicated when intra-articular congruency of the elbow joint cannot be restored and secondary posttraumatic arthrosis is too advanced \\[1, 6\\]. Preoperative planning is paramount to assess if it is technically feasible to restore ulnohumeral congruency (Figure 1(c)).\n\n【24】Stability of the elbow joint and a functional arc of motion were achieved in this case. After intra-articular osteotomy, the patient had only 90 degrees of flexion due to loss of anterior translation of the distal humerus \\[13\\]. Initial loss of flexion was accepted by patient and surgeon to avoid devascularization of the distal end of the humerus. After avoiding too much dissection during the index procedure in case one, the patient opted for a successful subsequent procedure to gain flexion. Satisfactory functional outcome was quantified by the Mayo Elbow Performance Index and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Instrument.\n\n【25】Surgical reconstruction of the intra-articular malunited distal humerus is technically challenging but can improve function in the young active adult by restoring intrinsic anatomy of the elbow.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Gastric variceal bleeding is a life-threatening complication of splenic vein thrombosis, resulting from increased blood flow to short gastric vein. Traditionally, splenectomy is considered the treatment of choice. However, surgery in necrotizing pancreatitis is dangerous, because of severe inflammation, adhesion, and bleeding tendency. In the Warshaw operation, gastric variceal bleeding is rare, even though splenic vein is resected. Because the splenic artery is also resected, blood flow to short gastric vein is not increased problematically. Herein, we report a case of gastric variceal bleeding secondary to splenic vein thrombosis complicated by necrotizing pancreatitis successfully treated with splenic artery embolization. Splenic artery embolization could be the best treatment option for gastric variceal bleeding when splenectomy is difficult such as in case associated with severe acute pancreatitis or associated with severe adhesion or in patients with high operation risk.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Necrotizing pancreatitis (NP) is present in 10~20% of patients with acute pancreatitis. NP should be managed as conservatively as possible because of a high operative mortality. A step-up approach with less invasive management is widely accepted nowadays for management of NP \\[1\\]. Bleeding from gastric varices (GVs) secondary to splenic vein thrombosis (SVT) can be life-threatening. GVs secondary to SVT are caused by the imbalance between splenic inflow and outflow. In the setting of SVT, splenic arterial flow is patent, but splenic vein is occluded. Therefore, SVT leads to the increase in splenic outflow via the short gastric and gastroepiploic veins, known as left-sided or sinistral portal hypertension. The increased pressure within the short gastric vein causes submucosal venous dilatation in gastric fundus. It has a potential risk of massive hemorrhage from gastric varices \\[2\\].\n\n【4】Traditionally, a splenectomy is considered as a treatment of choice for bleeding GVs secondary to SVT \\[3\\]. However, it is sometimes very difficult and dangerous in the patients with NP because of inflammation, adhesion, and bleeding tendency. In the Warshaw operation—a spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with splenic vein resection—the splenic artery and vein are resected with the distal pancreas. The splenic blood flow is preserved through the short gastric vessels and gastroepiploic vessels. In the report about the operative outcome of the Warshaw operation for 23 years, it has been reported that there were no clinical consequences of perigastric varices in 158 patients who underwent the Warshaw operation during a follow-up period of up to 21 years \\[4\\]. Although the splenic vein is resected in this procedure, pressure in short gastric and gastroepiploic vein is not increased problematically, because the splenic artery is also resected. No patient who underwent this procedure needed splenectomy due to bleeding GVs. Therefore, the Warshaw operation is considered safe and feasible. This theory can be applicable to treat gastric varices secondary to SVT.\n\n【5】Some authors have reported that splenic artery embolization (SAE) is an effective alternative to splenectomy for the treatment of gastric variceal bleeding with left-sided portal hypertension \\[2, 5, 6\\].\n\n【6】Herein, we report a case of bleeding GVs secondary to SVT in NP, successfully managed by SAE without splenectomy.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【8】A 42-year-old man was referred to our hospital for treatment of a necrotizing pancreatitis. He had no history of medication or alcohol consumption. Laboratory studies revealed white blood cell count 20,200/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin 17.4 g/dL, platelet count 25,8000/mm<sup>3</sup>, serum total bilirubin 2.17 mg/dL, AST 266 U/L, ALT 196 U/L, amylase 1670 U/L, and lipase 2673 U/L. An abdominal CT scan showed acute necrotizing pancreatitis with large amount of peripancreatic necrotic fluid collections (Figure 1(a)). He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and protease inhibitor and empirical antibiotics treatment was initiated. He presented a cardiac arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 20 minutes, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and mechanical ventilation were needed for combined multiorgan failure. An abdominal CT scan following 4 weeks of medical treatment in ICU demonstrated a huge pseudocyst (Figure 1(b)). Despite endoscopic transgastric internal drainage and percutaneous drainage, fever and abdominal pain were not subsided. A follow-up abdominal CT scan after 8 weeks from admission revealed the decreased but still remaining large amount of necrotic collections (Figure 1(c)) and SVT with engorgement of perigastric veins (Figure 1(d)). An emergency operation for necrosectomy and external drainage was performed. On operative field, severe adhesion and bleeding tendency was noted. On postoperative day 13, hematemesis occurred. Blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg and hemoglobin decreased from 11.2 g/dL to 7.6 g/dL. An abdominal CT scan revealed extravasation of contrast media at gastric cardia and fundus (Figure 2(a)). After initial resuscitation, an emergency esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed. It showed a huge clot in the stomach, and active bleeding from gastric fundus was suspected. However, the focus of bleeding could not be identified exactly due to the presence of large clot and ongoing active bleeding (Figure 2(b)). He was referred to intervention unit and underwent an emergency angiography. Celiac and splenic arteriography revealed no active bleeding from arterial system (Figures 3(a)\\-3(b)). Under suspicion of bleeding GVs, SAE was performed using vascular plug (Figure 3(c)). The vascular plug was placed at distal splenic artery just proximal to branching in splenic hilum. After SAE, splenic flow was remarkably decreased (Figure 3(d)). During the procedure, his systolic blood pressure was 70~80 mmHg and heart rate was 140~150 beats per minute. Four packs of PRCs were transfused after SAE. After the procedure, bleeding stopped immediately, and no more episode of gastrointestinal bleeding was observed. An abdominal CT scan 2 days following the SAE showed no more bleeding. A small splenic infarction was seen, but the infarcted volume was less than 10% of total splenic volume (Figure 4(a)). Any treatment for splenic infarction was not needed. At present, 4 months following the SAE, no more episode of variceal bleeding was observed and no infarcted area of spleen was seen on a follow-up abdominal CT scan (Figure 4(b)).\n\n【9】  \n**(a)**\n\n【10】  \n**(b)**\n\n【11】  \n**(c)**\n\n【12】  \n**(d)**\n\n【13】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【14】Figure 1 \n\n【15】(a) Abdominal CT scan showed severe necrotizing pancreatitis.

Discussion\n\n【34】It is known that incidence of pancreatitis-induced SVT is 14%, and risk of GI bleeding in these patients is 12% \\[7\\]. Thrombosed splenic vein with intact splenic artery induces hypertensive short gastric veins that can develop into varices in the gastric fundal submucosa. These varices are a potential source of significant upper GI bleeding (Figure 5(b)). Traditionally, splenectomy is considered as a treatment of choice for GV bleeding secondary to SVT. The cause of bleeding is the imbalance between inflow and outflow of spleen, not a splenic pathology. Therefore, in this setting, rationale for splenectomy is to interrupt the arterial supply feeding the collateral draining veins and the gastric fundus varices, thus reducing the pressure of the system and consequently the risk of rebleeding \\[8\\] (Figure 5(c)). The spleen resection should be forced to interrupt the short gastric vessels, because no more blood outflow is present in spleen after ligation of short gastric veins. Therefore, if we can decrease pressure within short gastric veins and no more bleeding is present, splenectomy is not necessary.\n\n【35】  \n**(a)**\n\n【36】  \n**(b)**\n\n【37】  \n**(c)**\n\n【38】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【39】Figure 5 \n\n【40】(a) Normal anatomy. The splenic inflows and outflows are balanced. (b) Thrombosed splenic vein and intact splenic artery induces hypertensive short gastric veins. It is a potential source of massive bleeding from gastric varices. (c) The rationale of splenectomy in the setting of gastric variceal bleeding is the complete interruption of blood flow in short gastric veins from spleen. PV, portal vein; SMV, superior mesenteric vein; CV, coronary vein; IMV, inferior mesenteric vein; SA, splenic artery; SV, splenic vein; LGEA, left gastroepiploic artery; LGEV, left gastroepiploic vein; SGA, short gastric artery; SGV, short gastric vein.\n\n【41】Hematologic and infectious complications can occur after splenectomy \\[9\\]. So, many pancreatic surgeons try to preserve spleen during distal pancreatectomy. The Warshaw operation, spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy (SPDP) with splenic vessels resection, is one of options for distal pancreatectomy. In this procedure, the splenic blood flow is preserved by short gastric vessels and left gastroepiploic vessels. Although the splenic vein is resected in this procedure, pressure in short gastric and gastroepiploic vein is not increased problematically, because the splenic artery is also resected (Figure 6(a)). This procedure has a theoretical risk of splenic infarction and perigastric varices. However, many pancreatic surgeons have reported the safety of the Warshaw operation. Warshaw group have reported that none of 158 patients who underwent the Warshaw operation developed GI bleeding and only 3 (1.9%) patients required a reoperation because of splenic infarction during a follow-up period of up to 21 years \\[4\\]. Kim et al. also have reported no clinical significant splenic infarctions or gastric varices in any case after the Warshaw operation \\[10\\]. In our center, we performed 19 cases of laparoscopic Warshaw operation from 2014. Splenic infarction was observed in 11 patients; however the infarcted volume was less than 10% in all patients, and no specific treatment was needed. No episode of GI bleeding was observed in all patients.\n\n【42】  \n**(a)**\n\n【43】  \n**(b)**\n\n【44】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【45】Figure 6 \n\n【46】(a) After the Warshaw operation, spleen is supplied by short gastric arteries and left gastroepiploic artery and drained by short gastric veins and left gastroepiploic vein. No gastric variceal bleeding was observed after the operation over 20 years of observation period. (b) After splenic artery embolization, pressure within short gastric veins is decreased. The blood flow of spleen is maintained similar to postoperative circumstance of the Warshaw operation. PV, portal vein; SMV, superior mesenteric vein; CV, coronary vein; IMV, inferior mesenteric vein; SA, splenic artery; SV, splenic vein; LGEA, left gastroepiploic artery; LGEV, left gastroepiploic vein; SGA, short gastric artery; SGV, short gastric vein; GVB, gastric variceal bleeding.\n\n【47】On the basis of these clinical results after the Warshaw operation, SAE can be a treatment option for GV bleeding induced by SVT. After SAE, blood pressure in short gastric veins is decreased because the blood inflow to spleen is decreased. In addition, spleen can be preserved via short gastric and gastroepiploic blood supply similar to postoperative circumstance of the Warshaw operation (Figure 6(b)). In our case, after SAE, drainage of fresh blood via nasogastric tube was stopped, and hypovolemic shock and anemia are recovered gradually. And very small region of spleen was infarcted, but no specific treatment was needed. Even though gastric and perigastric varices are still observed on abdominal CT scan, no episode of GI bleeding developed during the 4 months of follow-up period.\n\n【48】Any upper abdominal surgery in the patient with severe acute pancreatitis is very dangerous because of sever adhesion, inflammation, obscure anatomy, friable tissue, and bleeding tendency. Especially in necrotizing pancreatitis, a conservative or less invasive treatment is recommended \\[1\\]. Therefore, SAE could be the best treatment modality rather than splenectomy in GVs bleeding secondary to SVT in the patients with NP.\n\n【49】Nonselective SAE, embolization of main trunk of splenic artery, seemed more ideal than selective SAE, embolization of each branch of splenic artery, to preserve left gastroepiploic artery. Stone et al. reported 20~30% volume splenic infarction after nonselective SAE \\[2\\]. By contrast, Sankararaman et al. planned to embolize 80~90% of the spleen. After selective SAE, huge area of spleen was infarcted \\[6\\]. In our case, we performed nonselective SAE; then only small portion of spleen was infarcted.\n\n【50】In conclusion, splenic artery embolization is a safe and feasible modality to manage bleeding gastric varices secondary to splenic vein thrombosis. Especially in necrotizing pancreatitis, it could be the best treatment modality in aspect of “step-up” approach. However, more studies are needed with long-term outcome to clarify the necessity of splenectomy.\n\n【51】#### Competing Interests\n\n【52】The authors declare no conflict of interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "5328a64f-836f-4cc8-95f7-2c9d8ef6cbe5", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is estimated to have affected 6.2 million people in the United States and 27.5 million people worldwide as of September 9, 2020. On February 2, 2020, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) determined that the public health emergency justified the development and emergency use of “in vitro diagnostics for the detection and/or diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19” by activating the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Unfortunately, effective mitigation efforts were thwarted early in the outbreak resulting in an expansion of the initial EUA on February 29, 2020, to improve accessibility to in vitro diagnostic testing. Expectantly, the development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 testing including RT-PCR expanded rapidly in the weeks following the EUA expansion. These newly developed and approved SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests boast impressive positive and negative agreement rates nearing 100%. Despite the exceptionally high rates of agreement, caution is advised as the RT-PCR tests approved under the COVID-19 EUA are in vitro analyses developed with samples artificially doped with SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These tests therefore do not have clinically applicable sensitivity and specificity because they lack a “gold standard” for diagnosis. Here we present three challenging cases requiring cautious interpretation of the newest generation of RT-PCR molecular detection assays, highlighting the major challenges faced by providers treating patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In an unprecedented world of SARS-CoV-2 infection, a medley of non-FDA-approved tests has been thrust upon providers who are now challenged with their complex and potentially inconsistent interpretation. We aim to lay an intellectual framework for the rapid expansion of SARS-CoV-2 testing via EUA FDA “authorized” studies and emphasize the limitations of rapid bedside interpretation. Paramount to this topic is the often misquoted “sensitivity and specificity” of the RT-PCR detection assays, a nonexistent test property for SARS-CoV-2 due to the lack of a gold standard for verification and validation. It is important for all providers to understand these constraints and the potentially misleading test results in the clinical context of their patients. This article brings forth the potential for misinformation and misinterpretation that could lead to undesired patient outcomes. We advocate a thorough assessment of a patient’s clinical picture without isolated interpretation of RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2. In an effort to guide clinicians through this unparalleled time, we present three case reports to support detailed and individualized interpretations of patient presentations in the context of both positive and negative RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2. We hope a deeper understanding of testing validation, and results will improve our medical communities’ ability to make a true diagnosis of clinically significant COVID-19 disease or lack thereof and open up future research of more validated tests.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case 1\n\n【5】The following case is of an elderly male who presented with metabolic encephalopathy and failure to thrive that was found to have persistently positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 over several weeks despite a lack of symptoms typically attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[1\\].\n\n【6】A 90-year-old male with hypertension (HTN), well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), hyperlipidemia (HLD), coronary artery disease, mild Alzheimer’s dementia, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3 presented to the emergency department (ED) with generalized weakness and recurrent falls for the past few days. He was diagnosed with a possible urinary tract infection owing to an otherwise negative workup including a computed tomography (CT) head and chest radiograph (CXR). He did not initially undergo a NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on admission due to restrictions on testing at that time. He was discharged from the ED with oral antibiotics to his assisted living facility (ALF). Four days later, he returned to the ED with encephalopathy, progressive generalized weakness, and inadequate oral intake requiring admission to the inpatient medical ward. To note: the day after admission, the patient’s ALF reported an infection at their facility; however, our patient did not undergo a NP RT-PCR at that time as he had no indication for testing consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) testing algorithm \\[2\\] (note: testing criteria have since been updated). Pertinent findings on presentation included a dry oropharynx, right lower lobe crackles, ecchymosis on lower extremities, and a significant encephalopathy. Initial workup revealed a serum creatinine of 2.46 (baseline 1.8), a procalcitonin of 0.16, and a normal CXR. He was diagnosed with failure to thrive, metabolic encephalopathy, and acute kidney injury (AKI) on CKD stage 3. He was initially treated with isotonic saline for volume repletion and general supportive care. On hospital day (HD) four, the patient’s metabolic encephalopathy persisted despite rehydration and resolution of his AKI warranting further investigation. Aside from a CRP of 57.4, his lab work, blood cultures, repeat procalcitonin (0.19), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, repeated CXR, and electroencephalogram (EEG) were unrevealing. Although the patient did not meet CDC testing criteria at that time, he underwent NP-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 on HD nine. On HD 10, NP-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive and the patient was placed on modified droplet precaution while exposed staff members were instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days. A lumbar puncture (LP) was performed given the concern for encephalopathy related to COVID-19. PCR on CSF was negative for SARS-CoV-2. His encephalopathy improved by HD 20 without additional therapies; unfortunately, his discharge was delayed secondary to persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests (Table 1). On HD 30, CRP was retested and found to be improved at 8.4. He was discharged on HD 33 after two consecutive negative RT-PCR results. During his hospital course, he remained afebrile without pulmonary symptoms, imaging findings, supplemental oxygen requirements, or other signs of infection. All blood, urine, and LP cultures remained negative, and his metabolic encephalopathy was attributed to an atypical COVID-19 infection. Modified droplet precautions were removed once he had two consecutive negative NP RT-PCR tests, and he was discharged to his ALF without further follow-up or subsequent hospitalizations \\[3\\].\n\n【7】Table 1 \n\n【8】SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and IgG index based on hospital day, Case 1.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Case 2\n\n【10】The following case is of a middle-aged female who was admitted for the treatment of a hepatohydrothorax with negative NP RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. She was readmitted hours after discharge for an empyema, with a repeat negative NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, and subsequently developed COVID-19 pneumonia. After 12 days of hospitalization, the NP RT-PCR test detected SARS-CoV-2 concurrently with the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (Ab) in her serum.\n\n【11】A fifty-three-year-old Caucasian female with end-stage liver disease (ESLD), recurrent hepatohydrothorax, laparoscopic banding with takedown and sleeve gastrectomy, and anxiety and depressive disorder currently undergoing liver transplant evaluation initially presented to an outside hospital with a complaint of dyspnea. She was admitted with hypoxia and a large right pleural effusion. The patient developed hypotension of unknown etiology four days into admission and was transferred to the transplant intensive care unit (T-ICU) at our facility for further management. On presentation to our facility, she was afebrile with initial CXR demonstrating a moderate-large right pleural effusion with passive atelectasis in the right middle and upper lung zones and clear left lung fields. The patient had no known contact with persons with COVID-19 and had a negative NP RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 test at the time of transfer. The patient received a pleural pigtail catheter to manage her recurrent right hepatohydrothorax with significant improvement in symptoms on subsequent imaging. She remained afebrile, normotensive, and improved to baseline; she was discharged home after 10 days of hospital care.\n\n【12】Within hours of returning home, the patient re-presented to the ED febrile, encephalopathic, tachycardic, and tachypneic with a maximum temperature of 38.9 degrees Celsius. Pertinent data included a leukocytosis of 12.9, creatinine 1.5 (base 0.6), lactic acid 5.1 (from 2.5 the day prior), procalcitonin 0.34 (from 0.06 ten days prior), and a repeat NP RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 that was negative. She was admitted to the T-ICU and initiated on empiric piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and caspofungin for a suspected empyema. The patient initially responded; however, she began spiking fevers on HD eight. A CT chest 10 days after readmission was obtained and revealed a new, dense left-lower lobe consolidation with ground-glass opacities in the right upper lobe and anterior left upper lobe with a resolution of her effusion. Despite empiric antimicrobial treatment, she became progressively hypoxic.\n\n【13】She underwent a repeat NP RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 along with serology for IgG Ab by ELISA and both resulted positively (Table 2). At that time, she was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and placed on modified droplet precautions. A bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed thirteen days after readmission; the only positive finding was a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. A repeat CXR fifteen days after readmission revealed worsening bilateral interstitial and airspace opacities; she received lenzilumab for two consecutive treatments and two days later received convalescent plasma. Her COVID-19 pneumonia improved thereafter, and modified droplet precautions were removed once she had two consecutive negative NP RT-PCR tests \\[3\\]. She was recommended to wait 21 days from symptom resolution and have two negative COVID tests 24 hours apart to be relisted for liver transplant (Table 2). Interestingly, her pleural fluid culture from readmission and BAL cultures revealed no growth.\n\n【14】Table 2 \n\n【15】SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and IgG index based on hospital day, Case 2.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Case 3\n\n【17】The following case is of a middle-aged man recently recovered from severe COVID-19 pneumonia who presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and a positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【18】A sixty-one-year-old Caucasian male with HTN, HLD, DM2, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis secondary to diabetic nephropathy presented to the ED with two days of progressively worsening cough productive of blood-tinged sputum, dyspnea, nausea, and vomiting. He had also been experiencing progressive weakness and diarrhea for the preceding 10 days. He had no known exposure to COVID-19. Upon initial exam, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable with an oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) of 97% on room air. He was noted to have mild tachypnea and coarse crackles in the bilateral lung fields with the CXR revealing bilateral multifocal consolidations predominantly involving the mid- to lower lung zones. He rapidly deteriorated to a SaO<sub>2</sub> of 71% and was placed on a 100% nonrebreather. Within 12 hours of initial presentation, the patient required mechanical ventilation and was admitted to the intensive care unit. A NP RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 taken on admission returned positive prompting a diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, and he was placed on modified droplet precautions.\n\n【19】The patient was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Despite having a prolonged hospital course complicated by an _Escherichia coli_ pneumonia superinfection, his respiratory status dramatically improved after 18 days of hospital care. CXR on HD 16 showed persistence of consolidations with minimal improvement. At the time of discharge, he did not require supplemental oxygen and was discharged home.\n\n【20】Six days after discharge, the patient re-presented to the ED with hypoxic respiratory failure, nausea, abdominal pain, and poor oral intake. Upon exam, he was afebrile and hemodynamically stable yet tachypneic with a SaO<sub>2</sub> of 84% on room air. Again, he was noted to have coarse bilateral crackles and required 15 L of supplemental oxygen to maintain a normal SaO<sub>2</sub>. A CXR was significant for a marked bilateral interval increase in the interstitial and airspace opacities with near-complete consolidation at the lingula, when compared to his prior admission. The radiologist noted the findings were concerning for changes of recurrent COVID-related organizing pneumonia. Initial NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative upon readmission, but due to recent COVID-19 pneumonia, it was repeated the next day and found to be positive (Table 3). At this time, he was placed on modified droplet precautions given the concern for recurrent COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\n【21】Table 3 \n\n【22】SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results and IgG index based on hospital day, Case 3.\n\n【23】Laboratory data were significant for a decreased ferritin of 2010 mcg/L (prior admission peak of 4157 mcg/L), a decreased CRP of 31 mg/L (prior admission peak of 193.1 mg/L), and a decreased IL-6 of 7.2 pg/mL (decreased from 67.0 pg/mL). Serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG index was obtained and was 3.58. Despite a positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, the patient’s inflammatory markers had significantly decreased and alternate etiologies for the patient’s readmission were considered. Although the patient was compliant with scheduled hemodialysis, he underwent urgent hemodialysis with ultrafiltration of 4 L with significant clinical improvement. A transthoracic echocardiogram was repeated revealing an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40–45% compared to an LVEF of 53% just 45 days prior. At the time of discharge, the patient was breathing comfortably on room air without supplemental oxygen.\n\n【24】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【25】The rapid expansion of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in response to the EUA issued by the FDA was essential to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of patients with COVID-19 (Figure 1(b)). As of June 2020, over 130 FDA-authorized tests to identify current and past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 exist, including molecular (RT-PCR), serology (IgM/IgG), and antigen detection \\[4\\]. Serologic testing authorized by the FDA during this unprecedented time is intended to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19; however, providers have been formally advised by the FDA of the limitations of current testing given the absence of a validated diagnostic tool for SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[5\\].\n\n【26】  \n**(a)**\n\n【27】  \n**(b)**\n\n【28】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【29】Figure 1 \n\n【30】(a) Weekly EUA testing approval for SARS-CoV-2. (b) Cumulative EUA-approved testing for SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【31】No available tests for SARS-CoV-2 are “FDA-approved”; rather, tests are “FDA-authorized”. The process for FDA approval is lengthy, involving scientific review, regulatory review, assessment of effectiveness and safety, evaluation of performance, review of labeling, quality control mechanisms, and other requirements \\[4, 6\\]. As of March 14, 2020, the FDA has reported the “inappropriate promotion” of serologic tests by commercial laboratories including diagnostic application and poor performance during validation trials with the National Institute of Health \\[7\\]. In addition to the limitations of testing validity, on March 13, 2020, the President issued a “Memorandum on Expanding State-Approved Diagnostic Tests” authorizing New York State along with any other state that requests the authority to do direct laboratory testing for COVID-19 without FDA validation \\[8\\].\n\n【32】To ensure accurate interpretation of a diagnostic test, a thorough knowledge of the methods of testing verification as well as comprehension of applications, limitations, and confounding factors that may influence results is required. Importantly, providers should familiarize themselves with the concept of agreement rates, not sensitivity and specificity. All current FDA-authorized RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 is reported in positive and negative agreement rates due to the absence of an accepted “gold standard”. Sensitivity and specificity are reserved for diagnostic tests with comparative testing to an established “gold standard” which is based on natural specimens. This does not exist for the diagnosis of COVID-19 \\[5, 9\\]; under COVID-19 EUA, in vitro analyses are with contrived samples of artificially doped SARS-CoV-2 RNA. “Agreement rates” that approach 100% may be misleading to the public and providers alike, especially when reported out of context \\[8, 10–12, 13\\]. LabCorp has reported their COVID-19 RT-PCR test as having a positive percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 91.24%–100%) and a negative percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 92.87%–100%); Quest Diagnostics has reported a positive and negative percent agreement of 100% (95% CI: 88.7–100%) along with a specificity of 100% (72/72, 95% CI: 95–100%), to name a few \\[14, 15\\].\n\n【33】Deepening the above concerns surrounding the rapid development and deployment of testing under an EUA, providers are faced with additional uncertainties surrounding testing for SARS-CoV-2. The three cases above highlight some of these uncertainties and limitations in testing and are meant to encourage thorough interpretation of all clinical and objective data without using isolated results for diagnosis and decision-making.\n\n【34】False-positive RT-PCR results can lead to unnecessary testing or isolation, and individual and community panic. These results are due to replication-incompetent SARS-CoV-2 on PCR testing, as demonstrated in cases one and three by persistent positive results after clinical resolution of COVID-19-related disease. This replication can persist up to 12 weeks postinfection \\[16\\]. Furthermore, the CDC updated their guidance on de-escalation of isolation precautions for patients with COVID-19 based on data showing the lack of replication-competent virus after 20 days of onset of disease. False positives suggesting true infection can also develop as a result of viral load kinetics, technical error, sample contamination, detection of an alternative microorganism, amplification errors, and separation techniques \\[17\\]. In addition, FDA recommends 100 bases for nucleic acid-based molecular diagnostic testing; however, DNA probes used in RT-PCR kits for SARS-CoV-2 are 25 bases long, which leads to increased false-positive rates \\[17–19\\].\n\n【35】The second case acknowledges the existence of false-negative results. These are influenced by personnel-specific procedures including standard laboratory techniques, specimen collection including location and technique, and transport and handling. Increased false negatives are also related to the timing of testing and viral shedding, and variability between prime and probe target regions in the SARS genome in the setting of mutations \\[20\\].\n\n【36】Solely relying on RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing for diagnosis in the above three cases could have led to increased invasive testing, increased care cost, misdiagnoses, delay in diagnosis, inappropriate or delayed quarantining, superspreading, and ultimately patient and societal harm.\n\n【37】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【38】The patient presented in Case 1 above highlights the existence of persistent asymptomatic shedding as well as having a low threshold for diagnosing atypical presentations of COVID-19 infection, including encephalopathy and failure to thrive in the elderly. As a resident of an assisted living facility, a failure to initially identify his COVID-19 infection could have resulted in a significant spread to other community members and staff. We recommend maintaining a high index of suspicion for high-risk populations given the “superspreading” potential, and the need to test patients even if they lack the typical respiratory syndrome \\[21\\].\n\n【39】The patient presented in Case 2 above highlights the false reassurance providers may have when faced with a negative NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. The patient’s clinical syndrome was consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia despite initial negative testing; she was subsequently found to have a positive NP RT-PCR along with IgG antibodies simultaneously. According to the CDC, it can take 1–3 weeks to develop antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 after becoming infected but can vary by individual \\[22\\]. This timeline would imply a false-negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR on admission. Due to the overconfidence in the sensitivity of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, the patient’s diagnosis and care was delayed and there was an increased risk of exposure to others. NP RT-PCR testing should not be considered in isolation but in the context of patient symptoms and laboratory and radiographic findings.\n\n【40】The patient presented in Case 3 above highlights the importance of expanding a differential diagnosis in the face of a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Although recrudescence of COVID-19 is reported, alternate etiologies of the patient’s acute hypoxic respiratory failure were considered. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema secondary to acute systolic heart failure as a consequence of his prior COVID-19 infection was ultimately diagnosed. The positive NP RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 at readmission was considered persistent shedding of replication-incompetent viral fragments rather than a primary recurrent pulmonary COVID-19 infectious etiology, or a false positive in clinical terms. Additionally, the CDC reports “no confirmed reports to date of a person being reinfected with COVID-19 within 3 months of initial infection” \\[16\\].\n\n【41】We strongly advise providers to cautiously interpret the results of SARS-CoV-2 testing in the clinical context of the patients they treat. As mentioned previously, providers should not equate the 100% positive and negative agreement rates to sensitivity and specificity of RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 testing. Since tests were developed under an EUA, no official sensitivity or specificity data are available to date. The case examples above highlight common situations of false-positive and false-negative cases seen in clinical practice and remind providers not to rely solely on testing. The accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 infection should combine the clinical presentation and supporting findings along with an accurate interpretation of testing, taking into account the aforementioned details above.\n\n【42】#### Consent\n\n【43】No written consent has been obtained from the patients, as there are no patient identifiable data included in this case report.\n\n【44】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【45】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【46】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【47】The authors thank the contributor Abd Morin Abu Dabrh, MB, B.

Three primary fallopian tube carcinomas, arising in a background of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), are presented. The possible association between chronic PID and PFTC is discussed and a hypothesies linking these cancers with chronic inflammation is proposed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary fallopian tube cancer (PFTC) is a relatively aggressive gynaecological malignancy. It accounts for 1% of all female genital malignancies \\[1–3\\]. The aetiology of PFTC is unknown but nulliparous women and women with germ-line BRCA mutation and women in certain occupations such as smelting workers, artistic workers, hairdressers, packers, nurses, shop workers, and clerical workers appear to be at increased risk of PFTC \\[4–7\\]. Serous papillary carcinoma is the most common histological type, accounting for >90% of the cases with these tumours. PID is very common and _Chlamydia trachomatis_ infection is one of the most significant causes of chronic uterine tube inflammation \\[8\\]. Chlamydial infection has been associated with certain cancers \\[7, 9, 10\\]. This paper describes 3 cases of PFTC, clinically presenting as tuboovarian abscesses. A possible link between chronic PID and PFTC is suggested.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】Three cases of primary fallopian tube carcinomas, presenting between April 2011 and August 2013 with a clinical impression of an inflammatory tuboovarian mass, are described.\n\n【6】Case 1 is a 46-year-old Indigenous woman, admitted in April 2011 with pelvic pain. Abdominal ultrasound showed a 130 mm complex left cystic adnexal mass which was clinically considered to be a tuboovarian abscess as there was a longstanding history of PID due to _Chlamydia_ and gonorrhoea. No free fluid was seen in the pelvis and a CA-125 was normal. Abdominal computerised tomography confirmed the adnexal lesion but showed no additional masses. She had recently been investigated for menorrhagia and her endometrial biopsy and cervical cytology had been normal. She has type 2 diabetes and hypertension. On vaginal examination a large left sided pelvic mass was felt. At laparotomy there were dense adhesions between the adnexae, uterus, and bowel. The adnexae were completely obscured by scar tissues. She underwent hysterectomy left salpingo-oophorectomy and omental biopsy. Macroscopically, the left adnexa ( mm) hands a globular tan brown cystic appearance with a thickened fleshy wall and multiple fleshy projections into the lumen (Figure 1). A high grade mainly solid serous carcinoma was seen in the tube microscopically (Figure 1). Although the fallopian tube was almost completely destroyed by scar tissue from past PID, close relationship to uninvolved and “premalignant” dysplastic tubal epithelia could be microscopically established (Figure 1). The ovary was not identified. The tumour appeared to be limited to the tube and was staged as TNM stage pT1A (FIGO Stage IA). The tubal cancer was regarded as a primary fallopian tubal carcinoma, for which the patient received 6 cycles of postoperative adjuvant therapy. Posttreatment restaging CT 6 weeks later was normal and serial serum CA-125 measurements remained normal. The patient is alive and apparently disease free.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】  \n**(c)**\n\n【10】  \n**(d)**\n\n【11】  \n**(e)**\n\n【12】  \n**(f)**\n\n【13】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)**   \n**(f)**\n\n【14】Figure 1 \n\n【15】| (a) is the macroscopic image of the left fallopian tube which is totally destroyed and cystic.

She also complained of intermenstrual bleeding and had previously been treated for PID due to _Chlamydia_. Hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy in 2010 revealed no pathology and her cervical cytology was also normal. CT abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral adnexal cysts with the right measuring 120 mm and the left measuring 102 mm. Fluid-filled tubal structures were noted in close proximity of the cystic lesions on both sides. Some of the right-sided cysts communicated directly with the fallopian tube. There was also a heterogeneous thick-walled cystic lesion in the vicinity of the right-sided fluid-filled tube. These were interpreted as inflammatory collections. CA-125 was markedly elevated at 1900 kU/L (reference range < 35 kU/L). She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. In view of her clinical status and the presence of adhesions, temporary large bowel enterostomy and peritoneal washings were also performed. Macroscopic examination showed a uterus, cervix, tubes, and ovaries, 266 gm. The uterine corpus contained multiple leiomyomas but the cervix appeared unremarkable. The left ( mm) and right ( mm) adnexae were distorted by cystic lesions. Both tubes also had multiple tan and brown polypoid luminal areas (Figure 2). Histologically, a high grade serous cystadenocarcinoma, originating from the right fallopian tube and involving both adnexal regions and greater omentum (Figure 2), was identified. PID was also identified. No normal ovarian tissue was recognised. The cervix, endometrium, and myometrium showed no malignancy. The peritoneal washings revealed inflammatory material only. The tumour was staged as INM pT3aNXMX (FIGO Stage IIIA). She received chemotherapy and is being followed up with no evidence of disease recurrence clinically or by CA-125 levels.\n\n【17】  \n**(a)**\n\n【18】  \n**(b)**\n\n【19】  \n**(c)**\n\n【20】  \n**(d)**\n\n【21】  \n**(e)**\n\n【22】  \n**(f)**\n\n【23】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)**   \n**(f)**\n\n【24】Figure 2 \n\n【25】| (a) is the macroscopic image of the left fallopian tube which shows a cross section of sausage-like white fleshy mass within what appears to be part of the tube. The remainder of the tube is destroyed and cystic. (b) shows the right tube and uterus. The right tube is somewhat similar to the left and shows 2 tumour masses. The uterus with simple leiomyomas is also shown. (c) is a panel that is a low power view of the left tube with a papillary carcinoma (Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section, original magnification of ×10) and (d) is high power view of the right tube with a serous carcinoma, displaying a micropapillary growth pattern with occasional psammoma bodies (Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section, original magnification of ×40).

She had a history of chronic PID due to _Chlamydia_. Ultrasound examination confirmed bilateral hydrosalpinx and also a large uterine mass. Her CA-125, CA-19.9, and CEA were normal. Total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and peritoneal washings were performed. Macroscopically, the uterus contained a somewhat polypoid endometrial lesion 62 mm and several small leiomyomas up to 15 mm (Figure 3(c)). The right adnexa, which weighed 252 g and measured  mm, consisted of a cystic mass filled with creamy material. The cystic tubal wall ranged in thickness from 1 mm to 4 mm. A polypoid yellowish tan lesion  mm was seen on the inner surface of the right tube, Figure 3(a). The left adnexa consisted of tuboovarian tissue  mm with a recognisible ovary  mm. The tube was dilated and filled with haemorrhagic fluid. Multiple septae ranging from 5 mm to 25 mm in length were seen inside the left tube (Figure 3(b)). The uterine lesion was a FIGO grade 3 endometrioid carcinoma. The tumour had extended into the outer myometrium but was clear by 2.5 mm. The endocervix was also involved by carcinoma (Figure 3(c)). The tumour expressed vimentin and oestrogen receptor (Figure 3(c)). CD10 was expressed only in the stroma of the normal endometrium (Figure 3(c)) and CA126 along the luminal border of the malignant glands (Figure 3(a)). The right tube showed xanthomatous salpingitis (Figure 3(a)). The mucosal nodule was a high grade endometrioid carcinoma (Figure 3(a)) which had a similar immunohistochemical profile to the uterine tumour in being oestrogen receptor positive. Vimentin was also positive. CD10 was non contributory and CA125 was expressed along the luminal surface of the malignant glands. In addition, the right tubal epithelial lining also showed high grade dysplasia (Figure 3(a)). The dysplastic epithelium also expressed vimentin, oestrogen receptor, and luminal surface CA125. Both tubes also showed features of hydrosalpynx. The inflammatory process in the left tube was nonspecific (Figure 3(b)) in comparison to the xanthomatous inflammation in the right tube, as previously mentioned (Figure 3(a)). Close examination of the epithelial lining of the left tube showed focal atypia (Figure 3(b)). The was no malignancy in the left tube. The right tubal cancer was limited to the tube without penetration of the serosal surface (TNM stage pT1/FIGO stage IA). Indeed the tubal tumour did not show any mural invasion (Figure 3(a)). In view of the fact that the endometrioid cancer was at a higher stage, the patient was treated as having a TNM stage pT2a/Figo stage IIA. Her follow-up CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis were unremarkable. The serum CA125 measurement has been normal since surgery.\n\n【27】  \n**(a)**\n\n【28】  \n**(b)**\n\n【29】  \n**(c)**\n\n【30】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【31】Figure 3 \n\n【32】| (a) The upper left panel is the macroscopic image of the right fallopian tube which is markedly distended and shows a polypoid mucosal mass (right tube). Small yellowish deposits are also seen in the mucosa. The upper middle and right panels show chronic xanthomatous salpingitis with lymphoid and foam cell infiltration. The middle panel is the Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section with an original magnification of ×10 and the right panel which is the also Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section with an original magnification of ×40. The left panel of the middle row shows tubal epithelium near the polypoid lesion with high grade dysplasia (Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section, original magnification ×40). The middle panel of the middle row also shows tubal epithelium near the polypoid lesion with high grade dysplasia (Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section, original magnification of ×60). The right panel of the middle row shows the polypoid mass (Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section, original magnification of ×4). The left panel of the lower row is a vimentin stain which stains the stroma and the dysplastic epithelium but not the normal tubal epithelium (immunoperoxidase stain, original magnification ×60). The middle panel of the lower row is immunoperoxidase stain for oestrogen receptor with an original magnification ×40. The dysplastic tubal epithelium is strongly positive (upper part) and normal tubal epithelium is weakly positive (lower part). The right panel of the lower row is immunoperoxidase stain for CA125 with an original magnification of ×20. The epithelium (normal and dysplastic) shows luminal staining. (b) The upper panels are macroscopic images showing a normal ovary but a distended fallopian tube (left tube). The external surface is shown in the left panel and cut surface is shown in the right panel. The tube shows multiple fibrous bands. The middle panels show features of chronic salpingitis with disorganisation of tubal mucosal folds, infiltration by inflammatory cells, fibrosis, and loss of muscle. The left panel of the middle row is the Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section with an original magnification of ×4 and the right panel of the middle row is also the Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section but at original magnification of ×10. The lower panels also show features of chronic salpingitis with focal epithelial atypia in the centre of the images. The left panel of the middle row is the Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section with an original magnification of ×40 and the right panel of the middle row is also the Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section but at original magnification of ×60. (c) The left upper panels are macroscopic images of the uterus with a somewhat polypoid endometrial lesion (uterus). The right shows an endometrioid carcinoma which is infiltrating the endocervix (Haematoxylin and Eosin stained section, original magnification of ×4). The left panel of the middle row is a vimentin stain which shows strong stromal and epithelial expression (immunoperoxidase stain, original magnification of ×10). The right panel of the middle row is immunoperoxidase stain for oestrogen receptor with an original magnification of ×20. Positive staining is observed in the stroma as well as the epithelium. The left panel of the lower row is CD10 which stains the normal endometrium (lower part) but not the carcinoma (immunoperoxidase stain, original magnification of ×20). The right panel of the lower row is CA125 which shows luminal staining in the malignant glands (immunoperoxidase stain, original magnification of ×20). |\n| --- |\n\n【33】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【34】PFTC accounts for 1% of all gynaecological malignancies. In order to be considered a primary neoplasm, the tumour must be located within the fallopian tube or its fimbriated end and the uterus and ovary must either not contain carcinoma or if they do it must be clearly different from the fallopian tube lesion \\[11\\]. The 3 cases presented here fulfill these criteria and are therefore considered primary fallopian tube cancers. The third case is complicated by the fact that a clinically significant primary tumour of the endometrium was also found and the operation was performed for the uterine complaints with the fallopian tube pathology being an incidental finding. The tubal tumour was considered a second primary as it formed a polypoid mucosal lesion (Figure 3(a) left upper panel) with precancerous changes in the mucosa at the base of the polyp (Figure 3(a) middle panels). The tumour was associated with xanthomatous salpingitis (Figure 3(a) middle and right upper panels). The tumour and the precancerous change were endometrioid expressing vimentin and oestrogen receptor (left and middle lower panels). The nonneoplastic tubal tissue did express oestrogen receptor weakly but was not vimentin positive (left and middle lower panels). CA125 was seen only along the luminal surface aspect of the normal, preneoplastic, and neoplastic epithelia (Lower right panel). The endometrial carcinoma showed a similar immunohistochemical profile (Figure 3(c)). The left tube (Figure 3(b)) was not involved by cancer but foci of atypia were seen in the lining mucosa (Figure 3(b) lower panels). The tube, however, did show features of hydrosalpinx (Figure 3(b) upper panels) with chronic salpingitis (Figure 3(b) middle and lower panels). The tumour in the first 2 cases was of the serous type (Figures 1 and 2) and in each case, precancerous changes could be demonstrated in the tube (Figures 1 and 2 lower panels).\n\n【35】Mounting evidence indicates that the vast majority of epithelial ovarian carcinomas are not ovarian in origin. Extrauterine Müllerian epithelium from various sites in the reproductive tract accounts for the diverse morphology and behaviour of these tumours \\[12\\]. Prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomies in BRCA positive women have recently implicated the fimbria as a site of origin for high-grade serous carcinoma and its intraepithelial precursors \\[13–15\\]. Kurman et al. has proposed a model for the development of ovarian and extraovarian low-grade serous proliferations. They postulate that all of these lesions are derived from papillary tubal hyperplasia, which appears to be induced by chronic inflammation \\[16\\]. Chronic inflammation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of human cancers. The mechanisms underlying the relationship between inflammation and cancer are complex. The aetiology of the inflammation is varied and includes microbial, chemical, and physical agents. The chronically inflamed environment which is rich in inflammatory cytokines appears to lead to the activation of a number of signalling pathways \\[17\\]. The role of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of cancer of the proximal stomach, liver, and uterine cervix with helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C, and human papilloma viruses, respectively, is well documented. An association between chronic inflammation and fallopian tube cancer has been suggested by a number of investigators. Lin and colleagues found an association between PID and ovarian cancer and suggested that PID might be a useful marker for ovarian cancer as early detection and treatment could help to improve prognosis. They raised the possibility that pelvic inflammation might accelerate the growth of ovarian cancers or affect cancer-cell differentiation in ways that adversely alter prognosis \\[18\\]. Rasmussen et al. found that a history of PID was associated with an increased risk of ovarian borderline tumours and suggested that inflammation could be an etiological factor in borderline tumours \\[19\\] and Skapinyecz et al. also found that patients suffering from PID had a higher risk of cervical cancer \\[20\\].\n\n【36】Sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydial and gonorrhoeal infections can damage the tubal mucosa. A 60 kDa heat shock protein is believed to be an important triggering pathogenic immune response in chlamydial infection and several studies have demonstrated a correlation between the level of immune response to this chlamydial protein and the extent of tubal damage \\[21\\]. _Chlamydia trachomatis_ infection is one of the most significant causes of PID. The pathogen is highly prevalent in the cervix and uterine tubes of sexually active women. The probability of having ovarian cancer has been shown to be 90% greater in women with the highest levels of antibodies to chlamydia compared to women with the lowest levels, suggesting that past or chronic persistent chlamydial infection may be a risk factor for ovarian cancer \\[22\\]. This possible association was recently revived by J. P. Carvalho and F. M. Carvalho who hypothesised that chlamydial trachomatis infection might be involved in fimbrial carcinogenesis. Fimbrial intraepithelial precursors can evolve into high grade serous carcinomas that spread rapidly to the ovarian surface and peritoneum; such tumours may appear to be primary ovarian neoplasms, though in reality, they are secondary malignancies. J. P. Carvalho and F. M. Carvalho did not offer intracellular signalling pathways for their hypothesis. This hypothesis may have implications for patient management as salpingectomy instead of oophorectomy which may be more appropriate surgery for high risk women \\[21\\].\n\n【37】The 3 patients presented here had long standing histories of PIC with many hospital admissions for septic conditions and menstrual irregularities. Chlamydia with or without other infections is usually present in pelvic inflammatory disease and the 3 patients had been previously treated for chlamydial infections. Chlamydia is the most frequently reported notifiable condition in Australia. In 2011 there were almost 80,000 new notifications for persons aged 15 years and over 435 cases per 100,000 population and 9% of chlamydia notifications were among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, despite this population representing just 2.5% of the total population \\[8\\]. The notification rate for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population was nearly four times that of the non-Indigenous notification rate: 1,257 per 100,000, compared with 340 per 100,000, respectively. Similar to the non-Indigenous population, around 80% of chlamydia diagnoses were among those aged 15 to 29 years. In 2010, more than a third (36%) of all gonorrhoea diagnoses were among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The rate of diagnosis was more than 26 times that for the non-Indigenous population: 804 per 100,000, compared with 30 per 100,000, respectively \\[8\\]. The 3 patients presented here are from the northern territory of Australia which has a population of approximately 230,000 with 32% being Indigenous \\[23\\]. PID is a significant health problem in this cohort and the finding of 3 cases of PFTC is significant and raises the possibility of an association between these cancers and PID.\n\n【38】The role of chlamydial infection is firmly established in conjunctival cancers including marginal zone lymphoma \\[24, 25\\]. As chronic chlamydial infection is the most common causes of chronic uterine tube inflammation, this infection is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of tubal cancer. It is reasonable to suggest that chronic _C. trachomatis_ infection may be involved in fimbrial carcinogenesis and subsequent serous carcinomas with the potential for rapid spread to the ovarian surface and peritoneum. This has implications for possible early detection and prophylactic salpingectomy instead of oophorectomy in high risk women.\n\n【39】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【40】The author declares that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

He had recently recovered from COVID-19 infection and returned home on room air. Chest imaging showed bilateral hydropneumothoraces that were not present on the imaging performed during his prior admission three weeks ago. The patient was treated with bilateral chest tube drainage and oxygen support and responded well to treatment. This case represents a unique occurrence of spontaneous loculated bilateral hydropneumothoraces in the context of recent clinical recovery from COVID-19 infection requiring inpatient treatment. This case highlights the importance of an awareness of a potential sequela of COVID-19 that may occur even after presumed clinical recovery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Despite being nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to see novel disease presentations and complications. While common symptoms include fatigue and dyspnea, more severe complications may include pulmonary, vascular, and neurological manifestations \\[1\\]. Of additional interest are late complications of COVID-19 that present with new symptoms. Currently, there are isolated case reports of sequelae occurring late in the disease state or even after clinical resolution and inpatient discharge.\n\n【4】The incidence of pneumothorax, in particular, has been of interest to researchers, and previous works have estimated that this complication may occur in 1% of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospital admission \\[2\\]. It is more commonly seen as a manifestation of barotrauma in patients on mechanical ventilation; however, some reports have discussed increased incidence even in nonintubated patients with ARDS \\[3, 4\\]. Loculated pneumothorax refers to a pneumothorax with localized air trapping within the pleural space \\[5\\]. They occur typically due to pleural pathology, including empyema, parapneumonic effusions, malignancy, or incomplete pleurodesis \\[6\\]. A hydropneumothorax is defined by the presence of both air and fluid in the pleural space. Bilateral presentation of pneumothorax is less common than unilateral presentation, with a reported incidence of approximately 1.6% of pneumothoraces \\[7\\]. Most pneumothoraces are attributable to some known causative factor, with spontaneous pneumothorax being rarer and traditionally associated with tall and thin male patients \\[8\\].\n\n【5】Here, we present a case of delayed presentation of bilateral spontaneous hydropneumothoraces in a patient who had recently recovered from COVID-19 infection. This is the first case of a unique presentation of this complication to the best of our knowledge.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 53-year-old male presented to an outside hospital with worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, and back pain. He had been hospitalized for 6 days at another hospital, three weeks ago, due to COVID-19 infection. At that time, his symptoms included headaches, fever, nausea, and shortness of breath. During this hospital stay, his COVID-19 symptoms ranged from mild to moderate severity. He required neither ICU admission nor mechanical ventilation, and there were no significant complications during the hospital stay. He had received remdesivir and dexamethasone, and as the symptoms improved, he was discharged home on room air. Initially, he continued to improve for a week after discharge. However, he slowly began to experience progressive chest pain, back pain, and productive cough, which prompted him to return to the emergency department.\n\n【8】His past medical history was relatively uneventful. He denied smoking and drug use, although he endorsed occasional alcohol use. He denied any ongoing health issues or previous surgeries. He had infrequently sought medical attention in the past.\n\n【9】Upon arrival at the outside hospital, he was febrile and hypoxic and required supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> >90%. CT scan performed was negative for pulmonary embolism but revealed bilateral ground-glass infiltrates consistent with recent COVID-19 pneumonia. The imaging also showed bilateral posterior lung lesions with air-fluid levels, suspicious for lung abscesses (Figure 1). Compared to his prior imaging from a few weeks ago, these lesions were new (Figure 2). At this point, the patient was transferred to our institution for further pulmonary and infectious disease workup. Upon presentation to our emergency room, the patient continued to endorse pleuritic chest pain and back pain. His vital signs were as follows: a temperature of 36.7°C, blood pressure of 147/78, heart rate of 92, respiratory rate of 22, and SpO<sub>2</sub> of 93% on room air. He could speak in complete sentences and required 3 L/min supplemental oxygen to maintain normal SpO<sub>2</sub>. His physical exam was significant for decreased lung sounds posteriorly on auscultation bilaterally.\n\n【10】  \n**(a)**\n\n【11】  \n**(b)**\n\n【12】  \n**(c)**\n\n【13】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【14】Figure 1 \n\n【15】CTA from the outside hospital imaged prior to transfer demonstrating large cystic lesions in the (a) axial, (b) sagittal, and (c) coronal views.\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 2 \n\n【19】Anteroposterior chest radiographs of the patient during COVID-19 infection approximately 1 month prior to the current hospital admission.\n\n【20】The patient was admitted to the medical unit for diagnostic workup and medical management. The complete blood count (CBC) showed a white blood cell count of 10,400/mm<sup>3</sup> with 70% neutrophils, a hemoglobin level of 15.3 g/dL, and platelets of 352 × 10<sup>3</sup>/_μ_L. Serum chemistries, liver function tests, and procalcitonin levels were within normal limits.\n\n【21】The initial differentials included infectious etiologies that cause lung abscesses, including bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial infections. An extensive infectious disease workup including respiratory cultures, fungal serologies, and HIV and acid-fast smears was conducted, and results were grossly negative. Bronchoscopy and bronchoscopic alveolar lavage were also negative for identification of infectious etiology. Upon further review of chest films with our radiologist, it was determined that the air and fluid levels were in the pleural space and the patient had bilateral loculated hydropneumothoraces. On further questioning, the patient denied any recent trauma and surgical interventions.\n\n【22】Once the diagnosis of bilateral loculated hydropneumothoraces was made, traumatic and iatrogenic causes were considered. However, the patient denied any history of trauma and recent lung-related procedures. A congenital problem was also unlikely, as chest imaging did not have these lesions a few weeks prior.\n\n【23】Broad-spectrum antibiotics were started initially, but they were discontinued as the infectious workup returned negative. Once the diagnosis of loculated hydropneumothoraces was confirmed, bilateral 8.5-French pigtail catheters were placed into the patient’s posterior left and right hemithoraces under ultrasound guidance (Figure 3). Analysis of the drained pleural fluid was performed. No malignant cells were identified; reactive appearing mesothelial cells and blood were noted. The fluid consisted of fluid protein 4.9 g/dL, albumin 2.9 g/dL, amylase 17 U/L, cholesterol 130 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 285 U/L, and triglycerides 47 mg/dL. A pathogen panel on the pleural fluid was grossly negative, and cultures of the fluid demonstrated no growth.\n\n【24】  \n\n【25】  \n\n【26】Figure 3 \n\n【27】Anteroposterior chest radiograph confirming chest tube placement.\n\n【28】A continuous air leak was present in both the chest tubes for the first 3-4 days, raising the concern for bronchopleural fistulas. The thoracic surgery team contemplated surgical intervention, but the air leak began to slow down after the fourth day. Despite the improvements in the air leak, however, the chest tube could not be removed because the cavities continued to reappear whenever suction was discontinued. Repeat chest imaging, two weeks later, showed that the pneumothoraces had decreased in size but were not entirely resolved. Eventually, the patient was discharged home on room air with bilateral chest tubes attached to Heimlich valves.\n\n【29】Repeat imaging was performed at regular intervals using either chest X-ray or CT (Figure 4). Repeat CT at 1 month demonstrated interval resolution of the pleural collections with only a minimal amount of the pleural fluid remaining on the left, and the chest tubes were removed at that time. Repeat CT at 6 weeks (2 weeks after tube removal) was similar to that of 4 weeks, and the hydropneumothoraces were considered resolved (Figure 5). Furthermore, routine imaging was discontinued at that time.\n\n【30】  \n\n【31】  \n\n【32】Figure 4 \n\n【33】Anteroposterior chest radiograph taken 1 week after chest tube placement.\n\n【34】  \n**(a)**\n\n【35】  \n**(b)**\n\n【36】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【37】Figure 5 \n\n【38】Repeat CT demonstrating resolution of hydropneumothoraces in the (a) axial and (b) coronal views.\n\n【39】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【40】Pneumothorax is a relatively rare complication of COVID-19 infection \\[2\\]. However, many reports found a higher incidence of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 compared to other causes of ARDS and proposed a few possible mechanisms \\[3, 4\\]. The significant air hunger in patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 infection leads to increased tidal volume and respiratory rates \\[3, 4\\]. Increased respiratory drive with intense patient inspiratory efforts results in large tidal volumes, which can result in major swings in transpulmonary pressures. These transpulmonary pressure changes increase the risk of air leaking outside the alveolar space (pneumomediastinum/pneumothorax) \\[9\\]. Large tidal volume swings and changes in transpulmonary pressures also perpetuate a form of lung injury called patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) \\[10\\].\n\n【41】While the possible mechanisms of pneumothorax in the context of an ongoing COVID-19 infection have been described, there has been substantially less discussion of the mechanisms and risk factors of pneumothorax after clinical recovery from COVID-19. Review of the recent literature demonstrates that there have been only a handful of cases of a spontaneous pneumothorax after clinical recovery from COVID-19. Notably, some of these cases have occurred in a patient without any underlying risk factors for pneumothorax \\[11,12\\]. Thus, this complication appears to have the potential to develop in the absence of traditionally implicated risk factors, which include the presence of active pulmonary disease, treatment using mechanical ventilation, or smoking status \\[13\\]. Similarly, there are also insufficient data currently to determine whether vaccination status is protective of this particular late complication in patients who do develop COVID-19.\n\n【42】Our case presents a unique variation of this complication that is noteworthy for two reasons. First is the delayed presentation, i.e., the patient presented after clinical resolution of the acute COVID-19 infection. Second is the atypical radiological characteristics, i.e., it is rare for a patient to have bilateral loculated spontaneous hydropneumothoraces in any context, and ours may be the only reported case of such a complication after COVID-19 infection.\n\n【43】We could not confidently ascertain the etiology of delayed pneumothoraces even upon detailed history and exam. The patient’s demographics did not fit those typical of spontaneous pneumothorax \\[8\\]. He did not have any pleural or pulmonary procedures or any form of trauma that could have led air to enter the pleural space. In addition, the pneumothoraces were not present on chest imaging performed during the previous hospitalization a few weeks prior (Figure 2) and this delayed manifestation makes this pathology even rarer. The initial radiologic read of the bilateral lung lesions was noncommittal and led to the workup of infectious etiologies. However, reviewing the imaging again with the chest radiologist established that the abnormalities were in the pleural space.\n\n【44】While there is no conclusive way to say that bilateral loculated spontaneous hydropneumothoraces were due to the patient’s recent COVID-19 infection, the temporal relationship of the illness and the abnormalities a few weeks later, the absence of any other apparent causes, and other reports of increased risk of pneumothorax in COVID-19 patients justify this attribution as highly likely.\n\n【45】The medical community is still just beginning to understand the possible short- and long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infections. As clinicians continue to study the widespread effects of the virus and its lingering impact, it is plausible and unfortunate that such seemingly rare complications may become more commonplace.\n\n【46】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【47】Documentation in the literature of the spectrum of possible complications of COVID-19 is vital, as we are still learning more about the varied presentations of COVID-19. Researchers have advocated for the importance of both monitoring and counseling in the context of recovery from COVID-19 \\[1\\]. This case, among others reporting on sequelae of known COVID-19 infections, provides evidence to justify resource allocation toward continued outpatient monitoring and primary care visits in the weeks and months following resolution of an inpatient stay for COVID-19.\n\n【48】#### Data Availability\n\n【49】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【50】#### Consent\n\n【51】A written consent form was obtained from the patient for publication of this study.\n\n【52】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【53】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We, hereby, present the first case of AGEP following treatment with remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19, without hydroxychloroquine use, which serves as a reminder to consider remdesivir as a possible causative agent when dealing with AGEP presentation in COVID patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been well-known for its multisystemic involvement; besides respiratory manifestations, mucocutaneous symptoms have been among the most common presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[1\\]. Cutaneous manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection can range from erythematous or maculopapular eruptions and urticaria to blisters, petechiae, and livedo reticularis \\[2\\]. Skin involvement can occur as the sole manifestation of COVID-19 infection, intervene during the course of infection, or appear after the infection has subsided \\[3, 4\\]. On the other hand, cutaneous reactions can be a manifestation of a new-onset dermatosis or an exacerbation of an existing condition \\[5\\]. The underlying cause of this phenomenon can be the virus’s direct invasion into the skin and mucosal surfaces, the immunologic inflammatory response elicited by the virus, or the side effects of therapeutics used in the settings of SARS-CoV-2 infection \\[6, 7\\].\n\n【4】Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an exanthematous condition with an abrupt onset, which predominantly occurs as a result of a drug reaction. In fact, other factors such as infections, vaccinations, chemicals contact, and insect bites can also be triggering factors for AGEP \\[5\\]. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, an increased rate of AGEP has been reported, which could be attributed to the high prevalence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus as the causative pathogen, or the result of medications used in these settings. Here, we report a case of COVID-19 associated with AGEP with significant diagnostic challenges and complications, and we present a brief literature review.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 62-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic with a generalized pruritic skin rash. She mentioned a history of SAR-CoV-2 infection one month earlier, for which she had undergone remdesivir treatment. Two days after the completion of treatment, she developed cutaneous reactions beginning in the trunk and extending to the extremities. She also mentioned a history of Addison’s disease, for which she was taking prednisolone and fludrocortisone. On physical examination, widespread pustular eruptions with an erythematous base were covering all of her body surfaces except for the head and the neck area (Figure 1). The hair and nails were intact. No mucosal involvement was detected. She was started on high-dose oral prednisolone and cyclosporine in conjunction with acitretin and topical emollient. A few days later, she returned to the clinic with fever and toxicity. Laboratory evaluation revealed thrombocytopenia and transaminitis. Therefore, we admitted her for further workup. We initially stopped all the drugs she was taking, including cyclosporine and acitretin, and took a skin biopsy.\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】Generalized pustular eruptions with an erythematous base on the body (b) and extremities (a).\n\n【11】The histopathology report was indicative of linear neutrophilic parakeratosis with mild acanthosis and focal spongiosis, along with scattered necrotic keratinocyte, ectatic capillaries, and perivascular interstitial lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration in the dermis, all compatible with the diagnosis of AGEP (Figure 2). Then, we started her on methylprednisolone pulse and IVIG due to the possibility of idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) in this patient. She was tested negative for COVID-19 and HIV-Ab. The chest CT scan, as was expected, showed diffuse ground-glass opacities in both the lungs compatible with a convalescent pulmonary phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 3). Three days after the initiation of intensive therapy, platelet counts increased and liver enzymes decreased. The eruptions rapidly resolved within a few days; therefore, we switched the therapy to intravenous hydrocortisone and then to prednisolone with gradual tapering. At the time of discharge, postpustular desquamation was demonstrated. At follow-up visits, the patient did not describe any relapses.\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】Neutrophilic parakeratosis with mild acanthosis and focal spongiosis, along with the scattered necrotic keratinocytes, ectatic capillaries, and perivascular interstitial lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration: H&E ×40 (a); H&E ×100 (b).\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】Diffuse ground-glass opacities in both the lungs compatible with the convalescent pulmonary phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an acute pustular dermatosis with the abrupt onset of a great number of pustules with edematous and erythematous bases \\[8\\].\n\n【22】Several conditions, including infections, vaccination, and medications, have been mentioned as precipitating factors of AGEP \\[9\\]. The COVID-19 pandemic has unveiled a wide range of dermatologic disorders, new-onset or flare, in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Therefore, this virus should also be listed among the infectious causes of AGEP \\[10\\].\n\n【23】Medications most commonly associated with AGEP include pristinamycin, aminopenicillins, fluoroquinolones, antimalarials, sulfonamides, terbinafine, azoles, protease inhibitors, dapsone, pantoprazole, diltiazem, corticosteroids, azithromycin, NSAIDs, and antiepileptic agents \\[8\\]. Among the common therapeutics used during a SARS-CoV-2 infection with the probability of inducing AGEP, we can name hydroxychloroquine, which is the most notorious medication for inducing AGEP, favipiravir, azithromycin, NSAIDs, protease inhibitors such as lopinavir-ritonavir, anticoagulants, and glucocorticoids \\[11–19\\]. Our patient had received azithromycin, dexamethasone, naproxen, and remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the onset of AGEP could be attributed to any of the mentioned agents, although there has been no definite report of remdesivir-associated AGEP.\n\n【24】In AGEP, the duration of drug exposure before the onset of the symptoms varied from a few hours to a few weeks depending on the causative drug \\[17\\]. Our case presented with AGEP 4 weeks after receiving COVID treatment, which was a longer latency period compared to AGEP reported in COVID-19 infected patients in the recent literature, which makes it difficult to attribute the AGEP to these medications. However, one can infer that the combination of each of these medications, including remdesivir and genetic disposition with COVID-19 induced cytokine storm, led to the delayed development of AGEP in this case. In fact, AGEP is a hypersensitivity reaction mediated by CD8+/CD4 +T cells. Keratinocyte apoptosis occurs secondary to the migration of drug-specific T cells to the skin via granzyme B and the Fas ligand mechanism \\[20\\].\n\n【25】Moreover, interferon-gamma and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors released by the drug-specific T cells could lead to prolongation of the process \\[21\\].\n\n【26】Though AGEP might be considered as an unreported side effect of remdesivir, which has been widely used during the COVID era, it could be merely the result of the resemblance of inflammatory cytokine cascade alterations in the setting of both COVID-19 and AGEP, which let us consider these lesions as some late-onset cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 \\[22\\]. Further reports will shed more light on this issue.\n\n【27】Eliminating the causative trigger, such as ceasing the drug or treating the infection, is the cornerstone of AGEP management. Other potentially useful options include moist dressings and topical antiseptics, systemic antibiotics if superinfection intervenes, and topical or systemic corticosteroids \\[23, 24\\]. However, in severe or recalcitrant cases, cyclosporine and intravenous immunoglobulin may be beneficial \\[25\\].\n\n【28】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】We reported a case of AGEP, which might have been triggered by COVID-19 infection itself or be considered as an unreported possible side effect of remdesivir, to emphasize the necessity of paying more attention to history-taking and clinical suspicion as key factors to reaching the correct diagnosis \\[26–31\\]. Furthermore, one can infer from our report that when dealing with skin findings, remdesivir should be kept in mind as a causative agent.\n\n【30】#### Data Availability\n\n【31】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【32】#### Additional Points\n\n【33】_Key Clinical Message._ The authors presented the first case of AGEP following treatment with remdesivir in a patient with COVID-19 without hydroxychloroquine use which could be an important issue when dealing with cutaneous rashes, considering the widespread use of remdesivir in the COVID era.\n\n【34】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【35】Ethical approval from the Medical Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences was provided.\n\n【36】#### Consent\n\n【37】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【38】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【39】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【40】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【41】F.M visited the patient.

We presented a 24-year-old girl who was admitted for chronic cough and recurrent pneumonia associated with constitutional symptoms. She was feverish with a temperature of 39°C and had tachycardia and tachypnoea with an oxygen saturation of 98%. Investigations revealed leukocytosis. CXR showed right lower lobe consolidation, and CT thorax demonstrated collapse consolidation of the right middle and lower lobe, along with associated dilated segmental bronchioles and diffuse patch ground-glass opacity in both lung fields. Bronchoscopy revealed a pen cap at the entrance of the right lower lobe. Patient symptoms improved after removal of the foreign body. In patients with recurrent chest infection, the physician should check for the possibility of FBA and prompt for a referral to a tertiary center for further evaluation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Foreign body aspiration (FBA) is a common medical problem. Prompt action needs to be taken for early treatment and minimize the severity and fatal consequences. In the US, FBA leads to 7% of accidental death among children age less than four-year-old and 75 to 85% of accidental death in children under the age of 15 years \\[1\\]. FBA in adults mostly is seen in the sixth or seventh decade of life \\[2\\]. FBA can be further classified into organic and inorganic materials. Most organic materials causing FBA among children are nuts and seeds while among adults are food and bones. The most common types of inorganic FBA in children are beads, coins, pins, small parts of toys, or school pieces of equipment, i.e., pen caps. Dental prostheses, pills, and tops from beverage cans are the commonest FBA materials found among adult populations \\[1–3\\].\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 24-year-old girl who has no medical illness was presented to the hospital with a one-year history of chronic cough and chest infection. She also had a loss of appetite and loss of weight for the past year. She was investigated for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and it turned out to be negative. She noticed that her cough was getting worse, and she also had an episode of hemoptysis a week before the presentation.\n\n【6】On examination, she was feverish with a temperature of 39°C. Her blood pressure was 100/56 mmHg, her heart rate was 150 beats/min, and her respiratory rate was 30 breaths/min. She was hypoxic with oxygen saturation under room air of 89%. In the emergency department, she was further deteriorating, and her oxygen saturation was dropped to 80% despite on a high flow mask. She was in respiratory distress, and we decided to intubate her. Respiratory examination revealed reduced air entry and coarse crepitations on auscultation as well as dullness on percussion over the right lower zone. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【7】Blood investigations revealed leukocytosis with a total white blood cell count of 10.4 × 10<sup>9</sup> (L). The rest of the blood investigations were normal. Chest X-ray showed a right lower lobe consolidation (Figure 1). Computed tomography of the lung demonstrated a collapse consolidation of the right middle and lower lobe, along with associated dilated segmental bronchioles. Diffuse patch ground-glass opacity was seen in both lung fields but worst in the left side and minimal fibrotic changes with associated pleural thickening in both apexes (Figure 2). Tracheal aspiration fluid culture and sensitivity had no growth after five days, and the tuberculous bacilli smear was negative. Mantoux test (purified protein derivative) was also negative. She was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and was started on intravenous antibiotics. Unfortunately, her general condition and blood parameter were not improved; therefore, we decided to proceed with bronchoscopy. We are caught in a surprise to find a blue-colored foreign body at the entrance of the right lower lobe bronchus during the bronchoscopy (Figure 3). The foreign body was removed from the right lower bronchus, and it was a pen cap (Figure 4). After removal of the foreign body, the patient's clinical condition improved tremendously, and she was extubated. She was subsequently discharged after ten days of admission. Further history was obtained from the patient before she was discharged. She admitted that she accidentally ingested the pen cap while biting the pen cap while writing. She did not seek any medical advice at that time as she was asymptomatic.\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Chest radiography showed right lower lobe consolidation.\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】Computed tomography of the lung demonstrated collapse consolidation of the right middle and lower lobe along with the lower lobe with associated dilated segmental bronchioles.

Discussion\n\n【28】FBA materials are different according to the age group. Among children, they are prone to inhale materials such as nuts, seeds, beads, coins, pins, small parts of varying toys, or school equipment such as a pen cap. The study by Adjesto et al. involving 33 children in Northern Ghana showed the commonest FBA in children was groundnuts (39.4%), and the remaining was metallic objects (21.1%). The bronchoscopic finding noted foreign bodies (FBs) mostly localized to the right (24.2%) and left (24.2%) main bronchi, respectively \\[4\\]. There was a large study population conducted by Ciftci et al. in 2003 involving 663 children who suspected FBA, and 75% of them ingested organic materials such as sunflower seeds (27%), roasted chick-peas (15%), hazelnut (12%), and peanut (4%). In the same study, 25% of FBA cases involving inorganic materials which were straight pins (7%), the lid of ballpoint pens (6.2%), and plastic toy pieces (3.4%). However, the bronchoscopic finding noted FBs were mostly located in the right main bronchus (37%), left main bronchus (26%), and trachea (12%), respectively \\[5\\].\n\n【29】The FBA in the adult is unique as the commonest materials inhaled were food, bones, dental prostheses, pills, and tops from the beverage \\[6\\]. In our patient situation, we found pen caps which are usually found in children and toddlers. This is what happens when someone had a habit of biting the pen caps while writing and then incidentally swallowing the cap, which subsequently dislodged to the respiratory system instead of the alimentary system.\n\n【30】The symptoms and severity of FBA is variable from mild to severe, and it depends on the site of occlusion. Occlusion at the level of the larynx can cause choking and gagging. The patient will be presented with symptoms of hoarseness of voice, aphonia, and cyanosis and worst-case scenario, sudden death. Inspiratory stridor occurs when the obstruction is at the level of the trachea. However, an occlusion at the bronchus may cause cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and chest pain \\[7, 8\\].\n\n【31】Chest X-ray (CXR) is essential in the diagnosis of FBA. Although 90% of the foreign bodies are radiolucent, a standard radiological workup including a posteroanterior and a lateral chest film and a lateral soft tissue neck radiograph should be done. If the patient presented within 24 hours, the CXR finding could be normal. The initial CXR finding will be unilateral or segmental hyperaeration, and the subsequent finding could be atelectasis, air trapping, pulmonary infiltrates, and mediastinal shift on expiratory film \\[9\\].\n\n【32】The gold standard approach for diagnosing FBA is by doing flexible/rigid bronchoscopy \\[10–13\\]. Rigid bronchoscopy is the safest and preferred instrument used in the pediatric population, whereas in adults, the flexible bronchoscope is the preferred instrument for the diagnosis and removal of airway foreign bodies compared to rigid bronchoscope \\[1, 2, 14\\]. Removal of a foreign body by using bronchoscopy from the tracheobronchial area must be done by a trained and experienced person to minimize and avoid unnecessary complications \\[13, 15\\].\n\n【33】Delayed complications associated with retained foreign body include nonresolving pneumonia, lung abscess, recurrent hemoptysis, lung fibrosis, obstructive emphysema, and bronchiectasis \\[16–18\\]. In our patient, chronic retention of a foreign body in the bronchus lead to obstructive pneumonia. Localize obstructive bronchiectasis is one of the most important complications of a chronic FBA and may necessitate a surgical resection if it is complicated with recurrent infections. Obstructive bronchiectasis may develop many years after the unrecognized FBA. The standard surgical treatment for bronchiectasis is partial lobectomy of the affected lobe. There was a study reported that removal of the foreign body via bronchoscopy could achieve resolution of bronchiectasis and bronchial dilatation in a chronic FBA \\[13\\]. Hence, flexible bronchoscopy should always be considered in cases with localized bronchiectasis or nonresolving pneumonia for the possibility of FBA to avoid patients from an unnecessary surgical procedure \\[13, 14, 19\\].\n\n【34】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【35】FBA should always be considered in the etiology of recurrent chest infections or hemoptysis, lung abscess, middle lobe syndrome, fibrotic changes such as scar formation, and bronchiectasis. Early suspicion of FBA among patients presented with recurrent chest infections should prompt the medical practitioner to make an early referral to a tertiary center for further evaluations. The community should be educated regarding the symptoms of foreign body aspiration so that there was no delay in seeking medical treatment. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a safe procedure for the initial diagnosis of a foreign body. It can avoid unnecessary general anesthesia and surgical resection. Moreover, the success rate of the flexible bronchoscope in removing foreign bodies can be as high as 100% in experienced hands. Removal of a foreign body can result in the resolution of lung parenchyma or bronchial pathology and hence can prevent unnecessary surgery.\n\n【36】#### Data Availability\n\n【37】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【38】#### Consent\n\n【39】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for the anonymized information to be published in this article.\n\n【40】#### Disclosure\n\n【41】This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\n\n【42】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【43】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\n\n【44】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【45】SS wrote the manuscript.

Three patients manifested with normal blood pressure, recurrent hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Only case 2 had obvious hypomagnesemia. Gene sequencing showed a compound heterozygous mutation in SCL12A3 in case 1 and a homozygous mutation in SCL12A3 in case 2. Heterozygous mutations in SCL12A3 and CLCNKB were found in case 3. Then, the literature was reviewed. The keyword “Gitelman syndrome” was inputted into the PubMed, Wanfang Database, and CNK to search all Chinese patients with GS diagnosed by gene mutations and to extract complete clinical data from December 1998 to 2018. Finally, a total of 124 cases of GS were included. No significant differences in the levels of serum potassium and magnesium were observed among the different gene mutations, and the serum magnesium levels in adults were lower than those of the juvenile. GS with reduced blood magnesium had a serious clinical phenotype. Therefore, GS had a diverse phenotype, and its final diagnosis required genetic profiling. The relationship of gene mutation and clinical phenotype needed further study.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Gitelman syndrome (GS) is an autosomal recessive renal tubular disease, first reported by Gitelman et al. in 1966 \\[1\\]. GS is caused by a mutation in the SLC12A3 gene which encodes a thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (NCCT) \\[2, 3\\]. CLCNKB mutations form the molecular basis of classical Bartter syndrome (cBS) as it encodes chloride channels in the renal tubular basement membrane \\[4\\]. It was recently reported that CLCNKB mutations also cause GS \\[2, 5\\]. In this study, 36 hypokalemia-related genes were sequenced and analyzed by high-throughput second-generation sequencing in 3 patients with hypokalemia. We aimed to identify gene mutation sites that could improve disease diagnosis and treatment. We also searched full-text journals published in the PubMed, WanFang Database, and China Knowledge Network (CNK) to summarize the relationship between clinical data and mutation types.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】All 3 patients showed renal potassium loss, metabolic alkalosis, high renin activity, but normal blood pressure. The patients did not take long-term laxatives, diuretics, and other drugs, excluding secondary factors such as hyperthyroidism, primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, cortisol hypertrophy, renin tumors, or tubular acidosis.\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 23-year-old male patient was hospitalized for hypokalemia since 2 years. Two years earlier, the patient had hypokalemia due to severe diarrhea after eating unclean food. No fatigue, numbness of limbs, palpitation, or chest tightness was noted. Serum potassium was 2.77 mmol/L during a routine physical examination. The patient developed normally and is unmarried. There was no history of similar disease in the family. Consanguineous marriage was denied. After admission, a physical examination was performed: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg. The results of electrolytes at admission showed that the levels of serum potassium and serum magnesium were 2.84 mmol/L and 0.77 mmol/L, respectively. Blood gas analysis showed mild metabolic alkalosis.\n\n【8】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【9】A 41-year-old male patient was hospitalized due to elevated blood sugar levels that persisted for half a year. The patient suffered from hypokalemia for 8 years (blood potassium 2.5–2.9 mmol/L). The patient suffered from occasional feebleness and aching in both the lower limbs, which improved after potassium supplementation. There was no history of similar disease in the family. Consanguineous marriage was seen in his parents. After admission, a physical examination was conducted: blood pressure, 108/68 mmHg. The results of electrolytes at admission showed that the levels of serum potassium and serum magnesium were 2.39 mmol/L and 0.56 mmol/L, respectively. Blood gas analysis showed metabolic alkalosis.\n\n【10】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【11】A 37-year-old female patient was hospitalized for reduplicated twitching limbs for 10 years and syncope on 3 occasions. Ten years earlier, the patient suffered from limb twitching without obvious induction, which was accompanied by numbness and the twitching of both hands. Over the last 10 years, recurrent syncope occurred on three occasions. This was accompanied by sweating, a loss of consciousness, and urine incontinence. The symptoms lasted for several minutes and improved spontaneously, mostly after fatigue. In many emergency cases, the patient’s serum potassium level was 2.5–3.0 mmol/L. The 24-hour urinary calcium excretion quantitative value was 2.57 mmol, which was lower than the normal reference value. In addition, the oral hydrochlorothiazide diuretic test (HCT test) was performed in this patient as described by Colussi et al. \\[6\\]. The results showed that the maximum difference of chlorine excretion rate before and after HCT test was 2.1%, indicating that there was dysfunction of distal renal tubules. Moreover, the patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and failed to adhere to medication. Her deceased grandfather suffered from limb numbness and was not examined for blood potassium. Her mother suffered from limb numbness and low blood potassium levels (the specific situation is unknown), but her symptoms improved after oral potassium chloride. The elderly brothers and sisters were assessed for blood potassium which was normal on 3 occasions. One elderly sister died, the cause of death being unclear. A cousin displayed numbness of the limbs with blood potassium levels of 2.81 mmol/L. One son had no obvious numbness in his limbs, and his blood potassium was normal. A family tree is shown in Figure 1. Following admission, a physical examination was performed: blood pressure, 126/80 mmHg. The results of electrolytes at admission showed that the levels of serum potassium and serum magnesium were 3.29 mmol/L and 0.79 mmol/L, respectively. Blood gas analysis showed metabolic alkalosis.\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 1 \n\n【15】Family tree of the case 3 families who suffer from hypokalemia. Square = male, circle = female.\n\n【16】There were no abnormal blood lipids in the 3 patients including blood coagulation factors. Liver and kidney function were normal. Amongst the patients, case 2 had diabetes mellitus. The results of blood potassium, magnesium, calcium, 24-hour urine potassium, and blood gas analysis are detailed in Table 1. All 3 patients had hypokalemia, renal potassium loss, and metabolic alkalosis. Thyroid function, adrenal cortex hormones, and aldosterone were normal. Renin levels increased in all 3 cases. In addition, no obvious abnormalities in adrenal CT and pituitary MRI were observed in the 3 patients.\n\n【17】Table 1 \n\n【18】Serum electrolytes, 24-hour urine potassium, blood gas analysis, and renin aldosterone levels of the 3 cases.\n\n【19】High-throughput second-generation sequencing and bioinformatics analysis of the 36 hypokalemia-related genes were performed to identify possible mutation sites. Direct sequencing was used to verify the patients and their parents (Table 2). In case 1, two compound heterozygous mutations in the SCL12A3 gene were identified. One originated from the father (p. T60M), and the other originated from the mother (p. L858H). Case 2 had a homozygous mutation (p.N359K) from the parents. Case 3 had two genetic mutations from the mother, including the P.T60M mutation in the SCL12A3 and P.W391R mutation in the CLCNKB gene. These are known as Bartter syndrome type III and classic Bartter syndrome mutations.\n\n【20】Table 2 \n\n【21】Gene mutations in the 3 patients.\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Literature Review\n\n【23】We inputted the keyword “Gitelman syndrome” into the PubMed, Wanfang Database, and CNK to search all Chinese articles from December 1998 to 2018. Following screening, 48 papers with detailed and complete patient data were selected. A total of 124 cases were diagnosed as GS by gene mutation analysis. The age of onset ranged from 1 year to 64 years. Amongst the patients, 25 were ≤18 years old. A total of 17 patients had normal serum magnesium.\n\n【24】Amongst the 124 cases, there were 56 compound heterozygous mutations, 28 homozygous mutations, 26 multiple mutations, and 14 single heterozygous mutations. The 124 cases included 17 frameshift mutations and 6 nonsense mutations (Table 3). The detection of urinary potassium was influenced by the levels of blood potassium and whether the patients received supplementary potassium. The reference values of urinary magnesium differed between hospitals. And the difference of aldosterone renin levels was greater. We therefore compared only serum potassium and magnesium levels amongst the mutants.\n\n【25】Table 3 \n\n【26】Comparison of blood potassium and blood magnesium levels across the different mutation types ( ± _s_).\n\n【27】No significant differences between the 23 cases of frameshift and nonsense mutations and the 101 cases of other mutations in terms of blood potassium and magnesium levels were observed. No significant differences in serum potassium and magnesium levels were observed amongst the groups with compound heterozygous mutations, homozygous mutations, multiple mutations, and single heterozygous mutations. There were no obvious abnormalities in serum potassium levels in the adult or juvenile groups, but the serum magnesium levels in the adult group were lower than those of the juvenile group (Table 4). In addition, the average serum potassium level in the low blood magnesium group was significantly decreased compared with the normal blood magnesium group () (Table 5).\n\n【28】Table 4 \n\n【29】Comparison of serum potassium and magnesium levels in the adult and juvenile groups ( ± _s_).\n\n【30】Table 5 \n\n【31】Comparison of serum potassium levels between the low blood magnesium and normal blood magnesium groups ( ± _s_).\n\n【32】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【33】GS is characterized by hypokalemia, hypomagnesia, hypocalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, hyperrenin-angiotensin aldosterone, and normal or low blood pressure. It is a common tubular genetic disease caused by mutations in the SLC12A3 gene \\[1\\]. The disease is autosomal recessive inheritance, and the symptom rarely occurs before the age of six. GS is mostly diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood, and its general clinical features include muscle weakness and tetany. Mutations in the CLCNKB gene that encode the renal basement chloride channel form the molecular basis of the classical Bartter’s syndrome \\[4\\]. GS and Bartter’s syndrome overlap according to the phenotype. Hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria are the major features of GS \\[7\\], which differs from the classical Bartter’s syndrome. However, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria are not always present in patients with GS \\[8\\]. It has been reported that the CLCNKB mutations in the classical Bartter’s syndrome cause cases similar to GS \\[2, 5\\].\n\n【34】All 3 cases of hypokalemia were diagnosed in adulthood. Case 1 had no obvious myasthenia, convulsions of the hands and feet, and hypomagnesemia, but only mild metabolic alkalosis. The clinical phenotype was similar to Bartter’s syndrome. Case 2 showed occasional weakness and soreness of both lower limbs, mild hypomagnesemia, and hypochloride metabolic alkalosis. The clinical manifestations of case 3 were severe, with obvious weakness of both lower limbs, convulsion and asthenia, and syncope. Following potassium supplementation, the symptoms improved. There was no hypomagnesemia, and the 24-hour urinary calcium excretion quantitative value was significantly decreased. The clinical phenotype was similar to that of Bartter’s syndrome. The genetic analysis of cases 1 and 2 were SCL21A3 complex heterozygous mutations and homozygous mutations, respectively. All three mutation sites were previously reported in the literature \\[9–11\\]. In case 3, there were two gene mutations, both from the mother. One was the p.t60m mutation in the SCL12A3 gene, and the other was the p.w391r mutation of the CLCNKB gene, which was type of gene mutation of III Barter’s syndrome. To date, the p.w391r mutation of the CLCNKB gene represents a newly discovered mutation site and a nonpolymorphic site, the incidence rates of which are low. Moreover, the mutations were not reported in the professional edition of the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). GS and Bartter’s syndrome are autosomal recessive inheritance. It was reported that chloride clearance test can effectively differentiate GS and BS \\[12\\]. In order to further confirm whether case 3 is GS, we carried out hydrochlorothiazide load test on the patient. The results showed that the chlorine excretion rate did not increase significantly after the administration of hydrochlorothiazide. Therefore, it was preliminarily determined that the patient was GS. But further genome-wide sequencing and multiplexed probe amplification (MLPA) is required to detect large fragment deletions or duplications.\n\n【35】It has been reported that phenotypic differences exist not only in family members but also in patients with the same genetic mutations \\[13\\]. Case 3 also had Graves’ disease. The thyroid function was normal during hospitalization, and no previous medication was administered. Zhou et al. \\[14\\] summarized 17 cases of GS with autoimmune thyroid disease, including 13 cases with Graves’s disease. All 13 patients presented with hypokalemic periodic paralysis, the mechanism(s) of the occurrence of which remain unclear.\n\n【36】NCCT is expressed in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephrons and represents the major ion transport system in this region. The SLC12A3 gene is located on chromosome 16q13 and is approximately 55 kb in length with a total of 26 independent exons \\[2, 3\\]. The human SLC12A3 gene has been cloned and is predicted to encode a 1021 amino acid protein, that includes 12 transmembrane domains and long amino and carboxy ends. Over 100 mutations are associated with GS \\[15, 16\\], including missense mutations, nonsense mutations, coding frameshift mutations, and shear mutations. Meanwhile, homozygous mutations are rare. A large number of heterozygous mutations have been identified. In this study, 36 genes associated with hypokalemia were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. For cases 1 and 3, complex heterozygous mutations in SCL21A3 were identified. Case 2 was a homozygous mutation. The P.T60M mutation in case 1 is the most common mutation in Asians \\[13, 17\\]. The other mutations, p.l858h, were discovered by Japanese researchers in 2012 \\[10\\]. Case 2 had a homozygous mutation, and the patient’s parents were close relatives. The mutation type was P.N359K which was reported in Chinese studies in 2009 \\[11\\]. Case 3 had a heterozygous mutation which was more complex. Mutations of two genes were found, both from the mother, namely, p.t60m of SCL12A3 and p.w391r of CLCNKB. Interestingly, the patient’s mother also had hypokalemia. There are currently no reports of simultaneous SCL12A3 and CLCNKB mutations in the literature. Both mutations were heterozygous mutations. In Asia, the SCL12A3 P.T60M and CLCNKB P.W391R mutations are common. The CLCNKB mutation leads to the development of the classical Bartter’s syndrome, which has autosomal recessive inheritance. Although the frequency of heterozygous mutations increases with GS, other mutations may be present. The reasons are as follows: (1) the mutation sites may be located in a regulatory sequence of SLC12A3 that we did not sequence, such as 5′ or 3′ untranslated regions or deep introns; (2) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may interfere with the expression and function of NCCT; (3) mutations may be located in other genes that regulate NCCT function; and (4) gene expression and function may be acquired \\[17\\].\n\n【37】In this study, 124 cases of GS were diagnosed by gene mutational analysis with complete data and are summarized. These include 56 compound heterozygous mutations, 28 homozygous mutations, 26 multiple mutations, 14 single heterozygous mutations, 17 frameshift mutations, and 6 nonsense mutations. No significant differences in the levels of potassium or magnesium between the frameshift and nonsense mutations were observed, similar to previous studies \\[18\\]. Data from the Zhongshan Hospital of China showed that complex heterozygotes/homozygotes of the SLC12A3 gene have significantly lower serum potassium levels than the single heterozygotes \\[19\\]. In this study, no significant differences in serum potassium and magnesium levels were observed in either group. This may be related to the inconsistency of the detection methods. This article is a summary of an array of cases that used different detection techniques. Some employed multiplexed probe amplification technology (MLPA) detection, resulting in a higher frequency of mutation sites in which the number of compound heterozygous mutations increased. Some of the hospitals used MLPA to detect simple heterozygous mutations with different statistical parameters. This small number of cases now requires expansion to obtain statistically accurate data.\n\n【38】Electrolyte imbalances, acid-base imbalances, and clinical manifestations occur more frequently in patients with low serum magnesium \\[20, 21\\]. Amongst the 124 patients assessed in this study, 17 had normal serum magnesium, and the average serum potassium level in the low blood magnesium group was significantly decreased compared with the normal blood magnesium group. This was consistent with the more serious clinical manifestations in patients with low serum magnesium.\n\n【39】GS and the classical Bartter’s syndrome are incurable, but the prognosis is promising. However, the ion disorder in GS patients is difficult to treat and requires long-term use of a combination of medications \\[22\\]. GS-mediated hypokalemia and metabolic disorders can be corrected with potassium supplements or potassium-sparing diuretics. For severe cases, simultaneous magnesium supplementation is required \\[21\\]. The treatment of Bartter’s syndrome is to correct hypokalemia and alkalosis. Potassium-preserving diuretics such as spironolactone combined with potassium chloride help to control hypokalemia over a short time period. The most effective treatment is prostaglandin synthase inhibitors such as indomethacin, aspirin, and ibuprofen. In addition, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can reduce potassium excretion by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which may be superior to spironolactone.\n\n【40】In brief, GS had a diverse phenotype, and its final diagnosis required further genetic mutation analysis. Hypokalemia caused by hereditary diseases should be considered as the possibility of GS. The relationship of gene mutation and clinical phenotype needs further study.\n\n【41】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【42】This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University.\n\n【43】#### Consent\n\n【44】All subjects gave their informed consent to participate.\n\n【45】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【46】The authors report no conflicts of interest.\n\n【47】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【48】Xueting Li and Ruofei Chen contributed equally to this work.\n\n【49】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【50】The authors are grateful to all the patients for participating in the study.

A rare case of spontaneous rupture of SPT is reported. A 13-year-old female felt acute abdominal pain without blunt abdominal trauma. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the pancreas tail with fluid collection around it. The tumor was diagnosed as SPT with hemoperitoneum associated with spontaneous rupture. The bleeding was stopped conservatively and she was referred for surgery at three months after the rupture. At that time, CT revealed a tumor 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreas tail without distant metastases. Since peritoneal dissemination was not seen on intraoperative exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT with rupture of the capsule of tumor, and complete resection was confirmed. The patient has been followed up for two years, and she is alive without recurrence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas was first described by Frantz in 1959 \\[1\\]. SPT is regarded as an uncommon low grade malignant tumor accounting for 1-2% of exocrine pancreatic tumors, usually affecting young females \\[2–4\\]. The clinical presentations of SPT have been various and not specific. SPT was discovered by rupture and hemoperitoneum which was considered to be rare. In the literature, most of the ruptures of SPT were associated with the blunt abdominal trauma \\[5–7\\], while the spontaneous rupture seemed to be quite uncommon. We report a rare case of a spontaneous ruptured SPT which was resected completely by elective laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it (Figure 1). The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared (Figure 2). From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears (Figure 3). Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition \\[8\\]. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A \\[8\\], the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas. The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination (Figure 4). She survived without recurrence of disease for two years after the operation.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】| Urgent CT of acute abdomen.

Discussion\n\n【23】It is well known that SPT usually shows no characteristic clinical presentation, and the main nonspecific symptoms are abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain \\[2–4, 9–12\\]. In the present case, tumor was discovered by acute abdominal pain due to rupture of the tumor and hemoperitoneum. The incidence of the rupture of SPT was reported in 2.7% of 292 cases \\[13\\]. Regarding rupture of SPT, blunt abdominal trauma was the most common \\[5–7\\] and according to a review article, 3% of 718 cases of SPT were discovered after the trauma \\[3\\]. Other cases were considered to be spontaneous rupture and it was estimated to occur in approximately 1% of all SPT \\[13–15\\].\n\n【24】Since the cystic part of SPT consisted of the degeneration after the intramural hemorrhage \\[7, 9, 13, 16\\], SPT had a natural tendency to hemorrhage inside the tumor. Therefore, the spontaneous rupture of SPT was considered to result from both abrupt massive hemorrhage and increase of the pressure in the tumor. Panieri and colleagues reported a case of the major bleed into the lesser sac causing the rupture of SPT \\[16\\], and the enhanced CT also revealed a massive bleeding around the pancreatic tumor when our patient felt acute abdominal pain. Moreover, the tumor of the present case seemed to be slightly larger at the moment of rupture than three months later. When the abrupt hemorrhage occurred in the abdomen, emergency laparotomy was usually indicated. However, in the present case, the hemorrhage stopped with conservative therapy and allowed elective surgical treatment.\n\n【25】Surgical resection is the only treatment to cure SPT generally assuring a good prognosis, as reflected in the overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 95% \\[2, 3, 12\\]. Most cases of SPT have previously undergone the standard pancreatic resections such as pancreatoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy, because the tumors were relatively large and misdiagnosed as malignant disease \\[9, 11\\]. However, the surgical procedure indicated for SPT still remains controversial. Namely, taking into account the character of SPT, if at all possible the surgical procedures preserving pancreatic parenchyma and function should be selected. Butte and colleagues \\[12\\] described microscopic margins that were not considered a strong prognostic factor for the disease recurrence in SPT. Therefore, either partial resection or enucleation might be indicated for the small SPT, especially those localized in the periphery of the pancreas \\[2, 4, 11, 17, 18\\]. Actually, local resections and enucleations were performed in approximately 30% of SPT according to the recent literature \\[2, 3, 19, 20\\].\n\n【26】On the other hand, there was a report that enucleation for the pancreatic tumor had a high risk of pancreatic fistula \\[9\\]. Although postoperative pancreatic fistula was reported in 38% of sixty-one enucleation cases of the pancreatic tumor, it was considered a safe and effective procedure \\[17, 21\\]. Li and colleagues \\[19\\] recommended a minimized resection such as enucleation and partial resection for SPT, because there were no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative complications and the prognosis between the minimized resection and the standard resection.\n\n【27】In pancreatic surgery, the laparoscopic technique has been increasingly applied in recent years, but it still remains uncommon. Both enucleation and distal pancreatectomy were procedures without reconstruction. Therefore, they were the first to be performed by the laparoscopic approach \\[21, 22\\]. These laparoscopic procedures of enucleation and distal pancreatectomy have already been considered to be feasible \\[20–22\\] and have shown good indications for the low-grade malignant SPT \\[11, 21, 22\\]. It was mentioned that there were no statistically significant differences in the postoperative complications and the prognosis between laparoscopic surgery and ordinary surgery for SPT \\[20\\]. With regard to SPT, parenchyma preserving surgical procedure with laparoscopy should be considered if the tumor is small in size and located away from the main pancreatic duct.\n\n【28】There might be another argument in the surgical approach for ruptured SPT. Namely, when the emergency operation was decided just after the rupture of SPT, open surgery might usually be selected. Since acute hemorrhage due to the rupture of SPT was stopped by conservative therapy in the present case, we considered elective laparoscopic surgery. But if the peritoneal dissemination was seen on intraoperative laparoscopic exploration, the conversion to open surgery was considered necessary for curable resection of a metastatic lesion with primary tumor.\n\n【29】Recurrence was reported to occur in 10% to 15% of SPT patients after surgical treatment \\[2, 4, 10, 12\\]. Kim and colleagues \\[11\\] asserted that the tumor rupture might be the risk factor for recurrence after surgery for SPT. The previous reports showed that peritoneal dissemination of SPT occurred in only few cases even after the rupture \\[4, 14, 23, 24\\], although rupture of SPT was expected to be the most predictable factor for the peritoneal dissemination \\[14, 25\\].\n\n【30】Actually, some case reports indicated that disease free periods of the ruptured cases ranged from 12 to 66 months \\[5, 6, 15, 25, 26\\]. On the other hand, Kyokane et al. reported that the dissemination associated with the rupture of SPT was seen in only one case among the six cases of SPT with peritoneal dissemination \\[14\\]. Since the rupture of SPT has been quite uncommon, the relationship between rupture of SPT and peritoneal dissemination remains to be resolved.\n\n【31】In conclusion, a quite uncommon case of spontaneous rupture of the solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas has been described. Although emergency laparotomy is usually performed in the case with hemoperitoneum associated with rupture of the pancreatic tumor, we were able to resect SPT completely by elective laparoscopic surgery. SPT is considered to be a low-grade malignancy and a good prognosis is expected after the surgery. However, our patient who is alive without recurrence after surgery for two years should continue to be followed up carefully.\n\n【32】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【33】Susumu Takamatsu, Hiroto Nagano, Shunro Ootsukasa, Yasuyuki Kawachi, and Hiroshi Maruyama have no conflict of interests.\n\n【34】#### Acknowledgment\n\n【35】The authors give special thanks to Dr. Shigeki Arii for his help with their paper.

This tumor has a grave prognosis. We report to the best of our knowledge the first case of infantile scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumor in a 6-month-old male baby who presented with a right parietal scalp mass since the age of 1 month. This mass was initially diagnosed as scalp hemangioma based on clinical and imaging findings. However, this mass was growing fast which necessitated excision. Pathologic examination after excision showed a malignant tumor composed of sheets of rhabdoid cells. Immunohistochemically, this tumor tested positive for vimentin, CD 99, glypican-3, synaptopysin, WT-1, CK, and EMA. INI-1 immunostain was lost in the tumor cells. Subsequently, this tumor was pathologically diagnosed as extracranial scalp rhabdoid tumor. After tumor excision, the patient was referred to pediatric oncology to receive chemotherapy. Experience with scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumors is limited. However, this tumor in other organs carries a grave prognosis. Although scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumor is an extremely rare tumor, it should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of infantile scalp masses given the need of combined surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Masses in the head have a broad differential diagnosis and are usually divided into congenital versus acquired. Usually, CT and MRI are used in the evaluation of these masses initially. Congenital causes include, for example, encephaloceles, nasal gliomas, dermoid and epidermoid cysts, and benign tumors, while acquired causes include sarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), metastatic neuroblastoma, and infectious or traumatic lesions \\[1\\].\n\n【4】Extracranial rhabdoid tumor is a rare malignancy occurring in the pediatric population with a grave prognosis \\[2\\]. This tumor extracranially most commonly involves the kidney among other organs including neck, back, retroperitoneum, pelvis, and chest \\[2, 3\\].\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】We present a male premature baby with a gestational age of 33 weeks and part of twin pregnancy who presented with a right scalp parietal lump since the age of 1 month that progressively increased in size over time as shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b).\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Image of lesion at 1 month (a) and image of lesion at 6 months (b).

On sectioning, the cut surface showed solid tan-white appearance as shown in Figures 3(a) and 3(b).\n\n【20】  \n**(a)**\n\n【21】  \n**(b)**\n\n【22】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【23】Figure 3 \n\n【24】The gross findings showing a skin-covered polypoid firm mass (a) with solid tan-white cut surface (b).\n\n【25】Pathologic microscopic evaluation showed skin tissue infiltrated by malignant tumor cells composed of sheets of rhabdoid cells having abundant cytoplasm with eosinophilic hyaline globules, vesicular nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. The background stroma is fibromyxoid with high mitotic activity in addition to areas of necrosis as shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(b).\n\n【26】  \n**(a)**\n\n【27】  \n**(b)**\n\n【28】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【29】Figure 4 \n\n【30】H&E microscopic findings.

The patient was referred to pediatric oncology for staging and treatment.\n\n【41】This patient was treated according to the European rhabdoid protocol. However, the patient received just intensive chemotherapy as there was no role for radiotherapy or for autologous bone marrow transplant because of the age of the patient. The intensive chemotherapy given was composed of multiple chemotherapy regimens including the following chemotherapeutic agents: doxorubicin, ifosfamide, carboplatinum, etopside, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and actinomycin-D.\n\n【42】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【43】Rhabdoid tumors can involve the CNS primarily and are termed atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT). However, rhabdoid tumors can be extracranial either involving the kidney primarily or involving the soft tissues \\[4\\].\n\n【44】Malignant extracranial rhabdoid tumor diagnosis depends on morphologic pathologic features which are nonspecific for this tumor, since the differential diagnosis also includes other tumors such as Ewing’s sarcoma, Wilms’ tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, synovial sarcoma, undifferentiated sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma \\[5\\]. Histologically, soft tissue rhabdoid tumors (STRT) show noncohesive single cells, clusters, or sheets of large tumor cells with abundant glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm, an eccentric vesicular nucleus, and an extremely large nucleolus with immunohistochemistry showing positivity for vimentin and/or cytokeratin, and the diagnosis is confirmed with loss of INI-1 stain on immunohistochemical staining \\[5–7\\].\n\n【45】Malignant Extracranial rhabdoid tumor has been reported in multiple soft tissue organs such as neck, back, retroperitoneum, pelvis, and chest \\[2, 3\\]. We present to the best of our knowledge the first infantile extracranial rhabdoid tumor arising in the scalp although there has been a prior case report of congenital malignant rhabdoid tumor of the scalp by Cobb et al. \\[4\\]. After surgical excision and pathologic diagnosis, the patient was referred to pediatric oncology for treatment. Given the rarity of malignant extracranial rhabdoid tumor, standardized treatment protocols have not yet been popularized worldwide. Generally, treatment protocols are based on a multimodal approach, combining surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Despite many attempts to improve these various regimens, malignant extracranial rhabdoid tumor is still described as lethal \\[2, 4, 8\\]. At our institution, we used the European rhabdoid protocol for treatment, and this particular patient received just intensive chemotherapy given the young patient’s age as there was no role for radiotherapy or autologous bone marrow transplant.\n\n【46】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【47】Extracranial rhabdoid tumor is a rare tumor with grave prognosis, and diagnosis is based on histological and immunohistochemistry findings specifically a negative INI-1 immunohistochemical stain. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first infantile extracranial rhabdoid tumor of the scalp even though there has been a prior report of a congenital extracranial rhabdoid tumor of the scalp.\n\n【48】#### Data Availability\n\n【49】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【50】#### Consent\n\n【51】Parent’s permission was obtained to publish this case report.\n\n【52】#### Disclosure\n\n【53】This research article was performed as part of employment by the Royal Jordanian Medical Services.\n\n【54】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【55】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Many patients are asymptomatic, and a few may present with symptoms such as dysphagia and chest pain. However, heartburn is only reported in patients with accompanying hiatal hernia. We hereby report a giant lower esophageal leiomyoma with concomitant hiatal hernia in a young Vietnamese female, who presented with refractory gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. The diagnosis was challenging as the tumor grew outward. As a consequence, the patient did not experience dysphagia and the tumor was hardly detected under endoscopy. The hiatal hernia in this patient was probably related to the presence of the leiomyoma. It is important to look carefully for submucosal tumor at the lower esophagus and cardia under endoscopy in patients with similar manifestations.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Esophageal leiomyoma is a rare disease, which is commonly reported in patients aged 40 to 50 years with a male-to-female ratio of 2 : 1 \\[1–3\\]. About a half of patients with esophageal leiomyoma are asymptomatic \\[1\\]. Also, the majority of patients experience symptoms only if the tumor is large. The mean tumor diameter among symptomatic patients is about 5.3 cm, as compared to 1.5 cm in asymptomatic patients \\[3\\]. The most common symptom is dysphagia followed by chest pain while heartburn is only reported in patients with accompanying hiatal hernia \\[1, 2\\]. We hereby report a giant lower esophageal leiomyoma with concomitant hiatal hernia in a young female patient, who presented with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The diagnosis was challenging as the tumor protruded only a little into the esophageal lumen. As a consequence, the patient did not experience dysphagia and the tumor was hardly detected under endoscopy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 28-year-old female patient suffered from postprandial lower chest pain and heartburn for more than one year. Her past medical history and family history were unremarkable. She lost 4 kilograms and did not experience dysphagia or regurgitation. Three months before her visit to our hospital, the pain had become more severe. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) performed at another hospital showed a lower esophageal ulcer, which was located just above the gastroesophageal junction, hiatal hernia, and antral-predominant gastritis (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The _H. pylori_ antibody test was positive, and the histological result of esophageal ulcer was benign. The patient received _H. pylori_ eradication therapy followed by a regimen of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) at a standard dose in combination with antacid for more than 8 weeks. However, her pain did not resolve and she sought for medical consultation in our hospital.\n\n【6】  \n**(a)**\n\n【7】  \n**(b)**\n\n【8】  \n**(c)**\n\n【9】  \n**(d)**\n\n【10】  \n**(e)**\n\n【11】  \n**(f)**\n\n【12】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)**   \n**(f)**\n\n【13】Figure 1 \n\n【14】The esophageal ulcer just above the gastroesophageal junction and hiatal hernia detected during the first upper astrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) (a, b). The ulcer had completely healed after 10-week treatment with double-dose proton pump inhibitor. A protrusion at the cardia, which was only identified on the look down view with minimum insufflated air, suspecting submucosal lesion is shown (c, d). The UGIE performed four months after her surgery demonstrated good results of Nissen fundoplication (e, f).\n\n【15】We managed the patient as a case of refractory GERD. At first, the patient was treated with rabeprazole 20 mg bid in combination with alginate-antacid at bedtime for 2 weeks. The pain improved but was still intolerable and badly affected her sleep quality. The regimen was switched to rabeprazole 20 mg bid in combination with amitriptyline 12.5 mg at bedtime, which resulted in a complete clinical response and was continued for 10 weeks. The dose of rabeprazole was then tapered to 20 mg qd aiming to stop completely before UGIE was performed to document the efficacy of treatment. However, the pain recurred badly after about a week. The patient requested us return to double-dose rabeprazole, which again relieved the pain.\n\n【16】The second UGIE performed when the patient was still on PPI showed that the lower esophageal ulcer had completely healed (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). There was a protrusion at the cardia, which was only identified when air was minimum insufflated, suspected of a submucosal lesion. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and CT scan were performed which surprisingly showed a giant submucosal tumor at the fourth layer of the lower esophagus and the cardia (Figures 2 and 3). EUS-FNA was performed, and the histological examination confirmed that this lesion was a leiomyoma (Figure 2).\n\n【17】  \n**(a)**\n\n【18】  \n**(b)**\n\n【19】  \n**(c)**\n\n【20】  \n**(d)**\n\n【21】  \n**(e)**\n\n【22】  \n**(f)**\n\n【23】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)**   \n**(f)**\n\n【24】Figure 2 \n\n【25】Endoscopic ultrasound showed that the submucosal tumor arose from the fourth layer of the esophageal wall (a, b).

The histological findings on hematoxylin and eosin staining (d) and immunohistochemical stainings with Desmin (+) and Ki67 (+) confirmed that the tumor was a leiomyoma.\n\n【26】  \n\n【27】  \n\n【28】Figure 3 \n\n【29】Uneven thickening of the distal esophagus and cardia on the CT scan, measuring about 8 cm in length and 3.5 cm in diameter. The asterisks mark the tumor mass.\n\n【30】The patient was performed laparoscopic transhiatal surgery to enucleate the esophageal leiomyoma. In addition, hiatal hernia was repaired with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (Figure 4). As the tumor is too large, it was cut into pieces to facilitate its removal. The solid straightened tumor was approximately 8 cm × 3 cm in size (Figure 4). The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery. During the first two weeks, she had experienced dysphagia and regurgitation, which have resolved completely.\n\n【31】  \n**(a)**\n\n【32】  \n**(b)**\n\n【33】  \n**(c)**\n\n【34】  \n**(d)**\n\n【35】  \n**(e)**\n\n【36】  \n**(f)**\n\n【37】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)**   \n**(f)**\n\n【38】Figure 4 \n\n【39】The distal esophagus evolving leiomyoma was mobilized from the mediastinal pleura and structures (a, b). The leiomyoma was carefully dissected out of the esophagus (c). The tumor had been completely removed (d). Nissen fundoplication was performed (e). The postoperation specimen is shown (f).\n\n【40】Four months after her surgery, UGIE was performed again which showed good results of fundoplication surgery (Figures 1(e) and 1(f)). The patient sometimes had epigastric pain which could be completely controlled with intermittent rabeprazole therapy at a standard dose.\n\n【41】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【42】The clinical presentation of this patient would suggest dyspepsia be a differential diagnosis as postprandial pain is the predominant symptom. However, the first UGIE clearly showed an esophageal ulcer accompanying hiatal hernia. This suggested that the pain be an atypical symptom of GERD. According to the Asia-Pacific consensus, reflux symptoms which respond poorly to PPI at a standard dose in 8 weeks are considered as refractory GERD \\[4\\]. This patient satisfied this definition, and she was managed as refractory GERD. The lower esophageal ulcer as a complication of GERD and the presence of hiatal hernia were the two factors suggesting that acid suppression not be enough in this patient.\n\n【43】The findings on EUS and CT scan and intraoperative observation all showed that the tumor did not penetrate the mucosal layer. The esophageal ulcer could be due to tumor compression, which caused anatomical changes weakening the antireflux barrier. That the giant tumor was missed during the first UGIE would be due to some reasons. First, this leiomyoma tumor did not protrude much into the esophageal lumen. Therefore, dysphagia was absent and its endoscopic detection required a high suspicion with minimum air insufflation. There have been some case reports showing that esophageal leiomyoma might even masquerade as achalasia \\[5, 6\\]. Dysphagia was the predominant symptom in these patients, and UGIE revealed a dilated and tortuous esophagus with no clear findings suggesting of submucosal tumor. Second, the patient is a young female while leiomyoma has been generally reported in middle-aged, male patients \\[1–3\\]. A few case reports in Asia previously described giant esophageal leiomyoma in young females, but the diagnosis of these cases were not challenging as dysphagia was a predominant symptom and the tumors were easily identified under endoscopy \\[7, 8\\]. This is the first time that such a giant leiomyoma is reported in a young woman in Vietnam.\n\n【44】There were several options for the enucleation of such tumors, such as the thoracotomic, thoracoscopic, or laparoscopic approach \\[9, 10\\]. However, the laparoscopic transhiatal approach was chosen in order to avoid causing extensive defect in the esophageal wall, which might lead to impaired esophageal peristalsis and damage of the lower esophageal sphincter. Also, the hiatal hernia was finally repaired with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication after finishing the enucleation procedure. Recently, submucosal tunneling endoscopic resection has been introduced into the management of subepithelial lesions of the esophagus. Using meticulous dissection techniques, en bloc resection of giant esophageal leiomyoma could be performed safely and effectively in the hands of experts \\[11\\].\n\n【45】This case raises some interesting questions. First, whether the pain in this patient was due to tumor compression or cardia ulceration or it was actually an atypical reflux symptom. As the frequency and severity of the pain paralleled with the intensity of acid suppression therapy, acid reflux would be the major pathogenesis factor. But, that the pain was completely controlled with a neuromodulator add-on therapy suggested that tumor compression be a contributory factor. The weak point of this case was that there was no esophageal manometry and pH monitoring investigations to document the symptom index. However, that the pain significantly improved after tumor removal and hiatal hernia repair and only intermittent standard-dose PPI therapy was enough to control the patient’s symptoms supported this theory. Second, whether there was a direct association between the presence of leiomyoma and hiatal hernia or this coexistence was by chance in this patient. There have been several studies showing that the coexistence between hiatal hernia and lower esophageal submucosal tumor was very common \\[1, 7, 12, 13\\]. A case series on 66 patients who underwent surgery therapy for esophageal leiomyoma found that hiatal hernia presented in 15 (23%) patients \\[13\\]. The association may be incidental, but there is also suggestion that the tumor pulls the esophageal-gastric junction and causes hiatal hernia \\[7\\]. In Vietnam, the prevalence of hiatal hernia was only 2.3% among patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal symptoms \\[14\\]. Also, it was especially very uncommon in such a young female. Therefore, we believe that the hiatal hernia could be associated with the leiomyoma in this patient.\n\n【46】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【47】We report a case of giant lower esophageal leiomyoma with concomitant hiatal hernia in a young female, who presented with refractory gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. The leiomyoma was missed during the first UGIE as the tumor grew outward. It is important to look carefully for submucosal tumor at the lower esophagus and cardia under endoscopy in patients with similar manifestations.\n\n【48】#### Data Availability\n\n【49】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【50】#### Consent\n\n【51】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.\n\n【52】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【53】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n【54】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【55】Quach DT contributed to study conception and submitted the manuscript.

The syndrome is characterized by cognitive impairment, encephalopathy, psychiatric symptoms, and seizures associated with increased level of anti-thyroid antibodies. The exact pathophysiology underlying cerebral involvement is still lesser known. Although symptoms suggest a nonlesional encephalopathy in most of the cases, sometimes the clinical appearance can be subtle and may not respond to immunosuppressants or immunomodulatory agents. Here we report a case who presented with drowsiness and amnestic complaints associated with paroxysmal electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities which could be treated only with an antiepileptic drug.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hashimoto’s encephalopathy (HE) has been acknowledged as a syndrome of altered mental status varying between delusional thinking, confusion, and hallucinations with the presence of increased serum levels of anti-thyroid antibodies. Epileptic seizures may accompany these symptoms. The syndrome was first described by Brain and colleagues as a case report in 1966 \\[1\\]. HE syndrome can be acute and fulminant or chronic as in dementia \\[2\\]. Ataxia, tremor, myoclonus, focal neurologic deficit, and some psychiatric symptoms including depression, manic state, and psychosis in severe forms can be observed in this syndrome \\[3, 4\\]. HE is relatively rare and still lesser known. Here we present a patient with paroxysmal memory impairment attacks and loss of attention. Here we report and discuss clinical, electroencephalographic (EEG), and neuroimaging findings of a HE syndrome by highlighting diagnostic and treatment features.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 52-year-old woman suffering with drowsiness and memory problems was admitted to our hospital’s neurology department. She complained about disremembering some parts of a day and what she had done. These attacks were lasting for a few minutes to one hour sometimes and repeating every day in last three months. She had no history of psychiatric disease, epilepsy, or other mental problems including dementia. Neurologic examination did not reveal any focal abnormalities. Extended laboratory findings including CBC, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, vitamin B12, folate, electrolytes, blood ammonia, and glucose levels were normal. Thyroid function tests including free T3, free T4, and TSH were normal. Her mini mental state examination test score was within the normal range for her age and education level (29/30). Neither a noncontrast cranial computerized tomography (Figure 1(a)) nor the T1-weighted images of cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormalities like calcification. T1-weighted images after intravenous gadolinium administration were unremarkable. No evidence of cytotoxic edema was present on diffusion-weighted images (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2 weighted images demonstrated bilaterally symmetric basal ganglia hyperintensity (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)). On EEG, the background activity was mildly slow and irregular (Figure 2(a)). An interictal EEG recording showed bilateral paroxysms of rudimentary spike and sharp wave discharges (Figure 2(b)). Mini mental state examination test score was 27. To explain the etiology of subacute encephalopathy we examined her autoimmune markers. Serum anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-dsDNA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and ENA panel tests were negative. Anti-thyroid antibodies were elevated. Anti-TPO was 1258 U/mL and the anti-TG antibody was 154. In the light of clinic and laboratory findings she was diagnosed as HE. Intravenous methylprednisolone treatment with a dose of 1000 mg per day was initiated and maintained orally 60 mg per day. Control EEG on the 14th day of the treatment showed a normal background activity. Her attention and drowsiness were also improved. However the paroxysms of sharp waves on EEG persisted and she was still complaining about amnesia attacks. The patient was given orally levetiracetam with a dose of 1000 mg per day. On follow-up she was symptom free and her control EEG recording was normal.\n\n【6】  \n**(a)**\n\n【7】  \n**(b)**\n\n【8】  \n**(c)**\n\n【9】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Noncontrast CT scan is normal (a) and FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) images demonstrate increased T2 signal activity at bilateral lentiform and caudate nucleus (b-c).\n\n【12】  \n**(a)**\n\n【13】  \n**(b)**\n\n【14】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】EEG showing the presence of slow and irregular background (a) and bilateral sharp wave paroxysms (b).\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can cause an autoimmune encephalopathy with an unknown pathophysiology \\[5\\]. The clinic presentation of this rarely seen syndrome is variable including psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairments, seizures, and hemispheric neurologic deficits \\[6\\]. Patients with HE can be euthyroid as in our case \\[7\\]. An extended diagnostic procedure for vascular, toxic, metabolic, and infectious diseases should be performed carefully to avoid other etiologies which are not caused by thyroid dysfunctions such as autoimmune encephalopathy, infections of central nervous system, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, and CNS angiitis \\[6\\].\n\n【19】The most common cranial MRI changes in this syndrome include bilateral subcortical high signal lesions and bilateral hippocampus or thalamic lesions \\[7\\]. However, as in a recently reported case \\[8\\] our patients MRI showed bilaterally, symmetrical basal ganglia hyperintensity without any mass effect, cytotoxic edema, and calcification.\n\n【20】Our case is a patient who presented with drowsiness, loss of attention, and paroxysmal memory impairment attacks associated with symmetric slowing background activity and bilateral paroxysms of sharp wave discharges on EEG. It is well known that HE may be associated with mental and cognitive dysfunctions \\[9\\]. In a recent study, Wang et al. showed that the impairments in cognitive functions for patients with HE are similar to those with Alzheimer’s disease patients \\[10\\]. Epileptic seizures can also be seen in HE. The most frequent seizure types contain generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and complex partial seizures often associated with an EEG showing diffuse slowing background activity \\[5\\]. The syndrome can cause status epilepticus rarely \\[11, 12\\]. In HE, steroid therapy has shown to be associated with improvement or resolution of EEG findings. However, in our patient even though the slow background activity on EEG was improved after steroid therapy, the paroxysmal slow-wave discharges persisted until levetiracetam was initiated as an antiepileptic drug. Similar to our case, in two cases recently reported by Wang et al, levetiracetam was found to be effective in treatment of HE \\[10\\].\n\n【21】It is important to recognize this syndrome which is usually treatable successfully with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents such as IVIG, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and azathioprine \\[13\\]. Nevertheless, as in our case steroid therapy may not always be able to treat both clinic and electrophysiologic symptoms. Therefore appropriate antiepileptic medication should be administered.\n\n【22】HE should be considered especially in patients with encephalopathy with an unexplained etiology. But our case demonstrated that HE symptoms can be subtle. On such an occasion, the clinicians should suspect the presence of HE and evaluate anti-thyroid antibodies. But we thought that emphasis must be given to EEG which is valuable in evaluation of neurological conditions either associated with or apart from epilepsy \\[14\\]. As in our case, in patients with impaired consciousness or altered mental state EEG is important in diagnosing and monitoring the whole treatment process.\n\n【23】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【24】All authors disclose that they have no conflict of interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We describe a case of TTP which presented as an ischemic stroke. The patient presented with stroke as the primary manifestation of TTP despite a normal platelet count and mildly elevated lactate dehydrogenase level (LDH). The patient underwent two transfusions of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and ADAMTS13 levels confirmed the diagnosis of TTP after discharge. This case demonstrates the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for TTP in the setting of normal laboratory values and reveals the many atypical manifestations of TTP.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a microangiopathy characterized by a mechanical hemolytic anemia and a consumptive thrombocytopenia, resulting in end-organ damage from thrombotic occlusion of small vessels. TTP can either be acquired or congenital. The acquired form is autoimmune, caused by the development of antibodies to ADAMTS13, a proteolytic enzyme which cleaves von Willebrand Factor (vWF). The congenital form is rare and caused by a genetic mutation in the ADAMTS13 gene, leading to a deficiency of the corresponding protein. ADAMTS13 activity levels less than 10% in the presence of an inhibitor are diagnostic of acquired TTP. Microthrombi resulting from conglomerates of uncleaved vWF multimers and platelets can lead to renal failure, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular ischemia \\[1\\]. TTP left untreated has a mortality rate approximating 90%, and therefore patients with suspected TTP are treated with plasma exchange (PLEX) prior to resulting ADAMTS13 levels \\[2\\].\n\n【4】Hereditary TTP is caused by biallelic ADAMTS13 mutations. It typically presents in infancy but can also manifest in early adulthood. Patients who present with TTP in early adulthood may have a discernible trigger for an initial acute episode such as infection or pregnancy. Relapses are common in both the acquired and congenital forms and may not present in the same manner as the inciting clinical event \\[3\\]. While TTP should be suspected in all patients with otherwise unexplained microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, these laboratory findings may not always precede symptoms and signs of end-organ damage, and in many cases may not be present at all. While few patients present with the classic pentad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic deficits, renal failure, and fever, TTP in the setting of a normal to near-normal platelet is a known manifestation of hereditary TTP.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient is a 53-year-old female with a past medical history of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), asplenia, hypertension, hepatitis C, a patent foramen ovale with closure, and multiple strokes presented to our institution with a three-day history of dysequilibrium and nausea.\n\n【7】The patient was initially diagnosed with TTP at age 19 during admission for prolonged uterine bleeding after her first pregnancy. It is unclear how the first diagnosis was made. While splenectomy can be performed for patients with recurrent TTP, this patient underwent splenectomy after her first episode of TTP for unclear reasons. She had a recurrent episode of TTP during her second pregnancy at age 25. More recently, she had an episode of TTP after a cholecystectomy at age 48, with platelets dropping to 16,000/uL, and was treated with total plasma exchange and steroids.\n\n【8】Regarding her history of multiple strokes, she suffered her first stroke to the left middle cerebral artery in 2020 and was started on aspirin and statin. At this time, she was found to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO) on TEE which was thought to be contributing to the stroke; therefore, she underwent surgery for PFO closure. She remained compliant on the medical therapy and yet suffered a repeat stroke to the right corona radiata seven months later. Afterwards, she was switched from aspirin to clopidogrel and remained on a statin for stroke prevention. Despite being on optimal medical therapy, the patient suffered a third stroke to the left cerebellum just one month later. Clopidogrel was then discontinued, and she was started on apixaban 5 mg twice daily. She had been adherent to apixaban when she presented to our institution.\n\n【9】On presentation, the patient was well-appearing and in stable condition. She was found to have an elevated systolic blood pressure of 160 mmHg with otherwise stable vital signs. Neurologic examination was significant for subcortical slowing and aphasia from prior strokes and a new left upper extremity ataxia. The patient’s complete blood count was within normal limits (white blood cell count 8.7 × 10<sup>3</sup>/_μ_L, hemoglobin of 12 g/dL, and platelets of 216,000/uL). A basic metabolic panel was within normal limits. A head CT without contrast displayed no evidence of an acute intracranial abnormality. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed new ischemic changes in the left anterior cerebral artery territory involving the frontoparietal paramedian cortices, confirming the diagnosis of a new stroke.\n\n【10】Hematology was consulted on hospital day 2. The patient was found to have a normal platelet count of 208,000/uL, elevated LDH of 281 unit/L (normal 98–192), and haptoglobin of 159 mg/dL (Table 1). The patient’s pretest probability of TTP was calculated using the PLASMIC scoring system and was found to place her at a low risk of TTP. However, given her history of TTP, an ADAMTS13 activity level, a peripheral smear, and repeat hemolysis labs were obtained. Peripheral smears revealed several acanthocytes and occasional target cells with <1 schistocytes per high-power field which did not support a diagnosis of TTP. The patient continued on antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy. The patient’s platelets remained within normal range during admission, downtrending to a nadir of 195,000/uL on hospital day 3 (see Table 1). Despite resolution of symptoms and insufficient data to recommend plasma exchange, we recommend transfusion of 2 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to prevent further recurrence of stroke given the high suspicion of TTP. On hospital day 4, the patient’s platelets rose to 237,000/uL, and she was discharged from the primary neurology service with strict outpatient hematology and neurology follow-up with ADAMTS13 levels pending. The patient was counseled about the likely need for repeat ADAMTS13 replacement via scheduled FFP transfusions. ADAMTS13 activity level resulted after discharge at <3% with the presence of inhibitor at a titer of 1.3 BEU. The patient was eventually able to be seen in the hematology clinic several months later for assessment of prophylactic FFP infusions. ADAMTS13 levels were tested at subsequent visits and had normalized to 22%. The patient was genetically tested for congenital TTP and was found to be negative for any genetic variants.\n\n【11】Table 1 \n\n【12】Summary of lab values for patient on admission at the time of evaluation and at discharge.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】While there are more than 200 pathologic genetic variants of the ADAMTS13 mutation, cases of hereditary TTP make up less than 5% of all TTP cases. Many times, these genetic variants can be under-tested, leading to a delay in diagnosis. It is important, then, to use clinical history to aid in the diagnosis of hereditary TTP. Stroke occurs in 25–31% of patients with hereditary TTP, with the median age being just 19 years \\[4\\]. While stroke is not an uncommon event in patients suffering from TTP relapse, the majority of these ischemic events occur simultaneously with a drop in platelet number or other indication of hemolytic anemia.\n\n【15】Our patient presented with a recurrent stroke and had normal platelets, mildly elevated LDH, and normal haptoglobin, making this an atypical presentation of TTP. While her history was initially strongly suggestive of hereditary TTP, the presence of an inhibitor points to the fact that this is an atypical presentation of the acquired form. Furthermore, her unremarkable testing for genetic variants confirms this diagnosis. It is likely that the three strokes she suffered prior to this presentation were also manifestations of her acquired TTP. Treatment of hereditary TTP involves prophylactic plasma infusions, which can help prevent future end-organ ischemia. Despite our patient having the acquired form of TTP, her ADAMTS13 levels still responded to the prophylactic infusions of plasma.\n\n【16】Because of the high mortality associated with untreated TTP, particular attention should be paid to young or middle-aged individuals who present with recurrent strokes in the absence of obvious cardiovascular risk factors, even in the setting of normal platelet counts \\[5\\]. The development of thrombosis may precede the development of laboratory abnormalities in patients with either congenital or acquired TTP. There are rare reports of atypical TTP presenting initially as either pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction prior to the development of marked thrombocytopenia or hemolysis \\[6\\], and therefore a high index of suspicion must be maintained even in the absence of a high pretest probability, as in our patient. Demonstrating decreased ADAMTS13 activity is a highly specific way to confirm the diagnosis of TTP \\[7\\], and it can play a role in timely therapy with either total plasma exchange or administration of FFP \\[8, 9\\]. Furthermore, caplacizumab, an anti-von Willebrand factor immunoglobulin fragment, has been shown to normalize platelet counts and prevent recurrence of TTP when used during and 30 days after administration of plasma exchange therapy \\[10\\]. The current data suggest that caplacizumab is most efficacious when used at the time of diagnosis, and there is a paucity of data regarding its use as solely a prophylactic medication \\[11\\]. It also appears that the effects of caplacizumab after discontinuation may not be long-lasting, as recurrence rates for TTP were shown to be higher during the patient follow-up period after drug cessation \\[12\\]. In addition, its high cost burden makes it even more difficult to justify its use in our patient, for whom a clinically significant benefit may not be realizable. At follow-up, the patient’s ADAMTS13 levels had normalized without any further administration of plasma or immunosuppressant therapy. Because of this, the patient was managed with a watchful waiting approach and has ADAMTS13 levels checked routinely at 3-4 month intervals to guide further treatment approaches.\n\n【17】Our patient’s case reveals the variation in presentation of TTP, the complexity of diagnosis, and demonstrates a lack of evidence that can be used to guide management in patients with recurrent episodes of TTP but normal markers of hemolysis. Further studies need to be performed in order to delineate whether prophylactic plasma transfusions, immunosuppression, or caplacizumab can be useful for recurrent episodes of autoimmune acquired TTP and how frequently these patients should be monitored.\n\n【18】#### Data Availability\n\n【19】Justifications for the empiric treatment of our patient and for the conclusions represented in our discussion are made available in the cited medical literature.\n\n【20】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【21】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Gallstone disease is extremely prevalent in the western society with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) being the standard treatment for patients with symptomatic gallstones. The prevalence of common bile duct (CBD) stones with concomitant gallstones increases with age from 8–15% in patients <60 years of age and up to 60% in the elderly \\[1\\]. For patients suspected of having CBD stones, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) plays an important role preoperatively. Most patients experience relief of symptoms after LC, but a small number experience postcholecystectomy syndrome, which presents as biliary colic \\[2\\]. Postcholecystectomy syndrome can be secondary to dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi, traumatic stricture, retained CBD stones or retained stones within a gallbladder remnant \\[2\\]. The condition is especially common within the first three years postprocedure \\[3\\]. There have been only a few case reports of postcholecystectomy bile duct stones occurring more than 10 years following surgery in the literature. Most of these reports describe the presence of stones within the gallbladder/cystic duct remnant or secondary to migrating surgical clips \\[4, 5\\].We report a unique case of intra- and extrahepatic choledocholithiasis 15 years following laparoscopic cholecystectomy secondary to a primary biliary stone.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】An 86-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of abdominal pain. The patient’s medical history included hyperlipidemia and cholecystectomy 15 years prior to presentation. The patient stated that he had eaten at a fast food restaurant one day prior to presentation. Afterwards, the patient developed mild, diffuse, constant abdominal pain with nausea that worsened on the day of presentation, prompting his ED visit.\n\n【6】In the ED, the patient had a temperature of 102.3°F, leukocytosis with left shift, and a positive urinalysis. In addition, the patient was noted to have hyperbilirubinemia to 4.5 with elevated liver enzymes (ALT 413, AST 340, and ALP 203).\n\n【7】A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast demonstrated dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts with the common bile duct measuring up to 12 mm. There were multiple hyperdensities within the bile ducts particularly at the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts in addition to the distal CBD, consistent with choledocholithiasis (Figures 1–3).\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Axial CT of the abdomen with contrast at the level of the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts demonstrates an 11 mm hyperdensity likely representing a calculus (arrow). This finding is confirmed on the coronal image (arrow) in Figure 2.\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】Coronal CT of the abdomen with contrast demonstrates 11 mm hyperdensity likely representing a calculus at the origin of the common bile duct (arrow).\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】Axial CT of the abdomen with contrast demonstrates intrahepatic biliary dilatation.\n\n【20】An ERCP confirmed the presence of stones within the bile ducts with multiple pigmented black stones removed (Figure 4). Pus was also noted and sent for culture confirming the presence of cholangitis. A 10 Fr stent was placed into the common bile duct due to cholangitis.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 4 \n\n【24】ERCP images demonstrate multiple filling defects (green arrows) within the common bile duct with moderate dilatation of the extra- and intrahepatic biliary tree. A complete sphincterotomy was performed, and multiple black pigmented stones were removed.\n\n【25】The patient tolerated the procedure well and was successfully treated with antibiotics and discharged home. The patient was asked to follow-up with his gastroenterologist as an outpatient.\n\n【26】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【27】Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of bile duct stones. It is estimated that up to 15% of patients <60 years of age have stones in the common bile duct, whereas it can be as high as 60% in the elderly \\[1\\]. Risk factors identified for complicated choledocholithiasis are Asian descent, increasing age, and male gender \\[6, 7\\]. It is estimated that between 3.4 and 10% of patients have choledocholithiasis at the time of cholecystectomy \\[8, 9\\]. Delayed choledocholithiasis has been reported in patients with the most common etiologies being retained or regeneration of stones within a gallbladder remnant or cystic duct \\[4, 8\\].\n\n【28】Studies have shown that the vast majority of patients (80%) with choledocholithiasis following cholecystectomy will present within 3 years of surgery \\[3, 9\\]. Presentation later than this is thought to be secondary to migrating surgical clips with cases being reported up to twenty years following cholecystectomy. Only a few reports have identified disease at a later interval \\[10\\]. Rarely were the stones deemed to be primary as in our case.\n\n【29】Intrahepatic lithiasis can be either primary or secondary. Primary intrahepatic lithiasis is less common in the US and is usually the result of single or multiple cystic dilatations of the intrahepatic biliary tree resulting bile stasis. Secondary intrahepatic stones are the result of migration of gallbladder or CBD stones or strictures related to previous surgery \\[11\\]. Other risk factors include prior sphincterotomy, which could allow for debris to enter the CBD leading to infection and nidus formation and metabolic disorders.\n\n【30】Saharia et al. described a group of 30 patients with primary biliary stones following cholecystectomy with an average of 12 years following surgery until diagnosis. The most frequent presenting symptom was acute cholangitis as in our patient \\[12\\]. This was one of the few articles that were found after extensive research describing primary choledocholithiasis following cholecystectomy.\n\n【31】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【32】We present a rare case of primary choledocholithiasis postcholecystectomy, which, to our knowledge, is one of only a few in literature studies. Given the latency of presentation, it is important to have choledocholithiasis in mind even a number of years after cholecystectomy.\n\n【33】#### Data Availability\n\n【34】All information regarding the patient can be found in the hospital EMR and PACS.\n\n【35】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【36】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【37】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【38】The authors would like to thank Christopher Tan, MD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare primary neuroendocrine cutaneous tumor, rarely metastasizing to the brain. Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is a disease predisposing to MCC. According to previous reports, headache and focal neurological deficits suggest disease progression to the brain. We present a patient with MCC whose seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain. _Case Presentation_. A 62-year-old female patient had a history of CLL. A lesion with the appearance of an atheroma was removed from the right upper arm. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of MCC. She was admitted to the neurology department with her first GM seizure. The cranial MRI/MRA showed bone metastases in the right parietal and both frontal areas, compressing the brain. Flow cytometry of CSF did not reveal metastasis of MCC. _Conclusions_. The case history of the patient was unique even among the rare cases of MCC with neurological involvement. The seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain. In addition to patient history, clinical presentation and radiological findings enabled a suspected diagnosis of skull metastasis of MCC compressing the brain, causing symptomatic epileptic seizures.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and extremely aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy. Both clinically and histologically, it is difficult to differentiate it from neuroendocrine carcinomas, skin metastasis of small cell lung cancer, small cell malignant melanoma, malignant lymphoma, atypical keratoacanthoma, and leiomyosarcoma. In addition to patient history, clinical and radiological findings as well as immunohistochemistry contribute to a definitive diagnosis. Due to the above reasons, it is a significant challenge for the neurologist to diagnose this very rare and malignant disease in a timely manner which needs rapid treatment to provide a chance of recovery.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】The 62-year-old female patient’s chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) was diagnosed 10 years ago and was nonprogressive following chemotherapy. The only other past medical history of note was laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2006.\n\n【6】A lesion with the appearance of an atheroma was removed from the right upper arm 2 years ago. Histology with immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of MCC, and the patient received combined chemotherapy based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. This was discontinued due to bone marrow depression. The lesion recurred 7 months later and was reoperated. At this time, the patient also had right axillary block dissection due to the local recurrence of MCC and its metastasis to the axillary lymph nodes, confirmed by aspiration cytology, showing metastases from both CLL and MCC in the lymph nodes. Postoperative radiotherapy was performed, but the patient’s condition deteriorated. Progressively, a right axillary soft tissue conglomerate mass infiltrated the right lateral thoracic wall, and pathologic upper mediastinal and parasternal lymph nodes appeared. These all showed metastases from MCC. Chemotherapy following the ECO regimen (epirubicin (E) given weekly in combination with cyclophosphamide (C) and vincristin (O) applied during a 3-week interval) was reinitiated due to clinical progression, and the last chemotherapy session (vincristin) was administered 3 days before the patient was admitted to our Department of Neurology due to her first epileptic seizure (GM). The patient complained about headache during the week before admission.\n\n【7】##### 2.1. General Medical State\n\n【8】BP: 115/75 mmHg and HR: 75/min; no bruit over carotid or subclavian arteries; an oblique surgical scar with primary healing on the right upper arm; liver edge at the costal margin.

Gamma-GT: 24 U/L; alkaline phosphatase: 162 U/L; LDH: 1768 U/L; amylase: 75 U/L; CRP: 1.59 mg/L.\n\n【16】##### 2.5. Cranial CT\n\n【17】Cranial CT showed a 37 × 9 mm hypodensity in the right parietal region, at the posterior horn of the lateral ventricle, with marked cerebral and cerebellar atrophy (Figure 1).\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】  \n\n【20】Figure 1 \n\n【21】Cranial CT showing marked cerebral and cerebellar atrophy.\n\n【22】##### 2.6. Cranial MR\n\n【23】Cranial MR showed a solid epidural of 2 × 2.8 × 5 cm mass, originating from the bone, in the right parietal region, showing homogeneously low signal intensity on T1-weighted images (Figure 2(a)) and homogeneously high signal intensity on T2 and FLAIR images (Figure 2(b)), with an intense contrast enhancement (mainly) in the peripheral zone and smaller necrotic areas in the central zone. Moderate oedema around the mass is present, with higher apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value on the ADC images.

No histology was performed from the skull mass.\n\n【40】The patient died 3 months later. The cause of death was multiple metastases of MCC.\n\n【41】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【42】MCC is a rare and extremely aggressive neuroendocrine malignancy, presenting as a solitary, painless, thick, livid, and erythematous nodule, mostly on skin areas exposed to sunlight. First, it gives metastases to regional lymph nodes and then to distant organs. MCC is often associated with malignant hematologic diseases, such as CLL \\[1\\]. Recently, a polyomavirus was identified, likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of MCC \\[2\\]. Genetic instability and impaired immune defence due to the primary malignancy contribute to the development of other solid tumors, which may explain the coexistence of MCC with CLL. In addition to conventional radiochemotherapy, novel therapeutic options include treatment with somatostatin analogues in neuroendocrine tumors expressing somatostatin receptors, monoclonal antibody therapy in tumors expressing CD56 antigens, and anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy.\n\n【43】The case history of our patient is unique even among rare cases of MCC giving metastases to the brain \\[3, 4\\] due to the following factors:(1)She had a history of proven CLL(2)The seizure was not elicited by a cerebral metastasis, but by bone metastases compressing the brain\n\n【44】In addition to patient history, clinical presentation and radiological findings enabled the suspected diagnosis of skull metastasis of MCC compressing the brain, causing symptomatic epileptic seizures. Bone metastasis from CLL was unlikely, as solitary bone lesions in the context of CLL are believed to result from either Richter’s transformation or metastasis from another primary malignancy \\[5\\], in this case, from MCC. Therefore, previous oncological diagnoses and imaging are of key importance in clarifying the origins of solitary bone lesions of the skull.\n\n【45】#### Abbreviations\n\n【46】| ADC: | Apparent diffusion coefficient |\n| --- | --- |\n| CLL: | Chronic lymphoid leukemia |\n| CSF: | Cerebrospinal fluid |\n| MCC: | Merkel cell carcinoma. |\n\n【47】#### Consent\n\n【48】Consent was requested from and granted by patient’s relatives as patient deceased.\n\n【49】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【50】The authors declare no Conflicts of Interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "2ec1aef9-221b-4d4d-a8de-4a61cfb83283", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Hemorrhage due to the rupture of the infundibular dilatation of the posterior communicating artery (ID of the PCo-A) occurs infrequently. The preferred treatment of such hemorrhages is surgical clipping through craniotomy. There are few reports about endovascular coil embolization in such cases. We report such a case treated by endovascular embolization. A 35-year-old man, who had experienced 2 episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), was found to have a ruptured ID of the PCo-A by head computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). We performed stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization through a combined anterior and posterior circulation approach. Postembolization angiography showed absence of contrast filling of the ID of the PCo-A and nonleakage of the contrast agent. The patient recovered well with no complications. SAH recurrence was not recorded during the 1-year followup. The postoperative angiographic result was good. To our knowledge, this is the first case of hemorrhage due to ruptured ID of the PCo-A that was treated by such a technique.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】ID of the PCo-A refers to funnel-shaped widenings with a diameter less than 3 mm at the junction of the posterior communicating artery and the internal carotid artery \\[1–3\\]. ID of the PCo-A was regarded as normal anatomical variants with a low risk of rupture \\[4\\]. However, with increasing reports of ruptured ID of the PCo-A, bleeding is also found to occur in cases of ID of the PCo-A. Aggressive treatment (i.e., surgical clipping) is preferred for most patients presenting with hemorrhage \\[2–6\\], but little is known about the endovascular treatment of this condition. We report a case of ruptured ID of the PCo-A successfully treated by endovascular embolization.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 35-year-old man was admitted with sudden onset of headache and vomiting. At admission, he was in relatively good condition. Hunt-Hess scale was grade III, and the GCS score was 13 at presentation. A CT scan of the head revealed SAH mainly in the right suprasellar cistern with a Fisher grade of 3 (Figure 1(a)). Dehydration therapy was performed immediately. Nine hours after the onset of symptoms, the patient lapsed into a coma; Hunt-Hess grade progressed to IV, and the GCS score deteriorated to 8. A repeated head CT examination revealed rebleeding, acute hydrocephalus, hematocele at bilateral posterior horns of the lateral ventricle, and a Fisher grade of 4 (Figure 1(b)). A CTA was performed together with a CT and revealed a conical expansion of the infundibulum at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery with a diameter of less than 3 mm. The thin right posterior communicating artery arose from the apex of the infundibulum. In addition, no aneurysm was noted in angiography (arrow in Figures 1(c) and 1(d)). DSA and 3-D reconstruction were then performed, and these findings were similar to those seen in the CTA (arrow in Figures 1(e), 1(f), and 1(g)). After these imagings, conservative treatments including dehydration therapy were administered to allow the reabsorption of SAH. Nimodipine was given for antivasospasm treatment. In the meantime, lumbar drainage was performed to drain bloody cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n【6】  \n**(a)**\n\n【7】  \n**(b)**\n\n【8】  \n**(c)**\n\n【9】  \n**(d)**\n\n【10】  \n**(e)**\n\n【11】  \n**(f)**\n\n【12】  \n**(g)**\n\n【13】  \n**(h)**\n\n【14】  \n**(i)**\n\n【15】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)** **(f)** **(g)** **(h)**   \n**(i)**\n\n【16】Figure 1 \n\n【17】| Diagnosis of ruptured ID of the PCo-A. (a, b) Two SAH images detected at an interval of 9 hours show that the bleeding points in both episodes of hemorrhage were centered around the origin of the right posterior communicating artery and that the suprasellar cistern, sylvian cistern, ambient cistern, and tentorial margin were involved. Blood entry into the ventricles and the presence of ventriculomegaly were seen in (b). (c, d) Head CTA showed that a funnel-shaped expansion with a diameter of less than 3 mm occurred at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery and was in conjunction with the thin right posterior communicating artery at its apex (arrow). (e)–(g) The first DSA showed that a funnel-shaped expansion occurred at the origin of the right posterior artery and was in conjunction with the thin right posterior communicating artery at its apex, a finding similar to the results of CTA (arrow). (h) Reexamination by head CT after 20 days of conservative treatment demonstrated that SAH was absorbed and the size of ventricles was normal. (i) The second DSA examination after 20 days of conservative treatment revealed that the funnel-shaped expansion still existed at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery and was in conjunction with the thin posterior communicating artery at its apex, similar to the results obtained by CTA and the first DSA (arrow). |\n| --- |\n\n【18】After 20 days of conservative treatment, the patient’s condition got better, and he could follow simple commands. A repeated head CT showed that SAH was reabsorbed, and the size of the ventricles became normal (Figure 1(h)). DSA was performed again and yielded the same result as the previous one (arrow in Figure 1(i)). Thus, ruptured ID of the PCo-A was diagnosed, and we planned to perform coil embolization. Because of the wide neck of the ID, stent-assisted occlusion was required. As a result, clopidogrel and aspirin were administrated orally for one week.\n\n【19】At day 27 after the bleed, endovascular coil embolization was performed under general anesthesia. The right femoral artery was punctured using the Seldinger technique to introduce a vascular sheath. Heparin was administered. Vertebral angiography with carotid compression was performed before vascular embolization so as to observe the blood supply to the posterior circulation of the ID of the PCo-A. The result showed that blood flow reversed into the internal carotid artery through the posterior communicating artery (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Subsequently, endovascular embolization of the ID of the PCo-A was conducted. After a suitable working angle was selected, a Neuroform3 stent (4.0 mm  ×  20 mm) was successfully released using an Echelon-14 microcatheter and Transend-300 microguidewire to completely cover the neck of the ID of the PCo-A. Subsequently, an Echelon-10 microcatheter was delivered into the ID of the PCo-A using Transend-300 microguidewire through the stent mesh. After angiography, a HydroCoil 10 coil (2 mm  ×  2 cm, MicroVention, Aliso Viejo, Calif) was released into the ID of the PCo-A. However, the coil was not detached due to the unfavorable location (Figure 2(c)). The left femoral artery was punctured for introduction of a vascular sheath, and then an Echelon-10 microcatheter was placed into the PCo-A ID using a Transend-300 microguidewire via the posterior communicating artery (Figure 2(d)). Four HydroCoil 10 coils were sequentially released (2 mm  ×  2 cm, 2 mm  ×  2 cm, 2 mm  ×1 cm, 2 mm  ×  1 cm) to fill the ID of the PCo-A (Figure 2(e)). No enhancement of the ID of the PCo-A was shown in the angiography of anterior or posterior circulation, and leakage of the contrast agent did not occur (Figures 2(f) and 2(g)). The coil placed in the internal carotid artery was detached (Figure 2(h)). After catheters and sheaths were removed, the procedure was completed.\n\n【20】  \n**(a)**\n\n【21】  \n**(b)**\n\n【22】  \n**(c)**\n\n【23】  \n**(d)**\n\n【24】  \n**(e)**\n\n【25】  \n**(f)**\n\n【26】  \n**(g)**\n\n【27】  \n**(h)**\n\n【28】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)** **(f)** **(g)**   \n**(h)**\n\n【29】Figure 2 \n\n【30】| Endovascular coil embolization of ruptured ID of the PCo-A.

(b) Vertebral angiography showed that blood flew reversely from the posterior communicating artery into the internal carotid artery system after carotid artery compression. (c) A Neuroform3 stent was released in the internal carotid artery to cover the origin of the posterior communicating artery; an Echelon-10 microcatheter was used to release a Hydrocoil10 coil into the PCo-A ID through the stent mesh using a Transend300 microguidewire, but the coil was not detached.

The patient was treated with clopidogrel and aspirin. During a 1-year followup, the patient recovered well and could care for himself. His GOS score was 4, and SAH did not recur. The follow-up DSA showed no signs of ID of the PCo-A (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)).\n\n【32】  \n**(a)**\n\n【33】  \n**(b)**\n\n【34】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【35】Figure 3 \n\n【36】| Follow-up DSA. (a, b) The follow-up DSA did not show the recurrence of ID of the PCo-A. |\n| --- |\n\n【37】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【38】ID of the PCo-A is not a rare clinical entity. However, the prevalence of it on carotid angiography ranges from 5% to 17% \\[6–9\\] or even higher, as shown in other studies \\[10, 11\\]. The natural history of ID of the PCo-A remains unclear; it is generally recognized as an anatomical variant resulting from incomplete retrogression of vessels during embryonic development. ID of the PCo-A usually does not rupture or bleed \\[6, 8\\]. However, a number of studies have reported fatal SAH caused by ID of the PCo-A rupture or its progression to aneurysms \\[3, 4\\]. Hemorrhage due to the rupture of the ID of the PCo-A is surgically treated (i.e., surgical clipping) to prevent disastrous consequences due to rebleeding \\[5, 6, 8, 12–20\\]. In most IDs of the PCo-A, PCo-A is not well developed and has few perforating branches; so, the origin of the ID of the PCo-A is clipped in an orientation parallel to the internal carotid artery to prevent rebleeding \\[12–18\\].\n\n【39】However, in our patient, although the right PCo-A was underdeveloped, neurosurgical clipping treatment was not selected, and stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization was performed using a combined approach of anterior and posterior circulation. This approach was considered because we found that the ID of the PCo-A had a wide junction with the internal carotid artery, making full clipping quite difficult similar to wide-necked aneurysms \\[21\\]. Moreover, a previous study has shown that the bleeding points in the ruptured ID of the PCo-A were mostly located at the distal side of the ID, close to the internal carotid artery \\[22\\]. Under such circumstances, blood could still flow into the inside of the ID along the PCo-A even when the origin of the ID is clipped.\n\n【40】In the current study, enhancement of the PCo-A was not revealed in the DSA of posterior circulation, but it appeared in the angiography of the compressed internal carotid artery. Blood flowed reversely into the internal carotid artery (Figure 2(b)) indicating the possibility of rebleeding if the neck of the ID was clipped and the ruptured bleeding point was left untreated. However, clipping the bleeding points of the ID of the PCo-A might result in new bleeding sites near the previous ones, due to the continuous impact of blood flow; there is also the probability that the ID of the PCo-A will progress to an aneurysm \\[22, 23\\]. Therefore, at least 2 aneurysm clips are needed for isolation of the ID of the PCo-A in order to prevent rebleeding. It is difficult to place two aneurysm clips because of the narrow operating space around the posterior communicating artery. On the contrary, stent-assisted coil embolization by means of endovascular approach is relatively safe in comparison to neurosurgical clipping. Therefore, we preferred to perform endovascular treatment.\n\n【41】Although the patient experienced two SAH episodes in this study, the CTA on admission and first the DSA did not reveal the aneurysm but a conical expansion of the infundibulum at the origin of the right posterior communicating artery. At that time, ruptured ID of PCo-A could not be confirmed because profound SAH might have resulted in vasospasms that hide a very small aneurysm. In addition, the condition of the patient was critical. If we had attempted to treat the expansion of the infundibulum, disastrous result might have occurred or the aneurysm might have been missed. The better alternative was to wait until the blood was reabsorbed. After 20 days of conservative treatment, the repeated CT revealed reabsorption of blood along with an improvement in the condition of the patient. The DSA was performed and confirmed the diagnosis of ruptured ID of the PCo-A. Endovascular treatment lead to a good outcome. The follow-up DSA did not show the recurrence of ID of the PCo-A.\n\n【42】To date, no report on endovascular intervention treatment for ruptured ID of the PCo-A is available. We made an attempt to provide a new strategy for its treatment. While considering endovascular embolization for eligible patients with ID of the PCo-A, the following two factors need to be taken into account. First, the ipsilateral internal carotid artery needs to be compressed when conducting vertebral angiography so as to fully assess the hemodynamic status of the ID of the PCo-A. Therefore, rupture due to incomplete filling and blood supply from the posterior circulation can be prevented. Second, stent-assisted embolization is required because of the wide neck of the ID of the PCo-A. When full blocking is not possible through the internal carotid artery of the anterior circulation alone, it is preferable to carry out the blocking through the combined approach of anterior and posterior (via the posterior communicating artery) circulation.\n\n【43】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【44】Stent-assisted endovascular coil embolization through a combined approach of anterior and posterior circulation provides a new strategy for treatment of hemorrhage due to rupture of the ID of the PCo-A.\n\n【45】#### Acknowledgment\n\n【46】The authors thank Medjaden Bioscience Limited for assisting in the preparation of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

To report a case of acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) with atypical electrophysiology findings. _Case Presentation_. A 23-year-old-female presented with visual acuity deterioration in her right eye accompanied by photopsia bilaterally. Corrected distance visual acuity at presentation was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Fundus examination was unremarkable. Visual field (VF) testing revealed a large scotoma. Pattern and full-field electroretinograms (PERG and ERG) revealed macular involvement associated with generalized retinal dysfunction.

The patient was diagnosed with AZOOR due to clinical findings, visual field defect, and ERG findings. _Conclusion_. This is a case of AZOOR with characteristic VF defects and clinical symptoms presenting with atypical EOG findings.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR) is a rare retinal disorder first described in the literature by Gass in 1992 \\[1, 2\\]. Patients with AZOOR typically present with photopsia and scotomas. Fundoscopy in patients at initial presentation may be normal and diagnosis is confirmed with the abnormal findings in electrophysiology \\[1, 2\\].\n\n【4】According to Gass, AZOOR belongs to “white dot” syndromes, which is a wide spectrum of idiopathic inflammatory retinal disorders \\[1, 2\\]. Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy affects mostly women, with an average age at presentation of all patients described in the literature about 37 years. Typical characteristic of the disease is the presentation with vision deterioration in an area of the visual field accompanied by photopsia. Most of the patients present with unilateral disease, but involvement of the contralateral eye ultimately appears in the majority of the cases according to the literature \\[1\\].\n\n【5】In electrophysiology, most of the patients described in the literature have abnormal electroretinogram (ERG) in at least one eye (the most severely affected in asymmetric disease) \\[1, 2\\]. The electrooculogram (EOG) was also tested in many of the cases described in the literature, and so far all of them had abnormal results \\[1, 3\\].\n\n【6】The purpose of our study is to describe a case of AZOOR with typical clinical findings and abnormal ERG that presented with normal EOG, in contrast to the up till now published reports.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 23-year-old-female patient presented in the Outpatients Department of the Ophthalmiatreio Eye Hospital of Athens due to vision deterioration in her right eye and photopsias bilaterally. The patient underwent complete evaluation with detailed ophthalmic and systemic history, assessment of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), and slit lamp inspection of anterior and posterior segments. The patients’ CDVA was 20/50 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in the right eye and 15 mmHg in the left eye. The patient had no history of other ophthalmic or systemic diseases. Anterior and posterior segments examination was unremarkable. The patient underwent visual field testing that revealed a large central scotoma in the right eye and was normal in the left eye (Figure 1).\n\n【9】  \n\n【10】  \n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】| Visual field of the patient’s right eye demonstrating a generalized depression. |\n| --- |\n\n【13】Fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography were unremarkable bilaterally.

Stimulus 0.6 log units stronger than the ISCEV maximum standard flash was also used better to demonstrate the dark adapted a-wave (DA 11.0). Visual evoked potentials to a pattern stimulus (PVEP) and (EOG) were also recorded according to ISCEV standards \\[6, 7\\].\n\n【20】According to the results, PERG P50 amplitude as an index of macular function was reduced in the right eye but was within normal limits in the left eye indicating right eye macular dysfunction (Figure 3(a)). The PVEP P<sub>100</sub> component was of reduced amplitude and normal peak time in the right eye (possibly secondary to macular dysfunction rather than reflecting primary optic nerve disease) while responses in the left eye were recorded within normal range.\n\n【21】  \n**(a)**\n\n【22】  \n**(b)**\n\n【23】  \n**(c)**\n\n【24】  \n**(d)**\n\n【25】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【26】Figure 3 \n\n【27】| (a) Pattern electroretinogram (PERG) showing reduction of the P50 amplitude in the right eye.

(Figure 3(b)). Photopic single flash ERGs (LA 3.0) responses were subnormal in the right eye only (a-wave amplitudes: 25 _μ_V and 38.5 _μ_V in the right and left eye, resp.; b-wave amplitudes: 115 _μ_V and 200 _μ_V in the right and left eye (Figure 3(c)). Light adapted 30 Hz flicker ERG (LA 30 Hz) was delayed in the right eye but within normal limits in the left eye (implicit time of 31 msec and 26 msec in the right and left eyes, resp.)

The patient was diagnosed with AZOOR due to typical clinical, visual field and ERG findings despite the normal EOG findings.\n\n【35】Two months after first visit, patient evaluation was repeated. Vision in her right eye had deteriorated to 20/63, while in the left eye it was stable at 20/20. Visual field testing was also repeated and revealed further depression of sensitivity in the right eye and involvement of the left eye (Figure 5). The patient was followed up for 8 additional months and her symptoms and clinical findings were stabilized bilaterally. In the course of follow-up she also underwent magnetic resonance imaging of head and abdomen without findings.\n\n【36】  \n**(a)**\n\n【37】  \n**(b)**\n\n【38】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【39】Figure 5 \n\n【40】| Visual field of right eye (a) and left eye (b) demonstrating deterioration of the right eye and involvement of the left. |\n| --- |\n\n【41】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【42】Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy is a rare disease of unknown etiology affecting mostly young female adults \\[1\\]. There are only a few studies and case reports in the literature of this condition describing electroretinography as the critical test for confirmation of diagnosis in addition to the clinical findings and the visual field defect \\[1–3\\]. To the best of our knowledge, this case is the first described in the literature with nontypical electrophysiology due to the normal findings in EOG.\n\n【43】Our case presented with vision deterioration in one eye and photopsias bilaterally. Photopsias are described as a symptom at presentation in the vast majority of the cases of AZOOR \\[1\\]. Visual acuity is not always affected, since most of eyes retain a visual acuity of 20/20. Still, there are a percentage of patients with impaired visual acuity. In a series of patients presented by Gass et al. CDVA was 20/40 or more in 76% of patients at presentation and final visual acuity was 20/40 or more in 68% of patients \\[2\\]. Slit lamp biomicroscopy and fundus imaging examination (FA and ICG) were unremarkable in our case, which according to the literature is a common condition in diagnosed AZOOR cases, since 50% of published cases present with no related findings in FA \\[1\\]. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula was normal. According to the literature, OCT may show disruptions in the inner segment/outer segment junction line and in the outer segment tip lines of the photoreceptors, especially in the late phase of the disease \\[8\\].\n\n【44】Visual field defect is also one of the main findings in cases of AZOOR. Several types of visual field defects have been observed, such as blind spot enlargement, constriction of the peripheral visual field, and central scotomas \\[1\\]. In our case the patient presented with a full scotoma of the central visual field in the initially affected eye which was not related to any other optic nerve pathology. The course of our patient (deterioration of the most affected eye in the first months and involvement of the contralateral eye) was also typical of AZOOR.\n\n【45】Electrophysiology is the critical testing for confirmation of diagnosis in cases of AZOOR \\[1–3\\]. Gass et al. \\[2\\] reported abnormal findings in ERG of all 51 patients in their series, and most of the published cases in the literature report abnormal ERGs \\[1\\]. Common findings are depressed scotopic and/or photopic amplitudes in one eye (the most severely affected) or both eyes \\[2\\]. A negative amplitude is not common but was also reported in the literature in one case by Gass et al. \\[2\\] and in one case by Piao et al., where dysfunction of the inner retina, as well as the outer retina, was proposed in such cases \\[9\\]. Our patient also presented with a “negative” ERG in his right eye. Macular involvement was also demonstrated in that eye.\n\n【46】In a retrospective series of 28 patients Francis et al. \\[3\\] identified a pattern of electrophysiological anomalies in AZOOR cases where all affected eyes demonstrated delayed implicit time of the 30 Hz cone flicker ERG. Our case also displayed delayed implicit time in his right eye which is in accordance with these criteria. In the aforementioned case series \\[3\\] all of the patients had a marked reduction in the EOG light rise, indicating a generalized dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium. Accordingly, case reports in the published literature that include EOG testing of the affected eyes report abnormal results of EOG \\[1\\]. In our case EOG light rise and the Arden ratio were within normal limits bilaterally, despite the fact that the rest of the test results were suggestive of AZOOR.\n\n【47】In all reported cases and series of patients in the literature there is no definite description of the disease. Even the pathophysiology of AZOOR is not clear since it is either considered part of the white dot disease spectrum or triggered by inflammatory disorders such as punctuate inner choroiditis and multifocal inner choroiditis \\[3\\]. Differential diagnosis of cases of AZOOR with such findings at presentation as in our case includes other conditions such as cancer associated retinopathy and melanoma associated retinopathy \\[1\\]. Our patient had clear medical history and was referred to for complete evaluation for possible occult malignancy including clinical examination, blood testing, and chest and abdominal MRI which were not suggestive of such condition.\n\n【48】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【49】In conclusion, our patients had typical clinical findings of AZOOR with photopsia and visual field defect. However, it represents an unusual case of AZOOR as she presented with a “negative” ERG, indicating an abnormal inner and outer retina dysfunction, and with normal EOG recordings. The latter may indicate that involvement of retinal pigment epithelium, as demonstrated by EOG abnormality, is not imperative in the course of AZOOR.\n\n【50】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【51】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We conducted a review of children who were diagnosed with bronchiectasis due to foreign body retention in a university hospital between 2014 and 2019. Five patents were studied (four boys, one girl; age range: 15 months to 13 years old). Computed tomography showed localized cylindrical bronchiectasis in all five patients. After removal of the foreign body by bronchoscopy, the prognoses were good. Patients with localized cylindrical bronchiectasis should be examined to exclude foreign body. As long as foreign body aspiration is diagnosed early and appropriately removed, the possibility of a lobectomy or even mortality is greatly reduced.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Bronchiectasis is defined as the presence of reversibly or irreversibly widened bronchi due to damage to the bronchial walls. Common causes include postinfectious, aspiration syndromes, defects in host defenses, genetic syndromes, anatomical defects, and external airway compression \\[1\\]. In contrast, foreign body (FB) obstruction is an uncommon cause of bronchiectasis \\[2\\]. The causal relationship between cases of FB aspiration and bronchiectasis has not yet been established. In this article, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristic of patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis due to FB retention in our hospital between 2014 and 2019. Here, we wished to provide clinicians with useful data on the characteristics of bronchiectasis that result from FB inhalation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Objectives and Design\n\n【5】We retrospectively reviewed five patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis due to FB retention from January 2014 to January 2019. We analyzed the following patient demographics: sex, age, basic disease, symptoms, signs, the nature of FB, FB localization, period of retention, computed tomography (CT) results, bronchographic findings and prognosis.\n\n【6】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【7】Patients characteristics are listed in Table 1. The five patients comprised four boys and one girl with ages ranging from 15 months to 13 years (mean: 6.7 years). The FB identified included a sunflower seed, teeth, two nut, and a tapioca pearl (see Figure 1). The patients presented with recurrent cough, fever, or wheezing; one patient also experienced hemoptysis. Physical examination found wheezing in two cases, wet rales in one case, and decreased breath sounds in one case. One patient had basic disease, and the others were normal. None had histories of typical aspiration. The FB location was the left lower lobe in two patients, and the right lower lobe in three patients. CT showed inflammation, emphysema, and localized bronchiectasis. Bronchographic examination revealed granulation tissue formation in three patients. Repeated X-ray examination showed that bronchiectasis disappeared after 1 or 6 months. In one case, the patient experienced neither fever nor cough for 3 years after removal of the FB and refused repeat X-ray examination.\n\n【8】Table 1 \n\n【9】Clinical data of the five patients.\n\n【10】  \n**(a)**\n\n【11】  \n**(b)**\n\n【12】  \n**(c)**\n\n【13】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【14】Figure 1 \n\n【15】The images of CT and bronchoscopy of case 5: (a) shows bronchiectasis in posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe; (b) shows a spherical foreign body in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (c) shows the picture after removal of foreign body.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Aspiration of an FB into the trachea, and subsequently the bronchus, can occur in all age groups and most commonly occurs in infants and little children \\[3\\]. Once this occurs, identification of the FB is crucial, and hopefully occurs before bronchiectasis develops; the obstructive increases the risk of chronic infection and subsequent bronchiectasis. The incidence of bronchiectasis due to FB aspiration is reported to be between 1% and 5.6% in the literature \\[4\\]. However, approximately 500 patients admitted for FB aspiration in our hospital per year; therefore, the incidence of bronchiectasis in our study was lower than reported.\n\n【18】In our study, the mean age of patients with bronchiectasis due to FB was higher than that of all patients with FB. In addition, all the patients do not have histories of FB aspiration. The FBs were usually organic. CT revealed that bronchiectasis caused by FB was localized cylindrical bronchiectasis, mainly located in the lower lobes.\n\n【19】Aronoff reported in a systematic review that 18 of 989 patients, approximately 2%, with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis had FB aspiration \\[2\\]. The risk of bronchiectasis depends on the size, shape, localization, and the retention time of the FB \\[5\\]. The type of the FB and the time of retention within the tracheobronchial system are the most important factors. It has also been reported that the risk of bronchiectasis increases with retention time from aspiration to diagnosis \\[6\\]. Sirmali et al. reported that the earliest case of bronchiectasis developed 25 days after aspiration \\[5\\]. However, FB aspiration does not always lead to bronchiectasis, even after 4-5 years. Therefore, the occurrence of bronchiectasis is likely determined by several factors.\n\n【20】Because many patients do not report histories of FB aspiration and do not experience typical aspiration symptoms, this disease is often missed, making diagnosis more challenging. Doctors of patients with impaired mental statuses or swallowing mechanisms should be more vigilant about the possibility of FB inhalation, as was the scenario in one of our cases \\[7\\]. CT or bronchoscopic examination should be performed for patients with long-term cough, who are nonresponsive to routine treatment, who experience repeated occurrences of the same symptoms, have recurrent or persistent consolidations in the same location, or have unexplained hemoptysis \\[8, 9\\]. Furthermore, obtaining a proper history is crucial. Whenever a choking episode is mentioned in the patient’s history, tracheobronchoscopy is indicated without relying on other diagnostic tools \\[10, 11\\]. Recently, flexible bronchoscopy is also recommended for children newly diagnosed with bronchiectasis to exclude a foreign body or obstructive lesion \\[12\\].\n\n【21】Bronchoscopic removal of a retained FB may be difficult because of the presence of granulation tissue and copious secretions. In one of our case, the granulation tissue was lysed and frozen with liquid nitrogen before removal. In our study, all five patients recovered completely after successful FB removal. After 1–6 months, a repeat CT showed that the bronchiectasis had disappeared. Vergnon reported a case who had bronchiectasis due to pen cap retention for 41 years \\[13\\]. The successful removal of the cap leads to significant recovery, avoiding further invasive approach. It has been reported that neglected, inorganic FBs can cause permanent bronchiectasis after several years \\[14, 15\\]. These patients sometimes require lobectomy because of recurrent infection after removal of FB. As long as the FB is diagnosed early and removed by bronchoscopy, the need for lobectomy and the risk of mortality can be reduced.\n\n【22】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】To reduce the risk of bronchiectasis secondary to FB aspiration, proper histories must be obtained. In addition, CT or bronchoscopic examination should be performed for patients with long-term cough, repeated occurrences of the same symptoms, recurrent or persistent consolidation in the same location in the lungs, or unexplained hemoptysis. Impaired mental statuses or swallowing mechanism in patients should arise suspicion of FB aspiration. Finally, patients with localized cylindrical bronchiectasis should be examined for FB aspiration.\n\n【24】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【25】All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the Ethical Standards of the Institutional and/or National Research Committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n\n【26】#### Consent\n\n【27】Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report and any accompanying images.\n\n【28】#### Disclosure\n\n【29】CARE Checklist (2016) statement: the authors have read the CARE Checklist (2013), and the manuscript was prepared and revised according to the CARE Checklist (2016).\n\n【30】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【31】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【32】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【33】This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 81200022).

It occurs as a result of accidental implantations of fungus during traumatic procedures, such as surgery, and is usually reported in patients with predisposing factors such as immunosuppression, malignancy, and drug abuse. If left untreated, irreversible deformity and pain with severe osteoarticular destruction occur. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are important. This paper presents a case of 72-year-old man with primary _C. guilliermondii_ infection of knee joint without predisposing factors and previous traumatic procedures, who was misdiagnosed with advanced degenerative osteoarthritis. Our case is the second case of primary _C. guilliermondii_ arthritis of knee to be reported in the English-language literature and the first to be successfully treated with total knee arthroplasty following IV amphotericin B and oral fluconazole. Primary candidal infection of joint is generally asymptomatic or involves only mild pain and swelling in the affected knee. Thus, although the majority of knee joint infections are of a pyogenic or tuberculous origin, if a patient complains of mild pain and swelling in the knee and has mild signs of infection, the possibility of fungal infection should be considered.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Candidal infection of knee joint is rare. It is primarily reported in immunosuppressed patients as a sequela of prior episodes of transient candidemia or as a result of disseminated disease \\[1–3\\]. In the majority of cases, candidal arthritis is the result of hematogenous dissemination. Primary candidal infection of joint is extremely rare, with only a few reported cases. It most often occurs as a result of accidental implantation of fungus during traumatic procedures, such as surgery, intra-articular injections, or implantation of infected joint prostheses \\[4–6\\], and also in human-immunodeficiency-virus-(HIV)-infected intravenous drug users \\[7, 8\\] and heroin addicts \\[9\\]. While some _Candida_ species, including _C. albicans, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. glabrata,_ and _C. lusitaniae_, have been incriminated in the etiology of osteoarticular infections \\[10–14\\], _C. guilliermondii_ joint infection has been reported only once, by Graham and Frost \\[15\\]. However, the case reported by Graham and Frost occurred in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis, which is one of the minor predisposing factors for candidal infection of joint.\n\n【4】Here we report a case of primary _C. guilliermondii_ infection of the knee joint in a patient without predisposing factors that was successfully treated by total knee arthroplasty following intravenous amphotericin B and oral fluconazole. To the best of our knowledge, our case is the second case of primary _C. guilliermondii_ infection of joint reported in the English-language literature, and the first in a patient without predisposing factors. Additionally, ours is the first reported case to be successfully treated by total knee arthroplasty following intravenous amphotericin B and oral fluconazole in case of candidal joint infection.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 72-year-old man presented to our clinic with a 1-year history of pain and swelling of the right knee. He had been having intermittent pain in both knees for 15 years. Medication for mild degenerative arthritis had been recommended, but the patient refused treatment. A year before he presented to our clinic, he visited another clinic due to the aggravation of pain and swelling of the right knee and was diagnosed with severe degenerative arthritis by radiologic and physical exam, and a decision was made to perform total knee arthroplasty. During the operation, severe inflammation and an abscess were found inside the knee joint; therefore, bacterial culture was obtained and arthroplasty was not performed. After the operation, he was diagnosed by culture with unknown-originated joint infection and transferred to our clinic. The medical history was negative for rheumatoid disease, cancer, renal disease, and HIV. He was a nonsmoker and nondrinker and did not take any steroids or illegal drugs. On physical examination, the patient had signs of infection, including swelling and localized warmth, of right knee. Knee radiographs revealed multiple patched subchondral lesions of the distal femur and proximal tibia, severe joint space narrowing, and definite osteophytes (Figure 1(a)). These findings were suggestive of a degenerative knee joint (K-L grade IV).\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| (a) Standing knee radiograph showed multiple patched subchondral lesions of the distal femur and proximal tibia, joint space narrowing, and definite osteophyte. (b) After disappearing of the infection sign, standing knee radiograph showed aggravation of intra-articular deformity. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】The laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell (WBC), 11,200/mm<sup>3</sup> (4–10 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>); erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 97 mm/hr (0–15 mm/hr); C-reactive protein (CRP), 19.2 mg/dL (0–5 mg/dL). Tests for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), and HLA B<sub>27</sub> were all negative. The joint fluid cytology findings were as follows: appearance, cloudy and reddish; WBC, 17,200/mm<sup>3</sup> (0–200/mm<sup>3</sup>) with 85% neutrophils and 10% lymphocytes. The Gram stain and acid-fast bacteria (AFB) stain showed no bacteria or tuberculosis. _Candida guilliermondii_ was cultured in the joint fluid on hospital day 7 and was confirmed on hospital day 8. Amphotericin B (0.7 mg/kg/day) was given intravenously. Two weeks later, CRP had normalized. After 4 weeks, the amphotericin B was discontinued and oral fluconazole (400 mg/day) was prescribed for 6 months. The last culture of joint fluid was negative for _C. guilliermondii,_ and the patient had no complaints of pain or swelling. The ESR/CRP was continuously maintained at normal state. After the inflammation had resolved, the patient had pain on the medial side of the knee joint with ambulation, and rechecking knee radiographs revealed aggravation of the patient’s intra-articular deformity due to the candidal infection (Figure 1(b)). After 4 months, primary total knee replacement with a Duracon prosthesis (Howmedica, Rutherford, NJ, USA) was performed (Figure 2). The wound was daily dressed, and intravenous amphotericin was injected; however, redness and swelling were observed at the proximal operative site 1 week postoperatively (Figure 3).\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】| Primary total knee replacement with the Duracon prosthesis (Howmedica, Rutherford, NJ, USA) was performed. |\n| --- |\n\n【17】  \n**(a)**\n\n【18】  \n**(b)**\n\n【19】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【20】Figure 3 \n\n【21】| (a) Superficial infection at proximal operative site was noted at postoperative week 2.

So far, after discharge, there were no abnormal findings or signs of infection.\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】In our patient, infection of the knee joint occurred without predisposing factors, such as autoimmune disease, HIV, chronic steroid use, cancer, or drug abuse; therefore, most clinicians suspected pyogenic or tuberculosis infection and did not consider fungal infection because it rarely occurs in normal population \\[16\\]. Only a few cases of primary candidal infection have been reported. In our knowledge, primary candidal infection has been reported in less than 15 cases, mostly in neonates \\[17\\], septicemic patients, HIV patients, and drug abusers \\[7–9\\]. While only some _Candida_ species have been incriminated in the etiology of osteoarticular infections, _C. guilliermondii_ has been reported only one time, by Graham and Frost \\[15\\]. Graham reported that a patient with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis presented with mild knee pain and swelling and suggested that the unusualness organism, of the apparent chronicity of the infection, and the ultimate success of the surgical treatment are features of this organism. However, that case occurred in a patient of rheumatoid arthritis with systemic corticosteroid, which is one of predisposing factors.\n\n【25】Disseminated _Candida_ infection manifest with systemic symptoms including cutaneous and ocular lesions, so early diagnosis and treatment are possible. However, primary candidal infection of joint usually has mild, chronic course with little pain and few articular symptoms, leading to delays in diagnosis that can be as long as several years \\[14, 18\\]. Due to these ambiguous symptoms, primary candidal infection is often misdiagnosed as simple degenerative osteoarthritis of the knee, as in this case. However, if left untreated, irreversible deformity and pain with severe osteoarticular destruction occur. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are important. Thus, if there are minimal infectious signs, careful physical examination and attentive analysis of blood and joint fluid should be conducted to avoid incorrect diagnosis and treatment. In addition, because the majority of knee joint infections are of a pyogenic or tuberculous origin, most physicians do not perform the study about fungus infection. Thus, if there is an ambiguous case, which shows mild pain, swelling, and infection sign, a study about fungal infection should be also done.\n\n【26】Definitive information on the treatment of native joint _Candida_ infection is limited \\[19\\]. Both amphotericin B and fluconazole have been successfully used to treat infection with susceptible strains, as long as adequate drainage is provided \\[17\\]. Because successful treatment with amphotericin B is more commonly reported, we initiated treatment with intravenous amphotericin B, which was changed to oral fluconazole 4 weeks later. A long-term survey of _Candida_ demonstrated that fluconazole has fewer side effects and better antifungal effects than amphotericin B \\[20\\]. Therefore, we prescribed fluconazole for 6 months. Six months later, neither signs of inflammation nor side effects were observed.\n\n【27】As determined by a search of Medline for articles between 1966 and January 2011, our case is the second case of primary _C. guilliermondii_ infection of knee joint to be reported in the English-language literature and the first to be successfully treated with total knee arthroplasty following IV amphotericin B and oral fluconazole. Primary candidal infection of joint is generally asymptomatic or involves only mild pain and swelling in the affected knee. Thus, if a patient complains of mild pain and swelling in the knee and has mild signs of infection, the possibility of fungal infection should be considered.\n\n【28】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】Primary candidal infection of joint is extremely rare, with only a few reported cases. This infection is generally asymptomatic or involves only mild pain and swelling in the affected knee. However, if left untreated, irreversible deformity and pain with severe osteoarticular destruction occur. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment are important.

Chiari malformations (CM), first described approximately a hundred years ago, refer to a spectrum of hindbrain malformations characterized by cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum. We present the case of a 28-year-old woman with ADHD and concurrent Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) that was diagnosed by CT scan. There is growing evidence supporting the role of the cerebellum and its associated structures in the pathophysiology of ADHD. Thus, a cerebellar malformation such as CM may impact neurological circuitry in a manner favoring the development of a neuropsychiatric disorder such as ADHD. Our case highlights the need for further studies pertaining to the role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of ADHD and the importance of considering the presence of CM when evaluating a patient with ADHD.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity \\[1\\]. Reported prevalence rates of ADHD vary in the literature. Causes for these differences include factors such as the population studied and the method of assessment \\[2, 3\\]. ADHD is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder, affecting approximately 9% of children and 4% of adults in the United States, that emerges during childhood and persists into adulthood in as many as 75% of cases \\[4–6\\]. Despite recent advances in describing its precise pathophysiological mechanisms, much remains to be elucidated. Clinical observations of conditions which accompany and potentially contribute to ADHD may enhance our comprehension of this disorder.\n\n【4】Chiari malformations (CM), first described approximately a hundred years ago, refer to a spectrum of hindbrain malformations characterized by cerebellar herniation through the foramen magnum, resulting in compression of the caudal brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord as well as obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow through the fourth ventricle. Possible CM aetiologies include genetic predisposition, congenital anomalies, and acquisition through trauma or illness \\[7\\]. Four types of CM (CM-I, CM-II, CM-III, and CM-IV) have been described and are classified according to cerebellar herniation, spinal cord spacing, and severity, with CM-I being the least severe form \\[7\\]. The symptoms most commonly encountered in CM-I are debilitating headaches that worsen with Valsalva maneuvers, neck pain, dizziness, and visual disturbances \\[8\\]. It is difficult to evaluate the true prevalence of CM; however, modern imaging techniques have enabled CM to be identified more frequently. Before these technologies were available CM, was evaluated to occur in .001% of births \\[9\\].\n\n【5】The case we describe here is one of only three reported individual cases described in the English literature of a co-occurrence of ADHD and CM-I.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】The patient is a 28-year-old Caucasian college student, who was referred by her primary care practitioner to our outpatient clinic in September 2018 for evaluation and treatment of ADHD.\n\n【8】She had been diagnosed with ADHD at age 12 by a pediatrician and a psychologist in the context of poor academic performance, concentration difficulties, attention deficits, distractibility, impulsivity, and lack of organizational skills. At that time, the patient almost failed her first year of high school and began a trial of psychostimulants. By age 28, she had tried several long-acting formulations of methylphenidate as well as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, all of which increased her anxiety in social gatherings and resulted in significant dysphoria. At the time of her consultation, she was not on any medication.\n\n【9】She had no pertinent medical or surgical history, except for a concussion at age 15. Her mother had been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and her brother with borderline personality disorder.\n\n【10】One month prior to her consultation, the patient experienced a significant concussion accompanied by migraines, nausea, vomiting, and ataxia. An emergency physician prescribed a cerebral CT scan. While the results excluded hemorrhage, ischemia, or space-occupying lesions, they indicated a downward displacement of the cerebellar tonsils compatible with CM type I.\n\n【11】At the time of presentation to our clinic, most of her symptoms of concussion had subsided with the exception of dizziness during physical exercise. The patient was mainly preoccupied with symptoms of ADHD, which were evaluated with the clinical interview and the adult ADHD self-report scale (ASRS) \\[10\\]. Our consultation confirmed a postconcussion syndrome and ADHD. The patient’s baseline ASRS score (before starting medication) was 62. She was concerned that her lifelong symptoms of ADHD may have been caused by the CM leading us to undertake a review of the literature.\n\n【12】In the months following her initial evaluation, the patient proved to be extremely sensitive to the side effects of stimulants, limiting the possibility of using the usual therapeutic dose range. She is currently stabilized on 10 mg of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate daily. At this dose, her ASRS score was 51. She notes some improvement in organisation but continues to have significant difficulties with concentration and impulsivity as of July 2019.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Our case report of co-occurring ADHD and CM-I is one of only three cases described in the English literature. One other case occurred in a 10-year-old male who exhibited autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, and CM-I, and the third occurred in a 10-year-old male with a nonsense hemizygous mutation of the TBL1X gene, central congenital hypothyroidism, hearing loss, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), encopresis, and CM-I \\[11, 12\\]. These reports are of interest as they support evidence pertaining to the role of the cerebellum, its genetics, and its associated structures in the pathophysiology of ADHD.\n\n【15】CM consists of the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils, through the foramen magnum resulting in alteration and compression of postero-inferior cerebellar structures. Cerebellar findings, notably smaller cerebellar volumes, are amongst some of the earliest reported differences noted in ADHD \\[13\\]. Variations in cerebellar structure and functional connectivity have been reported in ADHD and ADHD symptom severity has been shown to correlate with the degree of reduction in volume of both the posterior vermis and of the cerebellum as a whole \\[13, 14\\].\n\n【16】A review of the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a sample of 86 children with a formal diagnosis of CM-I revealed elevated rates of psychiatric diagnoses, including ADHD (22.1%), anxiety (12.8%), and depression (10.5%) when compared to published norms in the general population \\[15\\].\n\n【17】Changes in the cerebellum and associated structures have also been linked with ASD, as was highlighted in the case report by Osuagwu and colleagues \\[11\\]. Their article underlined the neurobiological link between ADHD and ASD, as the cephalocranial disproportion in neural tissue in CM-I is also seen in ASD.\n\n【18】Furthermore, structural and functional imaging studies have shown evidence of altered brain volumes in ADHD leading to dysfunction in fronto-subcortical pathways \\[11\\]. A recent fMRI study noted that the altered connectivity in the cerebellar network was present in the combined type of ADHD (inattentive and hyperactive) as compared with alterations in the cingulo-frontoparietal attention and visual networks found in the predominately inattentive subtype \\[16\\].\n\n【19】Unfortunately, the absence of studies examining the association between ADHD and the different types of CM is a significant limitation of the available literature; it would be interesting to explore the relationship of severity of one condition and its correlation with that of the other. Additionally, an examination of the order of onset of cerebllar malformations and ADHD would inform the directionality of a causal relationship between the two conditions.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】This case report suggests a potential link between CM and ADHD which may itself be, in part, a result of cerebellar dysfunction. Imaging might not be appropriate in every case of ADHD but may be considered when the clinical signs and symptoms of CM are present such as headaches, neck pain, dizziness, and visual disturbances. These observations add to data suggesting that the cerebellum and its associated neural networks may play a role in the pathophysiology of ADHD.\n\n【22】#### Abbreviations\n\n【23】| ADHD: | Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder |\n| --- | --- |\n| CM: | Chiari malformation |\n| ASD: | Autism spectrum disorder |\n| TBL1X: | Transducin _β_\\-like 1 X-linked gene. |\n\n【24】#### Data Availability\n\n【25】Patient consent form and ASRS are available upon request.\n\n【26】#### Consent\n\n【27】Informed consent was obtained from the patient.

Leiomyosarcomas of vascular origin are particularly rare tumors occurring mainly in the inferior vena cava (IVC). They are malignant, slow-growing tumors with a poor prognosis. This paper reports on a rare case of surgical resection of an IVC leiomyosarcoma mimicking a hepatic tumor. _Case Presentation_. A 65-year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images, with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the Spiegel lobe or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma and performed a laparotomy. On the basis of surgical findings, we extirpated the tumor by performing a wedge resection of the wall of the IVC and suturing the primary IVC wall. Pathological findings led to a further diagnosis of the tumor as a leiomyosarcoma originating in the IVC. Thirty-seven months after the operation, multiple liver and lung metastases were detected, and the patient died from multiple organic failures. _Conclusion_.

Introduction\n\n【3】Leiomyosarcomas are malignant tumors of smooth muscle cells that can originate in any location but occur most often in the uterus, retroperitoneum, or intraabdominal region \\[1\\]. Leiomyosarcomas of vascular origin are particularly rare tumors occurring mainly in the inferior vena cava (IVC) \\[2, 3\\]. The International Registry of Inferior Vena Cava Leiomyosarcomas revealed that most tumors occur in the lower (44.2%) or middle (50.8%) region of the IVC, while only a small number of tumors occur in the upper third or suprahepatic region (4.2%) \\[4\\]. Leiomyosarcoma of IVC was first described by Dzsinich et al. in 1992 \\[5\\]. There are no definitive symptoms, but typical symptoms include dyspnea and a general feeling of being unwell accompanied by weight loss and abdominal and/or back pain \\[6\\]. A correct diagnosis is difficult, and, in up to one-third of cases, it is not made until after a postmortem examination \\[3\\]. Diagnosis is made using modern imaging techniques such as ultrasound, echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \\[2\\]. In spite of the advancement of modern imaging techniques, it is difficult to diagnose a leiomyosarcoma preoperatively, and in some cases it is also difficult to distinguish it from a hepatic tumor \\[4\\]. This paper reports on a rare case of surgical resection of an IVC leiomyosarcoma mimicking a hepatic tumor.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. The tumor was detected by chance during a chest CT performed for a lung examination. The patient had no past history of any abdominal surgery, and his vital signs were stable. There is nothing particularly significant in the findings of the laboratory examination. Tumor markers are negative.\n\n【6】Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images (Figure 1(a)), with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images (Figure 1(b)). Magnetic resonance imaging of this tumor revealed a contrasting low intensity on the T1-weighted image (Figure 2(a)) and high intensity on the T2-weighted image (Figure 2(b)). Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed no evidence of a malignant tumor in the gastrointestinal tract. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the Spiegel lobe or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| Enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images ((a) arrow), with no enhancement and washout in late-phase images ((b) arrow). |\n| --- |\n\n【12】  \n**(a)**\n\n【13】  \n**(b)**\n\n【14】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen.

To expose the affected IVC lesion, we need to mobilize some parts of the right lobe of the liver. This tumor was not located in the liver but originated in the IVC. We extirpated the tumor by performing a wedged resection of the wall of the IVC and sutured primary IVC wall. We controlled the bleeding from the IVC using the hemostatic forceps. The resected specimen was solid with a smooth surface (Figure 3). Microscopic examination revealed that the tumor consisted of uniform and spindle cells and had a fascicular growth pattern. This pathological feature was compatible with a mesenchymal tumor (Figure 4(a)). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that _α_\\-SMA and HHF35 were expressed in this tumor (Figures 4(b) and 4(c)), and c-kit and CD34 were negative. The MIB-1 index was about 60% (Figure 4(d)). The tumor was diagnosed as a leiomyosarcoma originating in the IVC. The patient’s recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 10. After 12 months, the tumor was detected in the Spiegel of the liver on enhanced CT of the abdomen (Figure 5). We diagnosed it as a recurrence of the leiomyosarcoma. We suggested to the patient and his family that he should undergo additional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgical resection, but they declined this. Thirty-seven months after the operation, multiple liver and lung metastases were detected on CT (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)), and the patient died of multiple organic failures.\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】  \n\n【20】  \n  \n\n【21】Figure 3 \n\n【22】| The resected specimen was solid with a smooth surface. |\n| --- |\n\n【23】  \n**(a)**\n\n【24】  \n**(b)**\n\n【25】  \n**(c)**\n\n【26】  \n**(d)**\n\n【27】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【28】Figure 4 \n\n【29】| Histopathological findings.

Discussion\n\n【40】Leiomyosarcomas originating in the IVC are rare, malignant, slow-growing tumors with a poor prognosis \\[6\\]. Tumor metastases of this slow-growing malignant tumor to other organs are relatively infrequent, but can be detected in the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, or bones \\[7, 8\\]. In this case, there were no symptoms, and the tumor was detected by chance in a chest CT. Present day imaging techniques such as abdominal ultrasonography, echocardiography, CT, and MRI are commonly employed to make a rapid and precise diagnosis of a suspected leiomyosarcoma \\[6\\]. In this case we could not preoperatively diagnose the tumor as leiomyosarcoma of the IVC and also could not rule out a potential liver tumor. A final conclusive diagnosis is of course made by means of histopathological and immunohistochemical methods. The pathognomonic findings of leiomyosarcoma are spindle-shaped tumor cells with positive markers for smooth muscle cells, vimentin, muscle actin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and desmin \\[9\\].\n\n【41】The recommended therapy for treating leiomyosarcoma is aggressive surgical removal of the tumor by means of modern vascular surgery, in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy \\[2, 8, 10\\]. In surgery, a complete resection of the tumor was possible, and the IVC was repaired primarily via surgical means without too high a risk of postoperative edema. For leiomyosarcomas, there is a perioperative mortality of 4%, and 42% of the patients died of the disease itself \\[11\\]. To reduce the tumor size and increase the resection rate, a preoperative neoadjuvant therapy can be implemented. If, however, a complete tumor resection is not possible, tumor reduction followed by radiation therapy provides a good palliative treatment option \\[12\\].\n\n【42】Postoperative therapy and the management of recurrence are difficult because of the absence of evidence for their effectiveness in patients. Radiation has been used in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, and some authors believe that it may help with the local control of disease \\[13\\]. For localized, resectable, soft-tissue sarcomas, adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin or a combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide has been shown to prolong the time before recurrence and the overall rate of survival \\[14\\]. This therapy may thus also be effective in the treatment of IVC leiomyosarcoma. A case has been previously reported in which an IVC leiomyosarcoma with liver metastasis was positive for steroid receptors, including the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) \\[4\\]. The patient received combined multimodal therapy, including resection of the tumor, intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy, and hormonal manipulation. Thus hormonal manipulation using medroxyprogesterone and/or tamoxifen should be tried in ER/PR-positive cases. Although there is no established treatment for patients with IVC leiomyosarcoma, we hope that thorough investigation of this condition will help establish a standard treatment yielding satisfactory results \\[4\\]. In a series of case studies of 14 patients with a leiomyosarcoma of the IVC who underwent generous resection followed by radiation, it was established that radiotherapy reduced local recurrence and increased the median survival time. In addition, a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been reported as being superior to radiotherapy alone with respect to an increase in the survival rate \\[13\\]. The long-term outcome of surgery for leiomyosarcoma of the IVC has been disappointing. Some reports with sufficient case numbers and followup revealed that a 5-year survival rate was achieved 33%–53% after radical resection followed by a curative approach using adjuvant therapy \\[2, 8, 13\\]. We should diagnose this tumor in early stage, and aggressive surgical management using modern vascular surgical and oncology techniques.\n\n【43】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【44】We encountered a rare case of leiomyosarcoma of the IVC mimicking a liver tumor. We must always consider leiomyosarcoma when treating a tumor between the liver and the IVC and be prepared to perform a complete surgical resection in the event of leiomyosarcoma and follow up carefully. We must also consider adjuvant therapy for a recurrent leiomyosarcoma.\n\n【45】#### Authors’ Contribution\n\n【46】J. Ueda, H. Yoshida, and E. Uchida contributed equally to this work; Y. Mamada, N.

Investigations revealed upper limb ischemia; he was hospitalized for further management.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a complication that has been associated with the use of COVID-19 vaccines that make use of an adenovirus vector \\[1\\], namely, Vaxzevria from AstraZeneca and Covishield from Janssen \\[2\\]. VITT is characterized by thrombosis that occurs 5 to 30 days after COVID-19 vaccination \\[3\\]. The mortality rate due to VITT varies between 30 and 60%. Primarily, the patients’ treatments included nonheparin anticoagulation and intravenous immune globulin \\[4\\]. COVID-19 vaccination was associated with thromboembolic events in some patients, and it is also evident that COVID-19 infection itself is commonly associated with thromboembolism \\[5\\].\n\n【4】Being first reported in February 2021, the syndrome is more commonly described in women, especially those younger than the age of 55 years \\[6\\]. According to an initial report released in April 2021 by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the incidence of VITT is 1 in 533,333 cases \\[7\\].\n\n【5】The clinical presentation of VITT appears to be very similar to that of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Symptoms of VITT include severe headache, focal neurological deficits, abdominal and extremity pain, vomiting, and in severe cases, mental status changes, coma, and death \\[2, 8\\]. The pathophysiology of HIT, where immunoglobulin G is produced and forms aggregates with the PF4-heparin complex, closely resembles that of VITT \\[1\\].\n\n【6】To confirm the diagnosis, thrombocytopenia, evidence of a new thrombotic event and positivity of the ELISA test for PF4 antibodies are necessary \\[9\\] based on the Brighton Collaboration, but this may miss patients who present with either thrombosis with normal platelet count or thrombocytopenia alone \\[8\\]. There were three levels of evidence depending on the confirmation of thrombosis based on imaging, surgical, laboratory findings, or clinical presentation of thrombosis or thromboembolism \\[8\\].\n\n【7】In the following case, we report a possible case of VITT in a patient who was admitted to Jordan University Hospital in June 2021.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 60-year-old man was in his usual state of health before presenting to the orthopedic clinic at Jordan University Hospital on May 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021, complaining of left hand pain. He did not report any history of trauma. There was no weakness or paresthesia of the left upper limb, nor shortness of breath or chest pain. The patient had no personal or family history of arrhythmias or thrombotic events. There were no other cardiac, respiratory, neurological, musculoskeletal, or other symptoms. He is a nonsmoker, and he does not use any regular medications. His complaint started two weeks after receiving the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.\n\n【10】Two days later, he presented to the emergency department complaining of increasing left hand pain and paresthesia. His left index initially was pale and then became cyanotic. He only felt tired when lifting heavy objects. There were no neurological defects or other associated symptoms.\n\n【11】On presentation, he was alert and oriented with stable vital signs. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations were normal. Upper limb pulses were not palpable on his left hand. His initial INR was 1.32, and his PT and PTT levels were elevated. Other laboratory investigations are presented in Table 1. A Doppler ultrasound of his left upper limb showed a monophasic radial pulse and a triphasic ulnar pulse.\n\n【12】Table 1 \n\n【13】Laboratory results on admission.\n\n【14】The CT scans provided showed an irregular filling defect at the junction between the aortic arch and the descending aorta, in addition to an irregular mural thrombus with calcification involving the aortic arch (Figure 1). There was also occlusion of the left radial artery at the level of the midforearm with retrograde filling at the level of the left rest. The left subclavian, axillary, brachial, and ulnar arteries were patent (Figure 2).\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Figure 1 \n\n【18】IV contrasted CT scan showing filling defect at the junction between the aortic arch and the descending aorta and an irregular mural thrombus with calcification in the aortic arch.\n\n【19】  \n\n【20】  \n\n【21】Figure 2 \n\n【22】IV contrasted CT scan showing occlusion of the left radial artery at the level of the midforearm with retrograde filling at the level of the left rest.\n\n【23】The patient was admitted under the care of the cardiovascular team as a case of upper limb ischemia for observation and therapeutic anticoagulation. Four weeks later, our patient presented to the clinic with improvement of his symptoms and reversal of tissue ischemia except for dry gangrene in his distal phalanx of the left index, which was left for autoamputation (Figure 3).\n\n【24】  \n\n【25】  \n\n【26】Figure 3 \n\n【27】Photo of the patient’s left hand showing the gangrenous distal phalanx of his left index finger.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【29】Thrombotic events post-COVID-19 vaccination, a type of VITT, are an evolving issue that depends on different factors such as age, gender, and geographical area \\[2\\]. These thromboembolic events are more common than other coagulopathies, such as bleeding \\[9\\]. The type of the vaccine and the number of doses also play a role, with AstraZeneca being associated with the highest incidence \\[2\\]. However, the World Health Organization released in March 2021 that the available data on AstraZeneca did not show any increased risk of clotting events despite having few cases reported on unique thromboembolism \\[10\\]. The earliest reported cases were the atypical venous thrombosis, mainly intracranial \\[1\\], which were challenging to treat \\[9\\]. Young females were mostly affected \\[1\\] and mostly presented within one to two weeks after receiving the vaccine \\[1, 9, 10\\]. The great majority of patients were previously healthy and fit \\[11\\]. So when a patient presents with headache, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and/or limb swelling postvaccination, a platelet count and imaging for thrombosis must be carried out \\[12\\].\n\n【30】An epidemiological study found that thrombotic episodes were more common among older adults during the first month post-ChAdOx1 vaccine \\[11\\]. Another study found that thrombotic events were more common in females and in patients younger than 45 years \\[13–15\\].\n\n【31】A narrative review paper found that the association between COVID-19 vaccination and the incidence of thrombosis is low. Nonetheless, smokers and the elderly still require special attention \\[16\\]. Despite the strength of the relationship, a conclusion about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination has yet to be drawn \\[17\\].\n\n【32】This case is different from previous cases, as our patient was an elderly male who did not have cerebral venous thrombosis, but rather, he presented with arterial thrombosis involving the aorta and the left radial artery. A study done in England to evaluate patients who were diagnosed with VITT identified 26 patients (12%) of the sample with aortic thrombosis or limb ischemia \\[11\\].\n\n【33】Our patient presented with thrombosis only, and his platelet count remained within the normal range. We did not test for PF4 antibodies, as a previous study concluded that PF4 antibodies alone may not be specific as they may be positive even without symptoms. One of nine patients with thrombosis without thrombocytopenia had weakly positive antibodies but with a negative functional test \\[8\\].\n\n【34】Our patient was started on warfarin and INR levels were checked continuously.\n\n【35】To the best of our knowledge, this is the second case of VITT from the Middle East after a case of mixed arterial and venous thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that was reported in Oman \\[5\\]. Both cases were treated with nonheparin anticoagulation and showed improvement in their hematological profiles.\n\n【36】Much about VITT still remains unclear. It has been suggested that a vaccine-induced autoimmune response to PF4 may be plausible \\[18\\]. Another possibility is that genetic predisposition may lead to thrombotic actions; however, further studies are required on next-generation sequencing to understand this vital issue.\n\n【37】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【38】This case highlights the importance of understanding the VITT mechanism. Also, healthcare providers need to be careful of any new adverse events that may occur after the administration of COVID-19 vaccines, as patients are heterogenous and not enough evidence from the literature supports the underlying etiologies of VITT.\n\n【39】#### Data Availability\n\n【40】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included within the article.\n\n【41】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【42】The article describes a case report.

Here, we present a case of a 17-year male who presented with multisystem involvement and eosinophilia. He was later diagnosed to have systemic lupus erythematosus with eosinophilia which is a rare combination. Despite being a diagnostic challenge, these patients can be well managed with immunosuppressive therapy if recognized in time.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Eosinophilia, defined as peripheral blood eosinophil count of more than 350 per mm<sup>3</sup>, is seen in many conditions \\[1\\]. Apart from parasitic infection which is the most common cause worldwide, allergy, hematological, and rheumatological conditions account for other etiologies \\[1, 2\\]. Although eosinophilia is commonly seen in rheumatological conditions such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and less commonly in dermatomyositis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis, and Sjögren syndrome, it has been rarely described in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) \\[2, 3\\]. Here, we present a case of 17-year male who presented to our center with multisystem involvement and was diagnosed to have eosinophilic vasculitis with SLE.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 17-year-male presented to our center with multiple skin lesions on bilateral lower limbs for 7 months. It started as painless, clear fluid-filled vesicles which later drained pus and resolved spontaneously. One month before the hospital presentation, he had 10–14 episodes of small-volume loose stool with mucus which lasted for 14 days. The diarrhea was not associated with fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Subsequently, he developed sharp, nonradiating pain at the tip of the left 2nd toe which progressed to dry gangrene involving half of the phalanx. He also complained of bilateral lower limb swelling and facial puffiness which subsided by the evening. He also had a productive cough with streaky hemoptysis without chest pain and shortness of breath. He also complained of fatigue, anorexia, and significant weight loss. There was no history of excessive hair fall, ear discharge, joint pain, malar rash, photosensitivity, oral and nasal ulcers, lumps and swelling, and muscle weakness. Patient did not have any comorbidities and has no history of any drug intake. A comprehensive timeline of his symptoms is shown in Figure 1.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】Timeline of symptoms onset.\n\n【10】On examination, pallor was present. Bilateral dorsalis pedis and left posterior tibial artery pulse were not palpable. Dry gangrene in the left second toe with a sharp line of demarcation was evident (Figure 2). Patchy loss of hair over bilateral toes was seen. Multiple skin lesions with central hypopigmentation and perilesional hyperpigmentation were seen on the bilateral lower limbs (Figure 3). There was diminished movement on the left side of the chest with a woody dull note on percussion and decreased vesicular breath sound.\n\n【11】  \n\n【12】  \n\n【13】Figure 2 \n\n【14】Dry gangrene in the left second toe.\n\n【15】  \n\n【16】  \n\n【17】Figure 3 \n\n【18】Multiple skin lesions with central hypopigmentation and perilesional hyperpigmentation.\n\n【19】The hemogram showed anemia (hemoglobin of 9.1 gm/dl) and eosinophilia (a total leucocyte count of 28560/mm<sup>3</sup> with 36% eosinophils and an absolute eosinophil count of 10288/mm<sup>3</sup>). Inflammatory markers were raised (ESR 73 mm/hour and high sensitivity C-reactive protein 10680 ng/ml). His activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was 37.7 s (control 29 s). On urinalysis, proteinuria was 1+ with a dipstick without active sediments, and 24-hour urine protein (UP) was 3.17 g/day. Peripheral blood smear showed increased corrected retics count and lactate dehydrogenase along with positive direct Coomb’s test (Table 1).\n\n【20】Table 1 \n\n【21】Laboratory findings of the patient.\n\n【22】Antinuclear antibody (ANA) tested positive with a homogeneous pattern and intensity of 3+ on immunofluorescence; however, his ANA immunoblot was negative. His dsDNA was raised, and antiphospholipid syndrome workup showed a borderline raised level of lupus anticoagulants and normal titres of anticardiolipin and anti-_β_2 glycoprotein I antibody. His C3 and C4 levels were normal (Table 2).\n\n【23】Table 2 \n\n【24】Serum antibody testing and its results of the patient.\n\n【25】Contrast-enhanced computed axial tomography scan (CECT) of the chest and pulmonary angiography was done that revealed multiple intermediate-walled cavitary lesions in the bilateral lower lobes. A biopsy from the left lower lobe was done which revealed necrotic tissue. Other laboratory results did not show any signs of renal, electrolyte, or hepatic abnormalities. The Mantoux test and sputum for acid-fast bacilli yielded negative results. Tests for hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV1 and 2, and leptospirosis were negative. Repeated examination of blood, urine, sputum, and stool for bacterial and parasitic infection revealed no abnormalities. The stool revealed no RBC, parasite, egg, ova, or cyst.\n\n【26】He was started on high-dose oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg), mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxychloroquine, and anticoagulation. One week after the commencement of immunosuppressive therapy, 24-hour UP decreased to 0.29 g/day, and his hemogram revealed a decrease in eosinophil count to 13%. Three months later, on follow-up, the patient was symptom-free, and his absolute eosinophil count and 24-hour UP normalized to normal range.\n\n【27】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【28】SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disorder with varying involvement of different organs \\[4\\].\n\n【29】In our case, there was the involvement of the vascular, hematological, respiratory, and renal systems. The investigation confirmed the diagnosis of SLE and persistent hypereosinophilia. Additional laboratory investigation was warranted to determine the cause of eosinophilia which included peripheral blood smear (for hematological malignancies), serological tests for hepatitis A, B, and C, HIV1 and 2, leptospirosis, blood, stool, and urine examination and culture. None of the tests were conclusive. There was no evidence for tuberculosis and aspergillosis as X-ray, CT scan, Mantoux test, and sputum for acid-fast bacilli yielded equivocal results. There was no evidence of parasitic infections. We planned to perform a tissue biopsy of the skin lesion and renal biopsy but could not be done as the biopsy specimen had to be sent to another country (for immunofluorescence), and it was unfeasible amidst COVID-19 nation-wide lockdown.\n\n【30】This manuscript not only points the unusual presentation of SLE with eosinophilia but also its presentation in a young male. SLE is more prevalent in female of child bearing age; however, it has various manifestations which vary according to the age group and gender because of difference in their pathogenetic mechanism \\[5\\]. Based on the history, clinical examination, and serum antibody positive for ANA, dsDNA, and lupus anticoagulant, we made a diagnosis of eosinophilic vasculitis with SLE with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLAs). He can be diagnosed to have SLE on the basis of 2012 SLICC criteria as well as 2019 EULAR/ACR criterion. Positive ANA along with proteinuria >0.5 g/day with positive lupus anticoagulant and anti-ds DNA gives ≥10 with at least one clinical criterion point the diagnosis of SLE according to 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria for SLE. The diagnosis was further supported by a marked response to corticosteroid and MMF therapy. The main limitation and diagnostic challenge in our diagnosis was the unavailability of histopathological study of tissue biopsy of the skin lesions which would have guided our diagnosis of eosinophilic vasculitis earlier.\n\n【31】The other differential diagnoses to this presentation of this condition are parasitic infection, drug-induced lupus, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. In this patient, serological tests and stool examination were carried out to exclude the presence of parasites, and no clinical signs of parasitic infection were present. Stool and serological tests were also negative for parasitic infection. The absence of intake of any drugs and negative antihistone antibody ruled out the possibility of drug-induced lupus. Although eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a possible diagnosis for this patient, negative P-ANCA and fulfilment of EULAR criteria make the diagnosis of SLE more favorable than eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.\n\n【32】Increased serum LDH along with increased retics count in peripheral blood smear along with positive direct Coomb’s test points that the cause of anemia in this case be autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The discordance between the proteinuria and anemia shall be nothing more than a mere coincidence. The presence of AIHA further adds to the positive correlation of this case to SLE.\n\n【33】Eosinophilia in the absence of coexisting allergy or parasitic infection is rarely seen in SLE patients. Eosinophilia with multiple organ/system involvement suggests eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss vasculitis) as the primary working diagnosis. In the evaluation of such patients, it is recommended to test for toxocariasis, _Aspergillus_ species (to evaluate for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis), and human immunodeficiency virus. The laboratory investigations should include vitamin B12 level (to evaluate for myeloproliferative hypereosinophilic syndrome), peripheral blood smear (to look for dysplastic eosinophils or blasts suggestive of primary eosinophilic bone marrow process), and chest computed tomography scan (to evaluate for lung involvement) \\[2\\].\n\n【34】Several reports have described eosinophilic vasculitis \\[6\\], eosinophilic gastroenteritis \\[7, 8\\], Loffler’s endocarditis \\[9, 10\\], eosinophilic pruritic cutaneous lesions \\[11\\], and nonerosive arthritis \\[12\\] in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. All of the cases possessed diagnostic difficulty due to the rarity of the case. In most of the reported cases of SLE with eosinophilia, it was treated with high-dose corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators, and all cases responded well. In one case reported by Thomeer et al. \\[9\\], after the patient was clinically improved with the treatment, he died and a postmortem diagnosis of Loffler’s syndrome was made. In another case report by Lee et al. \\[11\\], who used low-dose prednisolone (10–30 mg/day) for hypereosinophilic syndrome with SLE, there was no improvement in cutaneous manifestations. However, proteinuria in the patient had resolved. All the history, clinical, diagnosis, treatment, and result after treatment in reported cases of SLE with eosinophilia affecting different organs are given in Table 3.\n\n【35】Table 3 \n\n【36】Clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of different reported studies.\n\n【37】This case report points to an atypical presentation of SLE with eosinophilia thus adding to the existing literature. The main limitation to this study is failure to obtain the skin and kidney biopsies, which could have confirmed the diagnosis in this patient. Due to the existing condition of worldwide pandemic, biopsy could not be done. However, the above discussed features support the diagnosis of SLE in this patient with atypical feature like eosinophilia.\n\n【38】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【39】We here present a rare association of SLE with eosinophilia. SLE should be kept in the differential diagnosis of persistent unexplained eosinophilia. Being a rare entity, diagnosis of this SLE with eosinophilia as a leading point can be difficult, but once diagnosed, this condition is responsive to high-dose corticosteroids and immunomodulator therapy.\n\n【40】#### Data Availability\n\n【41】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【42】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【43】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【44】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【45】The authors would like to acknowledge the patient for providing the consent to write and add to the medical literature of the case.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a small vessel vasculitis characterized by lung and kidney involvement. It is typically a disease of white females and has a poor prognosis with the average life expectancy of 5 months for a patient without treatment. Oral and skin ulcers are considered to be rare presentations. _Case_. A 39-year-old black male presented to the hospital with oral and skin ulcers and was diagnosed with GPA based on the biopsies of both cutaneous lesions and kidney. He was started on rituximab with minimal improvement. Later he was admitted to the ICU and had plasmapheresis, and he gradually improved and was discharged home 8 days after admission. _Conclusion_. GPA is an aggressive vascular disorder resulting in possible organ system damage and failure. The role of the sickle cell trait in this patient is undefined, but this combination of gender, race, and presenting symptoms in GPA is extremely unusual.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis, is a small vessel vasculitis with systemic manifestations. This disease is characterized by upper and lower respiratory granulomatous inflammation with or without renal involvement \\[1\\]. It is part of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated small vessel vasculitis which includes Churg–Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, and renal-limited vasculitis \\[2\\]. GPA is a rare disease with a prevalence of 3 cases per 100,000 in the United States \\[3\\]. The localized form of the disease is predominant in young females \\[4\\], peaking in the fourth and sixth decade of life \\[5, 6\\]. GPA can present as a generalized disease or limited disease. The generalized disease can involve any organ while the localized form is usually limited to lungs, eyes, or ears, but other organs can be involved including the heart. Generalized symptoms such as fever and malaise may be present. Pulmonary symptoms include cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Renal involvement is usually late and is associated with a poor prognosis \\[7\\]. Oral mucosa lesions occur in 6–50% of patients \\[8, 9\\]. Currently, the diagnosis of GPA is based on clinical, serological, and histological findings.\n\n【4】The diagnosis is aided by the presence of serum antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody. In the generalized disease, ANCA can be seen in 80–95% of the patients, but in limited presentations, ANCA can be detected in a range of 60%–80%. If clinical suspicion is high with a negative ANCA test, obtaining a tissue sample for histopathology is required for definitive diagnosis \\[1\\]. In our case, we present a male who is seen in the emergency department with cutaneous lesions as the initial presentation of GPA. Our patient initially presented without pulmonary or renal involvement and was diagnosed with GPA following biopsies of oral and cutaneous lesions.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 39-year-old black male with known sickle cell trait presented to the emergency department with lower extremity swelling with blisters and odynophagia. He developed petechial lesions on both feet that progressed to ulcers (Figure 1) on the bilateral lower extremities. The odynophagia started 2 weeks prior to presentation and was associated with a tongue ulcer. He had been evaluated by an infectious disease team during a previous visit and had an unrevealing workup. He was not on any treatment for lower extremity lesions. He denied fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, night sweats, recent travel, and history of IV drug use.\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】Ulcer on third and fifth toes (arrows).\n\n【11】His initial vital signs were BP 156/86, HR 114, temperature 102.2 F, and O<sub>2</sub> saturation at 98% on room air. Physical exam was remarkable for oral thrush with right tongue ulceration and healing ulcers on the dorsal surface of his feet bilaterally. His complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic profile (BMP) were within normal limits. Urinalysis was positive for blood and 2+ proteinuria. His urine toxicology was positive for oxycodone. He was initially treated for Systemic Inflammatory Response System (SIRS). Blood cultures were drawn and he was started empirically on vancomycin and piperacillin and tazobactam. Bilateral venous duplex was negative for deep vein thrombosis. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed multiple irregular nodules with suspected infectious versus inflammatory etiology and septic emboli could not be excluded (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiogram was negative for infective endocarditis. Bilateral foot ulcers drained serosanguinous fluid with cultures positive for _Enterococcus faecalis_ and _Serratia_ but four sets of blood cultures remained negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left foot was normal and MRI of the right foot showed metatarsal stress reaction versus early osteomyelitis. Skin biopsy showed extensively necrotic fibroadipose tissue with acute inflammation. Right lateral oral tongue ulcerative lesion biopsy showed predominantly hyperplastic squamous mucosa showing an ulcer site and abscess with fragments of necrotic squamous epithelium associated with cytologic atypia and colonies of bacteria, and one fragment of necrotic squamous epithelium displayed vague papillary architecture. The patient later developed right eye conjunctivitis. Appropriate consultations with nephrology, pulmonology, and podiatry were obtained.\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】CT imaging showing multiple irregular pulmonary nodules (arrow) at different levels. The morphology of these nodules favors infectious/inflammatory nodules more than malignancy. Vasculitis can also have this appearance.\n\n【16】Based on the constellation of oral and cutaneous ulcers, CT chest findings, bilateral foot ulcers, and conjunctivitis, a rheumatologic process was suspected. The antinuclear antibody (ANA) was negative, rheumatoid factor was with 1 : 640 titer, C-ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) was positive with 1 : 1280 titer, and the diagnosis of Wegner’s granulomatosis was made. He was started on rituximab 375 mg weekly and methylprednisolone 250 mg every 6 hours for 3 days. He later had a renal biopsy which showed granulomatosis with polyangiitis and mild interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy and a pauci immune crescentic glomerulonephritis (Figures 3 and 4). He underwent debridement of his bilateral foot ulcers and received an additional dose of rituximab. Following the second dose of rituximab, the oral ulcers improved. Toward the end of his hospitalization, his hemoglobin decreased and he was noted to have blood streaked sputum. Repeat CT chest was ordered and was consistent with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (Figure 5). Unfortunately, he left prior to pulmonology evaluation. He was called and encouraged to come back to the hospital but declined and ultimately sought further medical attention at another hospital where he was ultimately admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Nephrology was consulted and began plasmapheresis for a total of 7 treatments. He was given a one-time dose of cyclophosphamide on initial presentation and then an additional dose of rituximab following plasmapheresis. He gradually improved and was discharged home 8 days after admission.\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Figure 3 \n\n【20】Light microscopy of a renal biopsy with multiple cores of renal tissue, of which approximately 40% is represented by cortex. Eighteen glomeruli are present, none of which are globally sclerotic. In up to four glomeruli, there are segmental cellular crescents, associated with fibrinoid necrosis and rupture of the capillary loops. Intact glomeruli do not show significant endocapillary hypercellularity. The tubulointerstitial compartment is marked by tubular injury, with tubular dilatation and epithelial simplification. There is mild and patchy inflammatory infiltrate, mixed. Multiple red blood cell casts are present throughout the biopsy. Occasional neutrophilic casts are also seen. There are mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy which comprise approximately 20% of the cortex. Arteries are marked by mild intimal fibrosis. Arterioles do not show significant hyalinosis. Toluidine blue-stained sections contain four intact glomeruli.\n\n【21】  \n\n【22】  \n\n【23】Figure 4 \n\n【24】This section is stained for fibrinogen and kappa and lambda light chains. There is focal and segmental staining of glomeruli with fibrinogen, in areas of crescents/fibrinoid necrosis (arrow). Kappa and lambda stain equally throughout the tubulointerstitium.\n\n【25】  \n\n【26】  \n\n【27】Figure 5 \n\n【28】Predominantly central patchy and confluent ground-glass and interstitial opacities (arrows). This pattern is nonspecific but, given the patient’s history, is favored to represent alveolar hemorrhage secondary to vasculitis.\n\n【29】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【30】Granulomatosis with polyangiitis was first described in 1936 by Wegener \\[10\\]. GPA was defined by the 2012 Chapel Hill consensus as necrotizing inflammatory vasculitis affecting mainly the small to medium vessels of the upper and lower respiratory tract \\[11\\]. Gubbels et al. reported that GPA affects a wide age range with a mean age of diagnosis of 40 years \\[12\\]. GPA can affect all racial groups but is seen predominantly among Caucasian people \\[13\\]. The typical diagnostic criteria were first described by Goldman and Churg in 1954. This includes upper and lower respiratory tract necrotizing granulomas, glomerulonephritis, and systemic vasculitis \\[14\\]. The American College of Rheumatology established criteria for GPA in 1990 which include abnormal urinary sediment, chest radiograph abnormalities, oral ulcers or nasal discharge, and biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation \\[15\\]. The earliest symptoms of the disease are often important clues that guide toward the diagnosis. Kihiczak published a case report in 1994 describing a 36-year-old woman who was diagnosed with sarcoidosis after having conjunctival and nasal mucosal biopsy. Later on, after a prolonged course of symptoms, she was ultimately properly diagnosed with atypical GPA with granulomatous ulcers \\[16\\]. Figarella also described a patient who had recurrent nodular lesions on the legs and biopsy showed nonspecific inflammation. Ten years later, pulmonary symptoms developed and a repeat skin biopsy revealed granulomatous vasculitis as the underlying cause for the cutaneous and pulmonary disease \\[17\\]. While skin lesions occur in 14–50% of patients with GPA, there are no specific cutaneous symptoms for the disease. Lesions can include palpable purpura, skin nodules, skin ulcers, and livedo reticularis. Palpable purpura can be considered as the most common skin manifestation with a prevalence of 35% among patients with GPA and 74% among dermatological findings \\[9\\]. A very rare cutaneous manifestation is pyoderma gangrenosum, defined by skin necrosis and deep ulcers. Kędzierska et al. published a treatment-resistant case that was treated with dapsone and steroids \\[18\\]. Sinovich and Snow also presented a case of a patient with right infra-auricular noduloulcerative lesion that progressed to a periauricular pyoderma gangrenosum that was completely resolved with steroids and azathioprine therapy \\[19\\]. Duna et al. reported that 6–13% of patients with GPA have oral lesions with 2% only have it as a presenting feature \\[20\\]. This was one of our patient’s presenting complaints making this case somewhat unusual. The combination of “strawberry gingivitis” with a biopsy showing pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, microabscesses, and multinucleated giant cells with severe systemic symptoms can be diagnostic for GPA \\[21\\]. There have been few reports showing that GPA can affect parotid, submandibular, and sublingual salivary glands \\[22\\]. Tongue necrosis is a rare oral symptom with only two previously reported cases. The first one was by Bachmeyer et al. who published a case of necrotic lingual ulceration that was resolved with immunosuppressive therapy \\[23\\]. The second was by Rodgers et al. with a case of bilateral tongue infarction with a severe and rapidly progressive form of GPA \\[24\\]. Early diagnosis is important. The aim of treating GPA early on is to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease as the average life expectancy is only 5 months for a patient without treatment with a 1-year survival rate <20% \\[25\\]. Treatment of GPA is multidisciplinary between different subspecialties in order to treat the different organs that are involved in the disease process. Treatment with corticosteroid alone was found to double the life expectancy to about 12 months with a 1-year survival of 34% \\[26\\]. Treatment with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid therapy has resulted in remission and increased survival rate \\[27\\]. Azathioprine, while less effective than cyclophosphamide, has shown some success and should be considered in patients with adverse effects to cyclophosphamide or when patients have fertility concerns \\[28\\]. Methotrexate, used in limited GPA, is less likely to achieve and sustain remission \\[29\\]. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against CD20 antigen on B cells and may be important in prevention of disease relapse \\[30\\].\n\n【31】In conclusion, GPA should be considered in the differential among patients who present with skin and oral ulcers compatible with pyoderma gangrenosum that develop worsening of renal indices. Due to the morbidity and mortality associated with the condition, early diagnosis is important. A multidisciplinary approach with close communication between a renal team and primary care physician team is important to achieve the best outcomes. This role of the sickle cell trait in this patient is undefined, but this combination of gender, race, and presenting symptoms in GPA is extremely unusual.\n\n【32】#### Data Availability\n\n【33】All data generated or analyzed in this study are included within this article.

Post-COVID-19 stroke occurs mainly in older patients who have preexisting vascular risk factors. Most strokes are possibly related to hypercoagulability associated with COVID-19 where elevated D-dimer levels were the most common finding. In this case, post-COVID-19 ischemic stroke occurred in a relatively young patient without preexisting cerebrovascular risk factors which were rarely reported before. _Case Presentation_. A 40-year-old male presented lack of concentration, sluggish mind, and forgetfulness. The patient has a positive COVID-19 history 5 weeks ago. The noncontrast MSCT scan confirmed multifocal lacunar cerebral infarction on the left lateral ventricle. Laboratory tests showed an increase in D-dimer of 1.22 g/ml. _Conclusion_. In COVID-19 patients without comorbidities, ischemic stroke should be considered.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】COVID-19 caused by the COVID-19 virus is associated with multisystem dysfunction covering any neurologic involvement. The neurological involvement in the form of stroke as a clinical manifestation was reported in 6 patients (2.8%) with COVID-19 according to a study in Asia with 214 patients \\[1\\].\n\n【4】Stroke is a rare complication of COVID-19 with an estimated prevalence of 3% \\[2\\]. The incidence of stroke is reported to be higher among patients with COVID-19 than in the non-COVID-19 population. A preliminary case-control study showed that COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for acute ischemic stroke \\[3\\]. A stroke occurs mainly in patients with severe COVID-19 and who have preexisting vascular risk factors \\[4\\].\n\n【5】COVID-19 patients have significantly higher rates of cryptogenic stroke (stroke of undetermined etiology on TOAST criteria) than non-COVID-19 patients \\[5\\]. Most cryptogenic strokes are possibly related to acquired hypercoagulability obtained during COVID-19 \\[6\\]. In coagulopathy conditions associated with COVID-19, elevated D-dimer levels were the most common finding \\[7\\]. The long-term effect of COVID-19 on the elevated D-dimer is estimated to reach 20% \\[2\\].\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 40-year-old male came to the neurology department with complaints of lack of concentration, sluggish mind, and forgetfulness. The patient has a positive COVID-19 history and is currently tested negative. Complaints have been felt since 6 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and continued 5 weeks since the onset of acute COVID-19. The patient started experiencing symptoms of acute COVID-19 without respiratory symptoms. Initial complaints were fever, anosmia, and fatigue. Fever varied between 38.5 and 40.5°C. During the acute COVID-19 phase, the patient was isolated at the Wisma Atlet, Jakarta. The patient’s O<sub>2</sub> saturation had dropped to 88%, and then, he received oxygen therapy with a nasal cannula. He experienced a memory deficit in which he did not recognize his family members. The results of the MoCA-Ina examination showed a score of 30 meaning that there is no cognitive impairment.\n\n【8】The patient did not show weakness in the legs or arms. On neurological examination, including motor, sensory, and cranial nerve functions, no neurologic deficits were found as commonly found in stroke. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes, heart problems, stroke, TIA, thromboembolism, or other vascular diseases. Medical, family, and psychosocial history were normal. However, the noncontrast MSCT scan confirmed the presence of hypodense lesions on the right lateral ventricles and calcifications on the pineal body and lentiform nucleus. It can be concluded that CVA was obtained with multifocal lacunar cerebral infarction, especially on the left lateral ventricle (Figure 1).\n\n【9】  \n\n【10】  \n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】Multiple lacunar hypodense lesions on the CT scan.\n\n【13】Laboratory tests were performed 5 weeks after the onset of acute COVID-19 and showed an increase in D-dimer of 1.22 g/ml. The other laboratory parameters for stroke panel were normal (cholesterol, LDL, triglyceride, blood glucose level, and hemoconcentration). Pharmacological therapy was provided in the form of oral anticoagulants rivaroxaban (10 mg), citicoline (500 mg), vitamin D3 (1000 IU), and vitamin B complex. The follow-up showed significant improvement, and the patient became fully independent with modified Rankin Scale measurement.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】This study reports a case of ischemic stroke with multiple lacunar infarcts in patients with a history of COVID-19. COVID-19 was confirmed by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, and the diagnosis of ischemic stroke was confirmed by an MSCT scan of the head.\n\n【16】Besides the presentation of ischemic stroke, other complaints are prolonged fatigue, difficulty in concentrating, and memory problems. In self-isolated patients, the most common symptoms of physical exhaustion were fatigue (35%), increased need for rest (30%), and lack of energy (29%), while the most common symptoms of mental exhaustion were difficulty in finding words (23%), difficulty in concentrating (19%), and memory problems (18%). More than half of COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate illness experience those symptoms 6 months after the infection \\[8\\].\n\n【17】The onset of neurological symptoms ranges from 3–14 days from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. It is in line with the Global COVID-19 registry (the average delay between the onset of COVID-19 symptoms and the onset of stroke is 7 days) \\[9\\]. In a study in New York, the median age of stroke patients was 62.5 years and the median time between the onset of the first COVID-19 symptoms and stroke was 10 days \\[6\\]. Referring to the Global COVID-19 registry, the imaging characteristics of stroke in COVID-19 involve 22.7% large vessels and 7.6% lacunar \\[9\\].\n\n【18】In this case, post- COVID-19 ischemic stroke occurred in a relatively young patient (40 years) without preexisting cerebrovascular risk factors which were rarely reported before. Considering the age of the patient and no accompanying cerebrovascular risk factors can help show that COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for acute ischemic stroke \\[10\\].\n\n【19】Early-onset cerebrovascular disease is more common in COVID-19 patients with underlying cerebrovascular risk factors including older age (>65 years) and very few reported cases of stroke in younger patients (<50 years) \\[11\\]. Based on the TOAST guidelines, specific vascular risk factors for ischemic stroke are diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia, hypertension, congestive heart failure (CHF) and atrial fibrillation, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) \\[12\\].\n\n【20】The incidence of stroke has been reported in 5.7% of patients with severe COVID-19 and in 0.8% of patients with nonsevere infection \\[1\\]. The frequency of stroke detected in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was 1.1% associated with older age and stroke risk factors. Frequent cryptogenic strokes and elevated D-dimer support increased risk of thromboembolism in COVID-19 which is associated with high mortality \\[13\\].\n\n【21】The significant increase in D-dimer levels in patients with acute ischemic stroke suggests that COVID-19 can induce an inflammatory response and trigger a hypercoagulable state causing an acute ischemic stroke \\[14\\]. The hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 supports the formation of small and/or large blood clots in many organs such as the brain, which have the potential to cause cerebrovascular disease (ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage) \\[15\\].\n\n【22】D-dimer is a degradation product of fibrin cross linking. Increased D-dimer levels indicate global activation of hemostasis and fibrinolysis, and it is in line with the COVID-19-associated hypercoagulability hypothesis \\[16\\]. Increased D-dimer levels confirm the theories of endothelial activation and hypercoagulability, but other mechanisms are under investigation \\[10\\]. Some other plausible proposed mechanisms involved in stroke in COVID-19 are viral neurotropism, endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, and inflammation \\[11\\].\n\n【23】The possible effect of hypercoagulability as a cause of stroke after COVID-19 infection is still unclear although some recent case reports in young patients with few/no comorbid risk factors have the potential to lead to this hypercoagulability mechanism \\[17\\]. A COVID-19-associated hypercoagulable state from a proinflammatory process can be hypothesized as a possible contributing mechanism for the higher prevalence of embolic cryptogenic stroke presentation \\[5\\].\n\n【24】As COVID-19 infection has been found to lead to a hypercoagulable state, in this case, the role of anticoagulation is important. The pharmacological therapy provided was rivaroxaban oral anticoagulant.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【26】In conclusion, this study reports a case of ischemic stroke after acute COVID-19 in a relatively young patient without preexisting cerebrovascular risk factors. Physicians should be aware, perform early identification, and treat stroke possibility on COVID-19.\n\n【27】#### Data Availability\n\n【28】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【29】#### Consent\n\n【30】No written consent has been obtained from the patients as there is no patient identifiable data included in this case report.\n\n【31】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【32】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n【33】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【34】The authors acknowledge the funder for involvement in the initial manuscript, data processing, imaging report, and supervision.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Upper gastric endoscopy revealed a giant polypoid-type tumor that extended from the duodenum bulb to the pyloric ring. A computed tomography scan revealed a slightly enhanced lobular tumor protruding into the duodenum bulb. Positron emission tomography showed an accumulation of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose in the area extending from the antrum of the stomach to the duodenum bulb. Since an endoscopic ultrasound test suggested that the tumor might invade the muscular tunic, indications of endoscopic mucosal resection were not favored, and the tumor was curatively removed via distal gastrectomy. The histopathologic diagnosis was papillary adenocarcinoma, and the invasion depth was the mucosal layer without vascular invasion, which was different from the preoperative diagnosis. Our case suggests the difficulties in precise diagnosis of the invasion depth of the giant polypoid cancer.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Gastric polypoid tumors vary in terms of histology, neoplastic potential, and management. Preoperative diagnosis is now extremely precise because of technical improvements in upper gastric endoscopy and medical imaging. However, it sometimes differs from the postoperative histopathologic diagnosis. Our case suggests the difficulties in precise diagnosis of the invasion depth of the giant polypoid cancer.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 66-year-old Japanese man undergoing hemodialysis for chronic renal failure was referred to our hospital with suspected duodenal cancer. On physical examination, his abdomen was soft and flat without symptoms. Tumor markers were within normal limits, and laboratory findings were normal except for renal dysfunction due to chronic renal failure. Upper gastric endoscopy revealed a giant polypoid-type tumor extending from the duodenum bulb to the pyloric ring; its main location was thought to be the duodenum bulb (Figure 1(a)). The surface of the tumor was rough, but its outline was clear. A biopsy of the tumor showed atypical papillous epithelium containing goblet cells, and nuclei in the epithelium were p53-positive. An endoscopic ultrasound test suggested that the tumor might invade the muscular tunic (Figure 1(b)). A computed tomography scan revealed a slightly enhanced lobular tumor (54 mm × 34 mm) protruding into the duodenum bulb, although serosal invasion was not detected (Figure 2(a)). Positron emission tomography showed an accumulation of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose (60 mm × 34 mm, maximum standardized uptake value = 5.6) in the area extending from the antrum of the stomach to the duodenum bulb (Figure 2(b)). Because indications of endoscopic mucosal resection were not favored, the giant polypoid-type early gastric cancer that was expressed on the pyloric ring and confined within the mucosal layer was curatively removed via abdominal surgery. We performed a submucosal resection via an incision in the gastric anterior wall. The resected tumor was localized in the anterior wall of pyrolic ring. Intraoperative histopathological diagnosis with a frozen section suggested that the tumor contained adenocarcinoma components; therefore, we performed distal gastrectomy followed by Billroth II reconstruction. The extent of resection was from the lesser curvature of stomach, which was 5 cm from the pyrolic ring, to the duodenum, which was 4 cm from the pyrolic ring. The resected lymph nodes were number 3b, number 4d, number 5, and number 6. The histopathological diagnosis was papillary adenocarcinoma, and the invasion depth was the mucosal layer without vascular invasion (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). There are no metastases in the removed lymph nodes and the numbers of resected lymph nodes were number 3b (0/1), number 4d (0/3), number 5 (0/1), and number 6 (0/4). The pathological stage was T1aN0M0- pStage IA. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was free from recurrence 1 year after the surgery.\n\n【6】  \n**(a)**\n\n【7】  \n**(b)**\n\n【8】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】(a) Upper gastric endoscopy revealing a giant polypoid-type tumor extending from the duodenum bulb to the pyloric ring.

Discussion\n\n【22】Polypoid-type gastric tumors protruding into the duodenum bulb are very rare. Inlaying of the tumor sometimes results in ball-valve syndrome, which is obstruction of the duodenum bulb because of the inlaying of the tumor \\[1\\]. In such cases, the reported symptoms are abdominal pain, vomiting, epigastralgia, and a sense of abdominal distension. Gastric polypoid tumors arise from the pyrolic ring or the antrum of the stomach \\[2\\] and are sometimes reported as early-stage cancers or leiomyomas. In such cases, they are usually pedunculated, and invasion depth is relatively shallow. In our case, gastrointestinal obstruction did not occur, because the mobility of the tumor was maintained and the tumor was soft. Because the tumor was pedunculated and the invasion depth was the mucosal layer without vascular invasion, it was clearly early-stage.\n\n【23】Gastric polyps are a heterogeneous group of epithelial and subepithelial lesions that vary in terms of histology, neoplastic potential, and management \\[3\\]. Treatments for gastric tumors include abdominal surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and endoscopic submucosal dissection, and the choice of operative method depends on the invasion depth of the tumor which is determined via an endoscopic ultrasound test, as well as the neoplastic potential. Recently, it was reported that gastric polypectomy is a safe endoscopic treatment \\[4\\]. In our case, the tumor was derived from an adenomatous polyp with high neoplastic potential; therefore, complete polypectomy and sampling of the surrounding mucosa were required. The invasion depth was estimated as the mucosal layer preoperatively; however, endoscopic treatment in our case was technically impossible because the stalk of the tumor was located on the pyloric ring, and working space was limited. Therefore, we firstly chose a submucosal resection via an abdominal incision based on preoperative assessment of a frozen section. However, the definitive diagnosis was adenocarcinoma, so we subsequently performed distal gastrectomy.\n\n【24】The tumor showed an accumulation of <sup>18</sup>F-fluorodeoxyglucose, and the invasion depth was the muscular tunic as estimated via an endoscopic ultrasound test. However, the histopathologic diagnosis was early cancer of the stomach within the mucosal layer without vascular invasion, which was different from the preoperative diagnosis. This case suggests the difficulties in precise diagnosis of the invasion depth of the giant polypoid cancer.\n\n【25】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【26】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative disorder presented with different manifestations. However, bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH) and adrenal insufficiency (AI) are rare manifestations. Herein, we described a patient who suffered from BAH and AI in the context of PV. _Case Presentation_. A 60-year-old man with an underlying history of PV was admitted with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of consciousness. Primitive computed tomography (CT) scan findings revealed bilateral adrenal masses (right: 40  23 mm, left: 60  35 mm) with the second scan showing quite similar results (right adrenal: 40  29 mm, left adrenal: 48  26 mm) suggesting BAH. The further adrenal assessment proved concurrent AI. Both adrenal masses resolved completely after 15 months. However, the patient still suffered from AI. _Conclusion_. BAH and AI in patients with PV should be considered rare complications requiring high clinical suspicion for early diagnosis and treatment to avoid life-threatening outcomes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Adrenal hemorrhage (AH) is a rare disorder with a prevalence ranging from 0.14 to 1.8% reported from post-mortem records \\[1, 2\\]. Several predisposing factors have been suggested for this unusual disease, including septic shock, stress, abdominal trauma, pregnancy, coagulopathies, and different hematologic disorders such as antiphospholipid syndrome and essential thrombocytosis \\[2, 3\\]. However, the incidence of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (BAH) and subsequent adrenal insufficiency (AI) in the context of polycythemia vera (PV), as one of the myeloproliferative disorders, is rarely reported \\[4, 5\\].\n\n【4】Herein, we described a patient with an underlying history of PV who experienced BAH and subsequent AI and reviewed the literature in this regard.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 60-year-old man with underlying hypertension and PV was admitted after an acute onset of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and concomitant loss of consciousness. On admission, he had a blood pressure of 110/75 mmHg. The patient mentioned prior episodes of vague abdominal pain over the past decade. He was diagnosed with PV 14 years ago on the basis of erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, and a bone marrow biopsy which was consistent with erythroid and myeloid hyperplasia without any grades of fibrosis. A PCR test for BCR-ABL1 was negative and the mutation JAK2V617F was detected. He denied using cigarettes and alcohol. His only medications were daily aspirin (80 mg), hydroxyurea (200 mg), and irregular usage of losartan (25 mg) and he did not mention usage of any other drugs. He irregularly performed phlebotomies and did not have good adherence to treatment. Based on previous medical records, his underlying disease was not well controlled and his last cell blood count revealed white blood cells (WBC) of 19.2  10<sup>3</sup>/l, hemoglobin of 14.2 g/dL, and platelet counts of 160  10<sup>6</sup>/l. There were no records indicating a hypertension control status. He denied any previous thrombotic events or any major bleeding episodes. On physical examination, he was lethargic and confused. Abdominal tenderness was present in the epigastrium as well as the periumbilical region, and splenomegaly was also noted in addition to left side costovertebral angle tenderness. As shown in Table 1, laboratory data were normal except for leukocytosis, which had been approved to be in the same range since he was diagnosed with PV.\n\n【7】Table 1 \n\n【8】Laboratory results of the admitted patient.\n\n【9】Abdominopelvic spiral computed tomography (CT) scan with intravenous and oral contrast was requested and revealed splenomegaly and a hypodense lesion with a mean 55 Hounsfield unit (HU) at the site of the right adrenal gland (40  23 mm) and another ill-defined soft tissue lesion (60  35 mm) with infiltrative margins at the site of the left adrenal gland without any evidence of vascular thrombosis. Supportive therapy was initiated, but the patient left the hospital due to personal desire and was admitted to one of the tertiary hospitals in Isfahan, Iran.\n\n【10】His vital signs on admission were the followings: blood pressure: 115/85 mmHg, heart rates: 100/min, respiratory rates: 20/min, T: 37.1°C, O<sub>2</sub> saturation: 85% on room air (94% with a face mask). He suffered from dyspnea, chest pain, and diarrhea. On physical examination, huge splenomegaly, generalized abdominal tenderness, and left costovertebral angle tenderness were noted. The requested electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia. Laboratory profile showed elevated creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and troponin (Table 1).\n\n【11】With prior suspicion of prerenal azotemia due to intraabdominal disorders including mesenteric ischemia, fluid replacement and broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed. Due to the presence of multiple air-fluid levels on the abdominal X-ray, surgical consultation was requested, which recommended observation and correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalances. After two days, the patient’s symptoms improved, and he gained normal bowel function with normal creatinine. Due to the suspicion of adrenal disorders including probable pheochromocytoma or adrenal cancer, an abdominal CT scan with the adrenal protocol was performed that revealed huge splenomegaly (spleen span: 25 cm) and bilateral adrenal masses (right adrenal gland: 40  29 mm, left adrenal gland: 48  26 mm) without any enhancement and 50 HU subsequently in favor of adrenal hematoma (Figure 1). Comprehensive adrenal glands assessment was performed and revealed the followings: aldosterone; 45 pg/ml (reference range: 30–400 pg/ml), plasma renin; 12 pg/ml (reference range: 12–36 pg/ml), 17 (OH) progesterone; 1.3 ng/ml (reference range: 0.2–2.3 ng/ml) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS); 25 mcg/dl (reference range: 56–80 mcg/dl). A 24-hour urine analysis was also requested, and the following were reported: norepinephrine; 23.1 mcg/day, epinephrine; 0.7 mcg/day, normetanephrine; 112 mcg/day, metanephrine; 62 mcg/day, and vanillylmandelic acid; 6 mg/day. These finding collections including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and abnormal adrenal CT findings were in respect to nonfunctional adrenal masses that resulted in AI in the context of adrenal hematoma. Therefore, basal cortisol was checked and the result was less than 3 mcg/dl. A tetracosactide test was performed in a way that one milligram of tetracosactide was injected intramuscularly and the cortisol level was measured at baseline and 4 hours afterwards (basal serum cortisol at 8 AM; 2.28 mcg/dl, 4 hours; 10.37 mcg/dl). Finally, the AI was confirmed and the patient was treated with daily prednisolone (5 mg) and fludrocortisone (100 microgram). The patient was discharged in a stable condition after 12 days with a recommendation for a follow-up ultrasound.\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 1 \n\n【15】Bilateral adrenal masses in favor of adrenal hematoma.\n\n【16】During the follow-up assessment, the patient acknowledged voluntarily discontinuing medication for AI after ten months of discharge. However, he had no clinical symptoms of AI. The adrenal hematoma was resolved gradually through periodic ultrasound assessments, and there was no evidence of adrenal masses on the abdominal CT scan 15 months after his discharge (Figure 2). Basal serum cortisol was 5.90 mcg/dL, and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was 68.2 pg/ml. Further investigation with the tetracosactide test 4 hours after intramuscular injection of 1 mg tetracosactide revealed a serum cortisol level of 18.15 mcg/dL. Therefore, AI was documented, and daily prednisolone (5 mg) was prescribed again.\n\n【17】  \n\n【18】  \n\n【19】Figure 2 \n\n【20】Resolved bilateral adrenal hematoma during follow-up assessment.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion and Conclusions\n\n【22】We reported an Iranian male patient with an underlying condition of myeloproliferative neoplasia (MPN), most likely a PV, which manifested with signs and symptoms of BAH and resultant AI. Although this entity is quite rare in literature, high clinical suspicion is required for prompt diagnosis and treatment. PV is defined as MPN with pathologic growth-factor independent increased growth of erythroid precursors. In addition, myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages are also often affected, resulting in increased numbers of WBCs and platelets. JAK2V617F is the main culprit in this regard \\[6\\]. Most common symptoms of PV are attributed to hyper-viscosity leading to oxygen delivery impairment and headache, vision changes, fatigue, claudication, dizziness, and aquagenic pruritus, among commonly reported complaints \\[6\\]. To the best of our knowledge, few reports described MPN/PV patients with concomitant BAH and/or AI (Table 2). Gonen et al. reported a 56-year-old male admitted with nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and loss of appetite. His lab data revealed erythrocytosis and leukocytosis with confirmed PV diagnosis through bone marrow biopsy. A CT scan revealed bilateral adrenal masses measured 4  5  5.5 cm and 4  3  2 cm in the right and left adrenal glands, respectively. Basal serum cortisol of <138 nmol/l, ACTH of 550 pmol/l, and an ACTH stimulation test suggested simultaneous AI. During the periodic follow-up assessment, both adrenal lesions diminished significantly, and they were completely disappeared after two years \\[5\\]. Another report was of an 85-year-old man who suffered from PV presented with abdominal tenderness and syncope finally diagnosed as BAH \\[7\\]. Bhandari et al. described a 64-year-old man with a chronic history of PV admitted with fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoglycemia. Further assessments were in favor of cardiogenic shock resulting from myocardial infarction. After percutaneous coronary intervention and stent insertion in the left anterior descending artery, he was still hypotensive and low random cortisol (3.3 mcg/dl) with a dramatic response to hydrocortisone stress dose proved AI as the main culprit. Also, a noncontrast CT scan revealed BAH (right adrenal: 5.3  3.4  3.8 cm, left adrenal: 6.1  4.3  5.4 cm) \\[8\\].\n\n【23】Table 2 \n\n【24】Summary of studies reported adrenal hemorrhage in the context of polycythemia vera.\n\n【25】Despite the quite low prevalence of AH, improvement in imaging technologies including sonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT scan might yield to diagnose this topic more frequently with the latter being the modality of choice in adults \\[9\\]. Adrenal hematomas appear round or oval, and peri-adrenal fat stranding is almost present. Acute or subacute adrenal hematomas contain high attenuation areas that usually range from 50–90 HU. Most adrenal hematomas resolve gradually over time, but some of them may resolve partially and cause permanent AI and lifelong hormone replacement requirements \\[4, 8, 10\\].\n\n【26】The exact pathophysiological mechanisms of AH remain uncertain; however, the anatomic location and physiological properties might play roles. Three main arteries (the superior, middle, and inferior suprarenal arteries) in comparison to a single adrenal vein draining blood from adrenal glands might predispose to vascular congestion and subsequent AH. On the other hand, catecholamine release leads to vasoconstriction of the adrenal veins impairing blood outflow. Efferent adrenal vein thrombosis and hyperviscosity resulting from PV impair venous drainage and venous congestion, ultimately predisposing to AH \\[1, 8\\].\n\n【27】In conclusion, BAH with subsequent AI should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with myeloproliferative diseases, especially PV, presented with non-specific symptoms including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and hypotension, in order to prevent life-threatening outcomes.\n\n【28】#### Abbreviations\n\n【29】| AH: | Adrenal hemorrhage |\n| --- | --- |\n| BAH: | Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage |\n| AI: | Adrenal insufficiency |\n| PV: | Polycythemia vera |\n| WBC: | White blood cell |\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| HU: | Hounsfield unit |\n| ECG: | Electrocardiogram |\n| LDH: | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| DHEAS: | Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate |\n| ACTH: | Adrenocorticotropic hormone |\n| MPN: | Myeloproliferative neoplasia |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging. |\n\n【30】#### Data Availability\n\n【31】The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to confidential issues but are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n【32】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【33】Ethical approval is not necessary for retrospective studies and case presentations in our institutional policies.\n\n【34】#### Consent\n\n【35】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

In this report, we present a case of a 46-year-old patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who avoided insulin treatment due to associated peripheral edema. Though rare, this phenomenon is typically seen in patients with elevated glucose levels who are initiated on insulin treatment, resulting in rapid correction and tight control of glucose levels. The diagnosis of insulin-induced edema is made after other causes of acute edema are ruled out. Furthermore, in this case report, we will also discuss the postulated mechanisms for the edema-causing property of insulin.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Insulin edema syndrome is a rare complication of insulin therapy. Edema resulting from initiation of insulin therapy or intensification of glycemic control is an under-recognized complication \\[1\\]. This phenomenon has typically been described in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus during the initiation of insulin treatment, with rapid correction and tight control of glucose levels \\[1\\]. However, the rarity and lack of awareness of this phenomenon creates challenges in establishing the prevalence, making an accurate diagnosis, and creating guidelines for treatment. We report a case of insulin edema during rapid correction and strict glucose control in a diabetic patient with poorly controlled glucose levels and elevated hemoglobin A1c level, with the goal of highlighting this complication, exploring the etiology and pathophysiology of insulin-related edema, and acknowledging it as a potential reason why patients decline insulin therapy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 46-year-old man with a medical history significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), recurrent pancreatitis, alcohol use disorder, and hypertension presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. His abdominal symptoms occurred intermittently for approximately three weeks prior to admission, during which time he had stopped using his insulin pump with continuous glucose monitoring after his device broke over two months ago. Ten days before his current admission, he was admitted to the hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis during which time he was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin and discharged on insulin detemir 8 units twice daily, insulin lispro 8 units 3 times daily with meals, calcium carbonate 750 mg every 6 hours, pancrelipase 12,000-unit capsule 3 times daily, sucralfate 10 ml four times daily, and trazodone 50 mg tablet nightly. He reported stopping the use of his insulin because he believed it was causing bilateral pedal edema to the level of his knees. He noted consistent patterns of developing edema in his lower extremities a few days after insulin administration. The patient stated that the swelling in his legs resolved after cessation of insulin use. During his hospital admission, the patient refused diabetes education and insisted on the side effect of insulin as a reason for non-compliance with treatment routine.\n\n【6】Social history was remarkable for 60 pack-year tobacco use, daily marijuana use, and no other illicit drug use. Review of systems was remarkable for recent weight loss due to poor diet, chronic smoker's cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, and lower extremity bilateral pedal edema present on days of insulin use that resolves when the patient does not use his insulin. He also reported having chronic diabetic neuropathy and numbness in his feet bilaterally.\n\n【7】Physical examination was notable for temperature of 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 151/76, heart rate of 88, respiratory rate of 20, and oxygen saturation of 98 percent on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal rate and regular rhythm, there was no elevated jugular venous pressure, and lung sounds were with no rales. He had generalized abdominal tenderness on palpation without guarding, rebound tenderness, or distension. There was bilateral pedal pitting 4+ edema up to his knees (Figure 1).\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Bilateral pedal edema to the level of the knees secondary to insulin therapy (photograph was taken with patient’s permission).\n\n【12】Laboratory results were consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): anion gap of 23, bicarbonate of 11 mmol/L, sodium of 130 mmol/L, chloride of 93 mmol/L, creatinine of 0.41 mg/dL, glucose of 374 mg/dL, total protein of 5.4 g/dL, albumin of 3.4 g/dL, and positive beta hydroxybutyrate of 2.74, and urinalysis showed 1+ ketones and 3+ glucose and was negative for proteinuria. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was remarkable for scattered calcification along the atrophic pancreas suggesting chronic pancreatitis and normal liver texture. Lower extremity venous Doppler was not done due to lack of recent immobility, negative Homans’ sign, bilaterality, and low clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis. Transthoracic echo was unremarkable without any ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Insulin edema syndrome is an adverse effect of insulin therapy ensuing from the rigorous correction of hyperglycemia in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus \\[2\\]. In addition to poor glycemic control, having a low body mass index increases the risk of developing insulin edema \\[3\\]. It is also seen in younger patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus. The edema is generally mild, affecting the lower extremities. However, there have been reports of severe presentations causing anasarca, ascites, and pleural effusion \\[2\\].\n\n【15】The cause of our patient’s insulin-dependent diabetes was believed to be secondary to his history of recurrent pancreatitis in the setting of alcohol abuse, also known as pancreatogenic diabetes or Type 3c \\[4\\]. Insulin edema may have variable presentations, from benign to frank heart or renal failure \\[2, 5\\].\n\n【16】The edema has been postulated to result from several mechanisms, including increasing capillary permeability and renal salt retention, thus inducing extravasation of fluid, resulting in edema \\[6\\]. Insulin is known to cause the reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys by stimulating the Na<sup>+</sup>/K+-ATPase as well as expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 3 in the proximal tubule, and it also causes vasodilation, which contributes to fluid retention. Hyperglycemia independently also causes an increase in vascular permeability, which is consistent with the development of edema in patients that have persistently elevated glucose levels \\[3\\]. Persistently elevated glucose levels in diabetic patients cause poor integrity of the vascular membrane, which increases the risk of edema as a result of rapid serum osmolar changes. This proposed mechanism is supported by the phenomenon of “refeeding edema.” Refeeding edema occurs with an increase in endogenous plasma insulin associated with carbohydrate ingestion after prolonged starvation \\[7\\].\n\n【17】There are different approaches to treating insulin edema, ranging from conservative management with restriction of salt and liquid intake to pharmacotherapy with diuretics, epinephrine, or ephedrine in refractory cases \\[8\\]. Adjusting the dose of insulin has also been shown to reduce the degree of edema \\[8\\]. As discussed above, the patient in this presentation noticed improvement of the leg swelling with cessation of insulin usage, which unfortunately resulted in his non-compliance and several sequelae of hospital admission as a result of DKA. During his admission, he received 20 mg of furosemide daily with rapid improvement in his symptoms.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】Insulin edema syndrome is a rare complication of insulin therapy. Appropriate patients who present with edema should have this clinical entity as an element in their differential diagnoses. Potential complications involving the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems should be considered. After other cardiac, hepatic, vascular, and nephrotic causes of sudden onset edema have been excluded, it is reasonable to attribute the etiology to this under-recognized phenomenon. Awareness of this condition can give patients reassurance and confidence in their insulin regimen.\n\n【20】#### Data Availability\n\n【21】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【22】#### Disclosure\n\n【23】This study was part of the employment of University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus.\n\n【24】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【25】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】The utilization of coronary stents has been the most important advancement in the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). A rare but potentially serious complication of stent usage is dislodgment of the stent from the balloon catheter before the deployment and subsequent dislocation of the stent into the vascular system.

Case Report\n\n【6】A 67-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital because of unstable angina. He had coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (internal mammary to left anterior descending artery, saphenous vein graft (SVG) to left circumflex artery, and SVG to right coronary artery (RCA)) seventeen years ago. Diagnostic catheterization (Figure 1) demonstrated 95% stenosis at the proximal of the SVG-RCA.\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】| Saphen vein arteriogram showing 95% stenosis. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】The patient was referred for PCI. The target lesion was predilated with a  mm Asahi Intecc balloon. Subsequent angiography revealed 20% stenosis at the lesion site (Figure 2). The decision was made to place a stent due to the existing plaque fracture and the improved long-term outcome results already achieved with stents. A  mm Ephesos stent was selected. Stent could not be advanced through the lesion. After several attempts the stent was pulled back into the guiding catheter. During the withdrawing process the stent had dislodged from the balloon catheter (Figure 3). A small balon (  mm Invatec Avion Plus) was advanced through the stent, inflated, and finally was withdrawn with the stent (Figure 4).\n\n【12】  \n\n【13】  \n\n【14】Figure 2 \n\n【15】| After balloon dilatation. |\n| --- |\n\n【16】  \n\n【17】  \n\n【18】Figure 3 \n\n【19】| Stent had dislodged from the balloon catheter. |\n| --- |\n\n【20】  \n\n【21】  \n\n【22】Figure 4 \n\n【23】| Small balloon, stent, and catheter complex. |\n| --- |\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Stent dislodgment and migration is an uncommon problem. But as a result of the universal use of premounted stents invasive cardialogists may come across with it more often. Stent dislodgement from the delivery system most often occurs while the stent-balloon assembly is pulled back into the guiding catheter, because the target lesion either could not be reached or could not be passed. Factors predisposing to the inability of stent delivery are poor support of the guiding catheter or the guide wire, vessel tortuosity proximal to the lesion, and severe vessel calcification \\[1–3\\]. In the event of stent dislodgment the primary objective should be the retrieval of dislodged stent from the coronary circulation due to the possibility of significant complications. For extraction of unexpanded stents from the coronary circulation different percutaneous techniques have been described, including the use of balloon catheters, loop snares, two twisted guide wires, or retrieval devices (biliary or myocardial biopsy forceps, multipurpose baskets) \\[2\\]. The use of small balloon catheters is effective, especially in cases where a stent is still riding on a guide wire and is deployed enough to advance a smallballoon catheter through its lumen \\[1, 2\\]. In our case the small balloon catheter was the right tool for successful retrieval of a stent from the SVG-RCA. The choice of retrieval technique should be specific to each case and to the operator’s experience.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

A timely diagnosis of the disease is challenging due to its nonspecific clinical symptoms. We reviewed a case that experienced an acute illness during pregnancy. The illness was manifested by localized pain in the hips or buttocks, sacroiliac joint tenderness, and debilitating hip pain during ambulation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed little joint involvement, and the patient was treated with antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and glucocorticoids. The patient responded well to the therapy with marked improvement in her ambulation. Septic sacroiliitis should be considered in peripartum patients presenting with increased inflammatory markers and severe localized pain. Medical management is usually curative and without an adverse effect on pregnancy. Although we could not perform a biopsy to verify the cause of the disease, the patient’s excellent response to the treatment confirmed our diagnosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hip and low back pain (LBP) frequently occur during pregnancy with a prevalence ranging from 30% to 78% \\[1\\]. Pain may originate from the lumbar region, hip, or sacroiliac joint (SIJ). LBP or buttocks usually has a nonspecific etiology and a self-limited course \\[2\\]. The risk factors for LBP include pelvic trauma, low age, multiparous, chronic LBP, and history of LBP in the previous pregnancy \\[3, 4\\].\n\n【4】However, certain conditions complicate the diagnosis, such as transient hip osteoporosis, hip avascular necrosis, sacral stress fracture, and sacroiliitis \\[2\\]. The sacroiliac joint disease usually presents with LBP that increases with ambulation \\[5\\]. Although most cases represent nonspecific arthritis, the sacroiliac joint can be seeded after bacteremia, resulting in a pyogenic course \\[2\\].\n\n【5】This complication is prevalent in injection drug users, although it may develop after any bacteremia. If the disease develops during pregnancy, it may pose a diagnostic challenge, as pain in the low back and buttocks is common and often nonspecific during pregnancy and the postpartum period \\[6, 7\\].\n\n【6】The incidence of pregnancy-associated sacroiliitis is low, with less than 20 cases reported in the literature occurring during pregnancy, during the puerperium, or after an abortion \\[2\\]. The pathophysiology of pregnancy-associated sacroiliitis may involve relaxation of pelvic ligaments during pregnancy, resulting in increases in pelvic movements and thus microtrauma to the joint surface \\[7\\]. Therefore, the physician may be susceptible to any transient bacteremia occurring in the context of pregnancy-induced immunosuppression \\[8\\].\n\n【7】Here, we reported a case of pregnancy-associated inflammatory sacroiliitis, which is rare and often underrecognized in daily clinical practice.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 24-year-old pregnant woman with a gestational age of about 35 weeks herself referred to an orthopedic emergency department. The patient suffered from sharp severe hip joint pain for a week. She was referred to a maternity hospital with a diagnosis of septic arthritis. After admission, the pain developed suddenly and radiated down to her right thigh. The pain was worsening over time. She regularly used local dairy products and did not take any specific medications. She had a successful vaginal delivery previously. A day after hospitalization, the labor pain began, and the vaginal delivery was conducted in the first hours of admission in the labor ward due to spontaneous labor pain. She suffered from pelvic pain and motion limitation of the hip, especially during the second stage of the delivery. The vaginal delivery had no dystocia regardless of the mother’s pelvic pain. The newborn had a normal Apgar score (9/10). She was unable to ambulate postpartum due to excruciating hip pain. She had anorexia, chill and malaise, low-grade fever, and mild respiratory issues. She was hemodynamically stable in a normal range.\n\n【10】Urine and blood were collected and revealed an infective bladder, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), negative rheumatoid factor (RF), negative 2-mercaptoethanol test (2 ME), negative blood culture (B/C), negative HIV, negative viral hepatitis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (135). A chest X-ray was performed, and it was normal. A hip magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed hyperlaxity of muscles around the right hip joint without evidence of bone damage. Mild collection of hematoma was noted, and the right sacroiliac joint showed fluid collection measuring 14 × 14 mm. The hips, femoral heads, and acetabulums were intact and showed normal congruency.\n\n【11】Lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with and without contrast revealed normal lumbar spines. A pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and demonstrated an abnormal right sacroiliac joint signal sacroiliac joint (SIJ). SIG enhancement was revealed, which is in favor of arthritis. Empiric intravenous antibiotic therapy was administered to cover urinary tract infection (UTI), which was presumed to be the infection source. She was transferred to the rheumatology department for further treatment. The follow-up with her treating specialist revealed that she had improved significantly and regained her ability to function normally. She was discharged for a further follow-up of 10–20 days. An examination under anesthesia revealed no evidence of a perinatal abscess. On day 6 postpartum, blood cultures and a perinatal wound swab had grown group A _Streptococcus_ (pyogenic); thus, her antibiotic regimen was rationalized to intravenous benzylpenicillin. However, she continued to have a fever and debilitating hip pain during ambulation.\n\n【12】Furthermore, cultures of urine, blood, and perinatal swabs were negative, and a color Doppler ultrasound excluded pelvic deep venous thrombosis. On day 12 postpartum, she underwent a pelvic MRI scan, which revealed bilateral sacroiliitis with a right-sided sacroiliac joint collection (Figure 1). It was subsequently drained under computed tomography (CT) guidance, yielding 1 mL of purulent fluid and dramatically improving the patient’s symptoms. She was discharged home on day 15 on a four-week intravenous benzylpenicillin course, followed by a six-week oral amoxicillin course.\n\n【13】After discharge, she was followed up and her gait and pain reduced day by day, and by the fourth week, her pain completely faded away.\n\n【14】  \n**(a)**\n\n【15】  \n**(b)**\n\n【16】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【17】Figure 1 \n\n【18】(a)-(b) Bilateral sacroiliitis with the right sacroiliac joint collection.\n\n【19】An internal medicine physician observed her for two months after discharge from the hospital and prescribed her nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (ibuprofen 200 mg three times a day) and pregabalin (75 mg twice a day) for 4 weeks after discharging from the hospital. She showed full recovery and was found to ambulate freely with no sign of discomfort in her sacroiliac joint. The laboratory findings during admission and cure are given in Table 1.\n\n【20】Table 1 \n\n【21】The diagnosis test and inflammatory markers.\n\n【22】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【23】The sacroiliac joint is a nonweight-bearing joint with a small range of motion that has to endure extra burden during pregnancy due to biomechanical changes, leading to pubic instability, inflammation, bone edema, and stress fractures \\[9\\]. The latter can quickly occur if there is insufficient bone mass due to osteopenia or vitaminD deficiency \\[7, 10\\].\n\n【24】This case had severe pain, and her CRP was very high, leading us to include pyogenic sacroiliitis in the entry diagnosis. Pyogenic sacroiliitis may be accompanied by a history of intravenous drug abuse, infective endocarditis, urinary tract infection, abortion, or delivery \\[2, 11\\]. However, infections play an important role in this disease. The primary causative organisms are groups A and B _Streptococci_ and _Staphylococcus_ species \\[12\\]. Group A _Streptococcus_ (GAS) is particularly important due to its mortality rate of 20–25%, a consequence of the toxic shock-like syndrome triggered by its exotoxin \\[13\\]. GAS can also cause rapid bone and joint destruction, resulting in chronic disability for survivors \\[14\\]. Although the timely diagnosis of pyogenic sacroiliitis is critical, it presents a diagnostic challenge. Moreover, one-third of patients with pyogenic sacroiliitis have a normal white cell count and are afebrile \\[2\\].\n\n【25】The most valuable investigations to establish this diagnosis are inflammatory markers, including almost universally elevated ESR and CRP levels, occasionally positive blood and urine cultures, and pelvic MRI. Bone edema, sclerosis, and erosions in SIJ are typical radiological changes similar to those in postpartum sacroiliitis \\[6\\]. Moreover, our case had a sign of upper tract infection. There were high ESR and CRP in her laboratory findings, which are in line with our diagnosis \\[6\\]. Empiric antibiotic regimens include vancomycin in combination with a third or fourth-generation cephalosporin (such as ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, or cefepime) and metronidazole. An alternative regimen consisting of vancomycin in combination with a 6 carbapenem is useful for coverage of staphylococci, Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes. Most patients remit completely in five months, but about 10% of them may experience more chronic persistent arthritis \\[6\\].\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【27】Hip and LBP are frequent during pregnancy or the postpartum period. A careful analysis of clinical, laboratory, and radiographic findings may help clinicians detect their underlying cause and tailor appropriate treatment.\n\n【28】#### Data Availability\n\n【29】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【30】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【31】Ethics approval has been obtained to proceed with the current study.\n\n【32】#### Consent\n\n【33】Written informed consent and the use of images from patients are obtained.\n\n【34】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【35】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "25e5ac0f-1c07-4dff-8e97-008e298ebab0", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Only few cases of primary renal Ewing's sarcoma have been reported in the literature to date. We present here two cases of renal ES/PNET with an uncanny presentation. The first case was discovered after the patient presented clinically with irradiating flank pain, mimicking the pain related with kidney stones. The second case had clinical presentation of pulmonary thromboembolism after the patient was involved in an automobilist accident. The tumors were mainly composed of small blue cells which by immunohistochemical were positive for neural markers, and FISH revealed the translocation 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene. The diagnosis of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor is very rare and usually involves several different diagnostic techniques. The differential diagnosis is usually broad with frequent overlapping features between the entities. The cases presented in this paper illustrated the difficulties with which routine anatomical pathologist is faced when dealing with rare renal poorly differentiated neoplasm in adults.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) are small, round-cell tumors of neural crest origin classically found in the central nervous system (CNS) but more recently characterized in the periphery \\[1\\]. Peripherally located PNETs (pPNETs) are members of the Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors (EFTs). It is the second most common primary tumor of bone in childhood. Less frequently it occurs in soft tissues \\[1\\].\n\n【4】Ewing’s sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (ES/PNET) is an extraordinarily rare primary tumor in the kidney. Only few cases of primary renal Ewing’s sarcoma have been reported in the literature to date \\[1–7\\]. Renal localization of pPNETs is found in young adults and is characterized by an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis \\[1\\].\n\n【5】We present here two cases of Ewing’s sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor occurring in two young women with an unusual presentation. The diagnosis in both cases was incidental during visits to the emergency room for other health problems.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【8】A 32-year-old female presented to the emergency room with right flank pain that irradiates to the groin. She was clinically diagnostic with kidney stones and indeed a kidney stone was identified. However, the computed tomography scan revealed a large right renal mass and right ovarian cystic mass. The patient underwent a right-sided laparoscopic radical nephrectomy along with an excision of the ovarian cystic mass. Her postoperatively course was uneventful except for some pain in the surgical incision site. Grossly, an 11 cm cyst adenofibroma of the right fallopian tube and ovary was identified. In addition, the kidney showed an 8.3 cm encapsulated tumor located at the pelvic adipose tissue within the renal capsule (Figure 1(a)). Microscopically, the tumor cells were arranged in solid sheets, tightly packed cords, trabeculae with variable stroma, and nests or ribbons of uniform small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm, uniform nuclei, and stippled chromatin. At places rosettes were identified (Figure 1(b)). Mitotic activity was present (Figure 1(c)). No necrosis was seen. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using the usual avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. The antibodies are listed in Table 1. The tumor cells were strong positive for neuron-specific enolase (Figure 1(d)), CD56 (Figure 1(e)), Cytokeratin AE1/3, and Cam 5.2. Weakly positive stain for PGP9.5, bcl2, and CD99 was identified. The tumor was negative for synaptophysin, EMA, inhibin, chromogranin, vimentin, WT1, S100, CK7, estrogen receptor, androgen receptor, CD10, and Carbonic anhydrase 9. Ki 67 showed a high proliferation rate index of 30% (Figure 1(f)). Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using the 22q12 LSI, EWSR1, Dual-Color Break-Apart Probe was performed on fresh tissue and showed 18 (29.5%) of the cells with the translocation pattern 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene. The histomorphological, immunohistochemical profile and FISH results were consisted with a renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor. The patient underwent chemotherapy and the followup 2 years after the diagnosis showed no evidence of tumor.\n\n【9】Table 1 \n\n【10】Specifications of the antibodies used in the study.\n\n【11】  \n**(a)**\n\n【12】  \n**(b)**\n\n【13】  \n**(c)**\n\n【14】  \n**(d)**\n\n【15】  \n**(e)**\n\n【16】  \n**(f)**\n\n【17】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)**   \n**(f)**\n\n【18】Figure 1 \n\n【19】| Thirty-two-year-old patient, right-sided laparoscopic radical nephrectomy.

Case 2\n\n【21】A 21-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a left foot fracture, nasal fracture, and loss of her pregnancy caused by a motor vehicle accident. A month later, the patient returned to the emergency room with complaints of shortness of breath, icterus, and dark urine. A chest-computed tomography scan revealed pulmonary embolism. She underwent a pulmonary embolism protocol which included a computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The exam showed extensive central bilateral pulmonary embolism and a large right atrial thrombus in continuity with thrombotic material within the inferior vena cava. In addition, her right kidney had poorly contrast-enhancing raising the possibility of a right renal vein thrombosis extending into the right atrium with subsequent pulmonary embolism. She underwent a pulmonary tumor embolectomy, right atrial mass removal, and tumor embolectomy thrombectomy of the hepatic inferior vena cava as well as placement of an inferior vena cava filter. The patient underwent a sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass. She started chemotherapy with etoposide and ifosfamide combination therapy. The tumor invaded the renal vein and extended to the resection margin. The histological examination of the right atrial, pulmonary artery, and caval vein thrombus revealed islands of uniform small round blue cells with scant cytoplasm, uniform nuclei, and stippled chromatin intermixed with necrosis and blood clot (Figure 2(b)). The viable tumor cells showed brisk mitosis. Immunohistochemical stains were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using the usual avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. The antibodies are listed in Table 1. The viable tumor cells showed a strong membranous stains for CD99 (Figure 2(c)), focal membranous and cytoplasm stain for CD56 (Figure 2(d)), a cytoplasm dot pattern for synapthophysin (Figure 2(e)), and focal cytoplasm and membranous stain for PGP9.5, BCL2, and vimentin. The lymphoid cells in the background were positive for LCA and CD43. The tumor cells are negative for CD3, CD20, CD30, alpha-fetoprotein, beta human chorionic gonadotrophin, pan-cytokeratin, CAM5.2, myogenin, epithelial membrane antigen**,** thyroid transcription factor-1**,** CK20, desmin, smooth muscle actin, HMB45, S100, and WT1. Five months later, the patient had a right nephrectomy. Grossly, the right kidney revealed multifocal tan-brown to yellow masses in the upper and lower poles ranging from 0.4 × 0.4 cm to 4.3 × 2.8 cm (Figure 2(a)). Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using the 22q12 LSI, EWSR1, Dual-Color Break-Apart Probe was performed on fresh tissue and showed 57 (95.0%) of the cells with the translocation pattern 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene (Figure 2(f)). In addition a FISH for the X-18 SYT translocation was performed but it was negative. The histomorphological, immunohistochemical profile and FISH results were consisted with a renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor. The patient completed her 12 months of chemotherapy and the one-year followup revealed no evidence of tumor.\n\n【22】  \n**(a)**\n\n【23】  \n**(b)**\n\n【24】  \n**(c)**\n\n【25】  \n**(d)**\n\n【26】  \n**(e)**\n\n【27】  \n**(f)**\n\n【28】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)** **(d)** **(e)**   \n**(f)**\n\n【29】Figure 2 \n\n【30】| Twenty-one-year-old female.

This confirmed the EWSR1 fusion transcripts in this peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the kidney. |\n| --- |\n\n【31】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【32】The diagnosis of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor is very rare and usually involves several different diagnostic techniques. The most challenging part is the differential diagnosis which is broad with morphological and immunohistochemical overlapping features between the entities. Therefore, mostly frequently molecular biology techniques need to be applied for a definitive diagnosis. We reported 2 cases of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor with an unusual clinical presentation which were incidentally found during imaging. These cases illustrated very well the difficulties with which general pathologists are faced in the routine anatomical pathology examination when faced with renal poorly differentiated neoplasm in adults.\n\n【33】Both cases had an uncanny presentation. In case number 1, the 8.3 cm kidney mass was discovered after the patient presented clinically with irradiating flank pain, mimicking the pain related with kidney stones. Moreover, it was associated with a benign ovarian tumor and the diagnosis of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING was only possible after extensive immunohistochemical and molecular studies, which were mainly performed to rule out other entities that were considered due to the unusual presentation and associated ovarian tumor. In literature-reported renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING, the clinical presentation was often nonspecific, comprising abdominal pain, palpable mass, and hematuria, and most reported cases were diagnosed incidentally by image studies \\[1, 4–8\\]. Few tumors had associated concurrent abnormalities such as hemangioma, central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and ovarian disgerminoma \\[1\\].\n\n【34】Our second case report was even more unusual. The Case 2 presented with respiratory problems after being involved in an automobilistic accident where multiple fractures were acquired. The clinical presentation suggested pulmonary thormboembolism, which was confirmed by image; however, after histopathological examination of the thrombectomy material small blue cell tumor of uncertain origin was regarded as the cause for the extensive thromboembolic event. Later on, a nephrectomy was performed and a renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING was diagnosed. As far as literature reports, there are few reports of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING with tumor thrombus extending to the inferior vena cava \\[9, 10\\]. However, in our case the thrombus extended all the way up to the inferior vena cava, right atrium, and bilateral pulmonary arteries, with more aggressive tumor extension than the previous reported cases \\[9, 10\\].\n\n【35】As far as disease progression, our cases had a better response to chemotherapy and surgery than the previous reported cases of renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING \\[1\\]. The outcome of other patients reported in the literature included very short survival, nonresponse to intensive therapy, and death 5 months after diagnosis \\[1, 4–8, 11\\]. Both our cases were free of disease after one year, and long-term outcome is still awaited.\n\n【36】Renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor should be differentiated from other small blue cell tumors arising in the kidney such as blastemal predominant Wilms tumor, neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, desmoplastic small blue cell tumor, and synovial sarcoma \\[1, 12\\]. All of them have very similar morphology with frequent overlapping morphological features, thus, extensive immunohistochemistry panel, in addition to the morphological features, is essential in reaching the final diagnosis \\[1, 12\\].\n\n【37】CD99 was the former marker for Ewings’ sarcoma; however, it is also expressed in other tumors such as synovial sarcoma, Wilms’ tumor, vascular malignancy, neuroendocrine tumors, and lymphoblastic lymphoma, and therefore nowadays is not considered a reliable marker of tumor origin \\[1, 7, 8\\]. Our presented first case showed a very weak stain for CD99, and the second one because of the bloody background was very difficult to interpret illustrating some of the difficulties in using this marker in diagnostic grounds.\n\n【38】From the neuroendocrine marker, CD56 was positive in both cases whereas synapthophysin was positive only in the second case in a cytoplasm dot pattern. This pattern has been considered as an unspecific pattern, but a recent publication described the pattern in oligodendrogliomas, and therefore the pattern seems to indicate neural origin \\[13\\].\n\n【39】The features favoring the diagnosis of blastemal Wilms tumor are young age and positivity of blastemal elements for vimentin, low molecular weight cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, and WT1. Both cases in our study were positive for cytokeratin and vimentin. However, WT1 was negative and EWSR1 gene was identified by FISH, and therefore adult Wilms’ tumor was ruled out.\n\n【40】Renal neuroblastomas are also similar morphologically to renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor. However, they usually occur at the age of 5 years and show a fibrillary background or a ganglionic differentiation facilitating the diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry is very useful to differentiate it from renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor because neuroblastomas are consistently positive for NSE and chromogranin and mostly negative for CD99.\n\n【41】Rhabdomyosarcoma is often positive for smooth muscle actin, desmin, and myogenin; all of them were negative in our patients. Desmoplastic small blue cell tumors are also positive for desmin, and synovial sarcoma was ruled out using the FISH for the X-18 SYT translocation, which was negative.\n\n【42】Finally, lymphoblastic lymphoma could be excluded by performing analysis with LCA and other hematopoietic markers; however, in the second case the background was positive for lymphoid markers. The differential was performed by morphology of the tumor cells which had stippled chromatin and pleomorphism whereas the lymphoid cells formed a uniform monotonous population with small dark nuclei in the background.\n\n【43】In our cases, the molecular analysis identifying the translocation was a supportive and strong confirmatory tool, especially with the confusing immunohistochemical profile. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis using the 22q12 LSI, EWSR1, and Dual-Color Break-Apart Probe showed the translocation pattern 22q12 for the EWSR1 gene. The probe used in our cases is from Vysis (Abbott Laboratories, Downers Grove, Ill, USA) and is commercially available, and data have been published using this probe. The probe is an EWSR1 (22; q12) Dual-Color, Break-Apart Rearrangement Probe, which consists of a mixture of 2 FISH DNA probes. The first is a 500 kb probe labeled in spectrum orange and flanks the 5 V side of EWSR1 gene and extends inward into intron 4. The second probe is 1100 kb labeled in spectrum green and flanks the 3 V side of the EWSR1 gene. There is 7-kb probe between the 2 probes. The known breakpoints within the EWSR1 gene are restricted to introns 7 through 10V. Approximately 90% of the translocations involving EWSR1 gene result in t(11; 22) translocation characteristic of EWS/PNET.\n\n【44】Because most renal primitive neuroectodermal tumors/EWING tumor of the kidney are poorly differentiated and have a broad morphological spectrum, it is important to have genetic confirmation for the presence of t(11; 22) for the accurate identification of these tumors, and the FISH probe is a good and easy method to do so.\n\n【45】In summary, we report two cases of primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor arising in the kidney confirmed by morphology, immunohistochemistry and FISH. The unusual presentation in our cases delayed the diagnosis, being both tumors diagnosed incidentally. Thus, we believe that these cases added some features to the already broad spectrum of presentations described in renal primitive neuroectodermal tumor/EWING tumor and also showed the importance of molecular analysis together with morphological and immunohistochemical features for confirmation of this poorly differentiated neoplasm.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Metastatic bone disease represents a systemic pathology that heavily affects the quality of life of oncologic patients causing pain and functional disability. _Methodology_. We present the case of a patient with a history of renal cell cancer presenting pathologic fractures of both humeri and proximal right radius. _Results_. After a careful multidisciplinary approach, an adjuvant anticancer therapy and a photodynamic bone stabilization procedure were performed with a minimally invasive technique aiming to minimize pain and local disease progression, while restoring functional autonomy and improving the patient’s quality of life. Electrochemotherapy was delivered on the lytic bone lesions with extraskeletal involvement of the proximal left humerus and the proximal right radius, and then polymeric bone stabilization was performed on both humeri. At two months of follow-up, the patient presented satisfactory functional scores (MSTS score: 12/30 bilaterally; DASH scores: 46.7/100 for the right side and 48.3/100 for the left one), and pain was well controlled with opioid analgesics. Radiographs showed good results in terms of ossification of lytic bone lesions and durability of polymeric stabilization. At four months of follow-up, the patient reported a stable clinical scenario. Six months after surgery, due to extremely poor prognosis after the progression of primary disease, the patient was referred to palliative care and died shortly thereafter. _Conclusion_. Over the last decade, the management of metastatic bone disease has changed. Low-toxicity and minimally invasive procedures such as electrochemotherapy and polymeric bone stabilization might be performed concomitantly in selected patients, as an alternative to radiation therapy and to more demanding surgical procedures such as plating and adjuvant cementing.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The most common cause of destructive bone lesions is metastatic cancer. Bone is the third most common site for metastasis after lung and liver, while prostate, breast, lung, renal, and thyroid cancer account for around 80% of all skeletal metastases \\[1\\]. Bone metastases are commonly associated with a high morbidity burden that heavily affects the quality of life of oncologic patients. Severe pain can be experienced due to bone pain and compression of spinal cord or nerve roots, and it requires adequate multidisciplinary treatment that can include narcotic analgesics, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bisphosphonate. Surgery is mainly indicated in nonresponding tumors or when pain is not controlled with medical treatment. Around 10–25% of patients present with an impending or actual pathologic fracture \\[2\\], often requiring surgery and representing a catastrophic event for these patients. In addition to the fracture-related complications that could lead to immobilization, possible surgery, and consequent suspension of tumor-related treatments, other possible negative effects such as contamination of adjacent joint, soft tissue, nerves, and vessels by hematoma formation, or distant hematogenous dissemination due to microcirculation damages must be considered. Around 30% of the patients with renal cell cancer eventually develop bone metastases, and these are associated with worse overall survival \\[3\\]. Renal cancer bone metastases are usually lytic and highly hypervascular and cause technical issues especially during surgical management when the surgeon must face difficulties in achieving bone stability for pain control. Preoperative embolization is often required to minimize blood loss \\[4–6\\], and whenever radical surgery is not indicated, minimally invasive palliative treatments, such as electrochemotherapy, radiofrequency ablation, high intensity focus ultrasound, and photodynamic polymer bone stabilization, have become more and more popular \\[7–10\\].\n\n【4】At our institution, an Orthopedic Oncologic Department of a national reference center for musculoskeletal tumor surgery, the concomitant use of electrochemotherapy and a polymeric intramedullary stabilization system was chosen to treat multiple bone metastases of upper limbs in a multimetastatic renal cancer case.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A nonsmoker 60-year-old woman with a history of hiatal hernia with Barrett’s esophagus and depression was admitted to the Emergency Department due to persistent fever during the last month. Blood tests, ultrasounds (US), and computed tomography (CT) imaging showed an 8 cm right mesorenal cancer with infiltration of the perirenal fat, urinary collecting system, and renal sinus. Moreover, the presence of floating thrombus in the right renal vein up to the inferior caval vein was detected, while the absence of a cleavage plane with the lower face of the liver was reported. Radical right nephrectomy and homolateral renal vein thrombectomy were performed after 15 days from diagnosis. Histological examination revealed a pT3a G4 N1 clear cell renal cancer with extensive pleomorphic and rhabdoid aspects. A week after surgery, the patient suffered from left pulmonary thromboembolism, which required anticoagulant therapy. An acute pain at the left arm and right forearm occurred two months after surgery with no history of relevant trauma. Pathologic fractures were found in both the diaphysis of the left humerus and the proximal metaphysis of the right radius. The patient showed pain (NRS score 8/10 \\[11\\]), swelling, and both upper limbs’ complete limitation of movement plus systemic fatigue and poor appetite. No fever was detected. The peripheral blood erythrocyte count was below 3 × 10<sup>12</sup>/L, and hemoglobin was around 95 g/L. The Karnofsky score was 30. After hospital admission, the patient received parenteral nutrition, analgesics, and other symptomatic treatments. Oral anticoagulant therapy was suspended and replaced with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) therapy. After a multidisciplinary team discussion, the patient was addressed for surgery. While undergoing the routine preoperative workups, a spontaneous diaphyseal fracture of the right humerus occurred. Preoperative radiographs (as in Figure 1) demonstrated the fractures and wide lytic lesions involving the left humerus and the proximal right radius and confirmed the pathologic fracture of the right humerus. A CT scan of the thorax and abdomen was performed, and no secondary lesions were detected apart from the bone localizations. An additional CT scan of the upper limbs was performed to refine the surgical indication (Figure 2). Large osteolytic lesions with soft tissue invasion, involving the proximal left humerus and the proximal right radius were noticed. Our approach consisted of delivering a local adjuvant therapy on the lesions of the left humerus and right radius with electrochemotherapy using Cliniporator VITAE® technology (IGEA Spa; Carpi, MO, Italy). Thus, closed reduction and intramedullary fixation using a photodynamic polymeric stabilization system (IlluminOss® -IlluminOss Medical GmbH; Hilden, Germany) of both humeri was performed. The patient underwent general anesthesia and the entire procedure in a supine position. To treat both intraosseous and extraskeletal components of the lesions, electrochemotherapy was applied as follows: 4 and 7 single long (16 cm) needle VGD-1830T16 electrodes (variable geometry) with 1.8 mm in diameter and 3 cm active part were positioned around the right radial lesion and the left humeral lesion, respectively, and then the patient received a bolus of bleomycin (Bleomycin Nippon-Kayaku, Sanofi-Aventis, vials 15 mg, 15,000 UI/m<sup>2</sup> of body surface area). Eight minutes after the infusion, to allow the drug diffusion into the tumour tissues, electric pulses were applied (electroporation) according to the standard operating procedures. A single train of eight electric pulses of 100 _µ_s of duration at 1000 V/cm was generated by the Cliniporator Vitae® (IGEA spa Carpi). Afterwards, a small incision was performed anterolaterally to the acromion process of the left scapula, the deltoid muscle was split longitudinally to expose the subdeltoid bursa, and then the supraspinatus tendon was incised in line with its fibers. The fracture was reduced with the aid of an intramedullary guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance and the canal prepared with flexible cannulated reamers. Thus, the Dacron® balloon catheter was inserted, and the monomer was infused. The light source was finally used to activate the monomer, the tissues were closed in layers, and the correct position of the implant was checked by fluoroscopy. When the stability of the left humerus was reached, the contralateral fracture was internally stabilized with the same photodynamic bone stabilization system. After the operation, the right arm was immobilized with a long splint for 20 days, while arm slings were positioned bilaterally. Passive mobilization was prescribed from the first day following the operation, active elevation of the arms was restricted for the first 20 days, while lifting and strength-training were prohibited for a period of six weeks. The postoperative period was complicated by anemia, and five blood units were given to the patient. The pain was controlled with the administration of oral oxycodone/naloxone 5 mg/2.5 mg combination every 12 hours. After oncological examination, 24 days after surgery, a systemic treatment with pazopanib 400 mg once a day was prescribed, and the patient was discharged to an outpatient rehabilitative long-term care ward. Two months following the operation, a clinical follow-up reported that all surgical scars were well healed, and the range of motion was acceptable for low-impact daily activities. Anterior elevation and abduction of both shoulders were around 90°, internal rotation was limited to the buttock, while the elbows demonstrated full range of motion bilaterally. While slight pain (NRS score 3/10) was reported during the mobilization of the left shoulder, no pain was evocable by palpation of the treated bone lesions or at rest (NRS score 0/10). Nonetheless, the patient continued the same opioid dosage as at hospital discharge. MSTS score \\[12\\] was 12/30 (40%) bilaterally, while DASH scores \\[13\\] were 46.7 and 48.3 for the right and left side, respectively. Along with the clinical examination, radiographs were performed (Figures 3 and 4) and showed no secondary mobilization of the implants, an initial callus formation, and new ossification processes. A radiographic partial response with a reduction of approximately 30% of the lesions’ diameters was reported (RECIST criteria \\[14\\]). In conjunction with the oncologic team, the administration of pazopanib was confirmed, and a further clinical and radiological follow-up was scheduled at 6 months from surgery. At 4 months after surgery, the patient was contacted by telephone and reported substantial stability of the clinical scenario with well-controlled pain by mild opioid analgesics. At 6 months after surgery, a follow-up chest and abdomen CT exam detected lymph node infiltration of the caudate lobe of the liver and bone progression of disease. Furthermore, neck and supraclavicular lymph node metastases were reported. The oncologist suspended the treatment with pazopanib, and palliative care was initiated. The patient died within a month. This case report was approved by the United Ethical Committee of “AOU Città della Salute _e_ della Scienza,” Turin, Italy, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The patient signed an informed consent form and authorized the use of data for research purposes.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】  \n**(c)**\n\n【10】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】Preoperative radiographs demonstrating simultaneous lytic lesions and pathologic fractures of upper limbs secondary to a renal cell cancer.\n\n【13】  \n**(a)**\n\n【14】  \n**(b)**\n\n【15】  \n**(c)**\n\n【16】**(a)** **(b)**   \n**(c)**\n\n【17】Figure 2 \n\n【18】Preoperative CT scans demonstrating a large extraskeletal mass in the proximal left humerus causing a pathologic fracture, while a second lytic lesion is visible distally.

Discussion\n\n【32】The treatment of the multimetastatic patients has changed radically over the last 20 years: several surgical treatments have been introduced to control pain, maintain independent living, and improve the quality of life, along with improved medical treatments that target the prevention of tumor progression. Surgery is typically employed for impending fracture or for actual pathologic fractures, but when surgery is not indicated, fractionated radiation therapy (8 Gy/1f or 30 Gy/10f) is offered as first-line treatment. However, radiation therapy is not effective in around 30% of cases \\[15\\], and reaching of the maximum dose limits its usage. Moreover, patients might suffer from intolerance in the surrounding tissues and from weakening of the healthy bone \\[7\\].To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case report of a patient treated with internal fixation of pathologic fractures with an intramedullary polymeric stabilization system combined with simultaneous electrochemotherapy of upper limbs. The rationale was to apply adjuvant therapy to both the intraosseous and extraskeletal components to control tumor progression and pain, while providing immediate stability of the pathologic fractures with a minimally invasive surgical technique. In case of multimetastatic bone disease, the main objective of palliative treatments is to restore a partial/complete function controlling the pain and not always to reduce lesion size dimensions. Electrochemotherapy is based on the local intake of a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent (usually bleomycin) by means of electric pulses delivered to the tumor nodule via suitable sets of electrodes. Changes to the cell membrane potential determine the establishment of a transient passage: electroporation is induced, and water and charged molecules, such as some anticancer drugs, can pass through the cell membrane’s newly formed pores, into the cells’ interior. Such pores are established rapidly and disappear within minutes depending on the electric field amplitude \\[16\\]. In vivo studies \\[17–19\\] demonstrated that, after exposure to the electric field, the tumor’s blood flow decreases up to 80% for about 24 hours allowing the cytotoxic agent to stay within the tumor for several hours and possibly determining a vascular-disrupting effect on the targeted cells. Electrochemotherapy’s range of applications is extensive and includes cutaneous and subcutaneous metastases, melanoma, nonmelanoma skin cancer, soft-tissue sarcoma, and liver and bone metastases; in addition, some clinical trials have been conducted on selected primary tumors \\[20\\]. Even if the treatment of bone metastases and soft tissue masses with electroporation-based therapies is relatively recent \\[17, 21\\], good outcomes have been recorded in terms of pain control and tumor necrosis. A phase II clinical study \\[15\\] conducted on 29 patients affected by painful bone metastatic disease showed an improvement on pain control or a decrease in analgesic consumption in 84% of the cases, while a local progression was detected in around 7% of the patients. No patient suffered from intolerance to bleomycin; local complications were rare accounting for skin ulceration and necrosis in previously irradiated skin and a neurogenic bladder after the third treatment in a large lesion involving the sacrum. Overall, electrochemotherapy is safe and feasible in well-selected patients with multimetastatic bone disease and provides good results on pain control and local disease progression. It also allows treating tumor masses and nodules in the proximity of noble structures such as vessels and nerves as the treatment does not employ tissue heating \\[20\\]. Electrochemotherapy is currently in use at the referral centers for musculoskeletal surgery in Italy, while the Italian Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology (SIOT) has included it in the guidelines for the management of unresectable sacral tumors \\[22\\]. Also, a registry named ReinBONE (Registry on Electrochemotherapy in Bone), which is promoted by the Study Group for Bone Metastasis of the SIOT, is at present collecting clinical data on the treated cases. The photodynamic bone stabilization system is a recent, minimally invasive surgical technique that allows surgeons to repair bone fractures using alight-curable polymer contained within an inflatable balloon catheter \\[23\\]. This technique allows the time to obtain a proper reduction of the fracture before hardening the polymer, unlike polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement: once correct alignment, rotational stability, and bone length have been restored, the visible light curing system is introduced to rapidly polymerize the liquid in the balloon to form a durable, hardened stabilizing rod. The ability of the system to get into contact with the cortical bone, filling the medullary space, significantly reduces the rotatory instability of the traditional intramedullary devices that require the use of further hardware, such as screws, to provide stability \\[24, 25\\]. Also, if necessary, the hardened polymer can be used as a substrate for supplemental osteosynthesis as screws can be inserted as in conventional nails, to provide supplemental stability \\[26\\]. A preliminary study reported no complications in the treatment of 36 osteoporotic and metastatic fractures of non-weight-bearing bones apart from one surgical revision of a humeral fracture \\[23\\]. To validate the initial studies, a European Union Registry has been set up: the first results reported achievement of procedural success, and no removal or revision of implants was required in 149 fractures treated with the polymeric rod \\[10\\]. Recently, a prospective study on 33 patients with traumatic humeral fractures treated with the polymeric rod showed a complete healing in the whole sample of patients, with good pain control and satisfying functional outcomes. The procedure’s complication rate was around 35% which is not higher than what was reported in literature for other stabilization systems \\[26\\]. A comparison study among cemental plate fixation, intramedullary nailing, and photodynamic stabilization in the treatment of 105 malignant pathologic humeral fractures was conducted. No significant differences were registered in reoperation rates, but the rate of broken implants was significantly higher in patients treated with a polymeric rod \\[27\\]. Although the photodynamic polymer stabilization system is usually indicated for metastatic and osteoporotic fractures of non-weight-bearing bones fractures, several other uses are reported in the literature such as compassionate stabilization of femoral fractures in nonambulant patients \\[23\\] and surgical augmentation of acetabular and femoral fractures in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta \\[28, 29\\]. Also, a preliminary study on sheep provided encouraging results in the treatment of weight-bearing bone fractures \\[30\\]. The system is contraindicated in active or not completely healed infections, even if studies have been carried out on the antimicrobial effect of the light used for the polymerization of the system \\[31\\].\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【34】The management of a patient with a multimetastatic bone disease benefits a multidisciplinary approach. Whenever medical or radiation therapy is neither effective nor indicated, several palliative surgeries can be proposed to the patient. Minimally invasive and low-toxicity procedures such as bone electrochemotherapy and polymeric bone stabilization might be performed concomitantly in selected patients, in an attempt to synergize their benefits. Although clinical and functional outcomes of the above case report were satisfactory to improve the quality of life, further larger studies on combination of techniques could help surgeons make more conscious decisions.\n\n【35】#### Data Availability\n\n【36】The radiographical imaging and data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.\n\n【37】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【38】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n【39】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【40】This work was supported by IGEA SpA (Carpi, MO, Italy).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

While several cardiac complications of cardiac involvement have been previously described, the evolution towards cerebral stroke has been rarely reported. In this case report, we describe an atypical case of haematogenous metastatic invasion of the left atrium from pulmonary neoplasm extension presenting as an ipsilateral stroke whose ASCO classification changed during the clinical management.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Although cardiac metastases have been reported in up to 25% of patients with lung cancer in autoptic studies \\[1\\], the detection of cardiac involvement in these patients is relatively uncommon in clinical practice \\[2–4\\]. The metastatic pathway to the heart is often lymphatic, but hematogenous patterns can also be observed \\[5\\]. From a clinical point of view, invasion of the left heart may be a life-threatening event, potentially leading to a number of complications such as obstructed pulmonary venous flow \\[6\\], cardiac tamponade \\[7\\], ventricular arrhythmias \\[8\\], complete atrioventricular block \\[9\\], left ventricular inflow obstruction \\[10\\], and myocardial infarction \\[11\\].\n\n【4】Cerebral stroke as a result of systemic embolization from the left heart has been exceptionally reported \\[12\\] and may sometimes represent the first clinical presentation of the neoplasm. Adequate identification of the underlying cause of stroke is therefore of major clinical importance in these cases. Compared with the old Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification system, newer classification schemes such as the ASCO (A, atherosclerosis; S, small vessel disease; C, cardiac source; O, other causes) phenotypic system can facilitate the identification of the most likely cause by grading the probability of each factor and accounting for the extent of the diagnostic work-up \\[13\\]. This approach may be particularly useful when multiple potential mechanisms are present, since it reduces the prevalence of patients with stroke of indeterminate origin. In this report, we describe an unusual case of left atrial (LA) invasion from pulmonary neoplasm extension via the right upper pulmonary vein whose first clinical presentation was characterized by an ipsilateral stroke with evolving ASCO categorization during the management.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 76-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department because of left hemiparesis and dysarthria. His history was relevant for past smoking, systemic hypertension, and laryngeal cancer treated by total laryngectomy and tracheostomy 5 years earlier. His usual therapy included aspirin, losartan, and doxazosin. During the last 3 weeks, he had shown recurrent episodes of postural instability and paresthesia in the left arm. A brain computed tomography (CT) performed 2 weeks earlier had shown no significant abnormalities. At the current examination, chest and cardiac examinations were normal, blood pressure was 170/75 mmHg, heart rate was 77 bpm, body temperature was 36.5°C, and oxygen saturation was 95%. The ECG was normal. Neurological examination showed facial-brachial-crural left hemiparesis (NIH Stroke Scale = 8). A new brain CT showed an ipsilateral hypodense lesion in the left semioval center. The patient was hospitalized, and therapy with aspirin, methylprednisolone, ramipril, and dalteparin was started. An echo-Doppler of supra-aortic vessels showed subcritical stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and critical stenosis of the left common carotid artery with occlusion of proximal left internal carotid artery. An atherosclerotic stroke was diagnosed (ASCO A1b).\n\n【7】During the following hours, neurological conditions progressively improved. Routine chest X-ray evidenced a rounding mass projecting over the right upper lobe and extending towards the right upper portion of cardiac silhouette (Figure 1). Chest CT confirmed the presence of a large opacity with irregular borders, with invasion of the right upper pulmonary vein and extension into the left atrium (Figure 2). Transthoracic echocardiography showed massive LA invasion by a large, multilobed, highly mobile mass (48 × 35 mm) protruding through the mitral valve into the left ventricle during diastole (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed LA invasion with occlusion of the right upper pulmonary vein and pericardial infiltration through the LA roof, allowing visualization of areas of vascularization and some regions of cystic colliquation within the mass (Figures 3(c) and 3(d)). The stroke was reclassified as ASCO C<sub>1</sub>. On day 7, sudden right hemiparesis with spatiotemporal disorientation occurred. Brain CT showed new multiple, diffuse hypodense lesions near the vertex in the left hemisphere (Figure 4). After careful clinical evaluation, the patient was considered at too high risk to undergo thoracic surgery. On day 20, cardiac magnetic resonance showed a further increase in the dimension of LA mass with subtotal obliteration of LA cavity (Figure 5). On day 23, the patient died because of cardiac arrest.\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Chest X-ray showing a rounding mass projecting over the right upper lobe and extending towards the right upper portion of cardiac silhouette.\n\n【12】  \n**(a)**\n\n【13】  \n**(b)**\n\n【14】  \n**(c)**\n\n【15】  \n**(d)**\n\n【16】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【17】Figure 2 \n\n【18】Chest CT showing a large opacity with irregular borders in the right upper lobe (a), with invasion of the right upper pulmonary vein (b-c) and extension into the left atrium (d).

Discussion\n\n【36】Although relatively rare, metastatization of pulmonary neoplasm to the left atrium has been well documented, particularly in patients with primary lung cancer \\[14, 15\\]. In a previous review of 215 lung cancer patients studied by gadolinium-enhanced 3D magnetic resonance angiography, an involvement of the proximal portion of the pulmonary veins and an extension into the left atrium were found in 9 (4.2%) and 2 (0.9%) patients, respectively \\[16\\]. Similarly, a more recent retrospective analysis of 4668 patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer found pathological evidence of pulmonary vein and LA involvement in 34 (0.7%) and 25 (0.5%) subjects, respectively \\[17\\]. LA invasion usually occurs by two main mechanisms, including direct infiltration of myocardial tissue by contiguity \\[18–20\\] and extension into the left atrium via the lymphatics and/or the pulmonary veins \\[21–28\\]. Patients most commonly suffer symptoms related to lung cancer (e.g., cough, hemoptysis, and weight loss) or sometimes related to cardiac complications as the first clinical presentation. A limited number of reports previously described cardiovascular presentations secondary to systemic neoplastic embolization, including cerebral ischemia \\[29–31\\] or peripheral arterial occlusion \\[32\\]. Noteworthy, most previous reports of cerebral ischemia described events with typical contralateral presentation \\[12, 29\\] or incidental detection of brain ischemic lesion by imaging techniques in asymptomatic subjects \\[30, 31\\]. Although patients with metastatic involvement of the heart generally have poor clinical outcome, their management should include a careful assessment of surgical options. When appropriate, the treatment of choice is complete resection in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy \\[32\\]. However, in the majority of cases, cardiac metastases occur in patients with advanced neoplastic disease who have already undergone resection of the tumor of origin. In these cases, cardiac treatment is usually confined to palliative interventions to relieve cardiac compression or haemodynamic obstruction if indicated. Moreover, complete resection of the tumor is not always possible, and postoperative mortality is relatively high \\[33, 34\\].\n\n【37】In this report, we describe the case of a primary lung neoplasm extending into the left atrium via a pulmonary vein and complicated by stroke presenting as ipsilateral hemiparesis. Several atypical issues should be pointed out in this case: (1) the clinical presentation as stroke with left hemiparesis and CT evidence of ipsilateral acute ischemic lesion, which might suggest the presence of uncrossed corticospinal tracts in our patient \\[35\\]; (2) the changes in stroke categorization according to the ASCO classification, related to the detection of left internal carotid artery occlusion with successive evidence of cardiac source of cerebral embolization; (3) the successive clinical evolution with sudden-onset right hemiparesis associated with multiple contralateral left-sided lesions, suggestive for an embolization pattern; (4) the growth rate of LA mass, which rapidly led to LA cavity obliteration and cardiac death. It should be pointed out that since tissue analysis data were not available, caution is needed in interpreting these findings. Although both the clinical course and imaging data support the hypothesis of a metastatic nature of the mass, without histologic confirmation, the diagnosis cannot be considered as definitively established. From a practical point of view, this report highlights the importance of considering the ASCO classification as a dynamic tool to define the phenotypic nature of stroke and of considering echocardiography as a cornerstone in the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of patients with clinical evidence of cerebral ischemia \\[36\\].\n\n【38】#### Competing Interests\n\n【39】The authors declare that there are no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

To date, fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the literature. We herein present a case of 59-year-old female with primary multifocal recurrent urinary bladder amyloidosis. The patient was treated with a new method (laser therapy) mentioned for the first time in the literature. After 18 months of treatment, the patient has no complaints. Our case illustrates a new procedure in the treatment of primary multifocal bladder amyloidosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous group disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of eosinophilic fibrillar protein (amyloid protein) in various tissues and organs \\[1\\]. Historically, the term amyloid was coined for the first time by Virchow in 1854. In 1897, Solomin described the first clinical case of bladder amyloidosis (BA) at autopsy \\[2\\]. BA is most frequent in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> decade with equal gender preponderance \\[3\\].\n\n【4】There are two forms of BA: primary urinary bladder amyloidosis (PUBA) and secondary (commonly associated with chronic inflammatory conditions) \\[1\\]. Gross hematuria with irritative lower urinary tract symptoms is the most prominent in PUBA. It may be easily confused with bladder cancer \\[3\\]. There are no standard management protocols of PUBA due to its rarity. Herein we present the first rare case in Syria of recurrent multifocal PUBA treated with laser therapy for the first time in the medical literature.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 59-year-old Syrian female was admitted with a 2-month history of gross hematuria associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. There were no systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, or rash). The hematuria was red in color, fresh, and intermittent with no clotting. She was diagnosed with PUBA 18 years ago treated by transurethral resection without follow-up.\n\n【7】The physical examinations were unremarkable. Complete blood counts (CBCs) and routine biochemical tests (renal, liver, and bone parameters) were normal. Urinary microscopic examination showed normal pH and specific gravity, with uncountable RBCs, few WBCs, granules casts, and presence of hemoglobin. Culture and sensitivity were normal.\n\n【8】Ultrasound of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder showed thickening and irregularity of the bladder wall with 9 mm as the maximum thickness (Figure 1). Intravenous urography was normal. Cystoscopy showed multifocal yellowish bladder lesions (Figure 2). The pathologic examination demonstrated extensive deposits of a cellular amorphous compatible with amyloidosis. No other abnormality was detected.\n\n【9】  \n\n【10】  \n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】Ultrasound scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder showed thickening and irregularity of the bladder wall.\n\n【13】  \n\n【14】  \n\n【15】Figure 2 \n\n【16】Cystoscopy showed multifocal yellowish bladder lesions.\n\n【17】To exclude systemic amyloidosis, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were conducted which revealed no pathologic findings. Tuberculin reaction and tuberculosis screening in 24 hours urine were normal. There was no increased lymphocyte count and protein gap. Bone marrow examination and CT scan of abdomen were both normal.\n\n【18】After the exclusion of systemic amyloidosis, recurrent multifocal PUBA diagnosis was confirmed.\n\n【19】A new method in the treatment of PUBA with neodymium: yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser therapy had been performed. The laser intensity used was 25 Watt with pulse duration less than 3 seconds. The fibreoptic tip was placed 1–3 mm from the bladder wall using a spot size of 2 mm. The total energy was 23500 Joules.\n\n【20】After 18 months from treatment, the patient was normal without symptoms. She has since remained asymptomatic without progression of systemic amyloidosis. Follow-up cystoscopies performed at present have been normal.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】The underlying mechanism of the PUBA is still controversial. Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation results in infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells with subsequent amyloid fibril deposition \\[4\\].\n\n【23】Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not always useful in differentiating amyloidosis from other pathological conditions. CT shows thickening of the bladder wall, a mass lesion, or a filling defect in the urinary bladder which leads to the differential diagnosis of invasive bladder tumor or inflammatory lesion \\[1\\]. Cystoscopy showed nodular or polypoidal lesions that mimic the appearance of primary urothelial carcinomas. The gold standard of the PUBA diagnosis is bladder biopsy \\[5\\].\n\n【24】To date, approximately 210 cases of BUPA have been reported in the literature (over 22 countries; 60 cases in the UK). The current case report is the first report from Syria that described a case of recurrent multifocal PUBA treated with laser therapy.\n\n【25】In the literature, transurethral resection or partial cystectomy is the most used option for treating PUBA with a high rate of complication and recurrence \\[6\\]. None of these cases used laser therapy as the first choice of treatment for the recurrent multifocal cases. Despite the wide multifocal lesions of the PUBA in the current case, laser was used for the first time over wide lesions without any significant complaint.\n\n【26】There are rare reports of conservative treatment such as intravesical dimethyl sulfoxide installation and oral medications (colchicine) in the smaller lesions. Laser therapy or fulguration has been used for small, localized lesions \\[4\\]. Long-term cystoscopic surveillance with close follow-up is recommended in cases of recurrent PUBA \\[7\\].\n\n【27】In the current case, we recommend the use of laser in treating multifocal lesions of PUBA. The use of laser is safe, and it maintains the capacity of the bladder without damage.\n\n【28】#### Data Availability\n\n【29】All data generated or analyzed during this study are included within this article.\n\n【30】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【31】This case report did not require review by the Ethics Committee of Tishreen University Hospital, Lattakia, Syria.\n\n【32】#### Consent\n\n【33】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【34】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【35】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【36】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【37】LD and MK analyzed and interpreted the patient data and were the major contributors in writing the manuscript.

Neonatal jaundice, hemolytic anemia, icteric skin, dark urine, and fever are usually the primary signs of this condition, which is generally diagnosed between the ages of infancy and 16 years old. Therefore, its first manifestation in old age is an unexpected phenomenon. Here, we present the case of a 70-year-old man with no past medical history of G6PD deficiency that was admitted to our hospital due to COVID-19 infection and developed acute hemolytic anemia while receiving hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) medication for COVID-19-related pneumonia.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the most common RBC abnormality, affecting 400 million people globally \\[1, 2\\]. Neonatal jaundice, hemolytic anemia, icteric skin, dark urine, and fever are usually the first signs of this condition, which is generally diagnosed between the ages of infancy and 16 years old \\[3, 4\\]. Therefore, the first onset of this disease in old age is an unexpected phenomenon that is one of the rare aspects of our case. On the other hand, although G6PD is a benign hematologic condition, an acute hemolytic crisis triggered by oxidative agents such as fava beans, medications (like hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)), or infections might be its most life-threatening clinical presentation.\n\n【4】HCQ is a renowned drug in the treatment of malaria, and it has lately been widely used as a trial medication to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). HCQ is a forbidden medication in G6PD patients, but recent investigations have challenged its role in causing hemolytic anemia \\[5\\]. However, following the prevalence of COVID-19 and the widespread usage of this drug, cases of hemolytic anemia in COVID-19 patients and their recovery after discontinuation of this drug were reported, which led us to collect these studies and review them thoroughly. Here, we introduce a 70-year-old man with no past medical history of G6PD deficiency who was admitted to our hospital for COVID-19 infection and experienced acute hemolytic anemia in the setting of HCQ therapy for COVID-19-related pneumonia.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 70-year-old man presented to our emergency department with a dry cough three days before admission, dyspnea, and a positive result from the recent COVID-19 PCR test. He had a medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, high blood pressure, and hypothyroidism. After the initial evaluation, his oxygen saturation was at 90%, and a mild fever was detected. Therefore, we started with 2 liters of oxygen with a nasal cannula. A high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed, and multiple patchy infiltrations were reported. Shortly after his admission, his oxygen saturation decreased to 75%, so we transferred him to the intensive care unit (ICU). Following our institutional protocol, he started on 800 mg HCQ on day one, then, 200 mg twice a day for four days. Then, we noticed a slight decrease in his hemoglobin level while he was receiving his first course of the HCQ, but his hemoglobin level stabilized after the first course of treatment. The laboratory courses of the patient's hemoglobin and creatinine level are illustrated in Figure 1. Afterward, a subsequent HRCT was performed and showed severe involvement of his lungs. Consequently, according to the promising results around HCQ's role in the treatment of COVID-19 at that time, we started the second treatment course with this drug; however, after three days, we noticed a severe reduction in his hemoglobin level again. Therefore, we stopped the HCQ and packed cell transfusion started for him. His peripheral blood smear (PBS) revealed peripheral schistocytes, which were in favor of hemolytic anemia. According to the previous G6PD history in his first-degree relatives, a G6PD level test was requested, and the diagnosis of G6PD was established. Ultimately, he was discharged in good condition by discontinuing HCQ as a G6PD stimulus and transfusing several bags of pack cells.\n\n【7】  \n\n【8】  \n\n【9】Figure 1 \n\n【10】Laboratory course of the patient's hemoglobin and creatinine during hospitalization.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】The COVID-19 pandemic, which was initiated in December 2019, has many more dimensions yet to be revealed. One of these aspects is G6PD-deficient patients. G6PD is the most common red cell enzymatic disorder worldwide, and 400 to 500 million people are affected by one of its subtypes \\[1\\]. The role of COVID-19 in this disorder has not been adequately studied. Infections, especially viral infections by increasing oxidative stress, have previously been recognized as a trigger for G6PD deficiency, but more studies are needed on the consequences of COVID-19 in G6PD deficient patients. \\[6, 7\\]. On the other hand, the drug HCQ, an antimalarial medication, was introduced as one of the early experimental treatments for COVID-19. This drug, along with COVID-19 infection, was an additional cause to explain hemolysis in G6PD patients. Therefore, for an adequate understanding of this issue, our team conducted an advanced search strategy using keywords and mesh terms in databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to find more cases with COVID-19 infection that used HCQ as a treatment and had hemolysis, which results are presented in Table 1.\n\n【13】Table 1 \n\n【14】Characteristics of 11 included studies.\n\n【15】In some cases, which we included in Table 1, HCQ administration has been recommended as the main reason for patients' hemolysis. But some of the other investigations propose otherwise. In a retrospective cohort survey by Mohammad et al. \\[5\\], in 2018, which analyzed 275 patients with rheumatic disease who had exposure to HCQ for more than 700 months, none of their 11 patients diagnosed with G6PD and simultaneously HCQ reported hemolysis was used. Similarly, in one of the cases mentioned in our table, they started HCQ on the 6th day of admission. Still, their retrospective evaluation of daily smear demonstrated a significant number of hemighost cells and microspherocytes from the 4th day of admission (2 days before they start HCQ), and their number increased gradually until the 7<sup>th</sup> day \\[17\\]. Although chloroquine is mentioned in the list of drugs that can lead to hemolysis in G6PD patients \\[11\\], it does not seem that a short duration of HCQ administration, which hospitals used for the treatment of COVID-19, could cause such severe hemolysis in the absence of another oxidative stress like a systemic infection \\[12\\]. Therefore, we assume that COVID-19 infection was the principal basis and primary trigger, which in combination with HCQ as a secondary agent; it induced hemolysis in G6PD patients. The interesting point about our case is that he did not experience even one episode of a hemolytic crisis in his lifetime, despite his continuous consumption of fava beans and G6PD unmasked just after his involvement with the COVID-19 virus and HCQ administration in the hospital.\n\n【16】In conclusion, G6PD is the most common enzymatic disorder in red blood cells and can lead to a hemolytic crisis, which can be associated with severe consequences such as death. COVID-19 should be considered a potent oxidative stress factor in these patients, especially since it is periodically treated with G6PD-exacerbating drugs such as HCQ.\n\n【17】#### Data Availability\n\n【18】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\n\n【19】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【20】Our study has been reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.\n\n【21】#### Consent\n\n【22】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient to publish this case report.

Insufficiency fractures of pubic rami are rare occurrences in association with total hip arthroplasty (THA). Postoperative stress fractures occur due to increase of patients activity following years of disability. The physician should consider the possibility of a pelvic insufficiency fracture in patients with RA after THA, if the patients present with groin pain. We demonstrate here the first case of bilateral insufficiency fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone following THA.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】THA is effective for decreasing pain and improving the loss of function. Acute hip pain within the first few years after THA is unusual when the components are correctly positioned. The differential diagnosis, dislocation, infection, and periarticular bursitis or tendinitis, are considered. Insufficiency fracture around components also should be considered as part of differential diagnosis.\n\n【4】Several reports showed cases of insufficiency fracture of pubic rami after THA \\[1–3\\]. However, insufficiency fracture of bilateral pubic rami and iliac bone following THA has never been reported. Here, we report a case of a patient who complained of bilateral pelvic pain following bilateral THA who was found to have bilateral insufficiency fractures of pubic rami and iliac bone.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 62-year-old woman suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) underwent a left THA in 2007 and a right revision THA in 2009. The patient was treated with various doses of glucocorticoid for long term. After surgery, she was able to walk without support. However, ten months postoperatively, she presented with complaints of left groin pain that initially was associated with physical therapy sessions. The symptoms became more constant. She denied a history of a fall or of another traumatic event. Radiographs, at that time, did not show any significant findings. She was treated with anti-inflammatory medication and weight-bearing with use of a cane in the right hand. Over the next 2 months, the left groin pain was disappeared. After 4 month, the left pubic pain was recurrent. She did weight-bearing with use of a cane in the right hand again. However, she presented right groin pain several days later. Symptoms were worse with weight bearing and walking. Furthermore, several days later, both sides of buttock pain were presented and unable to walk.\n\n【7】Radiographs showed fractures of both pubic rami. Computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone (Figures 1 and 2). Evaluation for metabolic bone disease was performed. There was no significant evidence evaluated by blood examination.\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】  \n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】| CT image showing pelvis.

By this time, all symptoms had subsided.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Stress fractures are classified into three subgroups: fatigue fracture caused by repetitive stress for normal bone, insufficiency fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile bone, and pathologic fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile invaded bone by tumor \\[4\\]. Zwartelé et al. reported systematic reviews of cementless THA in RA patients, and they concluded that cementless acetabular cups were rarely associated with mechanical complications including acetabular fracture \\[5\\]. However, Fukunishi et al. reported that 11 patients in 171 RA patients (6.4%) who underwent cemented THA suffered from pubic rami fractures postoperatively \\[6\\]. Isdale reported the bone quality in RA patients was poor, and insufficiency fractures of the pubic rami in RA appear to be more common than had been recognized \\[7\\]. In our case, the subtype of stress fracture is thought to be classified into insufficiency fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile bone due to RA. The bone quality of this patient might be poor, because the patient was treated with glucocorticoid for long term.\n\n【19】The patient performed revision THA by using Kerboull-type acetabular reinforcement device. Several reports demonstrated the results postoperatively using Kerboull-type acetabular reinforcement device \\[8, 9\\]. However, there was no report of pubic rami fracture after THA. Therefore, the fracture may not be associated with acetabular component design.\n\n【20】Most pelvic insufficiency fractures occur in women, particularly those with osteoporotic bone. The patients have impaired activity levels prior to THA. After surgery, many of these patients are pain free and get activity at a much higher level than preoperatively. Therefore, they are susceptible to the development of an insufficiency fracture if the bone quality is poor. In our case, the mechanism of fracture is thought as follows. Firstly, the insufficiency fracture of left pubic rami occurred due to daily activity. The patient was placed on limited weight-bearing, with use of a cane in the right hand. This increased the stress on the right side, and the fracture of right pubic rami was occurred. Both sides of pubic fracture increased the stress on both iliac bone, and the fractures of both iliac bones were caused.\n\n【21】Insufficiency fractures are differentiated from acute fractures, which occur early in the postoperative period as a result of press-fit insertion of cementless acetabular components in osteopenic bone \\[10\\].\n\n【22】The physician should consider the possibility of a pelvic insufficiency fracture in patients with RA after THA. If the patient presents with groin pain, the patient should be treated with weight-bearing as conservative management.\n\n【23】However, pelvic discontinuity by both pubic rami and iliac bone fracture occurred in our case; even we recommended weight-bearing at the time of initial fracture of left pubic rami. We reported the first case of bilateral insufficiency fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone following THA.\n\n【24】#### Acknowledgments\n\n【25】The authors thank Janina Tubby for her assistance with English rewriting.

The lesions tend to fade with time and those on the glabellum, eyelids, nose, and upper lip are rarely detected after the age of 6. We report a 33-year-old Chinese female with a salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum. To our knowledge, the occurrence of a salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum in adulthood has not been reported. The persistent salmon patch on the face of an adult is benign and not associated with any neurocutaneous syndrome or underlying vascular abnormality. The color of the lesion can be ameliorated with laser therapy if cosmesis is a concern.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Salmon patches, also known as nevus flammeus simplex, are the most common vascular lesions in infancy \\[1\\]. Colloquially, the lesions on the forehead and eyelids are known as “angel’s kisses” and the ones in the occipital area as “stork bite marks” \\[1\\]. Presumably, salmon patches are composed of ectatic dermal capillaries that represent the persistence of fetal circulating patterns in the skin \\[2\\]. In the Caucasian population, salmon patches are present in approximately 44% of all neonates \\[2\\]. They are much less common in dark-skinned neonates \\[3\\]. Both sexes are equally affected \\[3\\]. The lesions tend to fade with time and those on the glabellum, eyelids, nose, and upper lip are rarely detected after the age of 6 \\[1\\]. We describe a 33-year-old female with a salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum. To our knowledge, the occurrence of a salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum in adulthood has not been reported.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 33-year-old Chinese female presented with pain in the neck, back, and shoulders as a result of a motor vehicle accident. On examination, there was tenderness and hypertonicity in the paraspinal muscles in the cervical area, paraspinal muscles in the lumbar area, and trapezius muscles. Incidentally, a salmon patch was noted on the forehead and the glabellum (Figure 1). The patch was faintly erythematous in color. There were no other salmon patches noted on any parts of her body. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. In particular, she did not have dysmorphic features or hepatomegaly.\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】| A faint erythematous patch noted on the forehead and glabellum of a 33-year-old patient. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】According to the patient, the patch was present at birth but was erythematous in color. She did not have similar erythematous patches elsewhere such as the eyelids, nose, philtrum, lips, and the occipital areas. She recalled that the patch would deepen in color with crying and vigorous activity. The color of the patch had become lighter over time. She was born to a gravida 3, para 2, 24-year-old mother at term following a normal vaginal delivery and an uncomplicated pregnancy. The mother was not on any medication or alcohol during the pregnancy. The parents were nonconsanguineous. No family members had similar skin lesions in adulthood.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Clinically, the lesions of salmon patches are scarlet to pink, flat, can be totally blanched, and usually deepen in color with vigorous activity, crying, straining with defecation, breath-holding, or changes in ambient temperature \\[4\\]. In white infants, they are usually bright red or pink and are darker in oriental or black infants \\[4\\]. The lesions are most commonly found on the nape, followed by the glabella and eyelids \\[3\\]. Other less common sites are the nasolabial folds, lips, and sacral area \\[5\\]. Salmon patches are usually symmetric, with lesions on both eyelids or on both sides of midline \\[6\\]. Prominent lesions in the glabella are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome \\[4, 7\\]. Salmon patches are generally not associated with extracutaneous anomalies \\[5\\]. In spite of their midline location, most salmon patches, except those in the sacral area, are not associated with spinal dysraphism \\[5\\].\n\n【13】Salmon patches should be differentiated from port-wine stain (nevus flammeus) and congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation \\[8\\]. Port-wine stain is a capillary malformation characterized clinically by persistent macular erythema and pathologically by ectasia of the papillary and superficial reticular dermal capillaries, which are otherwise lined by normal-appearing flat endothelial cells. The lesions of port-wine stain are usually unilateral and segmental and do not follow the lines of Blaschko. The lesions often become dark-red during adolescence and violaceous with advancing age. Although port-wine stain can occur anywhere on the body, the most common site is the face. The lesions grow with the child and persist throughout life. Although usually an isolated finding, port-wine stain is also a typical feature of Sturge-Weber syndrome and Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome.\n\n【14】Congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation simulates a salmon patch but differs from a salmon patch in that the lesion is more extensive, extending from the forehead and glabella to the nose, philtrum, and upper lip; the color is more intense; and the lesion fades more slowly or incompletely \\[8\\]. Familial cases of congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformations have been reported \\[9\\]. Our patient did not have similar erythematous patches elsewhere such as the eyelids, nose, philtrum, and lips at birth. As such, in a strict sense, she did not have a congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation. Some investigators, however, believe that salmon patches on the forehead and the glabellum may be a forme fruste of congenital medial frontofacial capillary malformation.\n\n【15】Salmon patches tend to fade and disappear with time; nuchal lesions tend to persist longer \\[3, 10, 11\\]. Leung and Telmesani examined 808 Caucasian newborn term infants (440 males and 368 females) and 1,575 Caucasian children for the presence of salmon patches \\[2\\]. The patches were present in 192 (43.6%) males and 161 (43.8%) females in the neonatal period. The most frequent site was the nape, followed by the glabellum, eyelids, nose, and upper lip. Salmon patches were not detected in boys after age 6 and in girls after age 5. On the other hand, Oster and Nielson detected nuchal salmon patches in 501 (46.2%) of 1,084 Danish school-aged girls and 382 (35.1%) of 1,087 Danish school-aged boys \\[12\\]. Corson found nuchal salmon patches in 13 (4.7%) of 275 medical students \\[10\\]. Verbov and Steinberg examined 188 hospital inpatients and old-aged residents (67 males and 121 females), aged 60 years and over, for the presence and absence of a salmon patch over the occiput and nape \\[11\\]. Forty (60%) of the males and 51 (42%) of the females showed typical nuchal patches. From these studies, it seems clear that salmon patches are common in the neonatal period. These patches, except those located in the occiput and nape, tend to disappear or significantly regress with time. Those in the occiput and nape tend to persist longer. Facial lesions are rare after puberty and have not been reported in adulthood. We herein report the occurrence of a salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum of a Chinese adult. With the reporting of this case, it is hoped that similar cases will be forthcoming. Familiarity of the existence of salmon patch on the forehead and glabellum in adulthood would allow a straight forward diagnosis to be made and unnecessary referrals to be avoided.\n\n【16】The persistent salmon patch on the face of an adult is benign and not associated with any neurocutaneous syndrome or underlying vascular abnormality. The color of the lesion can be ameliorated with laser therapy if cosmesis is a concern.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】Salmon patches, except those located in the occiput and nape, tend to disappear or significantly regress with time.

We present the case of a 50-year-old woman who presented with a swelling in her left breast. The patient had experienced blunt chest trauma 2 months back. Needle aspiration revealed pus formation in the patient’s chest. Computed tomography revealed a mass in the lower region of the left mammary gland, with thickening of the parietal pleura and skin and fracture of the fifth rib under the abscess. Following antibiotic administration and irrigation of the affected region, surgical debridement was performed. During surgery, we found that the pectoralis major muscle at the level of the fifth rib was markedly damaged, although the necrotic tissue did not contact the mammary gland. We diagnosed the lesion as a chest wall abscess that occurred in response to blunt chest trauma. Her postoperative course was uneventful. There has been no recurrence for six months after surgery.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Chest wall infections can be categorized as primary and secondary infections, with the former arising spontaneously (primary chest wall abscess) and the latter occurring in response to preexisting disease states or irritation caused by other procedures (secondary chest wall abscess) \\[1\\]. We report the case of a 50-year-old woman who developed a primary chest wall abscess with breast tumor—like features that developed after rib fracture caused by blunt chest trauma.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 50-year-old Japanese female presented at our institute with a swelling in her left breast (Figure 1). She had received a blow to her anterior chest 2 months back, but she did not seek immediate medical consultation at that time. The patient reported no history of major medical diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, or renal disease, and she did not smoke, consume alcohol, or take any medications. Physical examination revealed a firm and tender mass in the lower region of the left breast. No lymph nodes were palpable in the bilateral axillary fossa and cervix. Ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic mass with a hyperechoic boundary toward the subcutaneous tissue (Figure 2). Laboratory evaluation revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 20,000/_μ_L and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 12.3 mg/dL. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 15-3, and NCC-ST-439 were all within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a large mass measuring 10 cm × 10 cm in the lower region of the left breast, with pleural and skin thickening and fracture of the fifth rib under the mass (Figure 3(a)). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with fat suppression revealed a low-signal intensity mass in the lower region of the left mammary gland, and contrast enhancement revealed its border and the adjacent pleura (Figure 3(b)).\n\n【6】  \n\n【7】  \n\n【8】Figure 1 \n\n【9】| The patient presents with left breast swelling. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 2 \n\n【13】| Ultrasound showing a hypoechoic mass with a hyperechoic boundary toward the subcutaneous tissue (arrow). |\n| --- |\n\n【14】  \n**(a)**\n\n【15】  \n**(b)**\n\n【16】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【17】Figure 3 \n\n【18】| (a) Computed tomography (CT) showing a large mass in the lower region of the left breast.

We suspected a breast abscess or chest wall abscess and instructed that the patient be admitted for treatment. Pus culture revealed the growth of group A _Streptococcus_ (GAS; _Streptococcus pyogenes_). Cytology revealed no malignancy.\n\n【20】The patient underwent drainage under local anesthesia on the day of admission, and a cloudy, yellowish-white pus was obtained. An irrigation drain was inserted into the abscess cavity. Antibiotic therapy with an ampicillin-sulbactam combination was administered and saline irrigation (1000 mL/day) via the drain was performed. GAS was susceptible to the ampicillin-sulbactam combination.\n\n【21】WBC and CRP levels declined to their normal limits on the 5th day of admission; therefore, antibiotic administration was discontinued. On the 24th day of admission, CT showed that the abscess cavity had shrunk and that the fracture of the fifth rib had healed (Figure 4).\n\n【22】  \n\n【23】  \n\n【24】Figure 4 \n\n【25】| Computed tomography showing that the abscess cavity has shrunk and that the fracture in the fifth rib has healed (arrow). |\n| --- |\n\n【26】The patient underwent surgical debridement under general anesthesia on the 27th day of admission to reveal the focus of the infection and for removal of the necrotic tissue. During surgery, we found that the pectoralis major muscle at the level of the fifth rib had markedly thinned; this necrotic tissue made no contact with the mammary gland. On the basis of these findings, a final diagnosis of chest wall abscess was made. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful and she was discharged 12 days after surgery. There has been no evidence of recurrence for six months after surgery.\n\n【27】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【28】Primary chest wall abscess is a rare clinical entity, occurring as a result of the hematogenous spread of bacterial, fungal, or mycobacterial pathogens. Chest wall abscess occurring because of the spread of infection from the lungs or pleura or that occurring after open trauma or thoracic wall surgery is classified as secondary chest wall abscess. Chest wall abscess can evolve from a simple soft-tissue infection, osteomyelitis of the rib(s), infection of the costochondral junction with destruction of the surrounding ribs, or infection of the sternoclavicular joint \\[2\\]. Treatment differs with the extent of infection and includes simple administration of routine antibiotic therapy or multiple and prolonged drainage and complex reconstructive surgeries \\[1\\]. The necessity for correct diagnosis cannot be underestimated because fulminant infections can occur in aged or immunocompromised patients if treated incorrectly. Prompt and appropriate surgical management and antibiotic therapy affect the treatment outcome \\[3\\].\n\n【29】Our patient developed a chest wall abscess 2 months after receiving a blunt chest trauma, and CT revealed a fracture in her left fifth rib under the abscess. We could not determine the route of entry of GAS into the bloodstream because the patient had been asymptomatic, had received no dental treatment or cut wounds for several months prior to the chest wall abscess, and had no preexisting disease. GAS bacteremia probably resulted from penetration of the skin following minor skin abrasion or trauma \\[4\\]. GAS is one of the most common human pathogens, and it can cause a variety of skin and soft-tissue infections, some of which are severe and even life-threatening \\[5\\]. We assumed that the patient developed GAS bacteremia in some manner, because of which the soft tissue around the fractured left fifth rib became infected. The fifth rib was located under the breast, so her initial presentation was breast swelling. Inflammatory breast cancer should be considered as a differential diagnosis of such swellings. However, breast cancer in our patient was excluded after the detection of pus and the absence of malignant cells on cytological examination. We also excluded breast abscess because the patient was not lactating, and the absence of inflammation in the left mammary gland was confirmed during surgery.\n\n【30】We performed a PubMed search of the English literature from 1966 to the present using the following keywords: chest, abscess, and blunt trauma. We also retrieved cases from the relevant reference lists. There were seven previous reports of primary chest wall abscess occurring after blunt chest trauma (Table 1) \\[2, 6–11\\]. Fractures were found in 4 of 8 cases. In five cases, the abscess appeared more than 2 months after the blunt trauma for reasons that remained unclear. The primary focus of infection remained unclear in six cases, and in five of these six cases, the pathogenic bacteria were indigenous skin bacteria. The treatment differed depending on the extent of infection.\n\n【31】Table 1 \n\n【32】Reported cases of primary chest wall abscess occurring after blunt chest trauma.\n\n【33】In summary, we report a case of primary chest wall abscess that developed after blunt chest trauma and initially mimicked a breast tumor. Because abscess formation was behind the mammary gland, breast tumor should be considered a differential diagnosis. Although the precise mechanism of this infection remained unclear, the patient’s condition improved without extensive debridement. If we had performed surgical debridement first, the patient would have been discharged earlier. In conclusion, this report suggests that chest wall abscess should be considered as a differential diagnosis when a patient presents with breast swelling and reports a history of blunt chest trauma.\n\n【34】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【35】The authors have no conflict of interests with regards to this paper.\n\n【36】#### Acknowledgment\n\n【37】This work was supported in part by the National Cancer Center Research and Development Fund (23-A-17).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Bronchoscopy was done, and a tumorous lesion obstructing right B6 was found. Biopsy of this lesion supported suspicions of sarcoma or spindle cell carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed that the mass extended to and obstructed the right main pulmonary artery. A skip lesion was also suspected in the periphery of pulmonary artery trunk. The tumor was removed by right pneumonectomy accompanied by resection of the main and left pulmonary arteries under cardiopulmonary bypass. The pulmonary artery trunk and the left pulmonary artery were reconstructed with a vascular graft. Collectively, intimal sarcoma originating from the right main pulmonary artery with extension into the right lung was diagnosed. Significant extension of pulmonary artery sarcoma into the lung, as was observed in the present case, is considered to be rare, and to our knowledge this is the first report in which the primary lesion was biopsied by bronchoscopy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sarcoma of the pulmonary artery (PAS) is a rare disease with about 200 cases reported so far in the literature \\[1, 2\\]. The prognosis is generally poor with a reported mean survival of about 20 months \\[1, 2\\]. In most cases, the lesion is confined to the vicinity of the main pulmonary artery. Here we report a case of PAS with significant extension into the right lung.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A female patient in her 30s was referred to our institution with a complaint of persistent cough. Chest radiography revealed a mass in the right middle lung field (Figure 1(a)). Noncontrast CT showed a mass approximately 8 centimeters in diameter with relatively smooth margins in the right lung segment 6 (Figure 1(b)). A malignant lung tumor was suspected and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was done. FDG accumulation was seen in the lung mass (standardized uptake value max. 3.6) as well as in the mediastinum suggesting a malignant lung tumor with mediastinal lymph node metastasis (Figure 1(c)). Bronchoscopy revealed a tumorous lesion obstructing right B6 (Figure 1(d)). Biopsy of this lesion showed proliferation of spindle cells raising suspicion of sarcoma or spindle cell carcinoma.\n\n【6】  \n**(a)**\n\n【7】  \n**(b)**\n\n【8】  \n**(c)**\n\n【9】  \n**(d)**\n\n【10】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【11】Figure 1 \n\n【12】(a) Chest radiography showing a mass in the right middle lung field.

(c) Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography showing accumulation in the right lung mass and in the lesion in the mediastinum. (d) On bronchoscopy, a whitish tumorous lesion was seen obstructing right B6 (arrow).\n\n【13】Next, contrast-enhanced CT was done, and it showed that the mediastinal lesion pointed out on FDG-PET/CT was actually a continuous extension of the lung mass into the right main pulmonary artery. A skip lesion was also suspected in the periphery of the pulmonary artery trunk (Figure 2).\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】  \n\n【16】Figure 2 \n\n【17】Contrast-enhanced CT showing obstruction of the right pulmonary artery (arrow). A skip lesion was also suspected in the periphery of the pulmonary artery trunk (arrowhead).\n\n【18】Lung ventilation-perfusion scan showed that the right lung was not perfused although sufficiently ventilated. On echocardiography, heart wall motion was intact and no signs of right heart failure were seen.\n\n【19】Collectively, a sarcomatous lung tumor with extension into the right pulmonary artery trunk or PAS with extension into the right lung was suspected. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor under cardiopulmonary bypass through a median sternotomy. The existence and localization of the skip lesion was first confirmed by transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography. Venous cannulas were placed in the right atrium and the femoral vein, and an arterial cannula was placed onto the femoral artery, and surgery was carried out with the heart beating. The left pulmonary artery was carefully dissected so as not to perturb the skip lesion and was clamped just proximal to the origin of left A3. Although the tumor filled the inside of the right pulmonary artery, its wall appeared to be intact from outside. Then the main pulmonary artery was incised just above the pulmonary valve and opened distally to expose the tumor. To remove all lesions, proximal portion of the left pulmonary artery together with the pulmonary artery trunk was resected. The left pulmonary artery was reconstructed with a 20 mm Gore-Tex vascular graft and the patient was separated from cardiopulmonary bypass. Following that, right pneumonectomy and total resection of the tumor were completed. Time on bypass was 2 hours and 11 minutes. Duration of operation was 9 hours and 9 minutes.\n\n【20】Grossly, the tumor seemed to arise in the large vessel of the pulmonary circulation and invade into the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma, especially in the S6 region (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). The tumor was diagnosed as intimal sarcoma and its histological findings, proliferation of atypical spindle or polygonal cells with high mitotic activity, were also compatible with the diagnosis (Figure 3(c)). The lesions were completely removed macroscopically. Further resection, particularly the distal portion of the left main pulmonary artery, was not considered to be feasible. However, the surgical margin of the left pulmonary artery was microscopically positive for tumor cells (Figure 3(d)). The patient was followed up without further treatment.\n\n【21】  \n**(a)**\n\n【22】  \n**(b)**\n\n【23】  \n**(c)**\n\n【24】  \n**(d)**\n\n【25】**(a)** **(b)** **(c)**   \n**(d)**\n\n【26】Figure 3 \n\n【27】(a) Gross finding showed the obstruction of the right main pulmonary artery by tumor tissue. (b) Transverse sections revealed a massive invasion of the tumor into the adjacent pulmonary parenchyma. (c) Histologically, tumor was consisting of spindle or polygonal-shaped atypical cell with high mitotic activity, compatible with intimal sarcoma. (d) At the margin of the left main pulmonary artery, pleomorphic tumor cells proliferated in the vascular intima (arrows).\n\n【28】Twelve months after surgery, recurrence in the right ventricular outflow tract was detected. Irradiation and proton therapy were done. The recurrence is without progression 2 months after detection.\n\n【29】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【30】Clinical diagnosis of PAS is considered to be difficult. Symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, chest or back pain, fever, or weight loss have been reported, but they are usually nonspecific. Previous reports have shown that the lesions are mostly confined to the vicinity of pulmonary artery trunk and are often initially diagnosed as pulmonary thromboembolisms. FDG-PET may be useful in differentiating pulmonary thromboembolism and PAS, but some reports indicate that PASs may not always show high FDG uptake \\[3, 4\\]. Case reports of EBUS-TBNA exist showing its effectiveness in the differential diagnosis \\[5, 6\\].\n\n【31】In the present case, a malignant lung tumor with mediastinal lymph node metastasis was initially suspected from noncontrast CT and FDG-PET/CT. To our knowledge, significant extension of PAS into the lung, as was observed in the present case, has not been previously reported. This is also the first report of PAS in which the primary lesion could be biopsied under bronchoscopy. The reason for this tumor extension is not clear. It is possible that in this particular case the primary lesion originated from the right main pulmonary artery rather than the pulmonary artery trunk. Since PASs are generally known to extend in the direction of blood flow \\[7\\], the lesion in the present case extended predominantly towards the periphery of the right pulmonary artery rather than towards the pulmonary artery trunk, and, because of this unilateral extension, the patient remained symptomless until a large tumor was formed in the right lung.\n\n【32】PAS may show a variety of histological differentiations such as leiomyosarcomas, angiosarcomas, malignant fibrous histiocytomas, and others but are mostly without differentiation. These are collectively termed intimal sarcomas, as is this case \\[1, 8\\]. Early diagnosis and surgical resection currently offer the best chance of prolonged survival for PAS. The efficacy of chemotherapy or radiotherapy for PAS still remains controversial \\[8, 9\\]. Therefore, adjuvant therapy was not done in this case although the surgical margin was positive. After the detection of recurrence, proton therapy was selected because the recurrence was localized, and we considered that the general condition of the patient would be best sustained by this treatment in comparison with systemic chemotherapy or reresection.\n\n【33】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【34】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Although it is rare, gynecomastia is a known finding in Graves’ disease and can be the presenting sign. Patients with unexplained gynecomastia or breast masses should be screened for thyrotoxicosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Graves’ disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The disease is characterized by a hyperthyroid state secondary to autoantibodies that bind to and activate thyrotropin receptors, leading to an increase in thyroid hormone production \\[1\\]. Patients of any age can be affected, however, the peak incidence is reported between the ages of 30 and 50 \\[2\\]. Common manifestations of Graves’ disease include weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, fatigue, tremors, and exophthalmos, occurring in more than 50% of patients \\[3\\]. Rare manifestations such as localized dermatopathy and thyroid acropachy (i.e., clubbing) have been reported in less than 1% of cases. Men may present with decreased libido or erectile dysfunction, and women may present with irregular menses \\[1\\]. In rare cases, findings may predominate in one organ system; isolated findings of diarrhea, anxiety, or gynecomastia (as in our case) may occur, distracting from the correct diagnosis. Gynecomastia is a common finding in hyperthyroidism, but it is rarely the presenting symptom \\[4\\]. We present a case of Graves’ disease with a less common presentation of a unilateral breast mass.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 37-year-old Caucasian male presented to the primary care clinic with the chief complaint of a tender right-sided breast mass. The patient also reported decreased appetite and a forty-pound weight loss over the preceding five months. The breast mass had been present for about six weeks and was not associated with galactorrhea. The patient denied any fevers or night sweats and denied taking any hormonal or nutritional supplements. There was no reported family history of breast cancer or endocrine disorder. During a physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits, and the patient was noted to be thin, with a BMI of 21.6. Breast examination revealed a one-centimeter-by-one-centimeter, tender, right-sided mass without nipple discharge. The thyroid gland was nonpalpable, and there was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.\n\n【6】Laboratory evaluation revealed TSH of 0.01 mIU/L (reference range 0.40–4.5 mIU/L) with free T4 3.3 ng/dL (reference 0.93–1.7 ng/dL) and total T3 335 ng/dL (reference 80–200 ng/dL). The thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level was noted to be >500 (normal <122%). Prolactin was found to be 7.2 ng/mL (reference range 4.0–15.2 ng/mL), and testosterone was noted to be 624 ng/dL (reference range 800–1080 ng/dL). A bilateral diagnostic mammogram revealed bilateral gynecomastia, right greater than left (Figure 1). A nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan was subsequently ordered, which showed the diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with homogenous increased uptake throughout, consistent with Graves’ disease.\n\n【7】  \n**(a)**\n\n【8】  \n**(b)**\n\n【9】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【10】Figure 1 \n\n【11】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the (a) right breast and (b) left breast showing flame-shaped subareolar densities consistent with gynecomastia.\n\n【12】On initial presentation, there was a high index of suspicion for breast cancer due to presenting symptoms of the right-sided breast mass associated with significant weight loss. The bilateral diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound were ordered for further workup of possible malignancy. Hyperthyroidism was also considered due to weight loss and palpitations; however, it was initially lower on differential diagnoses.\n\n【13】The patient was started on atenolol 25 mg daily upon laboratory diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. After confirmation of Graves’ disease on the thyroid uptake scan, the patient was referred to endocrinology. He was subsequently prescribed methimazole 10 mg twice daily.\n\n【14】After two months of treatment with twice daily methimazole, repeat bloodwork showed TSH 0.45 mIU/L (within normal limits), free T4 0.39 ng/dL (normal 0.93–1.7 ng/dL), and total T3 58 (normal 80–200). On repeat evaluation, the breast mass was no longer palpable, and the patient reported significantly improved energy levels and decreased palpitations. The weight of the patient, however, was unchanged. Over the last five years, multiple attempts at tapering off methimazole have been unsuccessful. He has been maintained on 5 mg methimazole daily with stable thyroid function labs. He has declined definitive therapy with radioactive iodine ablation.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Gynecomastia is defined as an enlargement in glandular tissue of the breast, which may present as unilateral or bilateral breast enlargement. This condition is commonly seen in patients with chronic liver disease and as a result of certain drugs \\[5\\]. Although it is rare, gynecomastia has been described as a common finding in hyperthyroid states, specifically in Graves’ disease \\[6\\]. As a cutaneous feature of thyrotoxicosis, gynecomastia can be seen in 10–40% of cases; however, it is rarely seen as the presenting feature of the disease. It has been reported as a presenting feature of hyperthyroidism in less than ten cases to date \\[7\\].\n\n【17】The development of gynecomastia involves an imbalance between free estrogen and free androgen actions in breast tissue. Breast tissue enlargement occurs when there is a relative increase in estrogen production. In hyperthyroid states, the increase in concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin binds testosterone more avidly than estrogen, leading to an increase in the concentration of bioavailable estrogen \\[6\\]. Treatment of hyperthyroidism with control of thyrotoxicosis results in resolution of gynecomastia \\[7\\].\n\n【18】Our patient presented with the chief complaint of a unilateral breast mass associated with forty-pound weight loss. This presentation was initially concerning to the patient and physician for breast cancer due to the predominant involvement of only one organ system. On further investigation with diagnostic mammogram, the patient was found to have bilateral gynecomastia. Laboratory work and thyroid uptake scan confirmed diagnosis of Graves’ disease.\n\n【19】It is important to keep a high index of suspicion for thyroid disease as hyperthyroid states may be deceiving in presenting with single organ system involvement. Although it is rare, gynecomastia is a known finding in Graves’ disease and can be the presenting sign. Patients with unexplained gynecomastia or breast masses should be screened for thyrotoxicosis \\[8\\].\n\n【20】#### Data Availability\n\n【21】No data were used to support the findings of this study.\n\n【22】#### Disclosure\n\n【23】This case report was completed as a part of employment of the authors at the University of Florida.\n\n【24】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【25】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Glaucoma is associated in 50% of the patients. Craniofacial and dental anomalies are frequently reported with ARS. The present study was designed as a multidisciplinary analysis of orthodontic, ophthalmologic, and genotypical features. A three-generation pedigree was ascertained through a family with ARS. Clinically, radiographic and genetic analyses were performed. Despite an identical genotype in all patients, the phenotype varies in expressivity of craniofacial and dental morphology. Screening for PITX2 and FOXC1 mutations by direct DNA-sequencing revealed a P64L missense mutation in PITX2 in all family members, supporting earlier reports that PITX2 is an essential factor in morphogenesis of teeth and craniofacial skeleton. Despite the fact that the family members had identical mutations, morphologic differences were evident. The concomitant occurrence of rare dental and craniofacial anomalies may be early diagnostic indications of ARS. Early detection of ARS and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) helps to prevent visual field loss.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome (ARS) (OMIM Nr.: 180500) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder (1  :  200000) with variable morphology characterized by malformations of the anterior segment of the eye such as Iris hypoplasia, iridocorneal adhesions, corectopia, polycoria, and embryotoxon posterius. Glaucoma is associated in 50% of the cases \\[1\\]. Craniofacial, dental, and umbilical anomalies are also regularly reported in connection with ARS \\[2, 3\\]. Characteristic craniofacial features are maxillary hypoplasia, hypertelorism, and telecanthus. Dental features include hypodontia/oligodontia of primary and permanent dentition, microdontia, short roots, taurodontism, and abnormally shaped teeth.\n\n【4】Other systemic features like anomalies of the pituitary gland, middle ear deafness, heart defects, hypospadia, short stature, and mental retardation were diagnosed in several ARS patients \\[1, 4, 5\\].\n\n【5】Three genetic loci have been associated with ARS so far. The genes _FOXC1_ and _PITX2_ encode transcription factors and are located on chromosomes 6p25 and 4q25, respectively. A third locus for ARS was mapped to chromosome 13q14 but the gene has not yet been identified. Therefore ARS has to be considered as a morphologically \\[1\\] and genetically \\[6\\] heterogeneous disorder.\n\n【6】In recent years there has been increasing focus on the clinical as well as a the molecular-genetic aspects of ARS. However, there is an absence of detailed description of the craniofacial and dental manifestations in patients with PITX2 mutation.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【8】In the present multidisciplinary clinical and genetic study of the pedigree four patients with ARS were examined by an ophthalmologist, a dentist, and an orthodontist.\n\n【9】A three-generation pedigree of the family members was constructed (Figure 1). All four patients were screened for mutations in PITX2 and FOXC1 by direct DNA sequencing \\[7\\].\n\n【10】  \n\n【11】  \n\n【12】Figure 1 \n\n【13】| Three-generation pedigree of the reported family. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】The craniofacial and dental examination of the patients involved lateral cephalometric radiographs and orthopantomograms. Analysis of plaster casts was made. The cephalograms were taken with the patients in a cephalostat with ear rods and a light source for adjustment of the head posture. The film-focus distance was 150 cm and the distance from the midsagittal plane to the film was 10 cm, resulting in an enlargement factor of 15%. Angular and linear measurements were made from each cephalogram. The position of the maxilla and mandible Was analyzed by the respective SNA and SNB angles. The skeletal configuration was defined by the Wits appraisal (the AB/Occlusal Plane angle). A metric analysis was done for the length of the maxilla and the mandible. The calibrated cephalometric results were compared to standards of a mean population group by Rakosi \\[8\\].\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【16】All four family members showed a sella turcica bridge combined with a prominent posterior clinoid process followed by a steep clivus and an elongated sella turcica, described by Meyer-Marcotty et al. \\[9\\].\n\n【17】##### 3.1. DNA Analysis\n\n【18】Sequence analysis revealed a variant in the _PITX2_ gene. Our four patients were found to have a heterozygous C to T transition at nucleotide position 774. This missense change P64L has already been described in ARS \\[10\\].\n\n【19】##### 3.2. Patient Reports\n\n【20】###### 3.2.1. Patient 1\n\n【21】_Patient’s History_  \nThe patient is 51 years old and a female. ARS was diagnosed at the age of 28 due to impaired vision by the patient herself.\n\n【22】_Ophthalmologic and General Examination_  \nThe patient presented with embryotoxon posterius, iridocorneal adhesions, and hypoplasia of the iris with the sphincter muscle visible in both eyes (Figure 2). She suffers from glaucoma with a visual field loss of Stage II according to Aulhorn stage classification \\[11\\]. The highest recorded intraocular pressure (IOPmax) was 36 mmHg in the right eye and 20 mmHg in the left eye. The patient has a protuberant umbilicus.\n\n【23】  \n\n【24】  \n\n【25】Figure 2 \n\n【26】| Embryotoxon posterius ( ↑ ) and hypoplasia of the iris in patient 1. |\n| --- |\n\n【27】_Dental and Craniofacial Findings_  \nThe patient's dental history revealed agenesis unspecified teeth as well as a conspicuous conical shape of the upper permanent incisors. No orthodontic treatment had been undertaken in the past. After additional loss of permanent teeth removable partial dentures were incorporated in the upper and lower jaw.  \nExtraoral examination of the patient showed a pronounced retrusive lip profile.  \nCephalometric analysis indicated skeletal Class III malformation due to severe maxillary retrognathia. Metric analysis of the jaws showed a highly shortened maxilla (micrognathia). The measurements of the mandible were in normative range (Table 1).\n\n【28】Table 1 \n\n【29】Cephalometric parameters of the four reported patients.

There is no record of elevated IOP. The patient has a protuberant umbilicus.\n\n【33】_Dental and Craniofacial Findings_  \nOrthopantomograms taken at the age of 11 years 3 months and 16 years 6 months were available for examination. Agenesis of the upper lateral incisors, taurodontism, microdontia as well a crown hypoplasia of the upper central incisors was present (Figure 3). According to her sister a significant tendency for root resorption was evident after orthodontic treatment.  \nThe cephalometric analysis showed parameters in normative range (Table 1).\n\n【34】  \n\n【35】  \n\n【36】Figure 3 \n\n【37】| OTP (11 years 3 months) showing agenesis of the upper lateral incisors, taurodontism of the molars, and microdontia with crown hypoplasia of the upper central incisors and congenital missing 18 and 28 in patient 2. |\n| --- |\n\n【38】###### 3.2.3. Patient 3\n\n【39】_Patient’s History_  \nThis 26-year-old female patient suffers from ARS-related ocular hypertension. Her condition was diagnosed at the age of 17 when she went for an examination to an ophthalmologist because of diminished vision which she noticed herself.\n\n【40】_Ophthalmologic and General Examination_  \nAn ophthalmologic examination identified embryotoxon posterius, iridocorneal adhesions, corectopia, and hypoplasia of the iris visible in both eyes (Figure 4). IOPmax was 35 mmHg in both eyes and medical regulation proved to be sufficient. There is no loss of visual field evident up to date.

Besides agenesis of the second premolars of the upper and lower jaw, the upper lateral incisors were not present. Moreover, a very rare agenesis of the upper left canine was evident (Figure 5(a)).  \nAfter correction of the skeletal Class III relationship by means of combined orthodontic-orthognathic therapy the orthopantomogram showed a tendency for root resorption on almost any tooth with a significant reduction of half of the root length of the lower incisors and the lower first molars (Figure 5(b)).  \nThe pretherapeutical cephalometric analysis at 15 years of age revealed a normal sagittal position of the mandible (Table 1). In contrast, the maxilla showed a significant retrognathia resulting in a severe skeletal Class III relationship (Figure 6).

The patient has a protuberant umbilicus (Figure 7).\n\n【58】  \n\n【59】  \n\n【60】Figure 7 \n\n【61】| Protuberant umbilicus in patient 4. |\n| --- |\n\n【62】_Dental and Craniofacial Findings_  \nOrthopantomograms taken at the age of 6 years 4 months and 18 years were available for examination. Besides agenesis of the lower right second premolar, the orthopantomogram showed a very rare instance of two missing upper molars (Figure 8(a)). The comparison of the developmental stages between the upper and lower teeth indicated agenesis of the upper first molars. Moreover, taurodontism of the upper and lower molars with variable degree was evident, as well as a paraplasia on the distal aspect of the upper third molar root (Figure 8(b)).  \nThe patient showed conical shaped lateral and central incisors and hypoplastic molar crowns.  \nThe cephalometric measurement revealed a severe skeletal Class III, as seen by a decreased SNA angle combined with a normative SNB. Metric analysis of the jaws showed a shortened maxilla, and an almost normative long mandible (Table 1).\n\n【63】  \n**(a)**\n\n【64】  \n**(b)**\n\n【65】**(a)**   \n**(b)**\n\n【66】Figure 8 \n\n【67】| (a) OPT (6 years and 4 months) showing agenesis of upper molars in patient 4.

Review of the Literature\n\n【69】In twelve published case reports \\[2, 12–22\\] descriptions of the dental and craniofacial phenotype of 17 ARS patients who were examined by an ophthalmologist and a dentist are given.\n\n【70】When the four cases examined in the present study are included, 21 patients have been evaluated up to now.\n\n【71】All the patients presented with hypodontia. These findings were documented in either the primary or permanent dentition depending on the age of the patient.\n\n【72】In 15 out of the 21 cases a detailed description of agenesis of permanent teeth was available. In the remaining 6 cases only the total number of missing teeth was reported, ranging from 3 to as many as 20. The teeth most frequently missing were the upper lateral incisors as well as the upper and lower second premolars. Other teeth whose absence was reported were central incisors, canines, first premolars, and first and second molars. Teeth of the upper jaw tended to be missing more frequently (Figures 9 and 10).\n\n【73】  \n\n【74】  \n\n【75】Figure 9 \n\n【76】| Frequency of agenesis of permanent upper teeth in 15 patients with ARS and hypodontia. |\n| --- |\n\n【77】  \n\n【78】  \n\n【79】Figure 10 \n\n【80】| Frequency of agenesis of permanent lower teeth in 15 patients with ARS and hypodontia. |\n| --- |\n\n【81】Data on congenital absence of primary teeth were available in 11 out of 21 cases. The teeth most often absent were the upper and lower deciduous incisors, missing in 40% and 18% of the patients, respectively.\n\n【82】Microdontia has been observed in 17 patients. In 6 patients only maxillary teeth were affected, in 11 patients teeth in both jaws were hypoplastic. Three patients displayed generalized microdontia of all teeth. The teeth series most often affected was the upper and lower incisors, followed by premolars, canines, and molars. Other dental anomalies reported included taurodontism, enamel hypoplasia, short roots, paraplasia, and delayed eruption.\n\n【83】Maxillary hypoplasia was present in 19 out of 21 patients (90.5%), resulting in a Class III facial profile combined with a flat midface, concave facial profile, receding upper lip, or prominent lower lip.\n\n【84】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【85】Axenfeld-Rieger Syndrome is a very rare condition. Thus, the number of patients studied is limited. In addition, this disease shows morphologic variability in terms of frequency and expression of associated anomalies \\[1, 5, 6\\]. Therefore, a detailed presentation of dental and craniofacial anomalies in patients with ARS is necessary. In our previous study of 26 patients with ARS and glaucoma or ocular hypertension, dentofacial anomalies were evident in 27% of the patients \\[3\\]. This is consistent with the studies by Shields et al. \\[1\\] and Ozeki et al. \\[5\\] on 24 and 21 patients with ARS, respectively.\n\n【86】Our patients show a missense mutation in the PITX2 gene. PITX2 is a transcription factor controlling the expression of other genes during development. This factor is essential for correct differentiation and migration of cells developing tissues and organs. Expression of PITX2 in mice has been found in periocular mesenchyme, maxillary, mandibular and dental epithelia, umbilicus, Rathke’s pouch, and vitelline vessels \\[23\\].\n\n【87】PITX2 has been identified as an activator of the Dlx2 gene that is also expressed in maxillary and mandibular and dental epithelia. Dlx2 is part of the “odontogenic homeobox code” essential for tooth and craniofacial development \\[24\\]. Therefore dental anomalies in ARS patients can be explained by PITX2 mutation \\[25\\]. Depending on the transactivation ability of a PITX2 mutant different phenotypes from mild Iris hypoplasia to the whole spectrum of ARS including severe dental and craniofacial anomalies have been observed \\[26\\].\n\n【88】In normal Caucasian population hypodontia occurs in males with an incidence of 4.6%, in females of 6.3%, respectively \\[26\\]. The teeth most often absent are the lower second premolars followed by the upper lateral incisors and the upper second premolars with a frequency of 1.5%–3.1% \\[27\\]. By contrast, all of our ARS patients presented with hypodontia. Moreover, two of the siblings exhibited very rare types of tooth agenesis, such as of an upper canine in patient 3 and of upper molars in patient 4, respectively.\n\n【89】Microdontia also seems to be a characteristic finding in ARS \\[2\\]. In all of our patients a conical shape of the upper central incisors was reported. Additionally, in patient 4 microdontic lower molars were found which is a very rare condition in general population with an incidence of 0.1%–0.4% \\[27\\].\n\n【90】Taurodontism occurs in approximately 0.3% of the white European population \\[27\\]. In patient 4 all molars were affected. This finding supports the hypothesis of previous reports that taurodontism is one of the characteristic dental anomalies in ARS \\[2, 5\\].\n\n【91】The observed root resorption in two of the siblings may indicate a higher risk of root resorption in ARS patients during orthodontic treatment.\n\n【92】The four presented cases underwent cephalometric analysis in order to evaluate the craniofacial morphology.\n\n【93】Three of the patients exhibited a severe skeletal Class III malocclusion caused by maxillary retrognathia associated with a shortened maxilla. In contrast, mandibular position was in an almost normal range.\n\n【94】The extent of skeletal Class III in our ARS patients was similar to the severity of hypodontia and other dental anomalies. Patient 3 with an agenesis of seven permanent teeth exhibited the most distinctive dysgnathia, whereas patient 2 with agenesis of the upper lateral incisors exhibited almost orthognathic jaw relationships. Drum et al. \\[14\\] concluded that an alveolar hypoplasia resulting from missing teeth contributes to a maxillary deficiency. In the present study it seems that the number of missing teeth may play a certain role in the extent of maxillary hypoplasia. However, the reduced maxillary length deficiency seen in our ARS patients is not exclusively limited to the alveolar region but also is evident in the maxillary base. Therefore, maxillary hypoplasia may not completely be explained by the number of congenitally absent teeth. It can be assumed that additional craniofacial factors may influence maxillary growth in ARS patients. Childers and Wright \\[2\\] also hypothesied that midface hypoplasia associated with ARS is a combination of skeletal and dentoalveolar factors.\n\n【95】Early diagnosis of ARS and control of IOP is essential to prevent visual impairment. Ophthalmologists, paediatricians, dentists, and orthodontists have to be aware that ARS is an inherited autosomal dominant anomaly and therefore all family members have to be screened as early as possible. Despite this fact, ARS frequently is diagnosed late. Even hypoplasia of the iris, visible without special instruments, does not reduce the mean age at diagnosis \\[3\\]. In addition, two of the patients included in this study were diagnosed only after symptoms of elevated IOP were noticed by the patients themselves.\n\n【96】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【97】Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome is a very rare disorder with genetic and morphologic variability. The concomitant occurrence of rare dental and craniofacial anomalies in these patients, such as hypoplasia of the central incisors, rare types of tooth agenesis such as an upper canine or upper molars associated with maxillary retrognathia, and a skeletal Class III may be indications of ARS. Early detection of ARS and measuring potentially elevated intraocular pressure helps physicians to prevent visual field loss.\n\n【98】The data used in this report are based on the dissertation “Phänotyp und Genotyp des Axenfeld- Rieger- Syndroms” by P.

{"seq_id": "5642570f-d880-42a2-8b42-8dc49dac6c23", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma-cell disorder that primarily involves the bone marrow, but extramedullary involvement is becoming increasingly common (Bladé et al., 2012) both at initial presentation and follow-up. Most common initial presentations for multiple myeloma include generalized fatigue, renal insufficiency, bone pain, and recurrent bacterial infections. We present a case of a healthy 55-year-old man that presented to the emergency department with a three-week history of anorexia and jaundice without any past medical history. Patient’s initial labs were significant for hyperbilirubinemia and elevated liver function enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT). Additional laboratory workup was significant for mild hypercalcemia and increased protein gap. MRI and ERCP suggested primary sclerosing cholangitis but were not diagnostic. Liver biopsy illustrated plasma-cell infiltration and bone marrow biopsy diagnosed multiple myeloma with extramedullary disease. Patient was started on dexamethasone, bortezomib, and cyclophosphamide, but, despite this aggressive regimen, the patient continued to decline. We take this opportunity to present this atypical presentation of a common hematological malignancy and review the associated literature.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Multiple myeloma accounts for one percent of human cancers, almost two percent of cancer deaths, and 12–15% of all hematological cancers \\[1\\]. It is a neoplastic plasma-cell disorder that involves clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in bone marrow, monoclonal protein in the blood or urine, and involved organs. Myeloma is thought to arise from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined clinical significance that progresses to smoldering myeloma and, finally, to symptomatic myeloma \\[1–3\\]. Genetic abnormalities change the expression of adhesion molecules on myeloma cells that allows malignant cells to escape regulatory mechanisms and proliferate autonomously \\[1, 2, 4\\].\n\n【4】The diagnosis requires presence of 30% monoclonal bone marrow plasma cells and most common initial presentations include anemia (73%), bony lesions (80%), and renal impairment (20–40%) \\[1\\]. Although multiple myeloma is a malignancy that predominantly affects bone marrow and bone, involvement of extraosseous tissues like spleen and liver is a relatively frequent postmortem finding \\[4–6\\]. The reported incidence of liver involvement in myeloma has been reported to be in the range of 26% to 46% in autopsy studies \\[7\\]. Nevertheless, the incidence of premortem clinical manifestations like hepatomegaly or ascites is much lower. Jaundice is an exceptionally rare way of presentation for myeloma and can be due to several causes: postobstructive to infiltration \\[8–10\\]. We report a case of a 55-year-old man who presented with jaundice and abdominal pain as the initial clinical manifestations of multiple myeloma.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 55-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with a three-week history of jaundice, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and bloody stools. He also complained of generalized fatigue and anorexia for the previous two months. He denied history of heavy alcohol use, liver disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. He also denied history of allergies and was not on any medication at home. On physical examination he was afebrile and icteric, but there were no other stigmata of chronic liver disease. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were normal. Laboratory studies showed white blood cell count of 7.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L with plasma cells noted on the peripheral blood smear, hemoglobin level of 13.1 g/dL, and platelet count of 95 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, total bilirubin of 10 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 218 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 96 IU/L, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 47 IU/L. His total protein was 7.7 g/dL, albumin level was 2.4 g/dL, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 82 mm/hour. Prothrombin time (14.1 sec) and INR (1.1) were normal. Serum creatinine was also normal (0.9 mg/dL), but his corrected calcium was elevated at 11.2 mg/dL. HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C antibodies and autoimmune antibodies were negative.\n\n【7】Chest radiography did not demonstrate any focal pulmonary or bony abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound was significant for hepatosplenomegaly, contracted gallbladder, and hepatic steatosis. Due to patient’s persistent increase in total bilirubin, abdominal MRI was done to evaluate hepatobiliary pathology. Abdominal MRI did not reveal any sign of hepatocellular carcinoma but suggested a chronic intrinsic liver disease with possible sclerosing cholangitic etiology due to presence of focal segmental dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts at the junction of segments IVa and VIII and beading of the right intrahepatic bile duct (Figure 4).\n\n【8】Subsequently, the patient underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and colonoscopy to rule out primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease. EGD revealed Grade I esophageal varices with normal gastric and duodenal mucosa. ERCP was significant for small intrahepatic ducts with pruning without any obvious beading or ductal stones/debris (Figure 5). Furthermore, colonoscopy was negative for any sign of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【9】Lastly, the patient underwent liver biopsy which identified neoplastic plasma cells filling the sinusoids of the liver and a bone marrow biopsy that was diagnostic for multiple myeloma (90% kappa light chain restricted plasma cells with 95% cellularity). Serum protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Immunoglobulin quantification was IgA 2112 mg/dL, IgG 225 mg/dL, and IgM 21 mg/dL. Flow cytometry revealed predominantly kappa light chains (11.1) in serum along with lambda light chain of 0.62, kappa/lambda ratio of 17.9, urine M-spike of 2.3, LDH 725, and B2-microglobulin 7.54. FISH analysis was significant for gain of 1q21, t(4; 14), (p16; q32), gain of 15q22, and 17p13 deletion. His disease stage was III according to the International Staging System for multiple myeloma. Upon diagnosis, the patient was started on dexamethasone, bortezomib, and cyclophosphamide; however, his condition continued to deteriorate rapidly with persistent rise in bilirubin, ALP, AST, and ALT. Unfortunately, after three cycles of chemotherapy the patient developed septic shock with encephalopathy and died two weeks later.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Patients with multiple myeloma present mostly with complaints of generalized fatigue, recurrent bacterial infection, weight loss, hematuria, or back pain but rarely of jaundice \\[1, 11\\]. The neoplastic plasma cells in multiple myeloma produce monoclonal light chains that frequently deposit in kidney, heart, peripheral nerves, and liver \\[4\\]. Although liver is the second most common organ after kidney to be affected by light chains, most of the patients remain asymptomatic and have mild elevations of liver enzymes early in the disease process \\[6, 12\\].\n\n【12】Myeloma presenting as jaundice has been reported in literature but the majority of these cases have been due to hepatic amyloid deposition or extrahepatic biliary tract obstruction secondary to abdominal plasmacytoma or pancreatic head myeloma; few cases of liver dysfunction due to plasma-cell infiltration have been reported \\[8–10\\]. Our patient presented with complaints of anorexia and jaundice without any complaints of back/bone pain, hematuria, or renal failure. Diagnosis was not immediately obvious as patient had severe cholestasis with MRI and ERCP findings suggestive of primary sclerosing cholangitis (Figures 4 and 5).\n\n【13】Our case is unique as it highlights a rare presentation for multiple myeloma as obstructive jaundice. Patient denied any symptoms suggestive of multiple myeloma. Admission labs did not reveal anemia or renal insufficiency but were significant for thrombocytopenia, abnormal liver function tests, mild hypercalcemia, and increased protein gap. Abdominal MRI and ERCP were suggestive of sclerosing cholangitic etiology. Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in patients with liver disease and increased protein gap can be seen in several diseases ranging from autoimmune to infectious ones \\[13\\]. Furthermore, primary sclerosing cholangitis may manifest with IgM hypergammaglobulinemia \\[14\\]. Since ERCP was nondiagnostic, liver biopsy was obtained (Figures 1–3) that led to bone marrow biopsy and, ultimately, to the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Though the patient was diagnosed in a timely manner, after presentation, chemotherapy course did not alter the course of disease. With extensive extramedullary disease, our patient did not respond favorably to chemotherapy regimen and continued to deteriorate clinically. The patient developed septic shock with encephalopathy and died two weeks later.\n\n【14】  \n\n【15】  \n\n【16】Figure 1 \n\n【17】High power image of liver demonstrating sinusoids packed with atypical plasma cells.\n\n【18】  \n\n【19】  \n\n【20】Figure 2 \n\n【21】Kappa light chain restriction of the intrasinusoidal plasma cells.\n\n【22】  \n\n【23】  \n\n【24】Figure 3 \n\n【25】Positive Staining of intrasinusoidal plasma cells for CD138.\n\n【26】  \n\n【27】  \n\n【28】Figure 4 \n\n【29】ERCP showing pruning of the biliary tree.\n\n【30】  \n\n【31】  \n\n【32】Figure 5 \n\n【33】MRCP significant for right intrahepatic beading.\n\n【34】Incidence of extramedullary disease in multiple myeloma ranges from 7% to 20% on initial presentation \\[4, 10, 15, 16\\]. Most common site for extramedullary disease on diagnosis appears to be skin/soft tissues; however, on follow-up liver seems to be involved more than any other organ \\[4, 15, 16\\]. Overall, patients with extramedullary disease tend to have more aggressive disease course, with shorter progression-free survival and overall survival \\[16\\]. Once liver failure is established the prognosis is poor and patient progresses rapidly through jaundice, coagulopathy, and encephalopathy \\[5\\]. Though current novel agents have increased overall survival of patients to more than ten years, the biologic and genetic features of multiple myeloma play a crucial role in treatment. Patients with high risk chromosomal aberrations and extramedullary disease, like our patient, have poor prognosis. The current diagnostic criteria and staging method for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients are listed as below.\n\n【35】_Diagnostic Criteria and Staging System for Multiple Myeloma \\[1\\]_\n\n【36】_Diagnostic Criteria_. They include at least 10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells, serum, or urinary monoclonal protein.\n\n【37】Myeloma-related organ dysfunction (CRAB criteria) is as follows: hypercalcemia (serum calcium > 11.5 mg/dL (2.88 mmol/liter)); renal insufficiency (serum creatinine > 2 mg/dL (177 umol/liter)); anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or >2 g/dL below the lower limit of the normal range); bone disease (lytic lesions, severe osteopenia, or pathologic fracture).\n\n【38】_Staging_. The International Staging System is as follows: Stage I: serum B2-microglobulin < 3.5 mg/liter, serum albumin > 3.5 g/dL; Stage II: serum B2-microglobulin < 3.5 mg/liter plus serum albumin <3.5 g/dL or serum B2-microglobulin 3.5 to <5.5 mg/liter regardless of serum albumin level; Stage III: serum B2-microglobulin > 5.5 mg/liter.\n\n【39】Soft-tissue plasmacytomas in multiple myeloma can arise either through direct extension from skeletal tumors or via hematogenous metastatic spread \\[2, 4\\]. It is hypothesized that extramedullary spread may be due to decreased expression of adhesion molecules allowing plasma cells to escape bone marrow \\[4\\]. Liver infiltration by plasma cells seems to manifest in two distinct patterns: diffuse (sinusoidal, portal, or mixed) and nodular \\[11, 12\\]; however, the origin of plasma cells in liver is obscure. These cells could be from bone marrow or may have originated and proliferated locally from the reticuloendothelial sites \\[12\\]. Only observational data are available \\[2\\].\n\n【40】Myeloma patients generally have elevated liver enzymes, especially alkaline phosphatase due to heavy plasmacytic infiltration of hepatic tissue \\[6\\]. However, elevations of liver enzymes do not correlate with the presence of histologic lesion \\[12\\]. Observational studies have shown higher LDH, ALP, CRP, and IL-6 levels with extensive liver involvement in patients with multiple myeloma. However, one cannot simply hold multiple myeloma accountable for elevated liver enzymes in patients with multiple myeloma. The risk of liver dysfunction due to fatty infiltration, hepatocellular necrosis, hemosiderosis, or granulomata is not more increased in multiple myeloma than any other hematological disease \\[12\\].\n\n【41】Current research is actively exploring genetic abnormalities involved in extramedullary disease as it is associated with decreased overall survival and absence of novel agents specifically for extramedullary disease \\[4\\]. Certain translocations, t(14; 16) and t(14; 20), along with mutations of k-ras and deletions of 17p have already been linked with extramedullary disease involvement. Hopefully, with gene expression profiling, specific extramedullary disease genes can be identified that could become target for treatment modality \\[1, 16\\].\n\n【42】Currently, management guidelines do not revolve around extramedullary disease but are circled mostly around the age of the patient and disease activity. Patients under 65 years of age with active disease are started immediately on induction therapy with thalidomide, lenalidomide, or bortezomib plus hematopoietic stem-cell transplant. Patients between 65 and 75 years of age, based on comorbidities, are considered for reduced-dose intensity autologous transplantation. However, patients older than 75 years are rarely considered for stem-cell transplant and therapy dosage is usually reduced \\[1\\].\n\n【43】#### Conflict of Interests\n\n【44】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
