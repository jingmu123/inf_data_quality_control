Introduction\n\n【3】First described in 1998 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, Russell body gastritis (RBG) is a rare inflammatory condition characterized by abundant intramucosal polyclonal plasma cells, which contain intracytoplasmic, eosinophilic globules of immunoglobulins (Russell bodies) that displace the nucleus, with an accompanying chronic inflammatory infiltrate. It usually occurs in the gastric antrum, but two cases of Russell body duodenitis have been recently described. Herein, we report an unusual case of Barrett esophagus with prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and Russell bodies, which expands the current spectrum of Russell body gastritis/duodenitis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 69-year-old male with a history of Barrett esophagus (6 cm length of involvement) underwent an ablation procedure, which resulted in a residual 1–1.5 cm band of Barrett mucosa  that was separated from the gastroesophageal junction by endoscopically unremarkable squamous mucosa. Two years later, biopsies from the residual band of Barrett mucosa showed intestinal metaplasia with active inflammation and numerous monomorphic cells in the lamina propria with eccentric nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm . The monomorphic cells were highlighted by a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain and immunohistochemical studies for CD79a, kappa, and lambda . There was no immunoreactivity with pan-cytokeratins (AE1/AE3). This immunohistochemical profile supported that these cells were polyclonal plasma cells, as seen in Russell body gastritis (RBG). The Barrett mucosa was called indefinite for dysplasia due to active inflammation.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy): a residual 1–1.5 cm band of salmon-pink Barrett mucosa separated from the gastroesophageal junction by endoscopically unremarkable squamous mucosa. |\n| --- |\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Hematoxylin and eosin, 20x.

Discussion\n\n【19】Russell body gastritis/duodenitis is an unusual form of chronic gastrointestinal mucosal inflammation, characterized by abundant plasma cells containing eosinophilic cytoplasmic globules. Russell bodies represent a cellular response to overstimulation of plasma cells, leading to the accumulation of abundant, nondegradable, condensed immunoglobulin in dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum cisternae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Plasma cells filled with abundant intracytoplasmic Russell bodies are called Mott cells, which can be seen in disease states characterized by plasmacytosis and chronic inflammation, such as chronic follicular gastritis, autoimmune-mediated diseases such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and rheumatoid arthritis, and hematopoietic tumors with plasmacytic differentiation, such as MALT lymphoma, plasmacytoma, or lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Mott cells are extremely rare in epithelial tumors. In gastrointestinal mucosal plasmacytic infiltrates, the absence of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, lymphoepithelial lesions, and monoclonal infiltrates, favors a benign, reactive process, such as chronic inflammation.\n\n【20】Including our current case, there are 24 reported cases of Russell body gastritis, duodenitis, and Barrett esophagitis in the English medical literature  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–22\\]</u>. The mean age of affected patients in these reports is 61 years (range 34–88 years), with a male-to-female ratio of 2.4 : 1. Most patients presented with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, nausea, and dyspepsia. Endoscopic features were likewise non-specific, including mucosal erythema, edema, erosion, ulceration, or, rarely, raised nodules. Biopsy specimens from all cases showed active chronic inflammation with either focal or diffuse accumulation of plasma cells containing Russell bodies. Of the 20 gastric cases, 12 showed evidence of Helicobacter pylori infection; all 4 extragastric (duodenal and esophageal) cases were H. pylori negative. Other associated conditions included HIV infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11, 16, 20\\]</u>, ethanol abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>, gastric carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 19\\]</u>, Barrett esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and concurrent Hepatitis C infection and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Table 1 \n\n【22】Reported cases of Russell body gastritis, duodenitis, and Barrett esophagus.\n\n【23】While plasmacytic infiltrates are the hallmark of gastric chronic inflammation, plasma cells containing Russell bodies are rare in Helicobacter pylori\\-associated gastritis. It is hypothesized that chronic Helicobacter infection stimulates plasma cell-driven hyperproduction of immunoglobulins, which leads to Russell body formation and Mott cell proliferation. The highly pathogenic Helicobacter pylori genotypes vacA and cagA may also be associated with RBG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. The disappearance of Russell bodies following successful Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy also supports the etiopathogenic role of the organism in RBG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15\\]</u>. In 2006, Stewart and Spagnola reported three cases of Helicobacter\\-associated gastritis with crystalline plasma cell inclusions, which may represent another morphologic manifestation of immunoglobulin accumulation in response to chronic gastritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【24】While RGB is usually a benign incidental finding associated with Helicobacter infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 11\\]</u>, it has also been described in association with gastric tubular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> and signet ring cell 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> adenocarcinoma. Russell bodies are actually more frequently seen in normal tissues adjacent to malignant processes compared to benign conditions, which suggests a possible association between malignancy and Russell body formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Coexistence of gastric carcinoma and RBG is not entirely unexpected, given the frequent association between RBG and chronic Helicobacter infection—an established risk factor for gastric cancer.\n\n【25】In 2010, Shinozaki et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> reported two cases of lymphoepithelioma-type, EBV-associated gastric carcinoma with extensive lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and prominent Mott cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. EBER in situ hybridization highlighted the tumor cells obscured by the Mott cell proliferations, and the authors postulated that aberrant chemokine expression in the EBV-driven tumors led to plasma cell activation and subsequent Russell body formation and Mott cell proliferation. Although both cases also showed evidence of H. pylori infection, the Mott cell proliferations were confined to the mucosa involved by the tumors and were not seen in the background mucosa; thus, RBG was excluded.\n\n【26】Russell body duodenitis has recently been reported in two patients: a 55-year-old HIV-infected male 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> and a 69-year-old female 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> with autoimmune disease. In both cases, the Russell body infiltrates and chronic inflammation occurred in areas of duodenal gastric metaplasia and, notably, in the absence of demonstrable Helicobacter infection. In this setting, Russell body duodenitis may represent either the residual sequela of healed or partiallytreated gastric Helicobacter infection or an abnormal response to disordered systemic immune responses. In 2005, Rubio described Mott cells in Barrett esophagus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. To our knowledge, the current case is the second reported case of RBG in Barrett esophagus. Regardless of anatomic location, it is likely that chronic inflammation causes aberrant chemokine expression, resulting in overstimulation of plasma cells, excessive immunoglobulin production, and subsequent Russell body formation.\n\n【27】RBG represents a potential diagnostic pitfall because the distended plasma cells may be mistaken for signet ring tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The plasma cells in RBG, however, lack nuclear atypia, mucicarmine, and cytokeratin expression. The periodic acid-Schiff reaction may help identify Russell bodies by conferring a dense, glassy stain to intracytoplasmic immunoglobulins. Plasma cell markers, such as CD138 and CD79a, and concomitant kappa and lambda light chain expression will demonstrate the polyclonal nature of the plasma cell infiltrate. Associated gastric carcinoma and infectious agents, such as Helicobacter and Candida, may alter patient management and clinical outcome and therefore should be excluded by ancillary studies.\n\n【28】The differential diagnosis for plasma cell infiltrates in the lamina propria of the luminal gastrointestinal tract including plasma cell neoplasms, such as plasmacytoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation. Benign Mott cell proliferations can be distinguished from hematopoietic malignancies by the absence of cellular atypia, mitotic activity, and monoclonality. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and PCR for immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangements aid in the evaluation of clonality.\n\n【29】The management of RBG involves Helicobacter eradication therapy and exclusion of associated conditions, including other infectious agents and gastric carcinoma.\n\n【30】In conclusion, we report the second case of Barrett esophagus with prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and Russell bodies, which expands the current spectrum of Russell body gastritis/duodenitis. Given the various anatomic locations in which Russell body gastritis may arise, we suggest that “Russell body gastroenteritis” may be a more appropriate designation for this uncommon reactive condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We report an unusual case, in which a 55-year-old woman with Sheehan's syndrome got worse symptoms after spontaneous labor. In 1998, she had severe postpartum hemorrhage and pituitary necrosis during the third delivery, thus it was diagnosed as Sheehan’s syndrome by clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and magnetic resonance imaging. She was treated by replacement therapy including hydrocortisone and levothyroxine sodium. However, she had the fourth spontaneous pregnancy in 2000 and got worse symptoms after delivery. We carefully concluded that pregnancy provided no evidence against the diagnosis of Sheehan’s syndrome because pregnancy might improve hypopituitarism by stimulating the pituitary remnant to undergo hyperplasia and irritating the placenta to secrete hormone. However, pregnancy might aggravate the symptoms by inducing autoimmunity as well. All in all, early diagnosis and adequate medical treatment are important to provide a good prognosis of Sheehan’s syndrome.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sheehan’s syndrome, which is pituitary necrosis after severe postpartum hemorrhage and hypovolemia, may cause hypopituitarism either immediately or after a delay of several years, depending on the degree of tissue destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. 40 years ago, it was estimated that the prevalence of Sheehan’s syndrome was about 100–200 per 1,000,000 women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In 2009, a retrospective nationwide investigation in Iceland reported that the prevalence of Sheehan’s syndrome was estimated to be 5.1 per 100,000 women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, the pathogenesis of Sheehan’s syndrome is still uncertain. Enlargement of pituitary gland, autoimmunity, small sella size, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) have been considered as important factors in the pathogenesis of Sheehan’s syndrome. The clinical manifestation of Sheehan’s syndrome varied from nonspecific symptoms like weakness, anemia, and fatigue to severe pituitary dysfunction resulting in coma and even death. Medical history of postpartum hemorrhage, failure to lactate, and cessation of menses are helpful clues to the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Early diagnosis and adequate medical treatment are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality of the disease.\n\n【4】The aim of this report is to describe a female patient who had the fourth spontaneous pregnancy after the appearance of postpartum hemorrhage and pituitary necrosis of the third delivery, and to critically focus on the symptoms getting worse after the fourth delivery in Sheehan’s syndrome. This case report was conducted in accordance with the appropriate clinical and experimental ethical guidelines and was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. The case was reported with informed consent from the patient and her relatives.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Description\n\n【6】The patient, a 55-year-old woman, was admitted to our hospital on February 3rd, 2012. Her chief complaint was repeated consciousness obstacle over two years. She had been in good health with normal menstrual cycles until her third delivery in 1988. She started to get mild hypofunction of gonad, thyroid, and adrenal cortex after severe postpartum hemorrhage. Unfortunately, owing to the limited medical resources in her hometown, she was not diagnosed as Sheehan’s syndrome and did not receive enough professional treatment. Her menstrual periods prolonged (about 40–50 days) with little volume and short duration. In 1990, she conceived naturally for the fourth time but the symptoms got worse after delivery, especially in recent years. From 2000, she had unconsciousness for three times. She gradually had serious hypoglycemia, progressive fatigue, loss of cutaneous pigment, dryness, and furfuration of the skin, loss of muscle strength, and a decrease in libido after the fourth delivery. Nevertheless, she had no symptoms of vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, or orthostatic dizziness. The family history of similar symptoms and previous history of hypertension or diabetes were not found.\n\n【7】The general physical examination showed that the blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature were within normal limits. She was in a coma and appeared chronically ill and pale with dryness and furfuration of the skin. Her eyebrows , glandebalaes and pubes fell off. There was no remarkable abnormality in lung, heart, and neurological examinations.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| The eyebrows fall off. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】Routine laboratory findings demonstrated a red blood cell count of 3.32 × 10<sup>12</sup>/L, a hemoglobin of 101 g/L, a hematocrit of 30.3%, the random blood glucose 2.89 mmol/L, the serum sodium 121.0 mmol/L, the chloride 94.5 mmol/L, carbon dioxide combining power (CO<sub>2</sub>CP) 17.2 mmol/L, the uric acid 63 μmol/L, the aspartate transaminase (AST) 72 U/L, the total protein (TP) 51.3 g/L, the albumin (ALB) 28.6 g/L, the globulin (GLB) 22.7 g/L, the triglyceride (TG) 2.83 mmol/L, the total cholesterol 7.62 mmol/L, the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 6.43 mmol/L, and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-CH) 0.67 mmol/L. The urine routine and stool routine were normal.\n\n【11】As the clinical manifestations suggested Sheehan’s syndrome, related endocrinological tests were finished as follows. The thyroid function test revealed a serum triiodothyronine (T3) of 0.31 ng/mL (normal 0.6 to 1.81), a thyroxine (T4) of 0 μg/dL (normal 4.5 to 12.5), a free triiodothyronine (FT3) of 0.88 pg/mL (normal 1.8 to 4.2), a free thyroxine (FT4) of 0.16 ng/mL (normal 0.8 to 1.76), a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 1.547 μIU/mL (normal 0.35 to 5.5), and a thyroglobulin autoantibody of 83.6 U/mL (normal 0 to 60). The plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level was 4.8 pg/mL (normal 0 to 46). The plasma crotisol level was 0.75 μg/dL (normal 3.9 to 22.4). The growth hormone (GH) level was 0.049 ng/mL (normal 0 to 10). The follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) was 4.30 mIU/mL, the luteinizing hormone (LH) was 1.78 mIU/mL and the estradiol (E2) was 10.52 pg/mL.\n\n【12】The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a diminutive pituitary and an empty sella turcica . There was no evidence of hemorrhage, intracranial mass, or aneurysm .\n\n【13】(a)\n\n【14】(b)\n\n【15】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| The sagittal (a) and coronary (b) noncontrast T1 weighted magnetic imaging (MRI) of the brain shows a diminutive pituitary and an empty sella turcica. |\n| --- |\n\n【18】She was diagnosed as Sheehan’s syndrome and pituitary crisis. Replacement therapy was instituted with hydrocortisone and levothyroxine sodium.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】Sheehan’s syndrome occurs as a result of ischemic pituitary necrosis due to severe postpartum hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–10\\]</u>. Only a small proportion of patients with Sheehan’s syndrome may have a sudden onset of severe hypopituitarism immediately after delivery, whereas most patients have mild illness and they have not been diagnosed for a long time so that they are not treated appropriately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Gei-Guardia et al. reported the average time between the previous obstetric event and diagnosis of Sheehan’s syndrome was 13 years in a study of 60 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this case, although hypofunction of gonad, thyroid, and adrenal cortex had persisted, she had not been diagnosed until about 24 years later. At least 75% of pituitary have to be destroyed before clinical manifestations become evident 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for the patients with Sheehan’s syndrome especially for the patients with severe postpartum hemorrhage. In other words, we should pay attention to those patients who have postpartum hemorrhage.\n\n【21】This is a special and infrequent case with two features. First, she had the fourth spontaneous pregnancy after the appearance of postpartum hemorrhage and pituitary necrosis of the third delivery. Second, the symptoms of Sheehan’s syndrome got worse after the fourth spontaneous pregnancy.\n\n【22】Pregnancy occurring in the patients with Sheehan’s syndrome is seldom described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is well known that the hypofunction of gonad and the effect of sex hormone axis are common in patients with Sheehan’s syndrome. The cessation or disorder of menses would appear. So it is hard for pregnancy in Sheehan’s syndrome. However, only a small proportion of patients with Sheehan’s syndrome may have spontaneous pregnancy, which depends on the preservation of LH and FSH secretion after the pituitary apoplexy event. In this case, the patient could have the fourth spontaneous pregnancy after postpartum hemorrhage and pituitary necrosis because of the preservation of LH and FSH secretion. Grimes and Brooks also thought pregnancy does not constitute evidence against the diagnosis of Sheehan’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Sheehan has reported that pregnancy might improve hypopituitarism by stimulating the pituitary remnant to undergo hyperplasia in Sheehan’s syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. As we all know, the pituitary gland is physiologically enlarged during pregnancy as a result of diffuse and nodular hyperplasia of the lactotroph cells stimulated by estrogens produced by the placenta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The pituitary remnant may have an increment of 30 to 100 percent in the weight in patients with Sheehan’s syndrome. It is also potential that placental secretion of TSH, estrogen, progesterone, and ACTH is responsible for the enhanced wellbeing of patients with hypopituitarism in Sheehan’s syndrome. So pregnancy is propitious to the patients with Sheehan’s syndrome, but it could improve the symptoms as well. See et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> reported that spontaneous pregnancy could bring partial recovery of pituitary function in the patient with Sheehan’s syndrome. However, in this case, the symptoms of Sheehan’s syndrome got worse after the fourth spontaneous pregnancy. There are two possible reasons for this case. The first one is the long course of disease and the old age. The second one is the potential autoimmunity such as thyroglobulin autoantibody (83.6 U/mL in this case). Antipituitary antibodies are also speculated as the other autoimmune antibodies but without detection result because of the limited technical condition.\n\n【24】We report an unusual case with worse symptoms after spontaneous pregnancy in Sheehan’s syndrome. In conclusion, pregnancy provides no evidence against the diagnosis of Sheehan’s syndrome because pregnancy might improve hypopituitarism by stimulating the pituitary remnant to undergo hyperplasia and stimulating placenta to secrete hormone, however, pregnancy might also aggravate symptoms by stimulating autoimmunity system.

We present a patient with pterygium colli and a low and laterally displaced nuchal hairline. Since its description, various surgical approaches have been implemented to correct the deformity. Previously reported posterior and lateral approaches have notable disadvantages with regard to hairline displacement and recurrence. In order to address these disadvantages, a new surgical technique was used on this patient. We have termed this technique an M to T rearrangement. Using a lateral approach, the M and T incisions are made and the trapezial fascial web is directly visualized and able to be completely excised. This prevents the recurrence seen with the use of posterior techniques. Inferolateral displacement of hair-bearing skin can be removed with resection of the superior intervening triangle and improves the appearance of the low nuchal hairline. The excision of excess skin along with the zig-zag closure also prevents postoperative scar contraction and recurrence. An important effect of this technique is the prevention of anterior displacement of hair bearing skin. M to T rearrangement is an effective technique for the correction of webbed neck deformities seen in Noonan and Turner syndromes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A syndrome involving valvular pulmonary stenosis, small stature, hypertelorism, mild mental retardation, undescended testes, and skeletal abnormalities was first described by Noonan and Ehmke in 1963 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Noonan syndrome is characterized by short stature, congenital heart defect, and developmental delay of variable degree. Other findings can include broad or webbed neck, pectus deformity, cryptorchidism, characteristic facies, varied coagulation defects, lymphatic dysplasias, and ocular abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The syndrome is fairly common, as the incidence is estimated to be approximately 1 : 1,000–2,500 live births 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. An autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance has been determined and attributed to missense mutations in the PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12 in 50% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】For the Noonan syndrome patient, the most concerning physical defect is often congenital webbing of the neck or pterygium colli. Kobylinski initially reported this deformity in 1883 and the name “pterygium colli” was coined by Funke in 1902 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. Pterygium colli involves an ectopic fibrotic facial band superficial to the trapezius muscle. Excess hair-bearing skin is also present and extends down the cervical region well beyond the normal hairline.\n\n【5】Since its description, various surgical approaches have been implemented to correct the deformity. Previously reported posterior and lateral approaches have notable disadvantages with regard to hairline displacement and recurrence. In order to address these disadvantages, a novel surgical technique was used on this patient. We have termed this technique an M to T rearrangement.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 13-year-old male was evaluated for congenital webbing of the neck secondary to Noonan syndrome. The patient presented with characteristic features of pterygium colli with a low and laterally displaced nuchal hairline. Presurgical testing did not reveal any coagulation abnormalities. These patients can often have specific factor deficiency or platelet aggregation anomalies, but none were noted with this patient. Surgical treatment was outlined to address both the neck and hairline abnormalities.\n\n【8】Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in a prone position and the webbing was carefully marked from the mastoid to the acromion. A pinch test of the skin overlying the trapezius muscle was used to determine the excess . A horizontal incision was marked perpendicular to the web to form a “T.” This incision was placed parallel to a crease in the anterolateral neck. The length of this limb (releasing incision) was determined from the midpoint of the web line to the palpated edge of the pinch test.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| A pinch test of the skin overlying the trapezius muscle was used to determine the excess. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】A triangular flap whose apex was at the intersection of the limbs of the “T” was then marked. An equilateral triangle, with the limbs and base of the triangle measuring the same length as the releasing incision, was marked. It is paramount to orient the triangular flap in such a way so to exclude any hair-bearing skin that is commonly present in a patient with inferolateral displacement of the hairline. The base of the triangular flap is then connected to the superior and inferior edges of the webbing to form an “M” .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Markings for an M-T rearrangement. An incision is marked perpendicular to the web to form a “T.” This incision is parallel to a crease in the anterolateral neck. The length of this incision is determined by the pinch test. Then, a triangular flap whose apex is at the intersection of the limbs of the “T” is marked. This is an equilateral triangle, with the limbs and base of the triangle measuring the same length as the releasing incision. The base of the triangular flap is then connected to the superior and inferior edges of the webbing to form an “M.” Note that the inferolateral displacement of hair-bearing skin is present within the superior triangle. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】The M and T incisions were made along the markings. The skin and subcutaneous tissue of the two intervening triangles that are present superior and inferior to the triangular flap were resected. The superior triangle usually incorporates the inferior and lateral displaced hairline and hair bearing skin. Then the fibrotic fascial band of the trapezius is fully visualized . The most important part of the procedure is to perform a complete excision of the trapezial fascial web in order to prevent recurrence. This effectively lengthened the trapezius and improved the neck profile . Meticulous dissection is required to visualize the spinal accessory nerve and protect it from injury.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| A lateral approach allows for complete visualization of fibrotic fascial band on the trapezius muscle.

Discussion\n\n【36】Numerous surgical approaches have been developed to correct the webbed neck deformity seen in Noonan’s and Turner’s syndromes. The primary goals of correction include normalizing the appearance of the neck, raising the low hairline. Previously reported techniques have attempted correction from lateral or posterior approaches.\n\n【37】In 1937, Chandler originally proposed surgical correction of the deformity via bilateral Z-plasties 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. A lateral approach allows for complete visualization of the web, but the use of a Z-plasty alone does not fully achieve desired aesthetic results. With this technique, the hair-bearing flap is rotated anteriorly and is visible on the lateral neck. Although the width of the neck is improved, future hair removal procedures would be indicated to achieve a normal appearance. Hikade et al. improved upon this technique by developing a modified Z-plasty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. With this approach a lateral Z-plasty is performed, the hair-bearing flap is excised, and the resultant dog-ear is corrected by two additional Z-plasties. This allows for visualization of the web and eliminates the need for future hair removal on the lateral neck. Although a modified Z-plasty does achieve the goals of webbed neck correction, scars extend from just below the mastoid process to the acromion.\n\n【38】With a posterior approach, excess skin is excised from midline of the posterior neck. This flattens the web against the lateral neck to achieve an improved appearance. Shearin and DeFranzo described a posterior butterfly correction of a webbed neck deformity in a Turner’s patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Tension on the vertical limb of the scar caused considerable spreading and recurrence of the web. Similarly, Thomson et al. used a posterior approach and excised a midline ellipse of tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The incision and resultant dog ears were closed leaving a Y-shaped scar. As was also described by Shearin and DeFranzo, the vertical limb of this scar is under considerable tension, which makes recurrence of the web possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Hypertrophic scarring was noted postoperatively in this case. A recent study noted that five out of eleven patients had mild to moderate postoperative hypertrophic scarring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. They found that lateral techniques with incorporation of Z-plasties provided superior results. They showed, as with our patient, that overall patient satisfaction is very high but recommended accurate preoperative planning and counseling of patients and families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【40】The M to T rearrangement described in this report offers considerable advantages to previously reported techniques. By using a lateral approach, the trapezial fascial web is directly visualized and able to be completely excised. This prevents the recurrence seen with the use of posterior techniques. Inferolateral displacement of hair-bearing skin can be removed with resection of the superior intervening triangle and improves the appearance of the low nuchal hairline. The excision of excess skin along with the zig-zag closure also prevents postoperative scar contraction and recurrence. An important effect of this technique is the prevention of anterior displacement of hair bearing skin. M to T rearrangement is a novel technique for effective surgical correction of webbed neck deformities seen in Noonan’s and Turner’s syndromes.\n\n【41】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We report two cases of reoperation as a result of raised ICP associated with cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity, one arising after glioma resection and the other after meningioma resection. In both cases, a “valve”-like structure was noted intraoperatively in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity. Surgical resection of the “valve”-like structure led to slow regression over several months after the reoperation rather than to immediate disappearance of the cyst. Both cases illustrate that the “valve”-like structure formed in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity may be responsible for cyst formation. Surgical resection of it provides good long-term outcomes in such patients though short-term outcomes are unsatisfactory; we speculate that if the resection of the cortical tissue around the “valve”-like structure is enough wide, its return may be avoided.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is common in patients undergoing intracranial tumor resection. Reoperation as a result of raised ICP is an important prognostic factor, often resulting in a poor outcome. Raised ICP associated with intracranial tumor resection frequently arises as a result of hemorrhage in the tumor resection cavity, peritumoral cerebral contusion, cerebral edema, and/or hemorrhage at adjacent or remote sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In contrast, reoperation as a result of raised ICP secondary to cyst formation in an intracranial tumor resection cavity is a rare clinical condition. In a retrospective analysis of 4,782 patients with intracranial tumor undergoing surgical treatment at our hospital over the past 10 years, we identified 98 patients who underwent reoperation owing to high ICP, and two of them developed high ICP as a result of cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity. Herein, we report the two cases, one arising as a result of repeated cyst formation in the tumor cavity after resection of temporal lobe glioma and the other after resection of sphenoid ridge meningioma. We also discuss the potential mechanisms underlying cyst formation in the intracranial tumor resection cavity.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【6】A 44-year-old female patient with a 1-year history of paroxysmal dizziness presented with an exacerbation of dizziness and nausea for 5 days. Physical examination revealed that she had poor memory and computation abilities without other focal neurological signs. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of her head revealed a large zone of slightly elongated T1 or shortened T2 signal in her right temporal lobe. After administration of contrast agent, the lesion showed patchy heterogeneous enhancement or ring enhancement (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). A diagnosis of glioma was considered preoperatively. Surgery was performed via a right frontotemporal approach. Intraoperatively, a pink-purple tumor was noted on the surface of the temporal lobe near the sylvian fissure. The tumor was closely attached to the dura mater, with a soft texture and a rich blood supply. Under an operation microscope, the tumor tissue located adjacent to the sylvian fissure was excised, and a 4 cm cortical incision (as shown in the elliptical area in Figure 1(a)) was made in the sylvian fissure. Further intraoperative exploration showed that the blood supply to the tumor was provided by small branches of the middle cerebral artery. After separating the tumor along the perisylvian region and severing its feeding arteries, the tumor was resected in a piecemeal fashion. The cortical tissue located on the surface of the temporal lobe was not resected (the extent of tumor resection was limited to the elliptical area shown in Figure 1(b)). Surgicel (Ethicon, Inc. a Johnson & Johnson company; Somerville, NJ) was applied to cover the operative field to prevent exudation. The surgery was uneventful, and no openings were found in the cerebral ventricle. Pathological examination demonstrated that the tumor was a grade III oligodendroastrocytoma. The patient recovered well after surgery.\n\n【7】(a)\n\n【8】(b)\n\n【9】(c)\n\n【10】(d)\n\n【11】(e)\n\n【12】(f)\n\n【13】(g)\n\n【14】(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f)   \n(g)\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Imaging results for Case 1 .

She had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 7. The patient received 250 ml of 20% mannitol and 40 mg of furosemide immediately to lower ICP. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her head revealed a hypodense area in the tumor resection cavity in the right temporal lobe, which led to deformation and dislocation of the surrounding tissue and the cerebral ventricle. Therefore, cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity was indicated (Figure 1(c)). Emergency exploratory surgery was then performed. After incising the dura mater, it was found that the cerebral tissue had an elevated tension. A “valve”-like structure was formed by relocated cerebral tissue, Surgicel, and the arachnoid in the roof region of the tumor cavity, sealing the effusion in the tumor resection cavity (the position of the “valve”-like structure is shown by the arrow in Figure 1(c)). After separating the arachnoid and removing the Surgicel to open the tumor resection cavity, approximately 40 ml of clear, nonyellow liquid was aspirated. As a response to tension reduction, the cerebral tissue collapsed. No communication between the tumor resection cavity and the cerebral ventricle was found. The tumor resection cavity was then washed repeatedly, and the bone flap was returned to its initial location. Postoperative CT reexamination revealed that the space-occupying effect was absent, the roof region of the tumor resection cavity was open, and the “valve”-like structure had disappeared (as shown by the arrow in Figure 1(d)).\n\n【18】Five days after the reoperation, the patient again developed symptoms of high ICP and cerebral hernia. Repeat CT showed a recommencement of effusion in the tumor resection cavity and resealing of the roof region of the tumor resection cavity, suggesting possible reformation of the “valve”-like structure (Figure 1(e)). A second reoperation was performed to aspirate the effusion at which the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern were fully separated, the “valve”-like structure resected, and the relocated cortex marsupialized so that the tumor resection cavity could communicate with the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern and the effusion could enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation. Surgicel was not applied this time. Considering that the patient developed cerebral hernia after both operations, the bone flap was removed. The patient recovered well after the second reoperation.\n\n【19】One week later, a CT rescan of her head demonstrated that there was still effusion in the tumor resection cavity, and it was possible that the “valve”-like structure had reformed again (Figure 1(f)). But because the compression on the surrounding tissue was not severe, and considering that the bone flap had been removed and radiotherapy had low risk, the patient was given Gamma Knife therapy immediately after discharge from hospital. Three months later, CT examination showed that the cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity had disappeared, and the tumor had not recurred (Figure 1(g)).\n\n【20】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【21】A 60-year-old women with a 2-month history of decreased memory presented with an exacerbation and nonfluent speech over the previous month. Physical examination revealed that she had incomplete motor aphasia without other focal neurological signs. An MRI scan of her head revealed a gourd-like area in the left frontotemporal region that spanned the anterior and middle cranial fossa. This abnormal area had a well-demarcated boundary, appearing as a slightly hypointense signal on the T1-weighted image, and as mixed isointense, slightly hyperintense and hypointense signals on the T2-weighted image. The left cerebral ventricle had become narrow as a result of compression. After contrast administration, the lesion showed heterogeneous enhancement (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). A diagnosis of sphenoid ridge meningioma was considered preoperatively and surgery was performed via a left extended pterional approach. After opening the dura mater, it was found that the grooves of the cerebral cortex near the sylvian fissure had become shallow and showed a pale yellow color. Under an operation microscope, the sylvian fissure was separated, and the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus were retracted to expose the yellowish-white tumor. After partially separating the tumor along its periphery, it was found that the basal part of the tumor was located mainly in the sphenoid ridge and partly at the base of the anterior and middle cranial fossa. Blood supply to the tumor was provided by the small branches of the middle cerebral artery. After severing the feeding arteries, the tumor was totally resected in a piecemeal fashion. The basal dura mater was coagulated following surgery. After the tumor removal, Surgicel was applied to cover the tumor cavity. The surgery was uneventful. Pathological examination demonstrated that the tumor was a meningioma.\n\n【22】(a)\n\n【23】(b)\n\n【24】(c)\n\n【25】(d)\n\n【26】(e)\n\n【27】(f)\n\n【28】(g)\n\n【29】(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f)   \n(g)\n\n【30】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Imaging results for Case 2 .

(e)–(g) MRI showing disappearance of cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity 10 months after the reoperation. |\n| --- |\n\n【32】Postoperatively, the patient’s overall condition was good. However, her condition deteriorated 6 days after the operation. She developed somnolence, mydriasis of her left eye, right limb paralysis, and pathological reflex and had a GCS score of 7, suggesting the formation of a cerebral hernia. To lower ICP, the patient was given 250 ml of 20% mannitol immediately. An emergency CT scan of her head showed a patchy mixed density (mainly hypodensity) area in the tumor resection cavity adjacent to the temporal lobe. The ipsilateral cerebral ventricle was deformed as a result of compression, and the midline structure had shifted toward the right side, suggesting cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity. A band-shaped hyperintense shadow was noted in the intracranial subdural space, in which some shadows of gas density were scattered (Figure 2(c)). Emergency exploratory surgery was performed. After removing a small epidural hematoma and incising the dura mater, it was found that a “valve”-like structure had formed by relocated cerebral tissue, Surgicel, and the arachnoid. The location of the “valve”-like structure was along the sylvian fissure between the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus after the sphenoid ridge (the position of the “valve”-like structure is near the arrow shown in Figure 2(c)) the length along the sylvian fissure was about 5 cm. After separating the arachnoid and removing the Surgicel to open the tumor resection cavity, a virtually clear effusion was noted in the tumor resection cavity in the sylvian cistern. Approximately 30 ml of the effusion was aspirated. As a result, cerebral tissue tension decreased, and the cerebral pulse was good. Subsequent examination revealed that a few blood clots were attached to the base of the tumor resection cavity. After removing the blood clots, no communication was found between the tumor cavity and the cerebral ventricle or cerebral cistern. Subsequently, the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern were fenestrated, and marsupialization of the relocated cerebral tissue was performed so that the tumor resection cavity could communicate with the sylvian cistern and subarachnoid cistern and the effusion could enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation. The tumor resection cavity was then washed repeatedly, and the bone flap was returned to its initial location. No Surgicel was applied during the second operation.\n\n【33】One week later, a CT rescan of her head revealed return of effusion in the tumor resection cavity, and it was possible that the “valve”-like structure had reformed again. But the roof region of the tumor resection cavity had become wider than before (as shown by the arrow in Figure 2(d)). Since compression on the surrounding cerebral tissue was not severe, a conservative approach was adopted. Ten months later, MRI examination showed that the cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity had disappeared, and the tumor had not recurred (Figures 2(e)–2(g)).\n\n【34】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【35】Reoperation after intracranial tumor resection is common in patients with cerebral retraction-induced cerebral edema, cerebral contusion, and/or intracranial hemorrhage, especially in patients with skull base tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. However, raised ICP or cerebral herniation as a result of the space-occupying effect of cyst formation in a tumor cavity after intracranial tumor resection is rarely encountered in clinical practice. In our retrospective analysis, we found that, among patients undergoing reoperation owing to high intracranial pressure, the rate of reoperation as a result of high intracranial pressure secondary to cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity was approximately 2%. Although intracranial tumor resection cavities filled with fluid are not unusual in patients with large intracranial tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, they often spontaneously diminish or even disappear after cerebral compression is relieved by tumor resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Cyst formation in an intracranial tumor resection cavity is very rare.\n\n【36】After intracranial tumor resection, a pale yellow liquid may be produced by the residual tumor or wound surface and accumulate in the tumor resection cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Such accumulation may occur at an early (average 5.6 weeks) or late (average 3.6 years) stage after tumor resection. Although the space-occupying effect may occur, reoperation owing to development of cerebral hernia is rare. Even if surgery is needed, the prognosis is good, and no repeat cyst formation has been noted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In cases 1 and 2 , the liquid aspirated from the tumor resection cavity had a nonyellow color, and cyst formation occurred 3 and 6 days after surgery, respectively, significantly shorter than periods reported in the literature. More importantly, cyst formation recurred rapidly after surgery and regressed over several months. These findings are inconsistent with previous reports mentioned above, suggesting the possible existence of other mechanisms. Cyst formation may also be caused by inflow and accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the tumor resection cavity as a result of communication with the cerebral ventricle or cistern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Although the tumors in both case 1 and case 2 were close to the temporal and frontal horns of the lateral ventricle, intraoperative examination and postoperative imaging revealed no communication between the tumor resection cavity and the cerebral ventricle. If communication occurs, the accumulated fluid in the tumor resection cavity may flow back to the cerebral ventricle, which may not give rise to raised ICP. Therefore, the possibility that cyst formation is caused by communication between the tumor resection cavity and the cerebral ventricle can be excluded.\n\n【37】So what mechanism caused the cyst formation? In case 1 , an intracerebral operation was performed to remove the temporal lobe glioma. In case 2 , resection of the sphenoid ridge meningioma was conducted in the space between cerebral tissue and the dura mater at the skull base; therefore this procedure was an extracerebral operation. Despite large differences in clinical characteristics and surgical procedures, repeated cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity was noted in both cases. Of note, both patients had a large tumor and a large tumor cavity after tumor resection. Exploratory surgery revealed that a “valve”-like structure had formed by relocated cerebral tissue, Surgicel, and the arachnoid in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity. Furthermore, we also found that the liquid aspirated from the tumor cavity had the properties of the cerebrospinal fluid. We therefore surmise that the “valve”-like structure may only permit unidirectional flow of cerebrospinal fluid. When raised ICP occurred, the cerebrospinal fluid entered into the tumor resection cavity via the “valve”-like structure which then sealed the tumor resection cavity, so preventing the effusion from entering the cerebrospinal fluid circulation and resulting in accumulation of liquid in the tumor resection cavity to produce a space-occupying effect. This is similar to the mechanism responsible for the formation of subdural hygroma or iatrogenic cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11–14\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Rao reported a case of an expanding iatrogenic cyst following temporal lobectomy. In that case, it was proposed that a ball valve obstruction to flow of CSF occurred at the trigone. Ventricular CSF outflow would be forced into the cyst with the increased pressure of respiratory inspiration and cardiac systolic pulses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Kutlay et al. reported a case with iatrogenic arachnoid cyst with distinct clinical picture as a result of bone defect in the floor of the middle cranial fossa, in the case with time CSF entrapment in iatrogenic cyst, which supported the probable existence of a valvular mechanism, leading to the progressive accumulation of fluid within the cyst. Additionally, the cyst itself might have acted as a conductor for transmitting the pulsatile forces of the brain and CSF, and this condition also contributed to enlargement of the cyst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Thus, it is reasonable for us to speculate that the formation of the iatrogenic “valve”-like structure is responsible for cyst formation in the tumor cavity after intracranial tumor resection. The formation of such an unidirectional “valve”-like structure is presumably in part iatrogenic. As the cortical tissue located on the surface of the tumor was not resected, it may provide an anatomical basis for the formation of the “valve”-like structure .\n\n【39】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| Diagram showing the “valve”-like structure on the surface of the brain. |\n| --- |\n\n【41】To prevent return of the effusion in the tumor resection cavity after the reoperation, we aspirated the effusion in the tumor cavity, opened up the communication of the cavity with the surrounding subarachnoid space and cerebral cistern, resected the “valve”-like structure, and marsupialized relocated cerebral tissue so that the effusion could enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation. However, the immediate postoperative outcome was poor as effusion recommenced in the tumor resection cavity in both cases because of the reformation of the “valve”-like structure. What is the hypothesis about the fact that the cyst postoperatively returns despite the fact that the “valve”-like structure was resected? A retrospective image analysis revealed the presence of edema in the cerebral tissue surrounding the tumor resection cavity. After the “valve”-like structure was surgically resected, edema could push the cortex toward the place of the former “valve”-like structure, which made it reform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【42】Therefore, we speculate that the “valve”-like structure may reform as a result of the presence of cerebral edema, and when the roof region of the tumor cavity remains very narrow, the effusion in the tumor resection cavity cannot enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, and so it builds up. Subsequent “valve”-like structures were weaker than the earlier ones, so as cerebral edema regresses, the anatomical mechanism underlying the formation of the “valve”-like structure diminishes, allowing the tumor cavity effusion to enter the cerebrospinal fluid circulation efficiently and resolving the effusion.\n\n【43】Currently there are three main surgical options for the treatment of developmental and iatrogenic cysts: craniotomy with excision of the cyst membrane, CSF drainage (either from the cyst or from the lateral ventricle), and cyst fenestration by means of stereotactic or endoscopic techniques 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–19\\]</u>. For the cases in this paper, the first option was not feasible because there was no cyst membrane to excise. It was also difficult to excise the cyst since it was not possible to resect the anatomical basis of the “valve”-like structure. Long-term CSF drainage was not possible either due to potential for infection. Thus craniotomy with resection of the “valve”-like structure was the best option, although in this paper the resection of brain tissue around the “valve”-like structure was not enough so that the roof region of the tumor cavity remained very narrow.\n\n【44】In case 1 , postoperative CT reexamination revealed the opening and resealing of the roof region of the tumor resection cavity, suggesting possible disappearance and reformation of the “valve”-like structure 通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown by the arrows in Figure 1)</u>. In case 2 , postoperative examination showed that the roof region of the tumor resection cavity became widened 通用删除1(英):<u>(as shown by the arrow in Figure 2)</u>, and cyst reformation was attenuated, suggesting that the effect produced by the “valve”-like structure is weakened. These imaging changes indirectly confirm our hypothesis that the “valve”-like structure is responsible for cyst formation in the tumor resection cavity. Thus, we speculate that resection of the cortical tissue located on the surface of the tumor to widen the roof region of the tumor resection cavity may avoid the formation of the “valve”-like structure.\n\n【45】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【46】In conclusion, we describe two cases of reoperation as a result of raised ICP owing to cyst formation in the tumor cavity following intracranial tumor resection. We hypothesize that the presence of a “valve”-like structure in the roof region of the tumor resection cavity is responsible for cyst formation in the cavity. Surgical resection of this and marsupialization of the cortex provide good long-term outcomes in such patients though short-term outcomes are unsatisfactory, and we speculate that if the resection of the cortical tissue around the “valve”-like structure is wide enough, the problem may be avoided.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The Case\n\n【5】A 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital with two-month history of progressive worsening cough and sputum production associated with exertional shortness of breath. His condition was combined with decline in his functional activity, malaise, loss of appetite, and loss of weight of about 30 Ibs. He also noticed painless ulcerating skin lesions, progressively increasing in size over his face, neck, and the scalp. His past medical history was significant for hypertension and Alzheimer’s dementia. He had 60-pack-year history of smoking. On examination, vital signs were within normal limits. BMI was 17.1. He appeared lethargic with temporal and facial muscle wasting. Skin finding revealed multiple large, firm, mobile, nontender, ulcerative skin lesions with hyperemic centers and elevated rolled edges, which were located on the left side of the chin and scalp areas (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). He also had a nodular lesion on the right lower face (Figure 1(c)) and a black hairy tongue. Chest examination showed diminished air entry with dullness to left upper chest. Laboratory tests showed WBC /L and hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL. The chest radiograph (CXR) showed abnormal soft tissue fullness at the left hilum. Computed tomography of the chest (CT) revealed a 5 cm large centrally located left upper lobe mass resulting in constriction to the left upper lobe bronchus and left upper lobe atelectasis (Figure 1(d)), associated with left hilar adenopathy. Bronchoscopy showed that a mass was visualized at the junction of the left upper lobe, and the lingula, completely occluding the entry to the left upper lobe and biopsies were obtained. Skin biopsy was performed, and the result was consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and was identical to the histopathology of the left lung mass.

Discussion\n\n【14】Lung cancer is a common neoplasm affecting men and women usually after the age of fifty. Only early stage operable disease can be cured, while the remainder of patients develop distant metastases and die. Most common sites of metastasis include the bones, liver, adrenal gland, and brain, while the skin is rarely affected. The percentage of patients with lung cancer that develop skin metastases ranges from 1 to 10%. This must be ruled out in patients with suspicious skin lesions and history of smoking or lung cancer. The diagnosis is usually made using clinical information, and skin biopsy should be obtained for histological examination. All histological types of lung cancer may metastasize to the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The incidence of cutaneous metastasis is highest among patient with large-cell carcinoma (2.5%) and low for squamous (0.7%) and small-cell carcinoma (0.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In about 20–60% of cases, the skin lesions are present before or at the same time with the diagnosis of the primary lung tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

A 52-year-old man was referred to our multidisciplinary clinic for rheumatic and pulmonary diseases for an active erosive seropositive RA and progressive ILD. Previous treatments were GC, hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, etanercept, withdrawn after ILD detection, and tocilizumab, discontinued due to relapsing infections. After our evaluation, we proposed rituximab in addition to low-dose GC and hydroxychloroquine, ineffective on joint involvement. Therefore, we proposed tofacitinib which allowed us to control joint involvement, stabilize ILD improving respiratory symptoms, and manage the frequent infectious episodes that occurred initially. The short half-life and rapid-acting of tofacitinib are two helpful characteristics regarding this aspect. Despite limited data from randomized trials and real-life, tofacitinib could represent a safe therapeutic option for RA-ILD patients. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm this encouraging report.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease affecting 0.5–1% of the population worldwide. It is characterized by chronic symmetrical erosive synovitis and sometimes by extra-articular manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, including interstitial lung disease (ILD), which represents the most common lung involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. ILD significantly affects therapeutic approach, quality of life, morbidity, and mortality of RA patients, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 4 to 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Among the main risk factors for the development of AR-ILD, we consider high titles of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), male sex, and cigarette smoking history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Sometimes lung interstitial involvement is early and represents the only sign of disease. In these cases, a clinical and serological follow-up may lead to evidence of autoimmune disease later in time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】In AR patients with lung involvement, the radiological UIP pattern is not only the most frequent one (about 60–70%) but also the most associated with poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The treatment of patients with RA and concomitant ILD is nowadays challenging and mainly based on glucocorticoids (GC) and immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Therapeutic options in these patients are complicated by the possible pulmonary toxicity of many disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and by their unclear efficacy on pulmonary involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The scientific community is constantly looking for therapeutic alternatives to control RA activity avoiding lung toxicity and, possibly, influencing the natural history of RA-ILD. Furthermore, RA-ILD treatment should be safe and easy to manage in case of infectious adverse events, giving the higher infectious risk in ILD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Small-molecule Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK-i), namely, tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib, are the latest drug class of DMARDs commercialized for the treatment of RA with a good safety profile 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–13\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Here, we present the case of a patient affected with progressive RA-ILD successfully treated with tofacitinib.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【10】A 52-year-old man, former smoker (45 pack years), was referred to our multidisciplinary outpatient clinic for rheumatic and rare lung diseases for an active RA associated with progressive ILD. His past clinical history revealed systemic arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and class II obesity (BMI: 37).\n\n【11】Diagnosis of RA was performed in April 2012. RF and ACPA were positive (42 and 300 U/mL, respectively), while antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigens (ENA), and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were negative.\n\n【12】Arthritis was aggressive and rapidly erosive at hands and wrists. The patient had been initially treated with methotrexate (MTX) 15 mg weekly, effective but replaced with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 400 mg daily for the desire of paternity in December 2012. Since HCQ became ineffective, etanercept (ETA) 50 mg weekly was added in April 2014.\n\n【13】Fourteen months later, ILD was casually detected , and ETA was replaced with subcutaneous tocilizumab (TCZ) 162 mg weekly. This latter drug was stopped after few months for relapsing infections, mainly involving the urinary and lower respiratory tract .\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【15】Clinical course and therapeutic strategy. ILD: interstitial lung disease; MTX: methotrexate; ETA: etanercept; TCZ: tocilizumab; RTX: rituximab; VAS: Visual Analogue Scale; FVC: forced vital capacity; DLCO: diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; CRP: C-reactive protein; RF: rheumatoid factor; ACPA: anticitrullinated protein antibodies; ANA: antinuclear antibodies; ENA: extractable nuclear antigen; ANCA: antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies; DAS-28: disease activity score on 28 joints.\n\n【16】In October 2017, due to a deterioration of respiratory symptoms, he was referred for the first time to our multidisciplinary outpatient clinic, which includes a rheumatologist and a pulmonologist. At that time, he presented severe restrictive ventilatory impairment, with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 52% of the predicted value and a severe reduction in gas exchange with a diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of 33% of the predicted value. Moreover, he desaturated at 6-minute walking test (nadir reached after two minutes with an oxygen saturation of 87%). As far as RA activity, he showed arthritis of wrists and II-III right metacarpophalangeal; C-reactive protein (CPR; 50 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 50 mm/h) were both increased, with a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS-28 CRP) of 5.27.\n\n【17】At chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), a pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia was described, characterized by reticular abnormalities and honeycombing aspects, particularly at the right lower lobe .\n\n【18】(a)\n\n【19】(b)\n\n【20】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【22】Chest high-resolution computed tomography: November 2017 compared to last follow-up, September 2020. Reticular abnormalities, honeycombing aspects, and traction bronchiectasis compatible with usual interstitial pneumonia. Despite an initial progression, interstitial lung disease showed a substantial stability at the last follow-up.\n\n【23】At that time, he was taking HCQ and low-dose prednisone (5 mg daily).\n\n【24】According to the clinical picture, we prescribed oxygen supplementation and proposed treatment with rituximab (1000 mg every other week for 2 intravenous infusions), performed in December 2017, maintaining treatment with prednisone and HCQ. Two months later, arthritis was still active, involving bilateral MCF and proximal interphalangeal joints of hands, wrists, and ankles associated with ESR and CRP elevation (45 mm and 60 mg/L, respectively).\n\n【25】After multidisciplinary discussion with a pulmonologist, in March 2018, we prescribed tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily. Vaccination for varicella zoster virus (VZV) was not performed because of the immunosuppressive condition of the patient.\n\n【26】One month later, the patient presented an infection of the upper respiratory tract, successfully treated with antibiotic therapy; tofacitinib was discontinued for ten days. Despite other few respiratory and urinary infectious episodes, RA remission was obtained after 3 months. Disease flares appeared when tofacitinib was discontinued, but every time, a rapid arthritis control was obtained with the reintroduction of tofacitinib.\n\n【27】From August 2018 to March 2020, we observed a stable RA remission, and no other infections were reported by the patient.\n\n【28】Despite an initial radiological progression detected at HRCT in November 2018, respiratory symptoms improved and lung function (FVC and DLCO) remained stable over the time .\n\n【29】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【30】ILD is a serious pulmonary complication of RA characterized by a significant impact on morbidity and mortality, representing a current therapeutic challenge because of the possible pulmonary toxicity of many traditional and biological DMARDs, their unclear efficacy on pulmonary disease, and the higher infectious risk in comparison to non-ILD RA patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【31】JAK-is have recently emerged in clinical practice for the treatment of RA, and they are recommended by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) in patients failing an initial treatment with MTX or other conventional DMARDs with poor prognostic factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Despite limited data, no relevant safety concerns in relation to both ILD onset and progression are emerged for tofacitinib 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11, 15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【33】A post hoc analysis on 7061 RA patients receiving tofacitinib from clinical trials and long-term extension studies reported an incidence rate for ILD with both tofacitinib doses of 0.18 per 100 patient-years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Few real-life data are up to now available. Among 15 RA-ILD patients treated with tofacitinib, none showed worsening of dyspnoea, while improvement was reported in some cases; moreover, respiratory function and DLCO remained stable in the majority of subjects evaluated, while 4 patients improved 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【35】In another study, 3 RA-ILD patients were successfully treated with tofacitinib without pulmonary adverse events in an 8–12-month period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【36】About the possible effect on ILD, some case reports have recently been published in which tofacitinib appears to be effective on ILD related to antimelanoma differentiation-associated 5 gene antibody-positive dermatomyositis and antisynthetase syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–23\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Tofacitinib has been demonstrated to be able to reduce the progression of zymosan-induced ILD in SKG mice, a murine model of RA. Tofacitinib significantly suppressed the progression of ILD compared to control by expanding myeloid-derived suppressor cells and suppressing Th17 cells’ proliferation and differentiation, suggesting a potential therapeutic effect of tofacitinib for RA-ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【38】However, other in vitro studies reported that the inhibition of JAK2, but not the selective JAK1/JAK3 pathway, significantly reduced IL-17A-induced fibrogenic response in fibroblast from IPF and RA-ILD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Rituximab was proposed as a therapeutic option for RA-ILD, even if it has been associated with an increased risk of infections in patients with RA-ILD.\n\n【40】Unfortunately, in our patient, rituximab was ineffective on arthritis and ILD, and it could have contributed to the infectious adverse events showed by the patient in the next six months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【41】The short half-life and rapid-acting of tofacitinib are two characteristics that we have considered for the treatment of our patient. Moreover, we took advantage by an intermittent therapy when the infectious events appeared obtaining a rapid clearance of the drug. On the other side, the patient also showed a rapid flare of disease after tofacitinib discontinuation, requiring a temporary increase of prednisone dose.\n\n【42】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【43】Despite limited data from clinical trials and real-life, tofacitinib could represent a therapeutic option for RA-ILD patients, with a good safety profile. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm this encouraging report.\n\n【44】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【45】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n【46】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【47】Sebastiani Marco conceptualized the study, was responsible for methodology, reviewed and edited the manuscript, and was in charge of the case; Vacchi Caterina wrote the original draft, was responsible for methodology, and was in charge of the case; Cassone Giulia, Manfredi Andreina, Andrisani Dario, Della Casa Giovanni, Cerri Stefania, and Salvarani Carlo were in charge of the case and wrote the original draft.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Limited joint mobility (LJM) is a rare disease that complicates all types of diabetes and might indicate the high-risk odd for the diabetic patients to develop microvascular complications. We are reporting a 13-year-old female child with chronic uncontrolled type 1DM presenting with full blown clinical picture of bilateral hand LJM associated with significant growth failure yet has no clinical or biochemical evidence of microvascular complications. Literature research studies have emphasized the rarity of this manifestation in pediatric type 1 diabetic patients; however, it is an important clue and warning sign for microvascular complication occurrence in these patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Limited joint mobility (LJM) previously known as cheiroarthropathy or stiff hand syndrome is a progressive flexion deformity which affects mainly hand digits and sometimes associated with thickened waxy and tight overlying skin and characterized clinically by painless limited extension of the proximal metacarpophalangeal joints and/or interphalangeal joints with fixed flexion of the fingers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is the most frequent joint-related disease in adult diabetic patients. Although it is seen in nondiabetic patients, multiple digit involvement is more prevalent in diabetic patients compared with the nondiabetic control group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In diabetes mellitus, its pathology is due to progressive nonenzymatic glycation of the collagen making it resistant to the collagenase enzyme leading to capsular thickening and dermal fibrosis with end result of loss of the connective tissue elasticity and might be complicated by joint deformity, found to be correlated with the duration of poor glycemic control and microvascular complications. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】It was initially thought to be seen in juvenile type 1 diabetic patients with growth failure; however, it is considered an early complication in both types of diabetes and affects all the ages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is prevalent in adult diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy or diabetic foot complications. In one study, all diabetic patients with LJM were found to have clinical evidence of microvascular complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; that is why, it is important to diagnose it as it might be the earlier warning signal for the presence of one or more of the microvascular complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy.\n\n【6】Generally, this disorder might improve by strict glycemic control and physiotherapy.\n\n【7】We are reporting an adolescent female with long standing uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus presenting with the typical history and clinical signs of bilateral hand limited joint mobility disease.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【9】A 14-year-old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM) since the age of 6 months, reported progressive painless stiffness in both hands over two-year duration, progressed into limited movements of all hands’ joints including the wrist and interphalangeal joints associated with tightening of the overlying skin but without evidence of Raynaud phenomenon.\n\n【10】Her diabetes had been always poorly controlled with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ranging between 10 and 12%. Although she is on multiple daily injection insulin regimen with appropriate total daily dose, she has poor compliance to her medication in addition to poor diet control with frequent hospital admissions due to diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Two years earlier, she had been investigated for delayed-bone-age short stature including growth hormone stimulation test which became sufficient. Despite her poor glycemic control, she had no evidence of nephropathy or retinopathy. The patient had no symptoms of hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, or polyglandular autoimmune disease; furthermore, no history suggestive of Celiac disease and its yearly screening test is within normal limit. The patient had no history of multiple joint pain, swelling, or hotness; no history of limping or morning stiffness; and no history of intermittent fever or weight loss. Family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in both parents. However, no family history of microvascular complications and no arthropathy disease or rheumatological disorders.\n\n【11】Clinical examination showed 3 SDS short-stature pubertal female with stable vital signs. Hand inspection showed flexure contracture of both hands with thick, tight, waxy skin over the dorsal aspect of metacarpophalangeal joints (MCPJ) and interphalangeal joints (IPJ) with normal nail structure and color. Clinically, there was nontender swelling over both hands with no hotness or dislocated joints. Limited joint mobility was confirmed clinically with the “Prayer sign”  (written consent was signed by parents), manifested as incomplete approximation of all of the palmar surfaces of her both hands’ digits. She also had positive “table top” sign, not able to completely lay her palms flat on the horizontal surface of the flat table, with no clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease of the feet. The patient was clinically euthyroid with no thyromegaly and had no clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency or hypoparathyroidism excluding autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1(APS-1). No clinical stigmata of systemic lupus or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【13】“Prayer” sign showing the significant involvement of the JML of both hands limiting the palmar digits’ alignment on each other. The shiny tight skin over the digits is also shown.\n\n【14】Retinal examination done by an ophthalmologist did not reveal any retinopathic changes.\n\n【15】Laboratory tests showed a high glycosylated hemoglobin c (HbA1c) level of 12.3%, normal thyroid function tests, and normal microalbumin test with urine albumin/creatinine of 20 mg/g. The patient had normal CBC with normal inflammatory markers.\n\n【16】As for management, the insulin total dose was increased by 15%, and the patient was offered a continuous glucose monitoring device to improve her glycemic control with strict follow-up visits to diabetic nutrition clinic to better manage her dietary intake. She was referred to pediatric orthopedic service for management of her hands’ limitation of movement and started on physiotherapy and occupation therapy to improve her hands’ range of motion and to increase her muscle strength and functional performance.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Our patient is having type 1 DM for more than 13 years, which is well known for its acute and chronic biochemical, pathophysiological, and functional complications; one of them is limited joint mobility LJM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although the differential diagnoses of joint involvement in female children are wide, most of the rheumatological, orthopedic, and systemic diseases were excluded in our patient based on the history, physical examination, and relevant laboratory tests. LJM has declined in frequency over two decades from 1970 till 1990 which was attributed to the better glycemic control offered by the availability of effective insulin therapy regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This child developed this complication after a long duration of diabetes. Diabetic children might have LJM as early as few months of onset of type 1 DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, compared to the late peak prevalence of LJM in 65% of DM generally after 30 years of onset 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. LJM was considered as a measure of the diabetes control quality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Our patient was having a high level of HbA1c as well as day to day home glucose readings, despite her adjusted insulin dose, indicating its correlation with chronic poor diabetes. Compared to our patient, we reported LJM in a 14-year-old male with chronically uncontrolled diabetes associated with celiac disease, receiving old mixed insulin regimen, yet he did not have evidence of retinopathy nor nephropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Despite the chronic poor control disease, our patient developed neither retinopathy nor nephropathy. Although literature is not conclusive in the LJM value as preceding the retinopathy and nephropathy, it is recommended to be part of clinical assessment of type 1DM patients as it might worn the presence of microvascular complications sooner. In different studies, they found significant association of LJM and later development of retinopathy and nephropathy in diabetic patients regardless of the duration of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Limitation of hand functionality in our patient manifested as restricted flexion and extension of the hand fingers which is explained by the connective tissue disturbance affecting the palmar aspects of the hands as mentioned in the literature. Our patient had positive findings in the two clinical tests of LJM; “Tabletop” sign with moderate severity and positive “Prayer” sign both tests are considered helpful tools in the clinical assessment. However, the prayer sign is more sensitive compared to the “Tabletop” because it detects the early pathological changes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The growth failure is one of the features of poorly chronic diabetic children and adolescents. Our patient was short with poor growth velocity and had normal peak growth hormone level. However, poor glycemic control is affecting the growth hormone response at the tissue level. Oxford study found an association of LJM with growth impairment in chronic poorly controlled diabetic children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Our patient had long stay type 1 DM with persistent high HbA1c level, which was found to be significantly correlated with high serum concentrations of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE) which is responsible for skin collagen glycation and consistent with the early appearance of LJM and its correlation with long-term control.\n\n【23】Although LJMS is considered as an irreversible disorder and has no curative therapeutic options, the main stay of treatment is symptomatic medications ranging from simple, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to local corticosteroid injections to relieve the pain and to decrease tendinitis or ameliorate the flexor tendon contractures. Surgical intervention is limited to severe contractures.\n\n【24】Physiotherapy intervention targeting stretching exercises of the palm of the hand and fingers will help to prevent progression of the joint stiffness in these cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. We targeted the patient management for better glycemic control and referred her to physiotherapy for management. Intensive glycemic control, physiotherapy for passive palmar stretching, and occupational therapy have shown to improve the range of movement and hand functionality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Generally, since LJM is an association or complication of chronic uncontrolled diabetes, the best preventive measure is to target well-controlled glycemic range and to involve the family to prepare the appropriate environment for this target starting from the early diagnosis stage.\n\n【26】Over the last two decades, many experimental studies on medications with AGE inhibitory properties targeting AGE cross-links have shown beneficial effects. However, human trials still need to prove the safety of these medications which are not in clinical use yet 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【28】We presented a child with bilateral hand limited joint mobility limitation as one of the rare type 1 DM complications as an important indicator of the microvascular complications in this age group, which mandates to be examined for during the outpatient visits of diabetic children for early detection and management. Good glycemic control with clear HbA1c and daily glucose range targets are still the mainstay of prevention of such complication and its associations. The available therapeutic options include symptomatic relief and hand’s function preservation through physiotherapy awaiting solid and extensive clinical trials to prove the safety and usefulness of the new AGE inhibitors.\n\n【29】#### Data Availability\n\n【30】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【31】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【32】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

He had exhibited a tendency to bleed for the last 16 years and had visited several medical institutions, but no diagnosis had been made. Since the risk of sudden bleeding was assumed to be high due to his age, we decided to examine him in our department. A coagulation abnormality with prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) of 4.5 and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 99.6 seconds was observed, but the platelet count, fibrinogen, and PIVKAII were within normal limits. Coagulation activities of factor V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII were all reduced. Anti-factor VIII and IX antibodies which were measured by the Bethesda method, lupus anti-coagulant (diluted Russell snake venom time method) and anti-cardiolipin antibody were also positive. The results of these tests were comparable to those undertaken 15 years ago when they were scrutinized at the university hospital. We suspected the presence of anti-factor V antibodies because there was a dissociation between the thrombotest values measured and those calculated from the PT-INR. Moreover, cross-mixing test showed an immediate inhibitor pattern. Subsequently, factor V antibodies were confirmed by the immunoblot method and the diagnosis of autoimmune factor V deficiency was made. When factor V, which is downstream of the coagulation cascade, is inhibited, coagulation test using the one-stage clotting method shows a pseudolow value. Therefore, extensive abnormalities of coagulation factor activity and inhibitor assay should be interpreted with caution, and the presence of a high titer of factor V inhibitor should be considered.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Autoimmune coagulation factor deficiency is a hemorrhagic disease caused by the appearance of autoantibodies to coagulation factors and inhibition of their bioactivity. Since a delay in diagnosis and treatment can be life-threatening, accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment are clinically important. Although there are numerous reports on acquired hemophilia caused by a deficiency of factor VIII, reports on other coagulation factor deficiencies are relatively rare.\n\n【4】Here, we report a confirmed case with autoimmune factor V (FV) deficiency diagnosed 16 years after the onset of symptoms, at the age of 70 years. Although the patient had symptoms of bleeding, he had reduced activity of many coagulation factors, which prevented us from identifying the cause of the disease earlier.\n\n【5】##### 1.1. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 70-year-old man presented to our hospital with complaint of right thigh pain. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a hematoma in the right thigh. We recommended hospitalization, but the patient wanted outpatient treatment with tranexamic acid because he had received the same treatment earlier for this condition. He received hemostatic infusion for three consecutive days in the outpatient clinic, and hemoglobin level of 13.2 g/dl from one month ago dropped to 11.3 g/dl on the day of injury and to 7.9 g/dl two days after the injury. However, there was no further progression of anemia and the pain decreased. Therefore, the infusion was stopped on the fourth day.\n\n【7】When we looked at the past medical records, he had presented to our hospital with the principal complaint of persistent subcutaneous hemorrhage at the age of 54 years. He had an abnormal prothrombin time (PT) % of 21.0% and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) of 99.4 seconds. Consequently, he was referred to two university hospitals but no specific cause could be found. The doctor at the hospital had said, “factor VIII 4.7% and factor IX 0.6% suggest a broad spectrum of coagulation factor abnormalities. Although he had positive lupus anticoagulant (LAC), the diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome could not be made. We cannot make a diagnosis, but FFP improves the coagulation activity to some extent, so use it in the event of bleeding.” Subsequently, there were numerous recurrent bleeding events, with major bleeding occurring every two years, such as in the ilium, pelvic cavity, subdural, iliopsoas, brachial muscles, and mediastinum . However, many of these bleeds healed spontaneously within a few days with conservative treatment. For this reason, the patient was given the provisional diagnosis of “circulating anticoagulant factor disorder” at the outpatient clinic of our hospital. Considering the age of the patient, the possibility of additional serious bleeding events was high, and therefore, we decided to examine the patient again.\n\n【8】(a)\n\n【9】(b)\n\n【10】(c)\n\n【11】(d)\n\n【12】(e)\n\n【13】(f)\n\n【14】(g)\n\n【15】(h)\n\n【16】(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g)   \n(h)\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【18】Major bleeding events that occurred during the course of the disease. 55 years old: intestinal hematoma (a). 59 years old: right glenohumeral and small pelvic cavity hematoma (b). 60 years old: left subacute subdural hematoma and small pelvic cavity hematoma (c). 60 years old: left acute subdural hematoma (d). 63 years old: intramuscular hematoma in the left iliopsoas muscle (e). 67 years old: right brachial intramuscular hematoma (f). 69 years old: intramediastinal hemorrhage (g). 70 years old: right intramuscular hematoma in the right thigh (h). (b)–(h) were light and managed with conservative treatment with tranexamic acid.\n\n【19】He had never undergone a gastroscopy or surgery until the age of 54. He had no history of chronic diseases, such as allergic diseases and collagen diseases. His only regular medication was tranexamic acid. There was no subcutaneous hemorrhaging on physical examination. Blood tests showed a prolonged PT-INR of 4.5, along with aPTT of 99.6 seconds . As reported 16 years ago, coagulation activities of factor V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII were all reduced (1–26.5%). In addition, lupus anticoagulant (diluted Russell snake venom time method) and cardiolipin antibodies were positive, as were anti-factor VIII and IX antibodies by the Bethesda method.\n\n【20】Table 1 \n\n【21】The main blood test of coagulation system at the university hospital 15 years ago and this visit.\n\n【22】Both PT-INR and aPTT were prolonged, which led us to suspect diseases such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), liver failure, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, vitamin K deficiency (including due to warfarin), and drugs (heparin, argatroban, and DOAC). However, platelet count, Fib, and proteins induced by vitamin K antagonism (PIVKA) test were within the normal range, and the disease course did not fit these diagnoses.\n\n【23】Therefore, we suspected a deficiency of coagulation factor II, V, and X which are common to the coagulation pathways evaluated by PT and aPTT. We first performed the hepaplastin test (HPT) and thrombotest (TT) to investigate whether the coagulation tests changed with factor V (FV) supplementation . The TT value was 3.7%, while the TT value calculated from PT-INR was 21% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We determined that the patient was FV deficient because of the difference in TT induced by a high-dose of bovine FV supplementation.\n\n【24】Next, we performed a cross-mixing test to determine whether FV deficiency was congenital or acquired. The results showed an immediate type of inhibitory pattern . Incubation at 37°C for 2 hours is required for anti-factor VIII antibody because of its weak inhibitory effect, whereas anti-FV antibody has a strong binding power and does not require incubation. This case also showed an immediate inhibitory response, suggesting the presence of anti-FV antibodies.\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【26】Cross-mixing test.\n\n【27】Since anti-FV antibody measurement is a laboratory-level test, we asked other institutions to measure them. As expected, both an immunoblot assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using purified human plasma FV confirmed the presence of anti-FV autoantibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and he was diagnosed with autoimmune FV deficiency. The plan is to treat him with immunosuppressive drugs in the future.\n\n【28】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【29】FV deficiency is a rare disease and is known to cause major bleeding in some cases, but there are no reported cases with long-term untreated follow-up. Since this case had not been diagnosed earlier, therefore, we were able to obtain the clinical history for the last 16 years. The main feature of this case was that the correct diagnosis could not be made due to the extensive abnormalities found in the coagulation factor activity and inhibitor assays. The underlying reason is that the phenomenon of “pseudodeficiency of multiple coagulation factors” is not well known.\n\n【30】The prevalence of autoimmune FV deficiency is extremely low, at 0.09 cases per million individuals per year, compared with 1.48 cases with autoimmune FVIII deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Primary symptoms differ from hemophilia A in that the majority of the primary symptoms are urologic, gastrointestinal, and respiratory bleeding, and there is little intra-articular bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. While usually asymptomatic, 12–17% patients may have fatal bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most cases are idiopathic, but some cases may occur with cancer or collagen disease in the background or after the use of surgical hemostatic agents (e.g. bovine-derived thrombin products) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This case was considered idiopathic because there was no history of previous gastroscopy or surgery. Normally no treatment is necessary. However, in the event of bleeding, treatment with FV supplementation is used as a coping strategy. Although fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is often used, platelet transfusion is also considered useful because of the abundance of coagulation FV in platelet alpha granules.\n\n【31】This case was characterized by the phenomenon of “pseudodeficiency of multiple coagulation factors” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>, and knowledge of the one-stage clotting method, which is also performed in this case, is essential to understand this phenomenon (Suppl). The one-stage clotting method is a PT or aPTT-based assay that is widely used for the measurement of coagulation factor activity and inhibitors due to its simplicity and automation of the measurement system. The coagulation factor activity assay is performed by mixing the target factor-deficient plasma with the patient’s plasma, and the coagulation inhibitor assay is performed by mixing the patient’s plasma with normal plasma, and the resulting plasma is used to measure PT or aPTT. In other words, these assays do not measure the activity of a coagulation factor itself, but rather perform an indirect search for the activity of a coagulation factor by measuring the time at which fibrin is formed (clotting time). Therefore, this assay system cannot detect unexpected abnormalities such as anti-FV antibodies as in our case. In such cases, the clotting time is always prolonged by any coagulation factor activity or inhibitor assay because FV activity, which is downstream of the coagulation cascade, is inhibited by the anti-FV antibody. Dilute Russell’s viper venom time (dRVVT) is always an outlier for the same reason. To prevent “pseudodeficiency of multiple coagulation factors,” the two-step coagulation method, the chromogenic substrate method, and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) method are available, but they are not widely used because of their complexity.\n\n【32】The diagnosis in this case was made by a traditional assay called TT and HPT (Suppl). This assay confirms the activity of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors by adding the coagulation factor other than II, VII, and X (created by absorbing the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors with barium sulfate) and the activator to patient plasma. The activator is thromboplastin, differentiated by the fact that TT is bovine and HPT is of rabbit origin. The usefulness of this test for determining FV deficiency has been reported in the past 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Furthermore, the present case was positive for cardiolipin antibodies, which are also found in other cases of acquired FV inhibition, suggesting a common mechanism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The assay system for detecting cardiolipin antibodies is the indirect ELISA (Suppl). The indirect ELISA measures not only anti-cardiolipin antibodies that bind to cardiolipin but also antibodies to plasma proteins that bind to cardiolipin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Since FV is known to attach to phospholipids via the C2 domain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, this finding should not indicate the presence of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and is considered false positive. However, this is only conjecture and essentially requires direct proof by immunoprecipitation.\n\n【34】In conclusion, we have described a case of autoimmune FV deficiency that went undiagnosed for 16 years due to “pseudodeficiency of multiple coagulation factors.” Autoimmune FV deficiency requires early diagnosis and treatment because of the life-threatening bleeding that may occur once every two years. When, as in the present case, extensive abnormalities of the coagulation factor activity and inhibitor assays are found, the presence of a high titer of FV inhibitor should be considered and the laboratory values should be interpreted carefully. In such a case, diagnosis using TT and HPT is considered useful.\n\n【35】Both PT and aPTT showed an inhibitor pattern. In addition, unlike anti-factor VIII antibody, there was little change after 2 hours of incubation because it showed an immediate type of reaction.\n\n【36】#### Data Availability\n\n【37】Data of the case report are available upon request to the corresponding author via mail.\n\n【38】#### Consent\n\n【39】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【40】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【41】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The detection of anti-factor 5 antibodies in this case was performed as a research of the Japanese Collaborative Research Group (JCRG) on Acquired Coagulopathies Supported by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.

These tests indirectly measure the activity or inhibitors of the clotting factors by measuring the time of fibrin formation (clotting time).

The patient was a 67-year old man who received 70 Gy radiation therapy to treat nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Eight years later, he suffered a pathological fracture of the right clavicle. One year after the fracture, surgical treatment was performed due to persistent pain and weakness. Radiographs demonstrated atrophic nonunion. Bone scan demonstrated hot uptake at both ends of the fractured bone. MRI demonstrated a formation of pseudoarthrosis with fluid collection and suggested bone marrow edema at both ends of the fracture fragments. In surgery, fibrous pseudoarthrosis tissue was excised and both ends of the fracture fragments were refreshed to identify bleeding. Open reduction and internal fixation using a 7-hole locking plate and autologous bone grafting were performed. Successful bony union was obtained 1 year postoperatively, and no adverse events were observed up to 52 months after the operation.

There has been no previous reports detailing the use of locking plate for the treatment of radiation-associated fractures of the clavicle. We report a case of radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle, which was treated by locking plate fixation and autologous bone grafting.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient gave the informed consent prior being included into the study. The patient was a 67-year old man who received 70 Gy radiation therapy for the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. He received 20 Gy radiation therapy to the nasopharynx and 50 Gy to the supraclavicular fossa. He had concomitant hypothyroidism. He suffered osteoradionecrosis and osteomyelitis of the mandible and received hemimandibulectomy 6 years after the radiation therapy. He was also a smoker.\n\n【6】Eight years after the radiation therapy, he suffered a pathological fracture of the right clavicle without apparent trauma. The fracture was treated conservatively at an orthopaedic clinic; however, bony union was not obtained. The displacement increased over time, and he was referred to our hospital. One year after the fracture, surgical treatment was performed due to persistent pain and weakness.\n\n【7】Radiographs demonstrated atrophic nonunion with displacement . Bone scan demonstrated hot uptake at both ends of the fractured bone . MRI demonstrated a formation of pseudoarthrosis with fluid collection and suggested bone marrow edema at both ends of the fracture fragments .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Preoperative radiograph of the fractured right clavicle demonstrating atrophic nonunion. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Preoperative bone scan demonstrating hot uptake at both ends of the fractured bone. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| Preoperative MRI STIR images demonstrating a formation of pseudoarthrosis with fluid collection and suggesting bone marrow edema at both ends of the fracture fragments. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】In surgery, fibrous pseudoarthrosis tissue was excised and both ends of the fracture fragments were refreshed to identify bleeding.

Discussion\n\n【21】Past reports suggest that fractures occur primarily with radiation doses >50 Gy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>. Our patient received 70 Gy radiation, and fracture occurred without apparent trauma; therefore, the fracture was diagnosed as a radiation-associated pathological fracture. Biopsy for pathology and culture are required for further investigation in these cases. The nonunion rate of radiation-associated fractures is reported as high at around 50%, and healing times tend to be long in fractures that eventually heal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The fracture developed atrophic nonunion radiographically. Difficulties in achieving bony union were predicted by the radiographic appearance. On the other hand, hot uptake at both ends of the fracture fragments was observed by a bone scan, and the finding suggested the existence of some biological bone activity. We hypothesized that the MRI finding of bone marrow edema suggested some biological bone activity even though the finding might be considered to show postirradiation change in the bone. However, because biological activity is considered to decrease as a result of radiation, we tried to achieve bony union by osteosynthesis with autologous bone grafting. If the bone activity was totally eliminated by radiation, vascularized bone graft should be necessary.\n\n【22】Due to the difficulty in obtaining bony union in radiation-associated fracture nonunions of the clavicle, past reports have recommended claviculectomy or resection of the pseudoarthrosis site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. These procedures have been reported to be effective for pain relief and patient comfort. Only two clinical reports have described successful open reduction and internal fixation of radiation-associated clavicle fractures. Wera et al. reported on open reduction and internal fixation of radiation-associated clavicle fractures for 3 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Two patients obtained bony union, and the remaining patient did not appear to achieve radiographic union but showed no loss of reduction at 28 months postoperatively. Fuchs et al. described the plate fixation and free vascularized corticoperiosteal bone graft for the treatment of radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle in two patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The fractures healed with good clinical results.\n\n【23】Wera et al. used autologous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest and demineralized bone matrix for the first patient, bone cement and allograft cancellous bone chips for the second patient, and demineralized bone matrix for the third patient as a void filler and enhancer of bone healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Fuchs et al. used a free vascularized corticoperiosteal bone graft from the medial femoral condyle to enhance bone healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We believe some supplementary bone healing enhancement is necessary and used autologous cancellous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest. Other tools enhancing bone healing, for example, bone morphogenetic proteins may also be useful; however, we consider that autologous bone grafting is better as it is osteogenic, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive. Vascularized bone graft is also a good option; however, it is technically challenging. Our treatment result suggests that autologous cancellous bone graft harvested from the iliac crest is sufficient for bony union. If a nonvascularized bone grafting fails, a vascularized bone grafting may become salvage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Locking plate is a new technology which provides excellent angular stability and also preserves biology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Irradiated bone results in a decrease in the circulation to bone and bone quality. Therefore, we think fixation using locking plate is superior to conventional plate fixation in both the biological and mechanical aspects. Locking plate fixation is thought to be a good choice for surgical treatment of radiation-associated fracture/nonunion of the clavicle.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】Our case suggests that a locking plate provides sufficient fixation and autologous bone grafting is effective in enhancing bone healing in a radiation-associated fracture nonunion of the clavicle in which it is difficult to achieve bony union.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】The utilization of coronary stents has been the most important advancement in the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). A rare but potentially serious complication of stent usage is dislodgment of the stent from the balloon catheter before the deployment and subsequent dislocation of the stent into the vascular system.

The decision was made to place a stent due to the existing plaque fracture and the improved long-term outcome results already achieved with stents. A  mm Ephesos stent was selected. Stent could not be advanced through the lesion. After several attempts the stent was pulled back into the guiding catheter.

Discussion\n\n【17】Stent dislodgment and migration is an uncommon problem. But as a result of the universal use of premounted stents invasive cardialogists may come across with it more often. Stent dislodgement from the delivery system most often occurs while the stent-balloon assembly is pulled back into the guiding catheter, because the target lesion either could not be reached or could not be passed. Factors predisposing to the inability of stent delivery are poor support of the guiding catheter or the guide wire, vessel tortuosity proximal to the lesion, and severe vessel calcification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. In the event of stent dislodgment the primary objective should be the retrieval of dislodged stent from the coronary circulation due to the possibility of significant complications.

The use of small balloon catheters is effective, especially in cases where a stent is still riding on a guide wire and is deployed enough to advance a smallballoon catheter through its lumen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In our case the small balloon catheter was the right tool for successful retrieval of a stent from the SVG-RCA.

The period of continuous irrigation was 12–16 days. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was demonstrated in case 1 by culture and PCR, whereas histology showed tuberculous lesion with caseous necrosis in both cases. Postoperative MRI showed markedly reduced abscesses after 3 months in both cases. The signal intensity in vertebral bodies was improved.

Introduction\n\n【3】Since tuberculous (TB) spondylitis does not induce strong acute inflammation such as that observed for pyogenic spondylitis, patients are unlikely to visit a clinic immediately after onset and tend to be diagnosed after progression of bone destruction and abscess formation, even if neurological dysfunction has not yet developed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】As for treatment, conservative therapy using antituberculous agents has been used for early-stage disease without nerve paralysis and with little destruction of vertebral bodies, while surgical therapy aimed at focal resection and spinal reconstruction has been performed in cases displaying advanced bone destruction combined with paralysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Recently, as an application of minimally invasive percutaneous nucleotomy (PN) under local anesthesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, good surgical outcomes have been reported for pyogenic spondylitis using percutaneous curettage and continuous irrigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.

Case Reports\n\n【7】Case 1. A 74-year-old woman with a history of gastric cancer presented with a chief complaint of lower back pain. Subjective lower back pain emerged approximately 4 months prior to her visit to our institute.  \nOn admission, deep tendon reflexes in both legs (patella tendon reflex (PTR) and Achilles tendon reflex (ATR)) were found to be decreased and hypoaesthesia was identified in the left L4 sensory region. Muscle weakness was observed in the left tibialis anterior muscle according to the manual muscle test (MMT), with a score of 4. Mild perianal hypoesthesia was observed. Neurologically, cauda equina syndrome and radiculopathy at and below the L4 level were identified.  \nRegarding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), T1-weighted imaging showed overall signal hypointensity for both L3 and L4 vertebral bodies, although T2-weighted imaging showed signal hyperintensity presumably indicating abundant abscess accumulation in the disc space, a lesion suspected to be epidural abscess in the spinal canal, and marked compression of the dural sac (Figure 1(a)). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed multiple abscess formation around vertebral bodies with calcification inside (Figure 1(b)). The preoperative diagnosis was infectious spondylitis (TB or pyogenic).  \nSurgery was started with the patient in the lateral position under local anaesthesia. According to the PN manoeuvre, percutaneous puncture was performed into the L3/4 intervertebral disc. A sheath was inserted into the disc space to aspirate 30 mL of abscess, and lower back pain reduced immediately thereafter. Curettage was performed while checking anteroposterior and lateral views on an X-ray image intensifier. Finally, an epidural tube as the in-tube and a drainage tube of 3 mm diameter as the out-tube were indwelled in the disc space and the operation was completed. Continuous irrigation was then started.  \nOn postoperative day 3, Mycobacterium tuberculosis was detected as Gaffky grade 2. M. tuberculosis infection was also confirmed by tuberculosis-polymerase chain reaction (TB-PCR). Irrigation was thus continued until postoperative day 16 using a washing solution of 200 mL saline containing 1000 mg streptomycin each day. Multidrug antituberculous therapy was started using pyramide (900 mg/d), isoniazid (300 mg/d), rifampicin (300 mg/d), and ethambutol (500 mg/d). Immediately after the completion of irrigation, the patient wore a lumbar brace and started rehabilitation of walking and muscle strength of the legs. Histology showed typical TB tissue with central caseous necrosis, surrounded by epithelioid cells and Langhans-type giant cells. Severe lower back pain also resolved almost completely by 1-2 weeks postoperatively.  \nMRI at 3 months postoperatively showed a clear tendency toward recovery of normal signal intensity in the L3 and L4 vertebral bodies on T1-weighted imaging, while most of the abscess with high signal intensity had disappeared from T2-weighted imaging. Good improvements were seen in both diagnostic imaging and clinical symptoms, with no tendency toward recurrence in blood biochemistry. All antituberculous agents were therefore discontinued at 7 months postoperatively. On MRI at 18 months postoperatively, signal intensity in vertebral bodies had completely recovered on T1-weighted imaging. No signal hyperintense regions were apparent in the disc space or epidurally to suggest abscess recurrence on T2-weighted imaging (Figure 1(c)). In addition, plain radiography indicated complete bone union at 30 months postoperatively (Figure 1(d)). At present, 7 years and 6 months after surgery, follow-up has shown good condition with no relapse of symptoms.\n\n【8】(a)\n\n【9】(b)\n\n【10】(c)\n\n【11】(d)\n\n【12】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| (a) Preoperative MRI in Case 1: T2-weighted imaging.

A 64-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with lower back pain and a history of surgery for leg varicose veins. Lower back pain had emerged about 3.5 months prior to her visit to our institute, with gradual worsening. The patient complained that lower back pain had never improved since onset and had been exacerbated by even slight exercise such as standing and walking.  \nRegarding MRI, T1-weighted imaging showed overall signal hypointensity in both L2 and L3 vertebral bodies, whereas T2-weighted imaging showed signal hyperintensity presumably indicating abscess accumulation in the disc space extending to inside the L2 vertebral body. Subsequent gadolinium-enhanced imaging showed diffuse contrast in both L2 and L3 vertebral bodies and rim enhancement around the abscess in the right psoas muscle (Figure 2(a)). CT showed a destructive change in the L2 vertebral endplate, and cavitations ≥10 mm in diameter were found in vertebral bodies (Figure 2(c)). Preoperative diagnosis was infectious spondylitis (TB or pyogenic).  \nSurgery was performed similar to that described for Case 1. A sheath was inserted into the L2/3 disc space to allow curettage of infected disc tissue. Finally, a 3 mm diameter in-tube and a 5 mm diameter drainage tube as the out-tube were indwelled in the disc space and the operation was completed. Continuous irrigation was started.  \nHistology on postoperative day 9 showed epithelioid cells centred around caseous necrosis, and QuantiFERON TB-2G showed strongly positive results. TB spondylitis was therefore finally diagnosed. Irrigation was performed until postoperative day 12 using only 250 mL of saline each day. Multidrug antituberculous therapy was started using isoniazid (300 mg/d), rifampicin (450 mg/d) and ethambutol (750 mg/d). After completion of irrigation, the patient wore a lumbar brace and started rehabilitation, mainly for walking. Strong lower back pain also disappeared by about 1-2 weeks postoperatively.  \nMRI at 3 months postoperatively showed recovery to normal signal intensity from signal hypointensity in the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies, except for the cavity area on T1-weighted imaging. On T2-weighted imaging, part of the signal hyperintense area remained, but was restricted to the disc space and vertebral bodies, with disappearance of abscess in the right iliopsoas muscle (Figure 2(b)). By 6 months postoperatively, diagnostic imaging showed good improvement, as did clinical symptoms. There was no evidence of recurrence from blood biochemistry. Administration of all antituberculous agents was thus discontinued at 6 months postoperatively. At 12 months, signal intensity in L2 and L3 vertebral bodies had normalized on T1-weighted imaging. No signal hyperintense regions were seen in the disc space, inside vertebral bodies or in the psoas muscle on T2-weighted imaging.  \nBy 6 months postoperatively, CT showed repair of the L2 vertebral body cavity and bone remodelling, and the cavities was clearly reduced. At 12 months postoperatively, the cavity was completely repaired and disappeared (Figure 2(d)). At the time of writing, although complete bone union has not been achieved, follow-up shows good condition without relapse of symptoms at 24 months postoperatively.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| (a) Preoperative gadolinium imaging, axial image.

Discussion\n\n【19】TB spondylitis resistant to conservative therapy is treated surgically by focal dissection of sequestrum and abscess, followed by spinal reconstruction using bone graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As less biofilm formation by M. tuberculosis is seen around metal implants than by other pyogenic bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, surgical treatment in combination with spinal instrumentation is increasingly considered acceptable. Reported methods include support by posterior instrumentation after curettage of the anterior parts of vertebral bodies and bone graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> and reconstruction using anterior instrumentation after curettage and bone graft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A method to obtain strong stability has also been reported using not only bone graft but also a titanium cage for reconstruction of vertebral bodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. These methods have recently been applied to pyogenic spondylitis but are definitely highly invasive surgeries, either as 1- or 2-stage procedure.\n\n【20】Conversely, a method of percutaneous surgery for pyogenic spondylitis is available as an alternative to conservative treatment with antibiotic administration or open surgery. In 1990, Onik et al. reported 3 cases of automated percutaneous discectomy for the purpose of biopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Yu et al. provided the first report of percutaneous discectomy in 2 cases of lumbar osteomyelitis using a nucleotome in 1991 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Nagata et al. later reported that good results were obtained through continuous irrigation with 2 indwelled tubes (an irrigation tube and drainage tube) in addition to percutaneous discectomy and local irrigation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Other methods have also been reported to obtain good results, including external fixation in combination with percutaneous surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, secure local debridement using an endoscope 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and abscess drainage and continuous irrigation, even in cases with marked abscess and bone destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Most reports of percutaneous discectomy have involved continuous irrigation and drainage of pyogenic spondylodiscitis. No reports have described advanced TB spondylitis.\n\n【22】Dinc et al. performed CT-guided percutaneous drainage in 21 cases of TB psoas and spondylodiscitic abscess, with periods of drainage of up to 36 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. However, 6 of these cases showed recurrence after removal of the drainage catheter. In a report of percutaneous discectomy in 16 cases of lumbar spondylodiscitis (including 1 case of TB), the primary objective was definitive diagnosis by focal biopsy. Three cases later required interbody fusion by open surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Surgical methods for TB spondylitis with marked abscess formation and bone destruction have been thought to require direct pus drainage, focal resection, and spinal reconstruction by bone graft. However, for patients with no advanced motor palsy before surgery, and no severe kyphotic deformity associated with vertebral body destruction or severe spinal instability, the method described herein can be expected to be effective not only for pyogenic spondylitis but also for TB spondylitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This chronic lymph leakage leads to a state of immunosuppression secondary to the loss of humoral and cellular components of the immune system and represents a potential risk factor for opportunistic infections. We report a case of protein-losing enteropathy in a seemingly immunocompetent patient. An intestinal histopathological study revealed the unusual association of lymphangiectasia and intestinal cryptococcosis. Although cryptococcal infection is common in immunocompromised patients, intestinal involvement is rarely reported. We found no reports on the association of intestinal cryptococcosis in patients with lymphangiectasia. This case report is the first to describe intestinal cryptococcosis associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case\n\n【3】A 37-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain exacerbation of 3 hours of evolution associated diarrhea with melena. The patient had a documented medical history of intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhea over the 6 months prior to the current admission. Upon admission, the patient presented febrile and in anasarca, with major edema in lower limbs. Initial blood work showed moderate microcytic anemia (Hb 10.3 g/dl, Hct. 23.7%, and MCV 75 fL), severe hypoalbuminemia (1.7 g/dL), inversion of albumin/globulin ratio, and CBC did not show signs of infection.\n\n【4】The patient was started on protein replenishment with human albumin which resolved partially the edema.\n\n【5】An exhaustive workout was performed to identify the underlying cause of the edema and low protein levels. Liver disease was ruled out due to normal liver profile (total bilirubin 0.21 mg/dL, indirect bilirubin 0.11 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 0.10 mg/dL, AST 9 IU/L, and ALT 8 IU/L) and the negative liver ultrasound. Nephrotic syndrome was also ruled out as a possible diagnosis.\n\n【6】Due to the persistence of abdominal pain, structural damage or tumor processes were investigated; however, abdominal CT only showed edema in the small intestine wall suggesting chronic enteropathy.\n\n【7】Although the patient was considered initially immunocompetent, there was a significant drop in complement C3 0.5 g/L (negative <0.8 g/L) and C4 0.03 g/L (negative <0.10 g/L). Further laboratory testing showed hypogammaglobulinemia (22 mg/dL IgA (normal 22–149 mg/dL), 150 mg/dL IgG (normal 615–1530 mg/dL), 20 mg/dL IgM (normal 31–272 mg/dL)), and 20 mL/24 hrs α\\-1 antitrypsin clearance.\n\n【8】An upper digestive endoscopy was performed showing a whitish lace pattern and erythematous walls in the second portion of the duodenum. In addition, a colonoscopy showed hemorrhoidal packages, multiple ulcerated lesions in sigma, and elevated, pseudopolypoid, infiltrative lesions in cecum and ileocecal valve.\n\n【9】Since our patient lived in a tuberculosis endemic area and that the lesions simulated intestinal tuberculosis, empirical antituberculosis therapy (isoniazid 75 mg, rifampicin 150 mg, ethambutol 275 mg, and pyrazinamide 400 mg) was started until biopsy results came back.\n\n【10】Multiple cryptococci were found in samples taken from the cecum, sigma, and ileocecal valve using the techniques of immunohistochemistry CD68, Grocott stain, PAS stain, and Alcian blue stain . In addition, the presence of intestinal lymphangiectasia was confirmed with D240 staining .\n\n【11】(a)\n\n【12】(b)\n\n【13】(c)\n\n【14】(d)\n\n【15】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【17】Macrophages loaded with cryptococcal spores (arrowhead): (a) PAS staining, (b) Grocott staining, (c) Alcian blue staining, and (d) immunohistochemistry CD68.\n\n【18】(a)\n\n【19】(b)\n\n【20】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【22】Histopathological biopsy study obtained from the lower gastrointestinal tract.

Due to the severity of the presentation octreotide was started along with dietary treatment. Octreotide and oral fluconazole 600 mg were maintained for 90 days after discharge with favorable symptomatic evolution, additionally, following laboratory controls shown that albumin levels went back to normal.\n\n【24】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Cryptococcosis is one of the most frequent opportunistic fungal diseases. Its incidence in Latin America has been increasing, reaching approximately 5300 cases in 2017. However, intestinal dissemination is rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【26】An exhaustive literature review in the Medline databases was performed using the terms “gastrointestinal cryptococcosis” and “intestinal lymphangiectasia.” We identified a total of 10 case reports of intestinal cryptococcosis in the context of immunosuppressing conditions which are summarized in Table 1; however, we were unable to find reports similar to our case. The lack of literature on the coalescence of these conditions suggests that this work is the first description of intestinal cryptococcosis associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia.\n\n【27】Table 1 \n\n【28】Case reports of intestinal cryptococcosis in the context of immunosuppressing conditions.\n\n【29】The countries with the highest incidence of common presentations of Cryptococcosis are Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. The infection occurs through contact with soil or eucalyptus trees contaminated with birds’ feces. Most of these cases occur in young male patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, and in much lesser proportion in immunocompetent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【30】The infection involves the central nervous system (CNS) in almost 70% of cases, being the most common cause of meningitis in HIV/AIDS patients. Lung involvement is the second most common presentation and presents as infiltrations or granulomatous reactions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【31】The increasing prevalence of patients diagnosed with AIDS has been proportional to the increase in opportunistic infections such as Cryptococcosis. The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has modified its presentation, resulting in atypical locations. Intestinal cryptococcosis is believed to be through direct inoculation rather than hematogenous dissemination since blood cultures were always negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The apparent immunocompetence of our patient and his unspecific symptomatology made his diagnosis a real challenge, misguiding the diagnostic suspicion towards more common gastrointestinal tract infections such as tuberculosis. Similar situations happened in a large number of reported cases of intestinal cryptococcosis, in which diagnosis occurred incidentally.\n\n【33】Out of 11 case reports of gastrointestinal cryptococcosis, only Sciaudone G presented an immunocompetent patient while the rest reported immunologically compromised patients. The correlation between immunocompromised and intestinal cryptococcosis is well documented. Patients with advanced stages of HIV (CD4 < 200), with malignant processes (solid or hematological tumors), treatment with immunosuppressants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>, organ-transplanted 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, or cirrhotic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 12\\]</u> are considered as high-risk subjects.\n\n【34】Intestinal lymphangiectasia can produce a state of secondary immunodeficiency. The pathological dilation of lymphatic vessels in the intestinal wall, especially in the submucosa, causes chronic loss of lymph containing immunoglobulins and lymphocytes (predominantly naïve CD4 and CD8 T cells) and severe hypoalbuminemia. This state of secondary immunodeficiency is of difficult diagnosis and poses a high risk for opportunistic fungal infections such as cryptococcosis, as in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Our patient’s age was accord with the average age of intestinal cryptococcosis presentation reported in the literature (37 years, ranging from 26 to 73 years) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Abdominal pain was the most common initial symptom in patients infected with Cryptococcus. The onset of pain in reported cases ranged from 2 days to 6 months; however, the majority exceeded 3 weeks. In addition, 66% of patients had fever at some point in the course of the illness associated with vomiting and nausea sporadically. Despite being an invasive intestinal pathology, only half of the patients had diarrhea, and only 25% had bloody diarrhea or melena. Any gastrointestinal organ can be affected.\n\n【37】Through endoscopy, suggestive lesions, as ulcers or abscesses, and signs of inflammation can be evidenced. However, ulcers can be similar to those produced in malignancy, other infections (Cytomegalovirus, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania donovani, etc.), or Crohn’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 7, 11, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Although management varies depending on the localization of infection, fluconazole 400 to 800 mg once daily for 8 weeks followed by medium doses for 12 months can be used empirically. Intravenous amphotericin B is considered as the first line of treatment for disseminated Cryptococcus; however, its use in gastrointestinal cryptococcosis is not well studied (F. Cicora) (Rupashree Sundar).\n\n【39】The cryptococcal infection had high mortality rates in immunocompromised patients; however, it is important to consider that in the majority of reports the patient’s general condition was already severely compromised due to the advanced state of the underlying disease prior to infection.\n\n【40】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【41】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "7da57770-70dd-4e12-a4c2-5eb09244c3e2", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Background. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), also known as the immotile-cilia syndrome, is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous syndrome. Improper function of the cilia causes impaired mucociliary clearance. Neonatal respiratory distress, rhinosinusitis, recurrent chest infections, wet cough, and otitis media are respiratory presentations of this disease. It could also manifest as infertility in males as well as laterality defects in both sexes, such as situs abnormalities (Kartagener syndrome). During the past decade, numerous pathogenic variants in 40 genes have been identified as the causatives of primary ciliary dyskinesia. DNAH11 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 11) is a gene that is responsible for the production of cilia’s protein and encodes the outer dynein arm. Dynein heavy chains are motor proteins of the outer dynein arms and play an essential role in ciliary motility. Case Presentation. A 3-year-old boy, the offspring of consanguineous parents, was referred to the pediatric clinical immunology outpatient department with a history of recurrent respiratory tract infections and periodic fever. Furthermore, on medical examination, situs inversus was recognized. His lab results revealed elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP). Serum IgG, IgM, and IgA levels were normal, while IgE levels were elevated. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for the patient. WES demonstrated a novel homozygous nonsense variant in DNAH11 (c.5247G > A; p. Trp1749Ter). Conclusion. We reported a novel homozygous nonsense variant in DNAH11 in a 3-year-old boy with primary ciliary dyskinesia. Biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the many coding genes involved in the process of ciliogenesis lead to PCD.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Axonemal structure dysfunction has been identified as being related to the emerging classes of disorders collectively known as “ciliopathies.” Examples include primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)/Kartagener syndrome, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, hydrocephalus, polycystic kidney disease, polycystic liver disease, nephronophthisis, Meckel–Gruber syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Alstrom syndrome, Jeune syndrome, laterality defects, etc. Primary ciliary dyskinesia, also known as the immotile-cilia syndrome, is a heterogeneous, mostly autosomal recessive genetic disorder and the first human disorder related to the motility dysfunction of cilia. Impaired mucociliary function due to defective axonemal structure leads to PCD recurrent respiratory manifestations (chronic bronchitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, otitis media, and pneumonia), male infertility, as well as laterality defects such as situs abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Autosomal dominant variants of PCD have also been reported in FOXJ1\\-linked ciliary dyskinesia due to de-novo mutations (OMIM 618699, 602291) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Over 300 genes have been identified to be involved in the function and morphology of the cilia, and at least 40 genes are involved in the inappropriate function of the cilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) and dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1 (DNAI1) are the most disease-causing genes involved in the pathogenesis of PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. DNAH11 (dynein axonemal heavy chain 11) is a gene, which is responsible for the production of cilia’s protein and encodes the outer dynein arm. Dynein heavy chains are motor proteins of the outer dynein arms and play an essential role in ciliary motility. Patients with pathogenic variants in this gene present symptoms associated with PCD but have normal cilia ultrastructure. The clinical manifestations of DNAH11 pathogenic variants are usually similar to those of other variants causing PCD. The development of chronic middle ear infections and rhinosinusitis is the prominent feature of this disorder during childhood. In adulthood, the same symptoms persist; in addition, some radiological findings such as consolidations, atelectasis, and bronchiectasis might be discovered in high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of these patients. Moreover, bronchial colonization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa might be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Motile cilia can be found on the apical surfaces of the upper and lower respiratory tract, ependymal cells of CNS ventricles, oviducts (female reproductive system), and the flagellum of spermatozoa (male reproductive system) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Respiratory cilia consist of a central pair of singlet microtubules surrounded by nine microtubule pairs, which make a cross-sectional 9 + 2 arrangement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Proteins responsible for appropriate ciliary beating include inner and outer dynein arms that cause microtubules to slide through, generating ATP. The absence of the outer dynein arms, missed central pairs, and disarrangement of the microtubules are the ultrastructural defects causing PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Over the past 15 years, our understanding of effective clinical care for PCD has progressed remarkably. Although respiratory manifestations of PCD present early in life, no effective treatment is available to stop the disease progression. Available treatments for PCD are extrapolated from other diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【6】In this study, we describe a patient who was investigated for PCD through genetic testing that eventually resulted in the reporting of a novel mutation in DNAH11.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 3-year-old boy, the offspring of consanguineous parents (first cousin), was referred to the pediatric immunology outpatient department with a history of recurrent respiratory tract infection, growth retardation, periodic fever, persistent rhinorrhea, and wheezing. Also, his history revealed allergies to different foods. In his referral letter, mild bronchiectasis in CT scan was also noted.\n\n【9】He had a history of hospital admission about three months before the visit, with the chief complaints of fever and rhinorrhea. Furthermore, on medical examination, situs inversus was recognized (the heart was on the right, the liver was on the left, and the spleen was located on the right side of the body). His lab results revealed elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C reactive protein (CRP), and white blood cell count (WBC) . The patient had normal levels of serum IgG, IgM, and IgA and elevated levels of serum IgE. A sweat test was done for possible cystic fibrosis (CF), and the sodium and chloride levels were 38 and 35, respectively (normal range: 5–35, borderline: 35–60, and for CF: 60–200). In addition, levels of antibodies against diphtheria and tetanus were in the normal range.\n\n【10】Table 1 \n\n【11】Summary of patient’s lab results.\n\n【12】In the patient’s follow-up, he had no other complications or complaints. However, the patient was overweight with an increased level of triglycerides and cholesterol. He is receiving metformin, diet therapy, and medications for allergies (montelukast and sprays).\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Genetic Testing\n\n【14】Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for the patient at the Dr. von Hauner Children’s Hospital NGS facility using Agilent V6 + UTR library preparation and an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencing platform on DNAH11 (Transcript: NM\\001277115.2/Chromosome: 7p15.3-7p15.3). The bioinformatics analysis pipeline used Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA 0.7.15), genome analysis toolkit (GATK 3.6), variant effect predictor (VEP 89), and frequency filters with public and in house databases (e.g. ExAC, GnomAD, and GME). WES demonstrated a novel homozygous nonsense variant in DNAH11 (ENST00000409508: c.5247G > A) or p. Trp1749Ter (GRCh37.p13: 7:21698568 G->A stop).\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【16】We reported a novel homozygous nonsense variant in DNAH11 in a 3-year-old boy with primary ciliary dyskinesia born to a consanguineous family of Iranian descent. Our patient showed recurrent upper respiratory infections (URI), fever, and rhinorrhea, which were not responsive to typical medications prescribed for URI. Recurrent URI, born to a consanguineous parent, and situs inversus raised the susceptibility of genetic disorders such as primary immunodeficiencies. Due to the accessibility of genetic testing with an extended panel, we did not use any other tests to discover the pathology of the clinical manifestation. Furthermore, considering abnormal levels of serum immunoglobulins and blood cells, suspicion of genetic disorders was raised.\n\n【17】In the absence of prematurity and cystic fibrosis, a neonatal history of respiratory distress (pneumonia, cough, and tachycardia), rhinorrhea, otitis media, cough, and lateral defects should raise clinical suspicion of PCD, as it was manifested in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> .\n\n【18】Table 2 \n\n【19】Clinical presentation of PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【20】PCD is a heterogeneous genetic disease that is caused by pathogenic variants in proteins essential for cilia assembly and function. In the majority of patients, the inheritance pattern of PCD transmission is autosomal recessive; however, X\\-linked inheritance patterns have also been revealed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Several genes have been identified to cause PCD. Dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1 (DNAI1), DNAI2, dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5), DNAH11, and thioredoxin domain containing 3 (TXNDC3) encode components of the outer dynein Arm (ODA)通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Mutation of DNAH11, the first PCD gene identified in 1999, causes up to 14% of PCD cases. DNAI1 encodes intermediate dynein chain 1 of ODA. DNAH5, the second identified gene associated with PCD, explains more than 25% of PCD cases and encodes the major molecular motor of ODA, called heavy dynein chain 5 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Chromosome 14 open reading frame 104 gene (KTU) is responsible for cytoplasmic preassembly of axonemal dynein. Pathogenic variants in KTU have been reported to cause ciliary immotility and the absence of both dynein arms. Furthermore, pathogenic variants in the radial spoke head 9 homologue (RSPH9) and 4 homologues A (RSPH4A) genes lead to central microtubular pair abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Pathogenic variants in the retinitis pigmentosa guanosine triphosphatase regulator gene (RPGR), which play an important role in the maintenance of photoreceptors, are associated with X\\-linked recessive retinitis pigmentosa, dysfunction of sensory hearing, and PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Moreover, a single family has been described with pathogenic variants in the oral-facial-digital type 1 syndrome gene (OFD1) that are characterized by X\\-linked recessive mental retardation, macrocephaly, and PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Transient electron microscopy (TEM) was once considered the gold standard for recognizing patients with PCD. However, approximately 30% of PCD cases have normal ciliary beating patterns, such as DNAH11 and nexin-associated defects (e.g. CCDC65 and CCDC164), and thus would not be recognizable by TEM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, DNAH11 has a distinct phenotype characterized by a hyperkinetic beating pattern and decreased beating amplitude. Patients have recurrent respiratory infections due to impaired ciliary motility and bronchiectasis. Many genes have been shown to be related to the inversion of symmetry. The variant in DNAH11 is a likely explanation for situs inversus and recurrent infections in our patient. Pathogenic variants in the DNAH11 gene do not cause obvious ultrastructural defects identifiable by TEM. Therefore, DNAH11 could be overlooked if the diagnosis is established solely on TEM and further tests. Particularly, genetic testing is required to identify such pathogenic variants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 13\\]</u>. In our patient, genetic testing confirmed the final diagnosis, too. However, it should be considered that in approximately 35% of PCD patients, the genes are not discovered. Therefore, precise clinical evaluation and other differential diagnoses are of great importance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Until now, 39 genes have been identified as causing PCD, and any of the >200 genes involved in ciliary function could lead to PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, but so far, only 65% of PCD patients have been diagnosed with genetic testing. In conclusion, genetic testing should be considered as part of the diagnostic process as the most reliable test in patients with PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Gene sequencing for PCD is currently limited to the most prevalent alleles, including DNAH5, DNAI1, and DNAH11, in genetic panels; however, some companies provide whole exome or selective sequencing for PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【22】There are also some other criteria for PCD diagnosis. Levels of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) are low in PCD patients (<77 nl/min, normal range: 125 to 867 nl/min; mean, 287 nl/min); therefore, it can be a helpful test for PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Patients with CF also show low levels of nNO, so it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of PCD and should be ruled out in workups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Biopsies of respiratory epithelium could be used for ciliary motility evaluation to confirm PCD diagnosis; however, this approach is not sensitive enough to detect wide ranges of ciliary phenotype in this disease since the accuracy of high-speed video microscopy (HSVM) is limited and shows an overlap between PCD and normal patients in ciliary beat frequency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Taken together, no single gold standard test exists to diagnose PCD. To make an early and definite diagnosis, a combination of technical investigations, including nasal nitric oxide (nNO), high-speed video microscopy analysis (HVMA), and TEM, is required.\n\n【23】In both Europe and North America, children with PCD have been diagnosed recently with a median age of 5.5 and 5.0 years, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Taking a focused history and making an early diagnosis are beneficial for the early diagnosis of PCD. PCD is among the top differential diagnoses and must be ruled out in the following conditions: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> appropriate tests should exclude PCD in children with situs inversus totalis or any heterotaxic syndrome; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> children with cerebral ventriculomegaly should have a PCD diagnosis excluded; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> PCD should be excluded in babies with unexplained respiratory distress, especially when it is associated with other characteristics of PCD (respiratory manifestations are present in 65–87% of neonates, from mild transient tachypnoea to significant respiratory failure), if unexplained respiratory distress in term neonates is accompanied by atelectasis, the suspicion of PCD is raised; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> children with chronic productive cough, unknown bronchiectasis, and severe upper airway disease should be referred for diagnostic testing for PCD; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> males with immotile sperm should be considered for diagnostic testing for PCD; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> females with recurrent ectopic pregnancy should be considered for referral for diagnostic testing, especially if there are other associated symptoms of PCD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The association of infertility with PCD is because of the similarity between the structure of the sperm flagella and the ultrastructure of cilia. Infertility in women with PCD is due to dysfunction of the cilia in the fallopian tubes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Some medical disorders and phenotypes that may coexist with PCD include complex congenital heart disease, laterality defects, retinitis pigmentosa, hydrocephalus, pectus excavatum, and scoliosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Approximately 50% of PCD patients present situs anomalies that could be associated with congenital cardiac diseases, and in our patient, situs inversus was a clue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Schultz et al. reported two Finnish families with clinical picture of PCD, including chronic wet cough, otitis media, rhinosinusitis, and situs inversus. Diagnostic tests were done, and two likely pathogenic variants of the DNAH11 gene were identified (c.2341G > A, p. (Glu781Lys) and c.7645 + 5G > A) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another study conducted by Xia et al. reported a Chinese family with heterotaxy and congenital heart disease (CHD). Exome sequencing and sanger sequencing in a nonconsanguineous Han Chinese family with heterotaxy and CHD and 200 unrelated healthy subjects (control group) identified compound heterozygous variants (c.3426\\1G > A and c.4306\\C > T) in the DNAH11 gene, resulting in CHD and heterotaxy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【24】To date, no clinical treatments have been proven to improve ciliary dysfunction in PCD. Regular clearance techniques should be performed for patients with PCD to prevent pulmonary infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Routine management of PCD pulmonary manifestations includes twice-yearly clinic visits, assessment of lung microbiology and pulmonary function like airway clearance, preventive measures such as pneumococcal and influenza vaccines, instructions for infection control, and antibiotic use to control infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 21\\]</u>. Moreover, exposure to inflammatory triggers such as tobacco smoke should be prevented.

Introduction\n\n【3】Thrombosis in the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a rare but serious condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. It is typically associated with vague symptoms such as abdominal pain, back pain, flank pain, leg pain, and swelling, which can vary in severity depending on the level of the thrombus in the vein. The causes of IVC thrombosis can vary, ranging from hypercoagulable states and tumors to pregnancy and congenital or acquired anomalies in the anatomy of the vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Although relatively uncommon, IVC thrombosis is associated with a higher risk of mortality than the deep vein thrombosis (DVT) alone, making early diagnosis and treatment essential for optimal patient outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In this case report, we describe a patient with thrombosis in the IVC who presented with a constellation of symptoms and underwent successful treatment with anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 39-year-old male presented to the emergency department with right flank pain that had progressed to severe back pain, bilateral flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain over the course of two days. The pain was severe enough to affect his daily activities. He had no significant medical history and had been treated with analgesics at a local health center prior to presenting to the emergency department. Given analgesics, the patient’s back pain decreased. However, he reported that his bilateral testicular pain and bilateral thigh pain became severe. His vital signs were BP 120/80 mmHg, pulse 130 beats/min, RR 20 breaths/min, and temperature 37°C. The leg raising test was negative, and the neurovascular bundle was intact. Scrotal exam was unremarkable. Since both the cremasteric reflex and Phren’s sign yielded negative results, an official scrotal Doppler ultrasound was not performed. There was no lower limb edema or swelling. Laboratory investigations revealed a D-dimer level of 17 mg/L (normal range: 0–0.49 mg/L), creatinine level of 124 µmol/L (normal range: 64–110 µmol/L), and a white blood cell count of 10 × 10<sup>3</sup>/L (normal range: 4–10 10<sup>3</sup>/L) with a CRP level of 5 mg/L (normal range: 0–5 mg/L). The patient’s prothrombin time showed a slight elevation at 13.8 seconds (normal range: 9.4–12.5 seconds), while APTT and INR levels remained within the normal ranges (APTT: 28.4 seconds, normal range: 25.1–36.5 seconds; INR: 1.1, normal range: ≤1.1).\n\n【7】Urine analysis was positive for blood. Bedside abdominal ultrasound showed no significant abnormalities. Doppler ultrasound of both legs showed deep vein thrombosis extending from the external iliac veins to the distal veins of both legs. Further investigation with computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins . There was no evidence of renal calculi or other abdominal pathology. Following admission, a comprehensive coagulopathy blood panel was conducted. Protein C levels were in the normal range (89%), but protein S levels were suboptimal (49.9%), likely influenced by the patient’s ongoing warfarin sodium therapy. Lupus anticoagulant was not detected, and the patient demonstrated effective anticoagulation with warfarin (ATAC 91%). Our patient, despite the absence of any family history of thrombosis, received a diagnosis of Factor V Leiden syndrome through genetic testing, which unveiled a heterozygous mutation in the F5 gene. He was started on low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, and after five days of hospitalization, he was discharged with warfarin for long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Thrombosis of the inferior vena cava (IVC) is a serious condition that can cause a range of symptoms, making it a challenging diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This case report described a patient who presented with a variety of symptoms, including severe back pain, flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain, which were ultimately attributed to IVC thrombosis. The patient was successfully treated with anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【12】Our case report is unique in which it describes a patient with a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins, which are relatively uncommon locations for IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In addition, the patient presented with a constellation of symptoms that included scrotal pain, which is an uncommon presentation of IVC thrombosis. The case also emphasizes the importance of genetic testing to identify underlying hypercoagulable states, such as Factor V Leiden syndrome, in patients with IVC thrombosis.\n\n【13】The symptoms of IVC thrombosis can be vague and nonspecific, making the diagnosis challenging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The patient in this case presented with right flank pain that had progressed to severe back pain, bilateral flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain over the course of two days. The pain was severe enough to affect his daily activities. These symptoms can be indicative of a variety of conditions, including musculoskeletal pain, urological disorders, and vascular disease, making it difficult to make an accurate diagnosis based on clinical presentation alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Laboratory investigations, including D-dimer levels, creatinine levels, and a white blood cell count, can help support the diagnosis of IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case, the patient had an elevated D-dimer level and a slightly elevated creatinine level. These laboratory findings are consistent with IVC thrombosis, as D-dimer is a marker of thrombosis, and an elevated creatinine level can be indicative of renal insufficiency, which can occur as a result of IVC thrombosis.\n\n【15】Sudden onset of testicular pain requires immediate evaluation, including a comprehensive medical history, thorough physical examination, urinalysis, and imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. An urgent situation such as testicular torsion, characterized by a high-riding testicle, demands swift action and confirmation to prevent potential testicular loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. Based on our examination and urinalysis, we were able to confidently rule out any potential medical emergencies for our patient. Although less frequent, nonscrotal factors can also trigger testicular pain due to shared nerve pathways (T10–T12, L1-L2, and S2–S4). Conditions such as kidney stones, lower back issues, aortic aneurysms, spinal disc protrusions, hernias, and other abdominal problems that utilize these common nerve routes may manifest as sudden testicular pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In our case, the patient’s testicular pain was likely due to the presence of the thrombus in the iliac veins, which can cause venous congestion and swelling in the scrotum. It is important for clinicians to consider IVC thrombosis in the differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with testicular pain, particularly in patients with known risk factors such as hypercoagulable states.\n\n【16】Bedside abdominal ultrasound is a useful tool for evaluating a wide range of conditions in the acute care setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>, but it has limitations and may not always provide a definitive diagnosis. If a bedside abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate for IVC thrombosis and no abnormal findings were detected, there could be several reasons why this occurred.\n\n【17】Firstly, it is possible that the thrombus was located in a segment of the IVC that was not adequately visualized by the ultrasound exam. The sensitivity of ultrasound for detecting IVC thrombosis can be affected by several factors, including the size and location of the thrombus and the quality of the ultrasound equipment and technique used 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【18】In addition, if the thrombus is partially or completely occlusive, there may still be some blood flow within the IVC, which can make it more difficult to detect with ultrasound. Imaging studies, including Doppler ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans, can help to confirm the diagnosis of IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Doppler ultrasound is a noninvasive and cost-effective way to diagnose deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can be a precursor to IVC thrombosis. In this case, Doppler ultrasound revealed DVT extending from the external iliac veins to the distal veins of both legs. CT scans can provide more detailed information about the location and extent of the thrombus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, a CT scan of the abdomen revealed a large thrombus in the distal vena cava extending to the renal artery and both external and internal iliac veins.\n\n【19】The causes of IVC thrombosis can vary, ranging from hypercoagulable states and tumors to pregnancy and congenital or acquired anomalies in the anatomy of the vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case, the patient was diagnosed with Factor V Leiden syndrome based on genetic testing, which revealed a heterozygous mutation in the F5 gene. Factor V Leiden is a common genetic risk factor for thrombosis, and individuals with this mutation have an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE), including IVC thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Treatment for IVC thrombosis typically involves anticoagulation therapy, which can prevent the thrombus from growing and reduce the risk of pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The patient in this case was started on low molecular weight heparin and warfarin, and after five days of hospitalization, he was discharged with warfarin for long-term anticoagulation. It is important to note that anticoagulation therapy can increase the risk of bleeding, and careful monitoring is required to ensure that the patient’s INR is within the therapeutic range.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】The presented case highlights the challenge of diagnosing IVC thrombosis due to its nonspecific symptoms and emphasizes the importance of considering this condition in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with back pain, flank pain, scrotal pain, and leg pain. Laboratory investigations, imaging studies, and genetic testing can aid in the diagnosis of IVC thrombosis and identifying underlying hypercoagulable states. Anticoagulation therapy is the mainstay of treatment, but careful monitoring is required to avoid complications, such as bleeding. Clinicians should consider IVC thrombosis in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with testicular pain, particularly in those with known risk factors. Early recognition and management of IVC thrombosis can prevent life-threatening complications, including pulmonary embolism.\n\n【23】#### Data Availability\n\n【24】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【25】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【26】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is characterized by a long period after initial nephrectomy and a favorable prognosis compared to other pancreatic malignancies. Its diagnosis may confuse clinicians if the medical history is not known. In the era of targeted therapies for metastatic renal carcinoma, surgery stands as the best treatment option for PM of renal cancer. We report the case of a woman who underwent successfully left splenopancreatectomy for corporeal PM of renal cancer treated seven years ago. This case underlines the necessity of long-term follow-up of patients treated for kidney cancer.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】According to the GLOBOCAN database, 403000 people were diagnosed with kidney cancer during 2018. Among them, men were more hit (254000 new cases and 114000 deaths) than women (149000 new cases and 61000 deaths) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Renal cell carcinoma represents 3–5% of all adult malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, of which clear cell carcinoma represents the most frequent subtype (65–70%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In Tunisia, it is a less frequent cancer with 2.2 per 100000 incidence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Pancreatic metastasis (PM) of renal cancer is even rarer. Surgical management of metachronous metastasis is a keypoint for this condition. In the present case, we report the case of a patient treated with a left splenopancreatectomy for metachronous pancreatic metastasis, seven years after nephrectomy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 60-year-old woman presented in April 2013 with gross hematuria. Physical examination revealed a left flank mass. The abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a renal tumor measuring 15 × 10 × 12 cm with capsular rupture, invasion of the left renal vein and of the vena cava in which a thrombus extended up to 7 cm. The thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) found the same tumor and four nonspecific pulmonary micronodules. This tumor was classified T3cN0M0.\n\n【7】The patient underwent a left total nephrectomy in the same month with a good clinical course. Histologic samples confirmed the diagnosis of a clear cell renal carcinoma classified as pT3cN0M0. She was put into surveillance, and annual CT scans confirmed the stability of the pulmonary nonspecific micronodules with no distant metastases.\n\n【8】After seven years, in November 2020, she consulted for abdominal pain without any other signs. The patient was in a good general condition. The physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【9】An abdominal sonography was performed revealing a deep hypoechogenic mass of the left flank linked to the tail of the pancreas measuring 7 × 4 cm with irregular outline and extending to the left border of the aorta.\n\n【10】The abdominal CT scan showed a multilobular mass, hypervascular on the arterial phase with arteriovenous fistula and wash-out on the venous phase. This mass obstructed the splenic vena and was responsible of a collateral venous circulation as well as of the atrophy of the tail of the pancreas . An abdominal MRI confirmed the same findings with a corporeal mass that had low signal in T1 Fat Sat images and hyperintense signal in T2 images . No further locations were found. A thoracic scan was performed and did not show any abnormality.\n\n【11】(a)\n\n【12】(b)\n\n【13】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【15】Computed tomography images of a tissular corporeal pancreatic mass, enhanced in periphery (a) with a central necrosis, invading the splenic vein (a, b).\n\n【16】(a)\n\n【17】(b)\n\n【18】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【20】MRI images of T1 fat saturation sequences with gadolinium injection in arterial (a) and portal (b) phases showing a tissular corporeal pancreatic mass, with low signal, enhanced in periphery, comprising a necrotic center with no involvement of the superior mesenteric artery.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【22】MRI T2 images of a heterogeneous hypersignal corporeal pancreatic mass.\n\n【23】After discussion of this case in a multidisciplinary meeting, a left splenopancreatectomy was performed. Surgical samples showed a 50 × 40 mm red-whitish nodular tumoral neoformation of the tail and body of the pancreas with some necrotic changes. Postoperative recovery was eventful.\n\n【24】The histological examination revealed a malignant proliferation in the pancreatic parenchyma made of cordonal, trabecular, and alveolar anastomotic structures. These structures were arranged into a fibrohyaline stroma comprising a rich vascular network, punctuated by an inflammatory infiltrate with punctiform necrotic changes. Tumoral cells possess a clear cytoplasm. Nuclei were often irregular with visible nucleolus. The tumor did not invade the peripancreatic fat.

Discussion\n\n【33】In renal cell carcinoma, major metastatic sites are the lungs (45.2%), bones (29.5%), lymph nodes (21.8%), liver (20.3%), and adrenals (8.9%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, despite pancreatic involvement is not frequent, RCC is the most common primary tumor leading to pancreatic metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Pancreatic metastasis (PM) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) incidence in autopsy series is reported between 1% and 3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. They are also a rare pancreatic disease and represent about 2% of all pancreatic malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Epidemiologic data on primary tumor location (left or right kidney) and PM location on the pancreas found no correlation and pleaded in favor of a hematogenous dissemination of the disease rather than a lymphogenous local spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. By a biochemical phenomenon of tumor cell selection, emboli metastatic cells only develop in the pancreatic parenchyma but not in other organs, explaining why PM is usually unique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Later developing metastases in remote organs are due to the heterogeneity of the primary tumor, which spreads genetically different cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Clinically, pancreatic metastases are usually asymptomatic as 55% of them show no symptoms and are discovered in surveillance imaging 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Very often, this condition is discovered a long period after initial nephrectomy, at a median interval of 91 months 通用删除7(英):<u>(54–142)</u> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. This finding underlines the necessity of long-time follow-up of renal cancer patients. Metachronous disease is rarer, and its incidence is estimated at 12% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【37】When symptomatic, patients may experience nausea, jaundice, acute pancreatitis, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, or weight loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【38】PM is characterized in computed tomography (CT) by its isodensity or hypodensity unenhanced images and by its avidity for enhancement in the late arterial phase as well as a wash-out in late phases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Similar findings were described on MRI, lesions having low signal in T1 images and are hyperintense in T2 images 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Pancreatic lesions are more often multiple when they are secondary to kidney cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, and the multifocal presentation of pancreatic metastases to kidney cancer represents between 20% and 45% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Multifocality and the pattern of enhancement are the key findings that differentiate primary from secondary pancreatic lesions.\n\n【41】Some PMs have an intense octreotide uptake in scintigraphy which may distort the diagnosis, confusing with neuroendocrine tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, usually, these tumours do not invade neither the choledochus nor the pancreatic duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【42】The surgical management of metastatic renal cell cancer has changed in recent years with the development of target therapies and immunotherapy. Resection of metachronous metastases is more commonly described than synchronous metastases. For metachronous metastases, it is now consensual that surgery is the optimal treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In a series of 274 patients with PM (both metachronous and synchronous), Grassi et al. found that patients locally treated had a doubled median OS compared with patients with systemic treatment with targeted therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Atypical resection is preferred to typical techniques because oncologic results are comparable when removing only the metastasis and protecting the endocrine and exocrine function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. The decision of surgery instead of systemic drugs is motivated by an excellent prognosis of these patients as overall survival at 5 years is estimated at 72.6% in a meta-analysis of 311 patients with PM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. It is suggested that patients suffering from PM of RCC present a less aggressive disease. Kalra et al. studied retrospectively 228 metastatic RCC in both PM and non-PM patients. The PM cohort was associated with a better prognosis than the other cohort, with a similar otherwise metastatic distribution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Very few cases have been reported of surgery performed for synchronous disease, but the surgical management of these lesions is still under debate. Nevertheless, it should be performed along with nephrectomy, whenever the patient is fit, and PM, the only site involved, as a persistent kidney tumor may be a source of potential new metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【43】The place of targeted therapies remains uncertain, as no data are currently available on their usefulness in patients with PM alone. The good results of surgery in terms of overall survival lead us to consider their use only after surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Prognostic factors reported in the literature are symptomatic metastases, surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>, nephrectomy, and good or intermediate Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) score that were related to survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【45】In summary, metachronous PM of RCC occurs late in the disease natural history, highlighting the necessity of long-term surveillance. It is associated with a good prognosis, and its treatment is based on the surgery of the metastases.\n\n【46】However, it is important to highlight that more than 20% of patients have metastatic disease at presentation, and early screening is necessary. Many studies suggest different imaging techniques, while others are developing the molecular diagnosis with detection of urinary miRNAs as a diagnostic tool of clear cell renal cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【47】#### Data Availability\n\n【48】The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.\n\n【49】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【50】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Therapy was indicated due to persistent and progressive symptoms of encephalopathy. Although an open surgical approach was considered, the multidisciplinary liver tumor group elected an initial percutaneous interventional approach. The procedure was performed with intravenous moderate sedation and local anesthesia. The left branch of the portal vein was accessed with a 21-gauge needle from an anterior abdominal approach, under real time US guidance. After placement of a 10 cm 5 Fr vascular sheath, a 4 Fr Bernstein catheter (Cook, Inc. Bloomington, IL) was directed into the main portal vein over a 0.035-inch angled glide-wire (Terumo Medical Corp. Somerset, NJ). Portal venography demonstrated two large right portal anterior and posterior venous branches communicating with the right hepatic veins through aneurysmal connections (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). There was a 28 mm aneurysm associated with the anterior portohepatic venous shunt (Figure 5(a)) and a 37 mm aneurysm associated with posterior portohepatic shunt (Figure 5(b)). Over a 0.035-inch Rosen wire, the 10 cm sheath was exchanged for a 25 cm 5 Fr sheath. The 4 Fr Bernstein catheter was advanced over the 0.035-inch angled glide-wire into the anterior right portal vein branch to its communication with the right hepatic vein. A 6 mm Amplatzer II vascular plug (St Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) was used to occlude the right anterior portal vein proximal to the communication with the right hepatic vein. The 4 Fr Bernstein catheter was then directed to the posterior right portal vein branch that supplied the second shunt. A 12 mm Amplatzer vascular plug was placed to occlude the posterior right portal vein branch. After occlusion of anterior and posterior right portal vein branches, a portal venogram was obtained with catheter tip in the main portal vein, which confirmed an absence of flow in the occluded branches with no opacification of the aneurysms (Figure 5(c)). The hepatic parenchymal access tract was embolized with gelfoam pledgets.\n\n【28】(a)\n\n【29】(b)\n\n【30】(c)\n\n【31】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n【33】A 45-year-old female with intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt with associated aneurysms.

Her moderate postprocedure RUQ pain was managed with intravenous hydromorphone. There was improvement of her RUQ pain and swelling at one-week postprocedure follow-up. US and Doppler assessment of the liver performed one month after embolization demonstrated thrombosis of the portohepatic communications and associated aneurysms. The patient had complete resolution of the presenting symptoms and was asymptomatic at 6-month follow-up.\n\n【35】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【36】Stringer described four major different varieties of congenital portosystemic venous shunts in six children seen during a 10-year period, with reference to anatomy of the shunt which was determined by imaging studies and surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. He divided extrahepatic portocaval shunts into two types: first, end-to-side shunts, where the portal vein (PV) terminates in the inferior vena cava (IVC), and the second, side-to-side shunts in which there is venous communication between a patent PV and the IVC. The third and fourth types of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts were abnormal intrahepatic connections between branches of the PV and the hepatic veins or IVC and persistent patent ductus venosus.\n\n【37】An intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt (IPSVS) is a communication between an intrahepatic portal vein and a systemic vein via an anomalous intrahepatic venous channel. The etiology of IPSVS may be congenital or acquired (secondary to cirrhosis, trauma, or biopsy procedure). The intrahepatic portal venous shunt in adults is most commonly due to portal venous communication to a systemic vein secondary to portal hypertension. While portosystemic shunts less than 2 mm in diameter are relatively common in patients with cirrhosis, the larger shunts are thought to be congenital 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Popper et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> described many minute communications between the portal and hepatic veins in cirrhotic livers. These anastomoses were considered to be remnants of previous sinusoids that had dilated and whose walls had become thickened in areas of liver cell loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our case is likely to be congenital as these were relatively large communications and there was no associated evidence of chronic liver disease or prior history of trauma to the liver.\n\n【38】In the embryonic period, there are three pairs of veins that participate in the formation of venous structures within and around the liver: right and left vitelline veins, umbilical veins, and cardinal veins. The portal vein is formed from several segments of the vitelline veins while some segments of the right and left vitelline veins collapse and disappear during the process of development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. According to Raskin et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> “a persistence of portions of the omphalomesenteric (vitelline) venous system from the second month of fetal life is the most likely explanation for the portohepatic venous malformation.”\n\n【39】Some small intrahepatic portosystemic shunts  located between the portal branches and hepatic veins disappear spontaneously by age 1 to 2 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. If larger shunts or the ductus venosus persists, they pose a risk of late development of complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, pulmonary hypertension, or hyperammonemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6, 7\\]</u>. The clinical significance of IPSVS depends upon the shunt ratio and on the patient’s age. Decreasing tolerance of the brain to toxic metabolites with increasing age may explain the delayed clinical manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Table 1 \n\n【41】Summary of intrahepatic portosystemic shunts.\n\n【42】Two shunts in one patient are also relatively rare. Remer et al. found three out of twenty-two (13.6%) had two intrahepatic portal venous shunts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The incidence of portal vein aneurysm in association with portosystemic shunts is not uniform in the literature. Tanoue et al. found that portal vein aneurysms were reported in 5 (50%) of 10 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Color Doppler ultrasonography (US) is the key imaging modality for the diagnosis of congenital portosystemic shunt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Doppler US is also useful for follow-up after therapy. In addition to demonstrating flow signals between the involved vessels, and evaluating flow direction, it may also determine the shunt ratio by estimating flow volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. The shunt ratio is calculated by dividing the blood flow volume through the shunt by the total portal blood flow volume 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 14\\]</u>. When the shunt ratio increases, the amount of nitrogen-containing substances in the portal blood that bypass the hepatic metabolism rises in the systemic circulation and can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. When the shunt ratio exceeds 30%, hepatic encephalopathy may develop at any time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. When the shunt ratio exceeds 60%, the risk of hepatic encephalopathy is increased, such that, in noncirrhotic patients even without encephalopathy, therapeutic intervention is indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Multidetector computed tomography (CT) with contrast is useful for pretreatment planning, to document the anatomy and location of the shunt. With use of maximum intensity projection and multiplanar reconstruction, it provides all the necessary information about the course of the shunt, its size, and orientation; it helps to define the best access route for intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. MRI with contrast of the abdomen can also well visualize the shunt anatomy without radiation risk. Confirmation with CT or MRI is valuable when there is suboptimal sonographic visualization of the liver and can exclude associated abnormalities such as liver tumors.\n\n【45】Recently, Lautz et al. classified shunts based on portal anatomy and expected physiologic consequences of the shunt , regardless of whether they were intrahepatic or extrahepatic; type I shunts were those with no intrahepatic portal flow and type II shunts were partial shunts with some preserved intrahepatic flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Type II shunt was further classified based on portal anatomy; type IIa arises from a portal branch, type IIb is from the main portal vein, its bifurcation, or the splenomesenteric confluence, and type IIc includes shunts from mesenteric veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【46】Table 2 \n\n【47】Classification of congenital PSVS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. CAPV indicates congenital absence of the portal vein.\n\n【48】Other vascular abnormalities of the liver such as cavernous transformation of the portal vein, arterioportal shunts, and aneurysm of the portal vein are in the differential diagnosis. These can be differentiated from IPSVS by imaging findings. Cavernous transformation of the portal vein is due to the formation of venous channels within and around a previously stenosed or occluded portal vein that act as portoportal collateral channels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. A characteristic beaded appearance (mass of veins) at the porta hepatis is usually seen on contrast enhanced CT scans due to dilated biliary and gastric veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u>. Arterioportal shunts are due to communication between the hepatic artery and the portal venous system. This condition is diagnosed in helical CT performed during the hepatic arterial phase showing early and marked enhancement of the main portal vein or major tributaries with attenuation similar to that of the aorta 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Aneurysms of the portal venous system may be present in patients with liver disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. On contrast enhanced CT or MRI, an aneurysm appears as an enhancing cystic mass that arises from the portal venous system and demonstrates simultaneous enhancement with portal vein.\n\n【49】Invasive studies such as arterial portography or direct percutaneous transhepatic portography can confirm the presence of portosystemic shunts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Symptomatic portosystemic shunts warrant therapeutic intervention. Treatment options include percutaneous embolization or surgical shunt ligation and/or hepatic resection. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment of congenital absence of the portal vein (type I Abernethy malformation) and is reserved for patients with refractory symptoms despite medical management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 18\\]</u>. Type II PSVS has variable anatomy, clinical features, and treatment options 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Lautz et al. reported 10 symptomatic children with type II PSVS who were successfully managed with operative ligation (), endovascular occlusion (), and a combined approach (). Endovascular occlusion (using coils, plugs, and/or stents) has proven successful for patent ductus venosus (PDV) and other isolated type IIa shunts whereas type IIb shunt usually requires staged operative closure because of short and wide diameter of the shunt 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Type IIc can be managed either with surgical ligation or endovascular occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Percutaneous closure of the shunts can be performed when an occlusive device can be fixed in position in the shunt, without compromising the flow in the inferior vena cava and the normal hepatic veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. This endovascular therapeutic option applies to shunts between portal branches and hepatic veins that can be closed by means of Amplatzer occlusive devices or embolic metallic coils, which depends on the size, position, and number of communications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Advantages of percutaneous embolization are the less invasive procedure and preservation of hepatic parenchyma. This is particularly important when faced with a lesion in the setting of cirrhosis and portal hypertension where preservation of hepatic parenchyma is desired 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【50】After closure of the shunt, liver tests and coagulation studies should return to normal. Hyperammonemia usually normalizes within a day and serum bile acids should be normal after a few days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 22\\]</u>. Sustained clinical follow-up is necessary to exclude return of symptoms that are secondary to recanalization of an occluded shunt or enlargement of other anomalous portosystemic communications.\n\n【51】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【52】Congenital intrahepatic shunts between the portal and hepatic veins are rare vascular abnormalities that may cause hepatic encephalopathy. Abdominal sonography with color Doppler is an excellent method to identify these lesions. Confirmation with CT or MRI is valuable when there is suboptimal sonographic visualization of the liver, to identify associated abnormalities, and for treatment planning. This pathologic condition can be successfully treated with percutaneous interventional occlusive techniques or surgical closure.\n\n【53】#### Abbreviations\n\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| --- | --- |\n| CAPV: | Congenital absence of the portal vein |\n| Fr: | French scale commonly used to measure the size of a catheter |\n| IPSVS: | Intrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt |\n| IVC: | Inferior vena cava |\n| PDV: | Patent ductus venosus |\n| PSVS: | Portosystemic venous shunt |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| RUQ: | Right upper quadrant. |\n\n【55】#### Consent\n\n【56】No identifying information was revealed; patients signed general consent for use of imaging studies with hospital admission.\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【59】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Authors’ Contribution</u>\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Kalyan Paudel reviewed the literature and wrote the paper.

We present a case of a young female with subacute symptoms of cough and progressive dyspnoea. On evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as cryptogenic organizing pneumonia based on her histopathological reports. However, her significant elevation of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels which drop after treatment with oral steroids, relapse, and clinical presentation pointed towards sarcoidosis as clinical diagnosis. Discussion. Here, in this patient, transbronchial biopsy was suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia along with chest X-ray, and the HRCT finding was also favouring the same. But in this case, we have also seen elevated levels of serum ACE which dropped significantly to the normal level along with a complete clearance of lesions with systemic steroids, and this favours sarcoidosis. Also, the recurrence was in different areas of the lung, and lesions once again responded both clinically and radiologically to steroids with a consistent drop in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, which again is a feature common in sarcoidosis. In COP, often complete clearance of the lesions is seldom seen, even though they do respond to steroids but not as dramatically as in our case. Also, recurrence of the lesion with BOOP at different sites is uncommon as it generally progresses in the same site. Conclusion. This case report suggests that sarcoidosis as a possible cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is worth considering with the mixed spectrum of presentation as in our case. And to our knowledge, this type of presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with sarcoidosis as an overlap disease is very rare, and this possibility needs to be explored by more series of such cases.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia earlier known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is clinically characterized by subacute or chronic respiratory disease for a duration of 2 weeks to 2 months. Usual presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia will be persistent with dry cough and breathlessness. Pathologically, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia was defined by the presence of granulation tissue in the bronchiolar lumen, alveolar duct, and some alveoli, associated with a variable degree of interstitial and air space infiltration by mononuclear cells and foamy macrophages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Various associations of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with many drugs, connective tissue disorders, hematological malignancy, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, infections, inflammatory bowel disease, inhalation injury, irradiation injury, and transplantation have been reported in the literature, except for an unlikely cluster of patients with association of sarcoidosis and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Summary\n\n【5】A 32-year-old female with no comorbid illness presented with dry cough and progressive dyspnoea for 3 weeks with no history of expectoration, fever, haemoptysis, night sweats, weight loss, myalgia, arthralgia, muscle weakness, or rash. Oral antibiotics were consumed with no symptomatic relief. She was a housewife with no history of exposure to mineral dust, silica, asbestos, fumes, and drugs.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed a healthy well-built female with a BP of 100/80 mmHg, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and a saturation of 94% in room air. No pallor, clubbing or cyanosis, lymphadenopathy, oedema, or skin lesions were observed.\n\n【7】Initial laboratory investigations showed an elevated ESR of 90 and an elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) level of 83, as against a normal level of 52 IU, with normal hemogram and other biochemistry and electrolyte assays. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-dsDNA, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C/P-ANCA), rheumatoid factor, and serology for HIV, HCV, and HBsAg were negative. Sputum for acid-fast bacilli and other routine bacteriology tests were negative.\n\n【8】The pulmonary function test showed a mild restrictive pattern. Chest X-ray showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates . High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) chest showed peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe . Bronchoscopy with brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsies were done.BAL was found to be negative for malignancy. Cultures of bacterial pathogens and acid-fast bacilli were also found to be negative by GeneXpert. The BAL study showed endobronchial cells with alveolar dust-laden macrophages with acute and chronic inflammatory cells. Transbronchial lung biopsy was performed, and histology  showed air space consolidation with fibrinous exudation and polymorph and macrophage infiltration, along with polypoidal proteinous layer in the alveolar spaces composed of granulation tissue, with alveolar septa showing moderately dense chronic inflammatory infiltrates (Masson bodies), all were suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP).\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】Chest X-ray showing bilateral interstitial infiltrates.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【13】HRCT chest showing peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【15】Low-power examination shows plugs of granulation tissue in bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n【17】High-power examination shows Masson bodies that are rounded nodules of granulation tissue in alveolar spaces.\n\n【18】The patient was treated with systemic steroids to which the patient responded dramatically with a clinical and significant radiological clearance  and a decrease in serum ACE to normal.

Chest radiograph and HRCT  showed recurrence of bilateral patchy lesions but in different zones of the lung. The patient was not willing for a repeat CT-guided FNAC and biopsy. The serum ACE levels again increased to pretreatment levels of 70 IU, and it again reached a nadir after another 3 months of a tapering course of steroids.\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 </u>\n\n【23】HRCT showing recurrence of bilateral patchy lesions in different zones.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】The differential diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) includes diseases like community-acquired pneumonia, idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. In our case, with the persistence of symptoms and lack of response to antibiotics, we diverged from bacterial or viral pneumonia. We excluded the diagnosis of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with clinic-pathological collaboration. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) has a similar clinical and radiographical presentation to subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis. We excluded the disease because of the absence of a known exposure to an aetiological agent and the absence of poorly formed granulomas on lung biopsy. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia can have a similar clinical and radiographical presentation to cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP). In chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, blood eosinophilia is usually higher than 1500/mm<sup>3</sup> and bronchoalveolar eosinophilia is higher than 25%. In our case, blood and BAL eosinophils were within the normal range. Also in histopathological patterns, a significant eosinophilic infiltration is seen, and the eosinophilic infiltration is often accompanied by foci of necrosis and proteinaceous debris, termed eosinophilic microabscesses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. With these findings, we excluded all other diseases and established the diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP).\n\n【26】In our case report, a 32-year-old female presented with dry cough and progressive dyspnoea with high ESR and elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, with the imaging study showing peripherally based patchy, subsegmental lesions of the upper lobe and left lower lobe and biopsy, suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia with granulation tissue and underwent remission of both clinical and radiological findings on treatment with systemic steroids.\n\n【27】Here, in this patient, transbronchial biopsy was suggestive of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) along with chest X-ray, and the HRCT finding was also favouring cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Here, we came to the final diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia after excluding all other possible conditions as well.In the absence of other contributing disease processes, diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia can be demonstrated by typical histological features in the patients with a compatible clinical and radiological pattern.\n\n【28】But in our case, we have also seen elevated levels of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) which responded to oral steroids. The features that favoured sarcoidosis were that there was a significant clearance of lesions with steroids. Also, the recurrence was in different areas of the lung once steroids were discontinued, and lesions once again responded both clinically and radiologically to steroids with a consistent drop in serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (SACE) levels, suggesting a sarcoidosis aetiology to the disease.\n\n【29】In cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP), often complete clearance of the lesions is seldom seen, even though they do respond to steroids but not as dramatically as in our case. Also, recurrence of the lesion in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) at different sites is uncommon as it generally progresses in the same site. Distinguishing cryptogenic organizing pneumonia from sarcoidosis can be difficult. Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia frequently occurs in 40 to 60 years, and sarcoidosis usually occurs in the age group of 20 to 50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Both entities may present with almost same clinical symptoms. The histological appearance of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia and sarcoidosis differs as mononuclear cells and Langerhans giant-cell granulomas characterize acinar infiltrates of sarcoidosis, whereas cryptogenic organizing pneumonia is characterized by fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and granulation buds in the distal airways and alveoli. The BAL study will show mononuclear cells in sarcoidosis and mixed cell populations with a modestly increased lymphocyte number in cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Since our patient had a significant clinical, radiological, and pathological overlap of symptoms which could not be explained by either cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or sarcoidosis alone, an overlap of sarcoidosis-cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) was a strong possibility.\n\n【30】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】In conclusion, for this patient, we came to a diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis as a possible cause of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) is worth considering with the mixed spectrum of presentation as in our case. And to our knowledge, this type of presentation of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (BOOP) with sarcoidosis as an overlap disease is very rare, and this possibility needs to be explored by more series of such cases.\n\n【32】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【33】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is currently not routine practice to assess the functional response to these agents. However, concern over functional hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel has led to widespread uptake of prasugrel and ticagrelor as the default P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor after stent implantation in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Here we report, for the first time, 3 cases in which patients who have had ST exhibit hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Stent thrombosis (ST) is a major complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), occurring in 2.0–2.9% of patients within 22 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Although uncommon, ST is associated with significant mortality of up to 45% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Dual antiplatelet therapy (APT) with aspirin and P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitor has become the default strategy in patients undergoing coronary stent implantation to reduce the risk of ST. However, a cohort of patients may have an inadequate functional response to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u> and are more likely to sustain ischaemic events including ST 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】There is particular concern about clopidogrel in this regard 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. The established link between functional hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel and ischaemic events, including ST, in patients receiving coronary stents has triggered the development of more potent and faster-acting P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors. Two large randomised trials have demonstrated reduction in ischaemic endpoints for prasugrel and ticagrelor when compared to clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing PCI, albeit at the price of increased bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. In response to these data and earlier studies demonstrating quicker onset and more potent and more homogeneous responses of healthy volunteers and stable patients to prasugrel and ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, many PCI centres in the UK have switched from clopidogrel to either prasugrel or ticagrelor as their default. Interestingly the incidence of prasugrel hyporesponsiveness is estimated to be 25% using flow cytometric analysis of intraplatelet vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation in ACS patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In the CREST registry, out of 6 patients who were found to be hyporesponsive to prasugrel, only 3 responded adequately to ticagrelor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】We present for the first time 3 cases who had experienced definite ST after drug eluting stent (DES) implantation who demonstrated functional hyporesponsiveness to clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, using a previously well validated test, short thromboelastography (sTEG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–15\\]</u>. sTEG uses a novel parameter, percentage clotting inhibition (%CI) in the AA or ADP channel for clotting inhibition by aspirin or P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, respectively. The formula for %CI by aspirin is and for %CI by P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors is 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Threshold %CI of <50 in the AA channel and <30 in the ADP channel was used to define hyporesponsiveness to aspirin and P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, respectively.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】Patient 1 is a 74-year-old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previous anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with a single drug eluting stent (DES) in the circumflex artery. He presented with proximal stent occlusion 2043 days after his index PCI while on aspirin 75 mg once daily. He was successfully treated with plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) and bare metal stent (BMS) insertion. Subsequently he underwent platelet function testing using sTEG. Initially our patient was started on aspirin 150 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Forty-two days later, the assay revealed an adequate response to aspirin (%CI 71) but suboptimal response to clopidogrel (%CI 17). Therefore, prasugrel 5 mg daily was commenced as patient was borderline for age group with no initial loading. Once more the reading showed inadequate response to prasugrel 5 mg daily (%CI −7) after 63 days of treatment and the dose was uptitrated to 10 mg daily. Subsequent test, 105 days later, revealed suboptimal response again (%CI 9). As a result, the patient was commenced on ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily without initial loading and retested after 85 days of treatment. Similarly, his reading revealed hyporesponse (%CI 1) . Due to development of dyspnoea while on ticagrelor, the patient was finally left on prasugrel 10 mg daily for life.

He was proven to have adequate response to aspirin 150 mg daily (%CI 82) but suboptimal response to thienopyridines. Clopidogrel 75 mg with inadequate response (%CI 8) after 19 days of treatment was replaced by prasugrel 10 mg daily with no initial loading, with again suboptimal response (%CI 9) after 56 days of usage. Finally, ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily was commenced without initial loading but similarly was proven to have inadequate response (%CI 24) after 21 days of treatment. As response to ticagrelor was better than to prasugrel, the decision was made for him to remain on ticagrelor for 12 months.

Discussion\n\n【28】Our case series demonstrates three cases of patients with acute stent thrombosis who were found to be hyporesponsive to all three commonly available P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> receptor inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a series of such cases has been described. Two previously published case reports have illustrated patients with dual thienopyridine resistance to clopidogrel and prasugrel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. In both cases, the patient was subsequently shown to have an adequate response to the ticagrelor. Orban et al. suggested that the response to ticagrelor may be due to its properties as an active drug, compared with prasugrel and clopidogrel which are prodrugs requiring hepatic cytochrome bioactivation prior to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Based upon both early studies reporting superior potency, speed of onset and consistency of responses to prasugrel and ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in both volunteers and stable patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>, and subsequent large scale randomised trials, in many PCI centres, prasugrel and ticagrelor have become the default P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> agent. The assumption from some interventionalists is that prasugrel and ticagrelor are not associated with functional hyporesponsiveness (also known as “resistance”). However, recent data suggest that functional resistance does indeed occur in association with these agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Our case series describe for the first time the concept of functional resistance to all three commonly available P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors. These data were obtained using short TEG, a well described and validated modification of TEG platelet mapping assay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–13\\]</u>. Our group has previously described the reproducibility of sTEG and has demonstrated the value of comparing the ADP-induced clotting response to that achieved using kaolin stimulation. This method has the advantage that there is a built-in reference, both numerical and visual, of the strength of the clot in response to ADP compared to the maximum clot strength achieved by kaolin. We have also used sTEG to describe discrepancies between these results from Verify Now assay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>.\n\n【31】One limitation of our case series is that we were not able to objectively prove patients’ compliance with medications, although we appreciate that it might have implications on final management strategy. In addition to this, no other platelet function assays (i.e. Verify Now) were used to confirm our results.\n\n【32】These cases suggest that some patients experiencing ST may exhibit functional resistance to all 3 of the currently available oral P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors. As well as adding weight to the argument in favour of measuring individual responses to P<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>12</sub> inhibitors, with the intention of possibly avoiding stents in patients who do not respond to them, it also raises interesting questions about the mechanism of hyporesponsiveness.\n\n【33】Further data are required to investigate whether this observation in such patients could be due to a paucity of receptor numbers, a functional flaw in the receptor activation, or perhaps even a lack of availability of such drugs at the receptor.\n\n【34】#### Competing Interests\n\n【35】Bartosz Olechowski, Alexander Ashby, Nalyaka Sambu, and Michael Mahmoudi declare that they have no competing interests.

Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 76-year-old Caucasian female was referred to our department due to a 6-month history of constant aching pain over her left hip region. Imaging features were very typical of a primary bone tumor and thus, as tentative diagnosis chondrosarcoma was made by the reporting radiologist . Subsequently performed tumor staging revealed the tumor as being a primary with an otherwise clear bone scan, CT chest, and abdomen. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. However, imaging of the kidneys suggested possible renal cell carcinoma involving the right kidney.\n\n【7】(a)\n\n【8】(b)\n\n【9】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Preoperative MRI showing the left femur of a 76-year-old Caucasian female with diagnosis dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma (a) anterior-posterior axial view, (b) anterior-posterior front view. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】Biopsy specimen of the proximal left femur revealed a biphasic tumor composed of a cartilaginous component with abrupt transition into a noncartilaginous malignant mesenchymal component . The diagnosis of a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma was made.

(b) same patient, clear-cell renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney (400x), H.E. |\n| --- |\n\n【18】The patient underwent limb salvage surgery, performed according to standardized local protocol by surgeons specialized in oncologic surgery, followed by endoprosthetic replacement. Wide surgical margins were achieved. Although the patient was reasonably fit, adjuvant chemotherapy was not given due to the patient’s age.\n\n【19】During the further course of treatment, the suspicious condition in the right kidney, that had already been present during initial tumor staging prior to limb salvage surgery, was diagnosed as clear-cell renal cell carcinoma  and immediately subjected to nephrectomy. There was no evidence of metastatic disease. After more than 5 years of followup the patient is still free of disease.\n\n【20】Besides the current complaints described above, the patient underwent hysterectomy and cholecystectomy years ago. She could not remember the reason and there is no documentation discussing why those operations were performed. However, her medical family history  revealed that her youngest brother started suffering from invasive medium- to-low differentiated urothelial carcinoma  of the bladder when he was 67-year-old. He died at age 69 of a fibroblastic osteosarcoma  located in his left femur. Their mother presented with renal cell carcinoma as well when she was 65-year-old (specimen not available).\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| Pedigree of the family presented, RCC: renal cell carcinoma, CHS: chondrosarcoma, OS: osteosarcoma, BL: urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. |\n| --- |\n\n【23】(a)\n\n【24】(b)\n\n【25】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| (a) Biopsy specimen of the proximal left femur of a 69-year-old Caucasian male with diagnosis fibroblastic osteosarcoma (200x), H.E.

Moreover, the entire coding (exons 2–11) region and flanking intron regions of TP53 were sequenced. Since both MLPA and sequenciation did not reveal pathologic changes of the TP53 gene, the GAG-banding pattern derived from cell division was analyzed as well. However, chromosomal aberrations were not detected in the cytogenetic analysis neither for structural or numerical reasons. Taking into account all the results obtained, the diagnosis of LFS could not be confirmed, but there is still uncertainty regarding a definitive diagnosis in terms of a possible new genetic syndrome.\n\n【29】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【30】Due to a rare combination of urinary tract and bone tumors occurring in the family presented herein, we hypothesized a hereditary predisposition and thus, the tentative diagnosis Li-Fraumeni syndrome was made.\n\n【31】In fact, positive family anamnesis is an important risk factor for cancer. The genetic defect in LFS is a germline mutation at the tumor suppressor gene p53 with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Accordingly, children of affected parents are at 50% risk of being mutation carriers. As the family pedigree shown in Figure 3 points out that there are a lot of children, a diagnosed syndrome could be very helpful to reduce risk for unaffected offspring. However, none of the offspring has yet developed cancer .\n\n【32】Due to a variety of neoplasms and the family history reported herein, LFS was strongly considered nevertheless. In contrast to other syndromes, for instance neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis, or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, LFS is characterized by various but characteristic multiple primary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Accordingly, significant differences in the distribution of bone tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, leukemia, melanoma, lung cancer, tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and the pancreas should be expected compared with the general population. Although an early age at onset is frequent, patients are also at increased risk of developing multiple primary late-onset malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The overall lifetime risk of cancer is estimated close to 80% in patients with pathologic changes of the TP53 gene; approximately 40% develops cancer during the first two decades of life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Further explanations like variable expressivity and germline mosaicism or de novo mutation in the patient brother’s TP53 gene were considered but finally denied due to low probability. Nonmedical explanations, including alternate paternity or maternity or undisclosed adoption, were explored and ruled out by means of family examination. Furthermore, a nonsyndromic cause of familial cancer is still being reasonable as pathologic changes of the TP53 gene have not been proven. Based on current data, some minor changes found in the DNA sequence can be classified as polymorphism without pathologic significance; however, current data may be subject to change. A genetic predisposition, perhaps due to other, currently unknown factors may still not be excluded. Besides, MLPA and sequenciation as methods for genetic testing may perhaps be too limited. However, these tools are standard procedures in our institutes.\n\n【34】As the case reported herein implies that families with highly suspicious medical family history should be closely monitored to minimize disease-related morbidity. Clinicians should therefore be aware of genetic syndromes as differential diagnosis. Further, similar, familial cases should be reported to address the question of a possible new genetic syndrome.\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Professor P.

A rare case of spontaneous rupture of SPT is reported. A 13-year-old female felt acute abdominal pain without blunt abdominal trauma. Enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a tumor in the pancreas tail with fluid collection around it. The tumor was diagnosed as SPT with hemoperitoneum associated with spontaneous rupture.

At that time, CT revealed a tumor 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreas tail without distant metastases. Since peritoneal dissemination was not seen on intraoperative exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT with rupture of the capsule of tumor, and complete resection was confirmed.

Introduction\n\n【3】Solid pseudopapillary tumor (SPT) of the pancreas was first described by Frantz in 1959 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. SPT is regarded as an uncommon low grade malignant tumor accounting for 1-2% of exocrine pancreatic tumors, usually affecting young females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>. The clinical presentations of SPT have been various and not specific. SPT was discovered by rupture and hemoperitoneum which was considered to be rare. In the literature, most of the ruptures of SPT were associated with the blunt abdominal trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>, while the spontaneous rupture seemed to be quite uncommon. We report a rare case of a spontaneous ruptured SPT which was resected completely by elective laparoscopic surgery.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The patient was a healthy 13-year-old female, who suddenly felt abdominal pain. She was taken to another hospital by ambulance, and the enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5 cm diameter cystic tumor in the pancreatic tail with fluid collection around it . The CT results indicated her acute abdominal pain was due to the hemoperitoneum caused by rupture of the pancreatic tumor. Because she had no history of blunt abdominal trauma, the tumor was considered to have ruptured spontaneously. The pancreatic tumor was diagnosed as a SPT of the pancreas from the finding on the CT combined with her age and gender. Since the bleeding stopped by conservative therapy, she was referred to our hospital for surgical treatment at three months after the rupture of the tumor. At that time, she had no abdominal symptoms and the tumor was not palpable. The CT at our hospital showed the cystic tumor was 4 cm in diameter, which protruded from pancreatic tail and was distant from the main pancreatic duct, and the fluid around the tumor had disappeared . From these findings, an elective laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor was proposed. Since there seemed to be no peritoneal dissemination from the result of laparoscopic exploration, laparoscopic enucleation was performed by using five trocars under pneumoperitoneum. The pancreatic parenchyma was divided with the laparoscopic coagulating shears . Duration of operation was 126 minutes and with little blood loss. Because the content of amylase in the fluid from the drain placed at the cut surface of the pancreas was 9710 IU/L on postoperative day 3, the postoperative pancreatic fistula was confirmed according to the international definition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, because the volume of the fluid from drain was very small, the drain was removed on postoperative day 4. Except for the pancreatic fistula of grade A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 7. Pathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as SPT of the pancreas. The negative surgical margin and the rupture of the capsule of tumor were verified by microscopic examination . She survived without recurrence of disease for two years after the operation.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Urgent CT of acute abdomen.

Discussion\n\n【15】It is well known that SPT usually shows no characteristic clinical presentation, and the main nonspecific symptoms are abdominal discomfort or abdominal pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4, 9–12\\]</u>. In the present case, tumor was discovered by acute abdominal pain due to rupture of the tumor and hemoperitoneum. The incidence of the rupture of SPT was reported in 2.7% of 292 cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Regarding rupture of SPT, blunt abdominal trauma was the most common 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u> and according to a review article, 3% of 718 cases of SPT were discovered after the trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Other cases were considered to be spontaneous rupture and it was estimated to occur in approximately 1% of all SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Since the cystic part of SPT consisted of the degeneration after the intramural hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9, 13, 16\\]</u>, SPT had a natural tendency to hemorrhage inside the tumor. Therefore, the spontaneous rupture of SPT was considered to result from both abrupt massive hemorrhage and increase of the pressure in the tumor. Panieri and colleagues reported a case of the major bleed into the lesser sac causing the rupture of SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, and the enhanced CT also revealed a massive bleeding around the pancreatic tumor when our patient felt acute abdominal pain. Moreover, the tumor of the present case seemed to be slightly larger at the moment of rupture than three months later. When the abrupt hemorrhage occurred in the abdomen, emergency laparotomy was usually indicated. However, in the present case, the hemorrhage stopped with conservative therapy and allowed elective surgical treatment.\n\n【17】Surgical resection is the only treatment to cure SPT generally assuring a good prognosis, as reflected in the overall 5-year survival rate of approximately 95% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 12\\]</u>. Most cases of SPT have previously undergone the standard pancreatic resections such as pancreatoduodenectomy and distal pancreatectomy, because the tumors were relatively large and misdiagnosed as malignant disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11\\]</u>. However, the surgical procedure indicated for SPT still remains controversial. Namely, taking into account the character of SPT, if at all possible the surgical procedures preserving pancreatic parenchyma and function should be selected. Butte and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> described microscopic margins that were not considered a strong prognostic factor for the disease recurrence in SPT. Therefore, either partial resection or enucleation might be indicated for the small SPT, especially those localized in the periphery of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 11, 17, 18\\]</u>. Actually, local resections and enucleations were performed in approximately 30% of SPT according to the recent literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 19, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【18】On the other hand, there was a report that enucleation for the pancreatic tumor had a high risk of pancreatic fistula 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Although postoperative pancreatic fistula was reported in 38% of sixty-one enucleation cases of the pancreatic tumor, it was considered a safe and effective procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 21\\]</u>. Li and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u> recommended a minimized resection such as enucleation and partial resection for SPT, because there were no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative complications and the prognosis between the minimized resection and the standard resection.\n\n【19】In pancreatic surgery, the laparoscopic technique has been increasingly applied in recent years, but it still remains uncommon. Both enucleation and distal pancreatectomy were procedures without reconstruction. Therefore, they were the first to be performed by the laparoscopic approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 22\\]</u>. These laparoscopic procedures of enucleation and distal pancreatectomy have already been considered to be feasible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–22\\]</u> and have shown good indications for the low-grade malignant SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 21, 22\\]</u>. It was mentioned that there were no statistically significant differences in the postoperative complications and the prognosis between laparoscopic surgery and ordinary surgery for SPT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. With regard to SPT, parenchyma preserving surgical procedure with laparoscopy should be considered if the tumor is small in size and located away from the main pancreatic duct.\n\n【20】There might be another argument in the surgical approach for ruptured SPT. Namely, when the emergency operation was decided just after the rupture of SPT, open surgery might usually be selected. Since acute hemorrhage due to the rupture of SPT was stopped by conservative therapy in the present case, we considered elective laparoscopic surgery. But if the peritoneal dissemination was seen on intraoperative laparoscopic exploration, the conversion to open surgery was considered necessary for curable resection of a metastatic lesion with primary tumor.\n\n【21】Recurrence was reported to occur in 10% to 15% of SPT patients after surgical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 10, 12\\]</u>. Kim and colleagues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> asserted that the tumor rupture might be the risk factor for recurrence after surgery for SPT. The previous reports showed that peritoneal dissemination of SPT occurred in only few cases even after the rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 14, 23, 24\\]</u>, although rupture of SPT was expected to be the most predictable factor for the peritoneal dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 25\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Actually, some case reports indicated that disease free periods of the ruptured cases ranged from 12 to 66 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 15, 25, 26\\]</u>. On the other hand, Kyokane et al. reported that the dissemination associated with the rupture of SPT was seen in only one case among the six cases of SPT with peritoneal dissemination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Since the rupture of SPT has been quite uncommon, the relationship between rupture of SPT and peritoneal dissemination remains to be resolved.\n\n【23】In conclusion, a quite uncommon case of spontaneous rupture of the solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas has been described. Although emergency laparotomy is usually performed in the case with hemoperitoneum associated with rupture of the pancreatic tumor, we were able to resect SPT completely by elective laparoscopic surgery. SPT is considered to be a low-grade malignancy and a good prognosis is expected after the surgery. However, our patient who is alive without recurrence after surgery for two years should continue to be followed up carefully.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Susumu Takamatsu, Hiroto Nagano, Shunro Ootsukasa, Yasuyuki Kawachi, and Hiroshi Maruyama have no conflict of interests.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors give special thanks to Dr. Shigeki Arii for his help with their paper.

Within the physiologic zone of rest formed by these 4 positions, the vertical and anterior borders of the envelope of function may be documented for the incisal and posterior mandible in true 3-dimensional fashion to assist the clinician in determining a physiologic interocclusal freeway space and vertical dimension of occlusion.

Introduction\n\n【3】Clinical application of a maxillomandibular orthopedic relationship including nerves, muscles, ligaments, dental occlusion, and both temporomandibular joints for optimal function can be challenging. However, failure to consider these basic dynamic elements of dental occlusion in providing temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) treatment may result in a functional compromise. Functional compromise may either predispose or ultimately lead to muscle pathology, destruction of the dentition, supporting structures and/or the temporomandibular joints. Even mild forms of compromise result in dysfunction of the neuromuscular apparatus and associated structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In an age that demands evidence-based care, combining objective measurements of physiologic and anatomic components is a natural evolution from treatment based on subjective and mechanical concepts, to computer-assisted technologies when seeking objective answers to complex physiologic functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Mandibular Posture\n\n【6】Posture may be defined as the relative position of the various parts of the body with respect to the egocentric coordinate system, the exocentric coordinate system, and the geocentric coordinate system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Postural control involves the meaningful integration of many different neural systems that control postural components, including those associated with cognition. The mechanical problem of maintaining the posture of any single region of the body is that there are profound effects on proximal and distal regions.\n\n【7】The orientation of any body part, such as the mandible, may be described in terms of these frameworks and it reflects a dynamic process.\n\n【8】The habitual postural position of the mandible when at rest in the upright position and the condyles are in a neutral unstrained position in the mandibular fossae is also called “postural position” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Anatomical rest position, or loose packed position, for the TMJ is with the mouth slightly open so the teeth are not in contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【9】Through the use of surface electromyography (SEMG), muscle activity of the masticatory system can be objectively measured. The repeatable postural range at minimum baseline SEMG levels has been shown to be consistent with physiologic rest position and jaw posture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Physiologic rest of the mandible, therefore, may be defined as the minimum amount of muscle activity required to maintain anatomical rest.\n\n【10】To achieve physiologic rest, the masticatory and cervical muscles must be balanced and coordinated with respect to left and right sides and the muscles of the posterior neck must be in balance with the anterior cervical muscles. This represents a stable mandibular position concurrent with a stable head position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u> as only a few millimeters of increased inter-occlusal distance may influence a large reduction of masticatory muscle activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore, interocclusal distance and muscle activity are intimately related and physiologically relevant. The postural range of the mandible should be a repeatable zone where the mandible may return allowing the investing musculature to function from physiologic rest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Additional research supporting SEMG clinical techniques in dentistry are numerous and conveniently provide guidelines where SEMG may be employed within treatment approaches including appliance therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–19\\]</u>, orthodontic intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–24\\]</u>, and dentures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Surface Electromyography (SEMG) and Jaw Kinematics in Determining a Mandibular Postural Position\n\n【13】Through the use of incisal based, magnetic kinematic technology and SEMG, Mazzocco et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> proposed a clinical protocol by which an incisal vertical physiologic envelope may be mapped in the TMD patient .\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Adapted and modified from \\[26, page 9\\]. SEMG of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MM), temporalis posterior (TP), and suprahyoid (DA) sites in combination with incisal spatial kinematics. “Maximum physiologic opening” or the bottom of the physiologic zone (incisal position 1) was determined when the suprahyoid activity was above what was determined as normal levels. The top of the zone or “maximal physiologic closing” (incisal position 3) was determined when elevator activity increased to greater than what was determined as physiologic normal levels. Physiologic rest (incisal position 2) position after 45–60 minutes of ULF-TENS. |\n| --- |\n\n【16】A postural envelope defines the limits of stability in space in all directions. As long as the sway envelope stays within the limits of stability, balance is maintained. If sway exceeds these limits, strategies involving neighboring regions must be employed to regain balance. If an individual’s center of gravity is more anterior, posterior, or lateral than center, a smaller sway envelope is tolerated before losing balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. The demand of neighboring systems then increases to remain within this smaller physiologic envelope. Therefore, if mandibular rest position or mandibular postural sway exceeds the zone of the physiologic resting range, a combined strategy including those of neighboring regions (e.g. the cervical spine, etc.), must be incorporated in an effort to maintain stability. Unfortunately, once the system’s adaptive capacities have been surpassed, pathology would ultimately develop.\n\n【17】A stable, physiologic occlusion would consider the spatial position from which the postural resting position of the mandible is maintained within a spatial zone that offers relatively minimal, balanced muscle activity in order to be able to provide symmetrical and prompt activation of the jaw musculature as the teeth are brought into occlusion, where maximal muscle recruitment is available and where the mandible may return to the physiologic resting range promptly and symmetrically.\n\n【18】Previous clinical works have been limited to incisal vertical dimension and lack documentation of posterior jaw position and an anterior boundary. Knowledge of the anterior border would enable clinicians to establish a jaw position within a boundary which, if exceeded, would require the neighboring systems to accommodate to maintain stability. Furthermore, posterior mandibular position is also of great importance as loss of posterior occlusal support leads to noticeable cranial condyle movement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u> as well as significantly altered effects on cervical muscle activity and spinal curvature with asymmetrical posterior occlusal support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Therefore, it would enable the clinician to objectively ascertain if the chosen mandibular position from the anterior and posterior coordinates is within vertical and anterior physiologic boundaries.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Lateral Pterygoid\n\n【20】The concept that disturbance to the activity of the lateral pterygoid muscles plays an important role in the etiology of TMD and is widely accepted; however, there is a dearth of scientific evidence to support this clinical notion and the role of the lateral pterygoid muscle in normal function remains controversial.\n\n【21】Motor unit studies at computer tomography confirmed that sites demonstrate and confirm that the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid (IHLP) and the superior head of the lateral pterygoid (SHLP) are active during opening, protrusion, and contralateral jaw movements, while a minority of SHLP were active during closing movements. These percutaneous results also provide clinically valuable information and have demonstrated that the SHLP and IHLP were minimally active when the jaw was in the clinically determined postural jaw position 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31–33\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The presence of elevated activity in the lateral pterygoid muscle at resting jaw posture may be of clinical significance in that variations in the level of lateral pterygoid muscle activity could influence and/or assist in determining the anterior positioning of the condyle in relation to the disc and eminence, as well as the positioning of the jaw at postural position.\n\n【23】Through the works of Hiyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34, 35\\]</u> and Thomas, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u> it has been shown that through intraoral recording techniques, it may be possible to monitor the activity of the lateral pterygoids using surface electrodes. Although the nature of the surface electrode disallows distinction between the activities of the superior and inferior heads of the lateral pterygoid muscles, this provides tremendous promise for clinical purposes.\n\n【24】In this case study, the physiologic window of postural rest position inclusive of anterior and posterior mandibular position relative to the maxilla and muscle activity of the intraoral lateral pterygoid placement was explored.\n\n【25】#### 5\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【26】Case study design including a 43 year old male with normal occlusion, with temporomandibular dysfunction. The subject was a unilaterally involved combined myogenous and arthrogenous patient (groups I and II according to RDC/TMD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u> and reported moderate to severe muscular pain at rest and during mandibular movements on the right side; pain was also associated with palpation of the TMJ area. Pain was classified as grade I-II according to the chronic pain classification scale (low disability with low to high intensity pain). Clicking (in opening/closing) or articular crepitus, on the right side were subjectively found.\n\n【27】Additional objective data included right joint sounds analysis that revealed possible crepitus, adhesions, scarring, and degenerative issues. Imaging results revealed slight osteogenic degeneration, sclerosis, and posterior and superior displacement of the right condyle.\n\n【28】SEMG data was collected from the bilateral temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), and suprahyoid (DIG) sites using pregelled bipolar Ag/AgCl surface electrodes (Noraxon USA) with a diameter of 1 cm and an interelectrode distance of 2 cm center to center, parallel to muscle fiber direction over the muscle belly as recommended 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. The reference electrode was placed on the C-7 spinous process. All SEMG electrode sites were rigorously abraded and cleansed with sterile alcohol prep pads prior to electrode placement.\n\n【29】The activity of the bilateral lateral pterygoid (LP) sites was recorded intraorally by way of surface electrodes per Hiyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34, 35\\]</u>. The electrodes used were a small Ag/AgCl surface electrode Blue Ambu N with a monitoring area of 15/28 mm<sup>2</sup> and a decentralized snap. The electrodes were trimmed and adhered to reach an interelectrode distance of approximately 1 cm and secured on the mucosa in the buccal vestibule distal to the maxillary tuberosity with an adhesive. Prior to electrode placement, the mucosal tissue was dried using a standard paper towel and then cleaned with a sterile alcohol prep pad.\n\n【30】All SEMG data was collected with a telemetry device, preamplified and band-pass filtered in hardware between 20 and 500 Hz (Noraxon USA) with input impedance greater than 100 Mohms and sampled at 1000 Hz with an overall gain of 1000. Data was rectified and smoothed at 100 ms (movag) in WinNMBite software (Zebris GmbH).\n\n【31】Spatial analysis of the lower jaw was determined in conjunction with SEMG using the Jaw Motion Analysis system (JMA) from Zebris Medical GmbH . The JMA system has been determined to be accurate for recording and evaluating jaw motion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39–41\\]</u>.\n\n【32】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Jaw Motion Analysis system mounted on subject. Courtesy of Zebris Medical GmbH. |\n| --- |\n\n【34】The JMA utilizes ultrasonic sensors attached to a light head frame (approximately 3.9 ounces) and emitters (weight—approximately 10 grams) that were attached to the mandibular dentition via Stomahesive (Convatec Inc). The resolution of the ultrasonic path is approximately 0.085 mm with a maximum sampling rate of 200 Hz (sampling rate was 75 Hz for the case study).\n\n【35】Documentation of the subject’s maxillary right and left distobuccal molars and the incisal points were determined using the pointer system. The lower jaw is then referenced to these three points in space. These coordinates used are relative to the maxillary plane and provide incisal and posterior mandibular coordinates relative to the maxilla.\n\n【36】The subject was seated upright comfortably in a straight-back chair without head support, with the Frankfurt occlusal plane parallel to the floor. After SEMG electrode placement was completed, baseline/postural resting values of each site were recorded .\n\n【37】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| SEMG activity of the bilateral temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS) suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoids (LP) at the initial baseline/postural resting position (Pre-TENS). |\n| --- |\n\n【39】Following the baseline recording, the subject was instructed on how to perform a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) for the masseter, temporalis anterior, and pterygoids. SEMG baseline/postural data of the temporalis anterior and masseter sites were normalized to their corresponding mean SEMG values recorded during a two second maximal clench. With the teeth apart where maxillary and mandibular incisal position was even, a recording during a 2 second maximally resisted protrusive effort was performed . SEMG baseline/postural data of the lateral pterygoid sites were normalized to their corresponding mean SEMG values recorded during the two second maximum resisted protrusion effort.\n\n【40】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| Recorded during jaw protrusion against resistance while the teeth are separated. Baseline values of the lateral pterygoids were normalized to this maximal effort. |\n| --- |\n\n【42】Ultralow frequency transcutaneous electrical stimulation (ULF-TENS,) was chosen as the relaxation method due to research demonstrating the efficiency in relaxing masticatory muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42–44\\]</u>. Following application of ULF-TENS, (Dolotens, Neuromuscular Technologies, Inc.) for 25 minutes, the subject was seated in a comfortable head-supported upright position with the Frankfort horizontal plane parallel to the floor and an additional baseline recording was taken to ensure that relaxation of all muscles was achieved . Then, the physiologic rest position was determined utilizing a traditional protocol as described by Hickman et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>.\n\n【43】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n| SEMG activity of the bilateral temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS) suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoids (RLP/LLPT) after 25 minutes of ULF-TENS. Recording demonstrates that baseline levels from all sites are low and balanced. |\n| --- |\n\n【45】Physiologic rest position of the mandible may be described as a position assumed by the mandible within the physiologic window . This position was identified after appropriate SEMG values were established to maintain balanced, relatively minimal muscle activity of the jaw elevator and depressor muscles.\n\n【46】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 </u>\n\n| Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral SEMG activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites.

The first spatial position/border, “maximum physiologic opening” was identified based upon SEMG parameters using similar methods described by Lynn and Mazzocco  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Maximum physiologic opening was obtained by having the subject slowly open the mouth until suprahyoid or lateral pterygoid SEMG activity demonstrated a consistent elevation in excess of physiologic rest activity. The subject was instructed to perform this motion 3 times to evaluate consistency. The spatial position when either the lateral pterygoid or suprahyoids demonstrated a consistent “burst” of activity above physiologic rest values was documented .\n\n【49】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 </u>\n\n| Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites.

Maximum physiologic closure was obtained by having the subject to slowly close the mouth until it was determined that the elevator muscle activity (masseter, temporalis anterior, or lateral pterygoids) demonstrated a consistent elevation in excess of physiologic resting activity and greater than 2% of their MVC. The threshold of 2% was chosen based on previous work that demonstrated a mathematical calculation of normal subjects having a resting baseline of less than 2% of MVC for the mandibular elevators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Acceptable baseline amplitudes, may be operationally defined as less than a 1% to 2% MVIC amplitude for tasks that are functionally performed for about 1 hour or longer (e.g. posture of the mandible) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. The subject performed this motion 3 times to evaluate consistency. The spatial position where the lateral pterygoid, masseter or, temporalis anterior sites demonstrated a consistent “burst” above 2% MVC was documented .\n\n【52】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 </u>\n\n| Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites.

Results\n\n【58】Spatial position for incisal, right and left posterior jaw positions relative to their corresponding physiologic positions are presented in Table 1.\n\n【59】Table 1 \n\n【60】Summary of associated mandibular coordinates relative to physiologic parameters, determined by simultaneous monitoring of masticatory muscle activity.\n\n【61】Physiologic rest was spatially determined when all elevator muscle levels were at relatively minimal levels and balanced. Incisal vertical demonstrated the greatest discrepancy. When establishing a spatial position of “maximal physiologic opening”, the suprahyoids demonstrated an initial elevation in activity in 2 of the 3 efforts. The 2nd effort demonstrated a simultaneous response of the right lateral pterygoid and suprahyoids. When establishing a spatial position of “maximal physiologic closing”, the lateral pterygoids consistently demonstrated a bilateral elevation in activity prior to the temporalis anterior and masseter recording sites in all 3 trials. When establishing a spatial position of maximal physiologic protrusion, the right lateral pterygoid site was consistently the first to demonstrate an elevation in activity over all muscles, in all 3 trials.\n\n【62】#### 7\\. Discussion\n\n【63】As previously indicated, once adaptive capacities have been surpassed, pathology develops. This is obvious within the masticatory and associated structures. Shortened muscles can initiate pain by affecting intramuscular nociceptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u> or through metabolic effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. As muscles shorten, tension increases and concurrent mechanical stress and pain may be induced by additional tension on tendons, joints, ligaments, as well as occlusion of the vascular bed prohibiting metabolic turnover. Tenderness within these tissues contributes to the sensitization of the associated neurons lowering the pain threshold. This nociceptive input arises from muscular hypertonicity and fatigue. Therefore, treatment directed towards muscle components that limit muscle hypertonicity can decrease pain related to the dysfunction present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【64】In the case study presented, each spatial position was documented when there was evidence of muscle activity above clinically acceptable baseline levels (hypertonicity). Therefore, the resting physiologic envelope of postural jaw function in this subject would be slightly superior to maximal physiologic opening, slightly inferior to maximal physiologic closing, and posterior to maximal physiologic protrusion, and it approximates the computed trajectory to be within a physiologic muscular position .\n\n【65】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 10 </u>\n\n| Spatial position of the lower jaw combined with bilateral activity of the temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MAS), suprahyoid (DIG), and lateral pterygoid (LPT) sites. Coordinates listed are representative of mandibular position relative to centric occlusion and physiologic rest, maximal physiologic opening (position 1), maximal physiologic closing (position 2), and maximal physiologic protrusion (position 3). |\n| --- |\n\n【67】The data would suggest that in this subject, an increase in vertical dimension may be considered to be compatible within the physiologic range. The vertical dimension compared to anterior/posterior positioning may require the largest change to reach a homeostatic state with mild differences between right and left posterior mandibular positions. If vertical dimension changes were to be considered on this subject, the vertical dimension would allow relatively moderate changes (less than 3.6 mm left and 3.3 mm right posterior jaw positions, resp.) and suggest mild changes in 3-dimensions to the subject’s right in 3 of the 4 positions documented. Also, any anterior change may be limited in this subject as all positions were less than a millimeter anterior to CO to be within the physiologic range. These data suggest that the vertical dimension of both the anterior and posterior jaw may endure the greatest change, where the anterior/posterior range is much more sensitive to change.\n\n【68】Furthermore, it was found that in establishing the resting physiologic envelope, during maximal physiologic closing, the lateral pterygoid sites, not investigated in previous studies, were consistently found to be responsive prior to prime mover sites (temporalis anterior or masseter). During maximal physiologic protrusion, the lateral pterygoid consistently demonstrated earlier activation than any other site, and during maximal physiologic opening, it was found to be elevated approximately 30% of the time concurrent with the suprahyoid sites.\n\n【69】This information presents a number of appealing implications as follows.通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>This physiologic resting range of the anterior and posterior mandibular positions may be documented utilizing jaw motion analysis (e.g. Zebris Medical GmbH) when combined with SEMG. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>The vertical physiologic envelope may be smaller than previously suggested in TMD subjects. The function and activity of the lateral pterygoid suggest that this may be the limiting factor. 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>The anterior border (maximum physiologic protrusion) may be documented if concurrent lateral pterygoid activity is recorded. 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>Caution should be exercised if jaw positioning is considered anterior to a trajectory created by TENS if the lateral pterygoid activity is not measured.通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>Intraoral lateral pterygoid recordings may lend important information in the construction of “pull-forward” appliances for sleep apnea patients to ensure the chosen appliance and/or position is within the physiologic range.通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>Establishing the physiologic borders through the combined use of SEMG and posterior jaw position during a bite registration procedure may allow the clinician to objectively document the range of physiologic rest of the anterior and posterior lower jaw in the vertical and anterior dimensions. Theoretically, this would allow the clinician to ensure the chosen bite registration position is within physiologically tolerable limits, thereby lessening the amount of adaptation that would be required. Within the physiologic zone of rest formed by these 4 positions, the vertical and anterior borders of the envelope of function may be documented for the incisal and posterior mandible in true 3-dimensional fashion to assist the clinician in determining a physiologic interocclusal freeway space and vertical dimension of occlusion.\n\n【70】This and previous works demonstrated tremendous promise for clinical applications for intraoral SEMG of the lateral pterygoid sites if commercially available customized miniature intraoral surface electrodes became available and an established electrode placement protocol based on verified CT sites is tested more thoroughly for clinical applications. Should these parameters be met, use of surface electromyography of the lateral pterygoids would provide noninvasive, functionally diagnostic treatment information not attainable by other means.\n\n【71】In the computed trajectory, one limitation is that functional anatomy dictates that the mandible does not move in a straight line. Therefore, it is seemingly intuitive that any sort of computer generated trajectory is an approximation and the addition of SEMG may be necessary to ensure that any chosen treatment position is within physiologic parameters.\n\n【72】Furthermore, there are obvious biomechanical implications related to the cranial-skeletal system that should be considered. Cranial asymmetries are not uncommon, often associated with craniofacial asymmetries, as well as cerebral asymmetries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49–51\\]</u>. In view of the fact that the masticatory muscles have attachments to the cranium, if asymmetries or skeletal anomalies exist, muscles are disallowed a biomechanically symmetrical alignment among homologous pairs, predisposing them to dysfunction. Without initially correcting these biomechanical issues, treatment success is likely to be limited with or without the technique or technologies presented.\n\n【73】The author acknowledges some clear limitations. In addition to the aforementioned parameters, the dimensional changes by way of orthodontic or reconstructive or other methods that were considered when referring to the data are speculative only and were not explored and thus, the rigorous research is required to establish validity of the concept. The analyzed individual represents only a convenient sample, and the extrapolation of the results or to different TMD diagnostic groups, should be done with caution. However, the concept does follow basic physiologic principles and appears to be promising.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The 15q11.1-13.1 duplication, also known as Dup15q syndrome, is a rare congenital disease affecting 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 60,000 children worldwide. This condition is characterized by the presence of at least one extra copy of genetical material within the Prader-Willi/Angelman Critical Region (PWACR) of the referred 15q11.2-q13.1 chromosome. Case Report. Our study presents the clinical and genetical features of the first patient with a denovo 15q11.2 interstitial duplication on the maternal allele (inv Dup15q) that mimics a milder Prader-Willi syndrome probably due to an atypical disruption of the SNHG14 gene. Methylation-specific MLPA analysis has confirmed the presence of a very unlikely duplication that lies between breakpoint 1 (BP1) and the middle of BP2 and BP3 (BP3). This atypical alteration might be linked to the milder patient’s clinical phenotype. Conclusions. This is the first Dup15q patient reported in Ecuador and of the very few in South America. This aberration has never been described in a patient with Dup15q, and the unusual clinical presentation is probably due to the atypical distal breakpoint occurring within the gene SNHG14 which lies between BP2 and BP3 and does not therefore contain the whole PWACR. If the duplication disrupted the gene, then it is possible that it is the cause of, or contributing to, the patient’s clinical phenotype.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】The 15q11.1-13.1 duplication, also known as Dup15q syndrome, is a rare disease with a prevalence at birth estimated at 1 in 30,000 but may be an underestimate. In patients with developmental concerns (developmental delay, intellectual disability, or autism spectrum disorder) or multiple congenital anomalies, the prevalence of partial tetrasomy of chromosome 15 is estimated to range between 253 and 584 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. There is an observed male to female predilection of 2 : 1 worldwide. This condition is characterized by the presence of at least one extra copy in the Prader-Willi/Angelman Critical Region (PWACR) of the referred 15q11.2-q13.1 chromosome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. This extra copy of genetic information often comes from the mother since paternally transmitted duplications are most likely asymptomatic. The most common type of duplication occurs in 80% of the cases and is due to the presence of extrachromosomal genetic information, leading to a supernumerary chromosome, a condition known as isodicentric 15q11.2-q13.1 duplication (Idic15q). In the remaining 20% of cases, additional genetic material is duplicated within the chromosome itself, resulting in an interstitial duplication of 15q11.2-q13.1 chromosome (Dup15q) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. Isodicentric duplications are always considered to be de novo, while maternal interstitial duplication is de novo in 85% of cases and maternally inherited in 15% of the remaining cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The region in the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q) contains an important cluster of imprinted genes within the PWACR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. When deletions or duplications occur in this locus, a significant susceptibility to develop autism spectrum disorders and skeletomuscular and intellectual developmental impairments is generated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Common clinical findings are represented by hypotonia, mild to severe developmental delay, risk of epilepsy, and different gravities of autism spectrum disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>. The diagnosis is established by the detection of duplication in the specific 15q region, with evidence of at least one extra copy within the PWACR, a condition usually inherited from the mother, although paternal transmission has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【6】The different genomic testing methods available to determine the copy number of sequences and identify chromosomal duplications can include chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and targeted duplication analysis, as well as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In addition, the 15q11.1-13.1 region encompasses imprinted genes, depending on the parent-of-origin. This imprinting allows for diagnosis based on methylation status using methylation-sensitive (MS) multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). PWS/MS-MLPA can also efficiently distinguish the parental origin of the duplications of 15q11.2-q13.1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【7】The available literature reports that most of the cases are diagnosed after months of subtle hypotonia and feeding problems observed by the parents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This study describes a unique case relating to a very unlikely presentation that was incompletely diagnosed in Ecuador and further analyzed in the United Kingdom.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】This report has exhaustively monitored the first case worldwide to have this type of mutation. The patient has been followed from day one of birth until the age of 3 years, and we have documented all the available information concerning his development. Clinical, radiological, molecular, and genetic evaluations have been carried out.\n\n【10】##### 2.1. Patient Information\n\n【11】A full-term male newborn (38.5 weeks) was born by an induced vaginal delivery. He is the second child of nonconsanguineous, 35-year-old healthy parents of Ecuadorian (Hispanic) ethnicity. His parents had no medical history of Dup15, autism, or Prader-Willis syndrome in their families, neither a history of alcohol or drug consumption before, during, or after pregnancy. A total of 12 prenatal-care visits and six ultrasounds were performed, and no abnormalities were found.\n\n【12】At 38.5 weeks, the gynecologist decided to induce labor, mainly attributed to the lack of weight gain expected from the last visit. One hour and 30 minutes before delivery, a single dose of intramuscular analgesia was administered (Tramadol: 100 mg) to reduce pain.\n\n【13】##### 2.2. Clinical Findings\n\n【14】The neonatologist received a spontaneous crying, 2,575 g male newborn with an Apgar score of 8/9, with a standard physical exam. He was examined for a routine evaluation and placed under typical observation for almost two hours. After deciding to rooming-in, the newborn was alert, awake, and active. He breastfed vigorously for up to 30 minutes until the newborn exhibited acute and severe hypotonia, complete unresponsiveness, and somnolence, as well as an absence of deep tendon reflexes, positive Babinski signs, and shallow breathing. As parents (both physicians) observed this acute alteration, the pediatrician team decided to transfer the newborn to the intermediate care unit for monitoring and evaluation. The sleepiness lasts several days with short intervals of alertness while a complete and multidisciplinary medical evaluation occurred.\n\n【15】##### 2.3. Diagnosis Assessment\n\n【16】On commencement, all studies were focused on the effort to obtain answers about his sleepiness and unresponsiveness. A basic panel looking for infectious diseases was started, although no signs of fever, leukocytosis, or neutrophilia were observed. Moreover, blood chemistry, urine test, and electrolytes came out normal, although the arterial blood gas (ABG) test showed some signs of a compensated respiratory alkalosis. One day later, the neonate was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and exhaustive clinical, imaging, and laboratory examinations were performed. Additional investigations such as TORCH immunological test, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) measures, lactic acid levels, cerebral spinal fluid analysis, and hormonal test were carried out .\n\n【17】Table 1 \n\n【18】Laboratory results from the NICU.\n\n【19】As seen in Table 1, most of the results were within normal limits, except for the CPK and the ammonia serum levels, which were significantly high. As several hypotheses were drawn, CPK was found to be caused by a traumatic bruise, a superficial trauma reported by the staff while trying to induce hard tactile stimuli over the newborn chest. Ammonia was reported as a significantly high abnormality that at that time was attributed to the use of maternal tramadol, as it has been previously elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. At this point, intracranial hemorrhage or other cerebral abnormality was suspected; therefore, cranial ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained. Nevertheless, both came out normal .\n\n【20】(a)\n\n【21】(b)\n\n【22】(c)\n\n【23】(d)\n\n【24】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【26】Coronal view of the brain.

Therapeutic Interventions\n\n【28】The newborn remained for approximately three days with signs of extreme drowsiness, decreased reflexes, and severe persistent central hypotonia. Nasogastric tube for feeding as well as a medium IV access for hydration access was habilitated. A continuous, twice a day physical therapy (PT) was indicated during the entire length of admission.\n\n【29】##### 2.5. Genetical Diagnosis\n\n【30】On the fourth day, he was more active and had an improved suction reflex, so the nasogastric tube was removed, and a spontaneous breastfeeding strategy was implemented every 3 hours, despite persistent hypotonia. After an extensive evaluation, infectious, neurological, and metabolic conditions were ruled out. On the twelfth day, he was discharged with a pending result of genetic analysis, karyotype, and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). 12 days later postdischarge, the chromosomal analysis came out normal, showing a male karyotype without structural or numerical apparent changes .\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【32】Normal male karyotype 46, XY.\n\n【33】At this point, a suspected diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome was formulated. The newborn remained at home with severe hypotonia, regular feeding, and continuous neurological, physical, and occupational rehabilitation until genetic results returned from Portugal (CGC Genetics) 16 days postdischarge.\n\n【34】The results of the semiquantitative method for methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) demonstrated the presence of an interstitial duplication of chromosome 15 (15q11-q13) originated from the maternal allele with at least 2.4 mega-bases implicated, confirming the diagnosis of duplication of the 15q11-q13 region .\n\n【35】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【36】Abnormal methylation pattern in the SNRPN gene due to duplication of region 15q11-13.\n\n【37】The diagnosis obtained through MS-MLPA showed a small duplication. Nevertheless, due to the lack of conclusive information, the parents of the patient decided to further explore the genetic aberration through the use of a microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) technique, and the array design was Oxford Gene Technology’s CytoSure™ Constitutional v3 oligo array, with a DLRS score = 0.1131 and an average backbone resolution of 189 kB in high priority regions to 375 kB in medium priority region and 663 kB in low priority regions, depending on the significance of the region in relation to developmental delay.\n\n【38】The aCGH has confirmed the cytogenetically visible interstitial duplication involving 15q11.2 that was originally detected: arr\\[GRCh37\\] 15q11.2(22765637\\25259734)x3.\n\n【39】The results demonstrated that the duplicated region comprises the specific position 2276563 7\\2525973 of chromosome 15q (2.4 Mb).\n\n【40】In this region, we identified the following codifying genes: CYFIP1, MAGEL2, MKRN3, NDN, NIPA1, NIPA2, NPAP1, SNRPN, SNURF, TUBGCP5, PWRN1, PWRN2, SNORD64, and SNHG14.\n\n【41】Although the duplication involves the entire PWACR region, the distal breakpoint occurring within the gene SNHG14 lies between BP2 and BP3. This specific region of duplication has never been reported in a Dup15q patient .\n\n【42】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【43】Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), x3, showing the breakpoints where the duplication occurred.\n\n【44】##### 2.6. Follow-Up and Discharge\n\n【45】In general terms, the child showed a mild development delay, especially for his head control which was acquired at 6 months (typically 0–2 months), sitting with support at 9 months (typically 4–6 months), standing up at 14 months (typically 9–10 months), and wide-based gait at 20 months (typically 12–15 months).\n\n【46】The child, despite having a slight psychomotor delay from birth, has developed in a very positive way. The physical, neurological, and emotional development have been quite normal, showing no signs of autism, neither epilepsy. An awake EEG and the last MRI were normal and did not show any pathological features. The main visible features are generalized hypotonia (especially in the upper trunk), short stature (−2.18 SD), and central obesity. In addition to this, it presents tampering fingers on the hands, narrow hands and feet, small penis, and a bilateral undescended testis, which were surgically resolved. Other features shared with Prader-Willi syndrome are almond-shaped eyes, central obesity, and a constant sense of hunger with hyperphagia.\n\n【47】The child at the time of this study is 36 months old and although he is not able to jump, he runs, climbs stairs, and is partially potty trained. His communication skills are progressing; even though his speech was delayed, his nonverbal communication, understanding, and social skills are normal, with no presence of autism spectrum disorder, nor infantile spams or epilepsy, classic features of 15q duplication syndrome.\n\n【48】During the last year, a Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL) to assess his developmental abilities across a range of domains was performed. The results showed that the patient had an early learning composite score of 63 (normal from 85 to 115), very close to the normal range. In terms of evaluating the child’s typical performance of day-to-day activities required for personal and social sufficiency, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, the 3rd Edition (VABS-III)–Parent Report was reported as normal.\n\n【49】#### 3\\. Discussion and Conclusions\n\n【50】We are presenting the first case in which an interstitial duplication of chromosome 15 is accompanied by a disruption of the SNHG14 gene. Normally, this region of chromosome 15 is imprinted, and the clinical significance of an imbalance is dependent on the parental origin abnormality. However, the patient’s duplication is atypical with the distal breakpoint occurring within the gene SNHG14 which lies between BP2 and BP3 and does not therefore contain the whole PWACR and may change the expression of this imprinted region. If the duplication has disrupted the gene, then it is possible that it is the cause of, or contributing to, the patient’s clinical phenotype. This case could be the first case ever reported of a patient who has a diagnosis of Dup15q but presents certain phenotypical and behavioral characteristics of a child with Prader-Willi syndrome. This sine qua non situation might be related to the milder phenotypical presentation of this child. There is only one case of a well-documented translocation of a breakpoint disrupting the host SNHG14 gene. Nevertheless, the patient had a diagnosis of a typical Prader-Willi syndrome, and the disruption occurs in the paternal allele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The phenotypic expression of duplication of 15q11-q13 is highly variable; that is why there are no formal diagnostic criteria for clinical diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Most affected children have joint hyperextensibility and some degree of drooling. Intellectual disability is often present although it ranges from almost imperceptible to profoundly affected cognitive ability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Autism spectrum disorder and the presence of seizures (especially infantile spasms) are common features among Dup15q interstitial syndrome patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Dysmorphism is absent or subtle, but some dysmorphic features have been described, such as visible epicanthal folds, downslanting palpebral fissures, and a small upturned nose 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Behavioral difficulties can be recognized during infancy, including hyperactivity, anxiety, and a wide range of emotional lability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. All of these ambiguous and unspecific clinical characteristics make the diagnosis particularly challenging, with none of them being pathognomonic, and they can be related to a list of different genetic disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【51】In this particular case, there was no report of weak or less fetal movements in the prenatal history, and during his first minutes of life, his muscle tone appeared to be quite normal, taking note that he could also breastfeed with no problem. Within the next hours and a few days, his muscle tone and average response to the environment were diminished, which were caused by 15q11.1-13.1 duplication syndrome. A plausible explanation is a central nervous system depression involvement in the child due to tramadol administration to the mother during labor, which, when combined with his genetic disorder, may have had a synergic effect that made the presentation of hypotonia more severe. This phenomenon, to our best knowledge, has never been documented before. Nonetheless, this uncommon event undoubtedly contributed to an early diagnosis of 15q11.1-13.1 duplication syndrome, the earliest diagnosis reported of this condition, so far.\n\n【52】There are different molecular tests available to identify chromosomal duplications although there is a reduction in accessibility in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique for a specific 15q region is the most used worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Besides, FISH, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), quantitative protein chain reaction (qPCR), and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) techniques are commonly used in high-income countries (HICs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. It is important to notice that CMA can detect the exact area where interstitial duplication occurred, a useful technique to complete the reciprocal nonallelic homologous recombination analysis in patients with Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It would be of use to perform a DNA methylation analysis demonstrating abnormal parent-specific imprinting within the Prader-Willi critical region and confirm the imprinted region gene expression that may be atypical in this particular case.\n\n【53】The main advantages of MLPA, which was performed in this particular case, are that it is a high throughput and cost-effective way to check for duplications and deletions. It is a multiplex reaction as opposed to conventional PCR, and for most applications, a single MLPA reaction is sufficient to deliver the diagnosis for its capacity to distinguish sequences differing by a single nucleotide and detect a small copy number difference. The assay is reproducible, easy to perform, and sensitive, each MLPA reaction requires only 50 ng of human DNA, and it can be performed on a large number of samples simultaneously. Plus, MS-MLPA can efficiently distinguish the parental origin in 15q11.2-q13.1 duplications, important in determining the associated and different neurodevelopmental phenotypes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【54】The proximal end of chromosome 15 is susceptible to genomic rearrangements where most have been described for PWS, AS, and Dup15q 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Unlike PWS and AS where mechanisms of loss of functionality genes present in the region 15q11-q13 are evidenced, either by de novo deletions, paternal/maternal uniparental disomy depending on the phenotype, or errors in imprinting mechanisms, Dup15q syndrome is characterized by duplication in this chromosomal locus. Deletions, interstitial duplications, and triplications with similar frequencies are described for areas called BP1 and BP2 (4.11-13.29-31). However, the common breakpoints in Dup15 syndrome involves the same breakpoint (BP3) as in PWS/AS deletions. Additionally, two distal breakpoints (BP4 and BP5) are reported in cases of large 15q11-q14 interstitial triplications and in Dup 通用删除7(英):<u>(15)</u> chromosomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【55】The molecular diagnosis in this case showed an unusual breakpoint in the PWS/AS critical region that involves a 2.6 Mb region. When chromosomal rearrangements develop in this region, the reported phenotypes include characteristics such as mild, moderate, or severe mental and developmental retardation, autism or autistic traits, seizures, and dysmorphism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. There is a relationship between a mental retardation phenotype in individuals with Dup15 and the presence of the 3–4 Mb PWS/CHROMOSOMAL region (15q11-q13) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. In our case, the rearrangement compromises an area of smaller size so that the mild penetrance can be related to this minor affectation.\n\n【56】Furthermore, it is important to note that the affected area involves many genes defined by paternal expression. There is little evidence about the pathogenesis of SNHG14 on this syndrome. However, the relationship between a failure in its expression and the disruption in the expression of downstream genes of SNHG14 described as pathogenic for PWS has been described (PWAR6, SNORD109 A/B, SNORD116, IPW, and PWAR1) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Either by the size of the duplicated gene region or by the breakpoint that affects SNHG14, this case shows the unusual mechanisms described for an individual with Dup15 diagnosis.\n\n【57】Prenatal diagnosis is possible between 15 and 18 weeks of gestation by employing a sample of chorionic villi or amniocentesis, which can be analyzed by cytogenetic and molecular combination. However, this technique is not routinely performed and it is only recommended in the pregnancy of mothers who suffer interstitial duplication 15q, or parents who have children with this syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【58】As 15q11.1–13.1, duplication syndrome has a heterogeneous presentation, with different involvement and severity of development areas; the treatment focuses on the signs and symptoms associated with each individual. The motor development delay can be managed by physical or occupational therapy; speech therapy is used to treat speech delay, while, for seizures, the use of certain medications is determined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【59】Finally, the boy is progressing significantly well at present. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS-III) and the Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL) evaluation tests were performed at the UCLA Brain and Behavior in Genetic Syndromes Center in 2017. The patient was reported as having an early learning composite score of 63 (normal range 85–115) and a MSEL score equivalent to 100 (normal range 85–115).\n\n【60】This is the first case of Dup15q reported in Ecuador and of the very few in South America; nevertheless, it is the first case worldwide that has this type of mutation within the Prader-Willi/Angelman Critical Region. It is important to emphasize that this case requires a series of diagnostic testing strategies that are not available in Ecuador and they are rather inaccessible for the vast majority of the population in this part of the world. This type of chromosomal anomaly might be more common than reported, so an extensive evaluation of children with central hypotonia should always be considered. The population affected by this disease is particularly susceptible and the support of health personnel is essential.\n\n【61】#### Abbreviations\n\n| Dup15q: | Interstitial duplication of chromosome 15 |\n| --- | --- |\n| IM: | Intramuscular |\n| ABG: | Arterial blood gases |\n| aCGH: | Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization |\n| IDIC 15q: | Isodicentric duplication of chromosome 15 |\n| TORCH: | Toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex including syphilis, parvovirus, and varicella zoster |\n| ACMG: | American College of Medical Genetics |\n| MS-MLPA: | Methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification |\n| FISH: | Fluorescence in situ hybridization |\n| PWACR: | Prader-Willi/Angelman Critical Region |\n| DNA: | Deoxyribonucleic acid |\n| ER: | Endoplasmic reticulum |\n| NICU: | Neonatal intensive care unit |\n| GPI: | Glycosylphosphatidylinositol |\n| PT: | Physical therapy |\n| IGV: | Integrative genomics viewer |\n| OMIM: | Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man |\n| WES: | Whole-exome sequencing |\n| WGS: | Whole-genome sequencing |\n| UCLA: | University of California |\n| VABS-III: | Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale |\n| MSEL: | Mullen Scale of Early Learning |\n| MLPA: | Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. |\n\n【63】#### Data Availability\n\n【64】The data about personal information cannot be shared according to local ethical regulations; nevertheless, some anonymized information concerning medical results can be shared upon reasonable request to the corresponding author.\n\n【65】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【66】According to local guidelines, the reporting of cases depends on the authorization of both parents and the next of kin.

Sellar tuberculomas are extremely rare lesions with nonspecific clinical manifestations. The tuberculous infection of the pituitary gland and sellar region is characterized by the presence of an acute or chronic inflammatory reaction and may occur in the absence of systemic tuberculosis. The diagnosis is difficult prior to the surgery. An adequate diagnostic and antituberculous drugs usually result in a good outcome. Clinical Presentation. We report four cases of sellar tuberculoma, 3/1 female/male, age range: 50–57 years. All patients had visual disturbances and low levels of cortisol. Conclusion. The clinical diagnosis of sellar tuberculoma is a challenge and should be suspected when a sellar lesion shows abnormal enhancement pattern and stalk involvement, and absence of signal suppression in FLAIR.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

General physical examination was normal. She was alert, the visual acuity in the right eye was 20/200, in the left was limited to eye-counting fingers because of cataract, color vision 0/8 bilateral, optic nerve bilateral pallor, bilateral islands of nasal vision, and endocrine investigation disclosed low levels of cortisol. CT scan of the pituitary region showed an intrasellar heterogeneous mass with peripheral enhancement. Preoperative MRI was not available. Prior to surgery the diagnosis was pituitary adenoma versus inflammatory disease. The patient underwent pterional surgery of the pituitary region. Histology revealed central caseous necrosis with lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate, extensive fibrosis, and Langhans multinucleated giant cells with epithelioid cells. An MRI two months later showed persistence of intra- and suprasellar inflammatory lesion that reached the chiasm and involved the stalk . Diagnosis of sellar tuberculoma was made; the patient received isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, and steroids during eight months. Eighteen months later, MRI showed resolution of the lesion.\n\n【10】(a)\n\n【11】(b)\n\n【12】(c)\n\n【13】(d)\n\n【14】(e)\n\n【15】(f)\n\n【16】(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)   \n(f)\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| MRI T1-weighted (a), T2-weighted (b), and contrast enhanced T1-weighted (c) of a 67-year-old woman presenting with impaired vision and temporal visual field deficit two months before admission.

On admission she was alert, visual acuity in the left eye was 20/80, in the right eye it was 20/200, and she had palsy of right third and fourth nerves. Color vision, optic nerves, and visual fields were normal. Endocrine investigation disclosed low contents of cortisol in serum. MRI images revealed a sellar and suprasellar lesion displacing dorsally the chiasm, thickening of the infundibulum, and cavernous sinus extension, predominantly to the right side . The diagnosis was inflammatory lesion of hypofisis. A transsphenoidal biopsy was obtained. Histopathology reported pituitary parenchymal necrosis with blood vessels surrounded by multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes, and epithelioid cells; Ziehl Neelsen staining was positive and the culture was positive to Mycobacterium spp. The patient received isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin during one year.

At neurological exam he was confused and somnolent, with incoherent speech; blood examination showed hyponatremia. Visual acuity in the left eye it was 20/100, in the right eye was 20/200, left optic nerve was edematous, and there was palsy of right third nerve. Color vision and visual fields were normal. Endocrine investigation disclosed significant deficiency of the thyrotrophic and corticotropic hormones in serum. The MRI showed an intra- and suprasellar inflammatory lesion contacting bilaterally the gyrus rectus and the chiasm . The clinical diagnosis was sellar tumor, transsphenoidal biopsy was done, and histopathology revealed extensive fibrosis with lymphocytic infiltration in areas of trapped pituitary cells, vasculitis with blood vessel necrosis, and filiform Ziehl Neelsen positive structures. The patient received antituberculosis treatment in another institution for pulmonary tuberculosis.

Seven days before admission she had throbbing headache associated with fever and vomiting. On admission she was febrile and confused with right ptosis, mydriasis, left hemiparesis, and meningism. Visual acuity was not recorded and endocrinology profile was not done. MRI images  shows obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to multiple coalescent well defined nodules, the largest was localized in the sella and involve the chiasm and cavernous sinus; the lesions localized in basal cisterns and retro sellar region cause brain stem compression.

Results\n\n【48】Age range of patients was 50–67 years, mean: 58 years; male/female ratio was 1 : 3. The predominant clinical features were headache and impaired visual acuity; clinical results are summarized on Table 1.\n\n【49】According to the extension three types of lesion were seen.\n\n【50】Two patients presented sellar and suprasellar masses without obstructive hydrocephalus, both patients presented visual impairment: one with bilateral optic atrophy and the other with papilloedema. Systemic manifestations of tuberculosis were not found. One patient had retrosellar extension, brain stem compression, and hydrocephalus with raised pressure manifestations (right third nerve palsy and right upper motor neuron); he also had pachymeningitis with meningism. One patient presented severe headache and palsy of right third and fourth nerves and decreased visual acuity.\n\n【51】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【52】Tuberculoma is defined as a well-circumscribed mass composed of granulomatous chronic inflammatory tissue that may occur in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brain stem, or perimeningeal spaces 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. They account for 0.15% to 4% of intracranial space-occupying lesions with geographical variations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In India, sellar and suprasellar tuberculomas represent 1% of all intracranial tuberculomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. We found 27 cases of intracranial tuberculomas in the registers of the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery of Mexico since 1999 to 2009, the localization was sellar in four of them (14%) higher than reported in similar studies . The pathway for spreading mycobacterium tuberculosis to this region is unclear; either haematogenous spreading or contiguous extension from a local tuberculous infection of the paranasal sinuses has been proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. In some patients the primary focus cannot be demonstrated. From the cases reported here, one patient had antecedent of tuberculous meningitis and another had pulmonary infection. Headache is a common symptom; throbbing severe headache was present in 2 patients. All patients had visual disturbances as affection of visual fields, visual acuity, diplopia, mydriasis, or blurred vision, in contrast with other reports in which visual disturbances were present only in about 50% of cases. One patient had fever, meningism, and Weber syndrome at onset due to a mass effect on the brain stem; this syndrome had not been previously reported in cases of sellar tuberculoma.\n\n【53】Similar reports found anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies or central diabetes insipidus at onset, hypogonadism secondary to low levels of GH, FSH/LH, TSH, and ACTH deficiencies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. All our cases with endocrine system investigation () disclosed a decrease of cortisol levels; one patient had deficiency of the thyrotrophic hormone. Endocrinology profile was not made in one patient. A previous review revealed that 60% of patients had complete anterior panhypopituitarism and 28% had central diabetes insipidus as initial presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. Another frequent finding is raised prolactin levels due to pituitary stalk effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>.\n\n【54】Pituitary tuberculosis may present a diagnostic dilemma because it is difficult to differentiate inflammatory lesions from a pituitary adenoma. MRI is the chosen imaging modality to establish the differential diagnosis. Thickening and nodularity of the pituitary stalk are considered to be a sign of pituitary tuberculoma; however, this finding is nonspecific as it is also seen in other inflammatory conditions like sarcoidosis, syphilis, and idiopathic hypophysitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 42, 43\\]</u>. This finding was present only in one patient (Case  2) (Figure 2(b)). The classical imaging of brain tuberculomas is multiple coalescing contrast-enhancing lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. We also found this pattern only in one patient (Case  4). T1-weighted image usually are hypointense; nevertheless, they can also be hyperintense too due a high protein content 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Three of four cases were isointense on T1-weighted image. The literature described that the lesions may appear hyperintense on T2-weighted image or may have an hyperintense center surrounded by a hypointense rim with peripheral ring enhancement of the lesion and enhancement of the adjacent dura and basal cistern. Nonenhancement areas corresponded to tuberculoma caseation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. On T2-weighted images we observed a major hyperintense component in three cases (75%), similar to other reports; we found peripheral ring enhancement in three cases (75%), whereas in one case generalized slightly enhancement was seen. On T2-FLAIR images all lesions were hyperintense; this finding could be useful for the differential diagnosis with other inflammatory lesions.\n\n【55】The histopathological characteristic of tuberculosis is ill-defined caseating granulomas with giant cells. Other causes of granulomatous inflammation of the pituitary are lymphocytic hypophysitis, sarcoidosis, and Langherhan’s histiocytosis and caseating giant cell granulomata 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The diagnosis requires confirmation by acid fast Bacilli and chain polymerase reaction for detection of mycobacterial DNA; however, these studies are not routinely done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. In our cases the histological studies revealed chronic inflammatory lesions of granulomatous type in different phases, leading to different degrees of destruction and necrosis of the pituitary gland.\n\n【56】The presence of vasculitis is a serious consequence of tuberculous meningitis, which can result in infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. This finding was evident in one of our cases. Endocrinological study and Ziehl Neelsen staining together with imaging and histology can confirm the diagnosis. In one patient, the culture of brain biopsy sample on Lowenstein-Jensen medium was required to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【57】Antituberculous therapy is mandatory in sellar tuberculosis; most cases have appropriate response. One patient could not be followed. Three cases had resolution of pituitary tuberculoma in follow-up studies (12–24 months). There is no consensus regarding the type of antitubercular regimen and duration of the treatment in pituitary tuberculoma.\n\n【58】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【59】In the present study this entity was more frequent than previously reported, so it should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of sellar lesions. Clinically, it behaves like any sellar lesion with visual manifestations and endocrine alteration. Sellar tuberculoma should be suspected when a sellar lesion shows abnormal enhancement pattern and stalk involvement; peripheral enhancement and absence of signal suppression in FLAIR are clues to the imaging diagnosis. Long-term chemotherapy with antituberculous drugs usually results in a good outcome.\n\n【60】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【61】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interests to declare.</u>\n\n【62】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Authors’ Contribution</u>\n\n【63】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Dulce Bonifacio-Delgadillo M.D. was the guarantor of integrity of the entire study; Dulce Bonifacio-Delgadillo M.D. and Yolanda Aburto-Murrieta M.D. contributed to the study concepts and design; Dulce Bonifacio-Delgadillo M.D. and Yolanda Aburto-Murrieta M.D. contributed to the literature research; Dulce Bonifacio-Delgadillo M.D. Yolanda Aburto-Murrieta M.D. Citlaltepetl Salinas-Lara M.D. and Arturo Garcia-Marquez M.D. contributed to paper preparation; Julio Sotelo M.D. contributed by editing the paper; Ivonne Montes-Mojarro M.D. collected the data.

Abdominal ultrasound showed a retroperitoneal tumor in the suprarenal region of the right kidney. Computed tomography revealed an enhanced lobular tumor with irregular, circumscribed, and indistinct border. Ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed. The tumor consisted of spindle-shaped cells with a giant nucleus and multinuclear cells. The diagnosis was leiomyosarcoma by immunohistochemical staining. The patient underwent surgery accessed by a right eighth intercostal thoracoabdominal incision. The tumor was completely resected, accompanied by removal of the posterosuperior segment of the right hepatic lobe, right adrenal gland, and a portion of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The histopathologic diagnosis was leiomyosarcoma arising from the IVC. We present a rare case of a successfully managed leiomyosarcoma of the IVC. This case suggests the importance of curative surgical resection of the tumor due to low efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for leiomyosarcoma.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Vascular leiomyosarcomas are very rare. More than half of all vascular leiomyosarcomas originate from the inferior vena cava (IVC). Although the accuracy of preoperative diagnosis has improved due to advances in medical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasonography, determination of the origin of the primary lesion can sometimes be very difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Currently, the only treatment of leiomyosarcoma is surgical resection because the efficacy of adjuvant therapy has not been clearly demonstrated. The present case shows the difficulties in precise diagnosis of the primary lesion of a retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma and the importance of curative surgical resection of the tumor.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 76-year-old Japanese man undergoing hemodialysis for chronic renal failure was admitted to our hospital with chief complaint of right hypochondoralgia. On physical examination, slight right lower abdominal tenderness was detected. Laboratory findings were normal except for renal dysfunction due to chronic renal failure. Tumor markers (CEA, CA19-9, AFP, and PIVKA-II) were within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasound scan showed a retroperitoneal tumor in the suprarenal region of the right kidney. The tumor size was 40 mm. A CT scan revealed an enhanced lobular tumor with calcification in the region of the right adrenal gland (Figure 1(a)). The borders of the tumor along the liver and right adrenal gland were not clear, and the tumor was close to the IVC (Figure 1(b)). A通用删除4(英):<u> <sup>123</sup></u>I-MIBG scintigraphy scan was negative, so pheochromocytoma was contradicted. The laboratory data of cortisol, ACTH, adrenalin, noradrenalin, dopamine, and renin were normal, so a functional adrenal neoplasm was contradicted. Ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed that the tumor consisted of spindle-shaped cells with a giant nucleus and multinuclear cells . In immunohistostaining, the tumor showed a positive pattern of α\\-smooth muscle actin, desmin, and caldesmon. The tumor showed a negative pattern of c-kit and HMB-45; therefore, the tumor was diagnosed as a retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma.\n\n【6】(a)\n\n【7】(b)\n\n【8】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】(a) Computed tomography revealed an enhanced lobular tumor (white arrow) with calcification in the region of the right adrenal gland; (b) the border of the tumor at the liver and the right adrenal gland was not clear, and the tumor was close to the inferior vena cava (IVC) (white arrow).\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【12】The tumor consisted of spindle-shaped cells with a giant nucleus and multinuclear cells.\n\n【13】We performed surgical resection of the tumor using a right thoracoabdominal incision at the eighth intercostal space.

The tumor was resected completely, along with the posterosuperior segment of the right hepatic lobe, the right adrenal gland, and a portion of the IVC using partial clamping of the IVC (Figure 4(a)).

The size of the tumor was 50 × 45 × 40 mm. The resection margins were tumor-free, so R0 resection was performed. The tumor consisted of eosinophilic spindle-shaped cells and had coagulative necrosis and hyaline degeneration. The 3 mitoses were counted per 10 HPF, and the tumor was grade 2 in the FNCLCC grading system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In immunohistostaining, the tumor showed the same pattern as the biopsy material . Based on the immunohistochemical findings, together with the imaging studies, the final diagnosis was primary vascular leiomyosarcoma arising from the IVC .

Discussion\n\n【27】Primary leiomyosarcoma arising from the IVC is relatively rare, although more than half of all vascular leiomyosarcoma occurs from the IVC and vascular leiomyosarcoma represents 2% of all cases of leiomyosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These tumors are most frequently seen in females, with the mean age in the sixth decade. Abdominal pain is frequently the presenting symptom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【28】The incidence of leiomyosarcoma involving interrenal and retrohepatic IVC is higher than that involving infrarenal IVC and suprahepatic IVC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The en bloc resection rate is higher in leiomyosarcoma of the interrenal and retrohepatic IVC due to the anatomical structure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In the present case, the tumor was found via the complaint of abdominal pain, and the size of the tumor was relatively small (50 × 45 × 40 mm). The location of the tumor at the interrenal and retrohepatic IVC allowed the tumor to be completely resected en bloc. Because of technical improvements in hepatobiliary surgery, the en bloc resection rate has risen to over 80% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Primary IVC leiomyosarcoma is mostly found as a retroperitoneal tumor. The symptoms of primary IVC leiomyosarcoma are varied, and the rate of preoperative definitive diagnosis is less than 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In the present case, the leiomyosarcoma was diagnosed through the use of ultrasound-guided biopsy, but the primary lesion was uncertain because the tumor is widely presumed to originate from the smooth muscle wall of the IVC and the central adrenal vein and its branches. Metastatic tumors, malignant melanoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), and primary retroperitoneal sarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis, along with tumor in the region of the adrenal glands. Early diagnosis is important for treatment, and survival depends on tumor size, location, and complete surgical resection with free margins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【30】The efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for leiomyosarcoma is extremely low 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Additionally, postoperative therapy and management of recurrence are not established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In spite of leiomyosarcomas being slow-growing and having late metastasis, leiomyosarcomas carry a poor prognosis and a high incidence of local recurrence. The most important prognostic factor is the ability to surgically achieve a microscopically negative margin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The 5-year survival rate has been reported to be approximately 50% after complete en bloc resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Even after complete resection, the prognosis is poor and long-term observation is required. In the present case, surgical treatment yielded a 5-year survival; detection at an early stage and small size for radical resection may have contributed to this result.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We describe the case of a 28-year-old patient who presented with an ischemic stroke secondary to a stab wound to the neck that affected the vertebral artery. A physical examination revealed neurological deterioration (Glasgow 8/15), a sutured neck wound, no palpable hematoma, no thrills, and no active bleeding. A computed tomography angiography revealed a left vertebral artery arteriovenous fistula with a component of a pseudoaneurysm, for which a neurointerventional consultation was carried out. Due to neurological compromise, the airway was secured, and because the case involved a posterior fossa infarction with compression of the fourth ventricle and obstructive secondary hydrocephalus, an external ventricular shunt was inserted by neurosurgery. A fistula occlusion was performed with five Axium coils and a vial of Squid 12; the vertebral artery was catheterized, and a craniotomy was performed to manage hydrocephalus with a 12-mm H<sub>2</sub>O collecting system. The patient was discharged on the tenth day after admission with sequelae of left hemiparesis (predominantly brachial) and no other deficits. There was no hemorrhagic transformation on the control computed tomography scans and no further complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Vertebral artery injuries can be spontaneous or caused by trauma. Traumatic injuries are frequently caused by blunt head and neck injuries but can also be caused by penetrating trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Vertebral artery partial dissection is a common cause of stroke in young adults without predisposing risk factors for cerebrovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Initial signs of vertebral artery dissection are usually head and neck pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>; however, patients may be asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The vertebral arteries perfuse the posterior fossa, and dissection causes apoplexy symptoms consistent with a posterior circulation deficit. Difficulty speaking, swallowing, and maintaining balance may also be observed in addition to the loss of coordination and/or changes in vision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Most injuries to the vertebral arteries are due to blunt trauma from motor vehicle accidents, and cases related to sports, trampoline use, sexual intercourse, yoga, scuba diving, and chiropractic neck manipulation have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, a few cases have been reported in association with stab wounds and strokes. This report describes an ischemic stroke secondary to a stab wound to the neck in a young adult with no history of cerebrovascular disease.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 28-year-old male patient with a traumatic wound in zone II of the neck produced after being stabbed during a fight was initially taken to a lower-complexity hospital, where he was discharged because no serious tissue injuries were found. Computed tomography angiography was not performed in this hospital because this institution does not have this resource; however, initial stabilization was implemented, the wound was sutured, analgesics were prescribed, and a tetanus toxoid vaccine was administered. However, 2 days later, the patient consulted a higher-level hospital for episodes of hematemesis and syncope.\n\n【7】Upon hospital admission, he presented the following vital signs: blood pressure 130/78 mmHg, heart rate 100 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. A physical examination revealed neurological deterioration (Glasgow 8/15), a sutured neck wound, no palpable hematoma, no thrills, no active bleeding, and no other findings. An emergent simple skull computed tomography (CT) was performed, which indicated cerebellar stroke and obstructing hydrocephalus . An emergent head and neck angiotomography indicated a compromise of the vertebral artery with a pseudoaneurysm . An emergent panangiography was scheduled in consultation with a neurointerventional service. CT angiography revealed a compromise of the left vertebral artery with an appearance suggestive of a pseudoaneurysm, for which a neurointerventional consultation was carried out.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】Simple skull tomography.

A pseudoaneurysm of the left vertebral artery is observed at the level of C4 with an associated arteriovenous fistula and without signs of active bleeding. The pseudoaneurysm measures 8.5 mm anteroposterior diameter, 7.3 mm transverse diameter, and 8 mm craniocaudal diameter. Hyperdensity of adjacent venous structures is observed, and the venous phase is better visualized after configuring an arteriovenous fistula with a filiform filling of the distal vertebral artery.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【13】Panangiography depicting vertebral artery occlusion. The fistula is occluded with five Axium coils and a vial of Squid 12.\n\n【14】Due to neurological compromise, we decided to secure the airway, and because this case involved a posterior fossa infarction with compression of the fourth ventricle and secondary obstructive hydrocephalus, the insertion of an external ventricular shunt was performed by neurosurgery. Subsequently, neurointerventional fistula occlusion was performed with five coils and a vial of Squid 12; the vertebral artery was catheterized, and a craniotomy was performed by neurosurgery to manage hydrocephalus with a 12-mm H<sub>2</sub>O collecting system.\n\n【15】The patient was then transferred to the intensive care unit.

The report on this case was endorsed by the Bioethics Committee of the Hospital San Vicente Fundación.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】Traumatic vertebral artery injury is a relatively rare condition, reported in less than 1% of trauma admissions. However, a recent increase in incidence has been described, probably due to greater awareness and detection of this condition in high-risk patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 5\\]</u>. Although the literature reports cases of traumatic injury to the vertebral artery by knives 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–9\\]</u>, there are few cases involving ischemic stroke secondary to a stab wound to the neck that affects the vertebral artery. Similar to the present case, Park et al. described a case of cerebellar infarction produced by vertebral artery injury from a stab wound that separated the vessel between the transverse processes of C3 and C4 with a hypoplastic contralateral vertebral artery. The patient suffered an infarction of the cerebellum due to insufficient preservation of blood flow in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The neurologic consequences of vertebral artery injury are due to cerebral ischemia from thromboembolism, hypoperfusion, hemorrhage, or a combination of these. Generally, vertebral artery injury is caused by an intimal tear, generating platelet aggregation and thrombus formation that can cause local occlusion of the vessel. However, more often, the clot will embolize the cerebral circulation, causing a stroke 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【23】As observed in the present case, partial dissection of the vertebral artery can also cause a pseudoaneurysm, which can become a source of emboli or hemorrhage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 11\\]</u> Moreover, the risk of stroke is highest in the first 2 weeks after partial dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【24】CT angiography (CTA) is the most reliable noninvasive neurovascular imaging modality and is the initial test of choice for patients with suspected cerebral artery injury. However, digital subtraction arteriography (DSA) has been indicated as the gold standard, although it is more invasive, less available, and requires more contrast than angiography. Consequently, CTA has replaced DSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5, 7, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Symptomatic patients may be treated with anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy, depending on the risk of bleeding and the location and extent of the lesion. As in the present case, endovascular therapy and surgical repair are reserved for patients with high-grade injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7, 9, 11\\]</u>; it is also recommended for patients with contraindications to anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy who are at high risk of progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The prognosis for patients with a vertebral artery injury reflects a 24% stroke rate and an 8% mortality rate; between 5% and 25% of patients have poor neurological outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Poor outcomes are associated with older age, arterial occlusion, and increased stroke severity at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【27】#### Data Availability\n\n【28】The clinical data utilized in this report are described in this article.\n\n【29】#### Consent\n\n【30】The Bioethics Committee of the Hospital San Vicente Fundación approved the publication of this report.\n\n【31】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【32】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors acknowledge their employment relationship with the Hospital San Vicente Fundación and the Universidad de Antioquia.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The management and treatment of these cases can become challenging, since it also can present with atypical or even no symptoms in physical evaluation. A 14-year-old boy was referred to our hospital with a history of insertion of a paintbrush into his anus four weeks before the admission. The paintbrush had perforated the colon and was in the abdominopelvic cavity; however, no symptoms of peritonitis were observed. Rectal examination, sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy were unremarkable. Exploratory laparoscopy was performed, and the paintbrush was taken out completely. The patient was discharged in good condition. In cases with rectal foreign body insertion, perforation without causing peritonitis or acute abdomen is possible. In these conditions, imaging examinations play an essential role in managing the patients, and laparoscopy can be a proper procedure for retrieving the foreign body.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Management and treatment of rectal foreign body (FB) insertion are among challenging conditions due to the variety of objects with different shapes and, as a result, different trauma patterns to the rectum and colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the examination, our purpose is to obtain information about the FB’s size, shape, number, and location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Abdominal pain, rectorrhagia, incontinence, and constipation are the patients’ most common complaints 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Also, in cases with perforation, peritonitis should be diagnosed early 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>; however, perforation can be presented without any peritoneal symptoms in some patients. Unlike adults, rectal FB insertion in pediatrics is rare and infrequently reported. Herein, we intend to report a 14-year-old boy with a paintbrush inserted into his rectum without any noticeable symptoms in physical evaluation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Chief Complaint and Admission\n\n【6】A 14-year-old boy had been visited by a doctor due to the rectal insertion of a paintbrush, in which computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed and demonstrated a 90 × 6 mm shaped object in the abdominopelvic cavity. He was referred to our hospital for further evaluation.\n\n【7】##### 2.2. History Taking and Examinations\n\n【8】He reported a history of rectal insertion of a paintbrush four weeks ago, which resulted in rectorrhagia and pain during defecation since that time. The 4-week delay in seeking medical care was because of the patient’s mortification. In physical examination, no fever, abdominal tenderness, or rebound was observed. In his CT image, the paintbrush was in the abdominopelvic cavity, located in the middle part of the lower abdomen. Oblique orientation of the FB was seen with the left tip pointing to the left lower abdomen and the right tip to the posterior of the lower abdomen, just anterior to sigmoid bowel loops. The location of the FB was reported in the mesenteric area with adjacent fat stranding and not in the bowel loops . However, the rectal examination was unremarkable. We performed another CT scan for reassurance and reevaluation, which had the same result in comparison to the first image. He underwent rigid sigmoidoscopy under general anesthesia, with no findings in the last 25 cm of the rectum and sigmoid colon. Subsequently, a colonoscopy was performed, which did not show any abnormality. Eventually, exploratory laparoscopy was performed.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】Computed tomography imaging of a 14-year-old boy with evidence of a foreign body (paintbrush) in the pelvic cavity, anterior to sigmoid bowel loops (marked with blue outline).\n\n【11】##### 2.3. Surgical Procedure\n\n【12】The patient was taken to the operating room for general anesthesia and was placed in the supine position. Insufflation was done via the insertion of a Veress needle into the umbilicus. Then, a trocar was passed from the umbilicus for the laparoscope, and two laparoscopic graspers were passed from the abdominal wall, one in the right lower quadrant and the other in the left lower quadrant. The peritoneal cavity was explored, and the tip of the paintbrush was found. The paintbrush was covered with omentum, so dissection of the omentum was performed, and the paintbrush was taken entirely out by laparoscopic graspers . No other abnormal finding or intestinal damage was observed in the peritoneal cavity. Finally, the fascia and skin were closed layer by layer.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【14】Laparoscopy view demonstrating foreign body (paintbrush) in the omentum.\n\n【15】##### 2.4. Postoperation and Follow-Up\n\n【16】The patient received ceftriaxone (25 mg/kg/dose every 12 hours for two days) and metronidazole (10 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours for two days) postoperatively and was discharged in good condition three days after the surgery. The patient has been visited routinely at our clinic postoperatively, with no signs and symptoms presented. After three years from the operation, he is well without any complaints.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】The trend of rectal FB insertion is increasing based on studies from western countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The majority cause of rectal FB insertion is self-/partner-eroticism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Also, it should be noted that criminal assault and psychiatric disorders are two other main reasons for FB insertion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In many rectal FB patients, seeking the medical center may be delayed because of the patients’ embarrassment, as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Rectal FB insertion in pediatrics is not as common as that in adults, and fewer studies have been published in this manner. In the present study, we reported a 14-year-old boy with rectal FB insertion retrieved with laparoscopy.\n\n【19】There were two points in our case, which were interesting to be mentioned: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the paintbrush had perforated the colon; however, the site of perforation healed, and there was no evidence of any injury in sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> Although the paintbrush entered into the peritoneal cavity, there were no symptoms of acute abdomen or peritonitis.\n\n【20】Few studies of pediatric rectal FB insertion are reported in the literature. Table 1 demonstrates some of these case reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–10\\]</u>. Besides, a study by Fischer et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> reported 27,755 cases, aged 0 to 25 years, with FB injury involving the rectum, vagina, and penis, based on the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System of the United States. The study was performed between 2008 and 2017. In the mentioned study, 51.93% of the cases were from 0 to 18 years that 46.90% of them had rectal involvement. Also, the annual trend of rectal FBs was increasing.\n\n【21】Table 1 \n\n【22】Review of literature regarding rectal foreign bodies in pediatrics.\n\n【23】A detailed history and physical examination are crucial in the first step 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Physical examination is essential to assess the possibility of peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the presence of peritonitis, a perforation is possible, which requires an urgent laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Rectal examination should be performed as a part of the physical examination to palpate the FB and determine the competency of the anal sphincter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Due to the possibility of inserting a hazardous object (e.g. shattered glass), a detailed history of the item inserted is essential for rectal examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Some studies suggest the rectal examination to be performed after radiographical evaluation to prevent physicians’ injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Lack of specific symptoms makes the diagnosis and treatment approach more challenging, especially when the patients do not report a detailed history.\n\n【24】Imaging is essential for retained FBs. Although radiography is suggested to be the first diagnostic approach, CT imaging can give more information, especially in the presence of peritoneal symptoms or in higher FBs. Typically, colorectal FBs with perforation can be diagnosed with wall disruption of the bowel and the FB position in the image; however, free gas is not commonly seen. Besides, colovesical fistula or inflammatory mass can be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【25】There are various therapeutic approaches, including transanal extraction, endoscopic technique, and surgical procedure, for retained FBs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. FB should be retrieved with the least possible invasive procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Transanal extraction, which is performed with local anesthesia, is successful in 60% to 75% of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. If transanal extraction was unsuccessful, an endoscopic approach via rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopy is convenient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The next option is surgery, which can be less invasive with laparoscopy, as in our case, or laparotomy, as the last option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Also, as mentioned, peritonitis shows the possibility of perforation and should be managed with an urgent laparotomy.\n\n【26】There are few reports regarding the management of pediatric rectal FBs in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. We propose our simplified management algorithm for rectal FBs . Based on our algorithm, FBs in the gastrointestinal tract cannot be accessed from the abdomen, so transanal extraction/sigmoidoscopy is preferred. However, FBs located in the abdominopelvic cavity are more complicated. According to our approach, when the patient does not present with symptoms of the acute abdomen but has some other symptoms, such as localized tenderness, laparoscopy or laparotomy is suggested after resuscitation. However, in the presence of the symptoms of peritonitis, laparotomy is our choice. In an asymptomatic clinical situation, both laparoscopy and laparotomy can be done. It is worth mentioning that our report addresses FBs that the child has acknowledged the entry of an object into the anus and are so large that they cannot be managed by observation and follow-up, and incidental findings are not included in our report. In our case, we performed laparoscopy because of three reasons: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the FB was in the abdominopelvic cavity, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the site of perforation healed with no evidence of any injury in the sigmoidoscopy, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the advantages of laparoscopic surgery over open surgery. In an alternative situation, if partial part of the FB had been seen in the sigmoidoscopy, or the rectum wall had not healed, laparotomy would have been our choice.\n\n【27】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【28】A simplified management algorithm for rectal foreign bodies; FB, foreign body.\n\n【29】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【30】In conclusion, our case demonstrated that perforation of the colon and retained FB in the peritoneal cavity may present without acute abdomen or peritoneal symptoms. In these cases, imaging, especially CT scan, can play an essential role in diagnosis and appropriate approach; also, it can be useful for ruling out other conditions. Laparoscopy can be a proper approach in such cases. We suggest a thorough examination before performing any invasive procedure.\n\n【31】#### Data Availability\n\n【32】Data of the patient can be requested from the authors.

We present two cases (a 48-year-old woman and a 57-year-old man) with indolent systemic mastocytosis in whom omalizumab (anti-IgE) reduced gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms significantly. This observation provides additional insight into the effects of omalizumab on systemic mastocytosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Mastocytosis refers to a group of myeloproliferative disorders characterized by excessive proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in tissues. Whereas cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is limited to the skin, systemic mastocytosis (SM) describes forms of mastocytosis in extracutaneous organs, with or without skin involvement. The majority of SM patients present with a point mutation in the KIT gene at the 816 position. Systemic mastocytosis comprises clinical variants ranging from indolent systemic mastocytosis to mast cell leukaemia and is commonly associated with anaphylaxis and symptoms including palpitations, flushing, cutaneous itch, nausea, and diarrhoea. The WHO diagnostic major criterion for SM includes multifocal, dense aggregates of mast cells (15 or more) detected in sections of bone marrow and confirmed by tryptase immunohistochemistry or other special stains, whereas minor criteria are as follows: (a) in biopsy section, more than 25% of the mast cells in the infiltrate have atypical morphology, or, of all the mast cells in the aspirate smear, more than 25% are immature or atypical; (b) mast cells coexpress CD117 with CD2 and/or CD25; (c) detection of KIT point mutation at codon 816 in bone marrow, blood, or other extracutaneous organs; (d) serum total tryptase persistently >20 ng/mL (not a valid criterion in cases of systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal hematologic non-mast-cell lineage disease). A diagnosis of SM may be rendered if one major plus one minor criterion or three minor criteria are fulfilled 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of mastocytosis is not well defined and thus treatment remains challenging and on a palliative basis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Omalizumab is a humanized murine monoclonal antibody that conjugates free serum IgE and reduces binding to the high-affinity IgE receptor (FCεRI) on mast cells and basophils, thereby stabilizing and reducing the potential reactivity of these cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Omalizumab has been used successfully in and is approved for the treatment of disorders in which mast cells are pathogenetically involved such as allergic asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> and chronic urticaria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Therefore, therapy with this antibody in mastocytosis seems worth considering. We present two cases of indolent SM which showed good response to omalizumab treatment.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】The first patient was a 48-year-old woman with CM for the last 15 years and with diagnosed SM for one year but with diffuse systemic symptoms for the last five years. She also had psoriasis and was formerly diagnosed with cutaneous malignant melanoma and dysplasia of the cervix. SM was verified by one major criterion and three minor WHO criteria: presence of multifocal, dense aggregates of mast cells in bone marrow confirmed by tryptase immunohistochemistry (major criterion) and expression of CD2, CD25, and CD117 in bone marrow, persistently elevated serum tryptase (up to 86 µg/L), and KIT D816B mutation in duodenal and bone marrow biopsies (minor criteria). The patient experienced severe cutaneous itch with widespread rash typical of CM, diarrhoea, palpitations, episodes of musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue daily or almost daily. She was previously treated with oral nonsedating H1-antihistamines at high dose (fexofenadine 180 mg up to four times daily) for six months with reduced occurrence of skin symptoms but not of gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal symptoms. Injections with omalizumab (300 mg s.c. once every four weeks) were initiated, and, within a few months, she experienced resolution of gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms, whereas musculoskeletal pain remained. She was followed up for eleven months and continued having a good response of omalizumab. She experienced no side effects of the treatment.\n\n【7】The second patient was a 57-year-old man with CM for the last 30 years and with diagnosed SM for three years. He was otherwise healthy but was on permanent disability pension due to symptoms of mastocytosis. SM was verified by one major criterion and two minor WHO criteria: presence of multifocal, dense aggregates of mast cells in bone marrow confirmed by tryptase immunohistochemistry and with expression of CD117 but not CD2 (major criterion) and persistently elevated serum tryptase (>200 µg/L) and KIT D816B mutation (minor criteria). The patient experienced diarrhoea (loose stools up to five times daily) and severe daily cutaneous itch and widespread cutaneous mastocytosis. He was treated unsuccessfully with PUVA (three times per week) plus high dose of nonsedating H1-antihistamines (ceterizine/levocetirizine 5–10 mg up to three times daily) for two months and, hereafter, with UVA-1 (three times per week) plus high dose of nonsedating H1-antihistamines (ceterizine/levocetirizine 5–10 mg up to three times daily) and montelukast for one year and four months. He was subsequently switched to a strong topical corticosteroid (used two times per day) for one month with no effect. Finally, omalizumab treatment (300 mg s.c. once every four weeks) was initiated but paused for six months after only one injection, as he was unable to attend scheduled ambulatory visits due to a motor vehicle accident and a fractured leg. Treatment with omalizumab was resumed and, after three months, he experienced marked reduction in cutaneous itching as well as resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms. He was followed up for 15 months on omalizumab and continued having a good response with no side effects of the treatment.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the surface of mast cells and basophils by forming complexes with free IgE in serum. This results in downregulation of FCεRI expression on mast cells and basophils and reduction of mast cell and basophil activation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The mechanisms whereby omalizumab decreases symptoms in patients with mastocytosis are not well known. Also, little is known about the pathogenesis of symptoms in mastocytosis patients. Yet, it is plausible that the reduction in mast cell activity caused by omalizumab may reduce these symptoms caused by an excessive number of mast cells.\n\n【10】There are several case reports suggesting that omalizumab may decrease symptoms of mastocytosis, both in its systemic and cutaneous form. To our knowledge, six previous studies with a total of seven patients have reported successful treatment of SM with omalizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–12\\]</u>. These studies of SM all reported less anaphylactic episodes, with the exception of one patient in whom fewer gastrointestinal symptoms were reported. Another three studies totalling three patients have reported successful treatment of CM with omalizumab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. These reports all found reduction in skin symptoms . In line with our patients, previous studies reported very few side effects of omalizumab, the only exception being Jandus et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> who describe a patient with SM and Hymenoptera venom allergy who was administered omalizumab as add-on therapy to improve venom immunotherapy tolerability and who—during omalizumab treatment—developed sleep disturbances.\n\n【11】Table 1 \n\n【12】Studies of mastocytosis treated with omalizumab.\n\n【13】We did not taper the omalizumab dose or change the dosing intervals during treatment nor did we monitor IgE or other serological markers among our patients. It is possible that symptom resolution in SM can be obtained with lower doses of omalizumab (e.g. 150 mg) and longer dosing intervals (e.g. every four to eight weeks). Also, it is possible that our patients would have benefitted symptomatically from treatment with oral cromolyn. However, we did not use this drug.\n\n【14】Our report of reduced gastrointestinal and cutaneous symptoms in two patients with SM treated with omalizumab expands on previous findings providing additional insight into the effects of omalizumab for SM.\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Little is known about the effects of volume change by hemodialysis (HD) and mechanical stress caused by an anatomical structure being in contact with the left atrium on the progression of atrial remodeling. We experienced a case of atrial tachycardia (AT) in a patient who had left atrial (LA) scarring at the LA roof and a low-voltage area with slow conduction around the LA scar as components of AT circuit. Here, we present the conceivable hypothesis of the LA scar and the low-voltage area formation. Our concept can be useful in developing a strategy for ablation in a patient with chronic renal failure (CRF) on HD. Case Report. A 65-year-old man with CRF on HD was referred for AT ablation. Three-dimensional electroanatomical mapping revealed that the AT conducted around an LA scar in a counterclockwise fashion. There was a slow conduction area at the superior side of the LA scar, where the AT was terminated during the ablation. Computed tomography indicated a close relationship between the LA and the anatomical structures (ascending aorta and pulmonary artery). Conclusion. Volume change by HD and close contact of anatomical structures to the LA can promote atrial remodeling, resulting in AT occurrence.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】It is well known that diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic renal failure (CRF) promote the remodeling of atrial muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In contrast, there are limited data on how mechanical stress due to hemodialysis (HD) influences atrial remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We experienced a case of atrial tachycardia (AT) circulating around a left atrial (LA) roof scar in a DM and CRF patient on HD. Echocardiography showed a remarkable change in LA diameter before and after HD. Three-dimensional (3D) electroanatomical mapping merged with computed tomography revealed that the LA scar was close to the pulmonary artery (PA), and the low-voltage area was close to the ascending aorta (AS-Ao). In the current case report, we present a hypothesis that short-term volume change by HD and mechanical stress by PA and AS-Ao can induce atrial remodeling, resulting in the formation of an AT circuit.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 65-year-old man was referred to our hospital for ablation of the AT. He had been treated for end-stage renal disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate: 9 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>; serum sodium level: 139 mEq/L; serum potassium level: 3.6 mEq/L) due to DM and was receiving HD treatment. He felt palpitations and was diagnosed as having AT with a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Pilsicainide and amiodarone were prescribed; however neither medication could suppress the AT. Ablation was therefore considered. The patient’s blood pressure (BP) was within normal range and his DM was well controlled (BP 110/70 mmHg and HbA1c 6.1%). Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular (LV) systolic function (ejection fraction: 56.5%) without LV dilatation (LV end-diastolic diameter: 52 mm). The LA was dilated (50 mm) prior to HD. The ECG recorded on admission showed AT with 290 ms PP intervals. P wave morphology was bimodal, positive, and wide in leads I, II, III, and and positive/negative in lead V1 (Figure 1(a)). The sinus rhythm ECG showed a different P wave morphology; lead I was flat, leads II, III, and were positive, and lead V1 was positive/negative (Figure 1(a)). An electrophysiological study was performed with a twenty-polar electrode catheter (Halo catheter) positioned along the tricuspid annulus (TA) and two octapolar electrode catheters positioned in the coronary sinus (CS) and at the bundle of His. The earliest local activity was recorded at the CS ostium at this time (Figure 1(b)). The total interval of atrial activity including TA, CS, and His electrodes did not fulfill the clinical AT cycle length (CL). We therefore advanced a mapping catheter into the distal CS, where a fragmented long duration potential was observed. After a transseptal puncture, 3D electroanatomical mapping of the LA was constructed using the CARTO system. In the LA voltage map, there was a scar area at the LA anterior roof. Around the scar, there were low-voltage areas with fragmentation at the roof and right anterior wall of the LA (Figure 2(a)). The activation map fulfilled almost the entire duration of the AT CL. This result indicated that the AT circulated around the scar in a counterclockwise fashion (Figure 2(b)). Entrainment pacing was performed at the LA roof (black circle in Figure 2(a)), where a fragmented potential was recorded (Figure 2(c)). The postpacing interval was in accordance with the AT CL (Figure 3(a)). Therefore, linear ablation was performed between the roof scar and the ostium of the right upper pulmonary vein (Figure 2(a)), during which the AT was finally terminated (Figure 3(b)). After completion of the ablation line, the AT could not be induced. Six months after ablation, no AT recurrence was observed.\n\n【6】(a)\n\n【7】(b)\n\n【8】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】(a) The left panel shows a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in sinus rhythm (SR) and the right panel shows that of atrial tachycardia (AT).

Discussion\n\n【23】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of AT conducted around the scar at the LA anterior roof in a patient with DM on HD. There are two interesting points of observation; the first is the relationship between the P wave morphology of the AT and the conducting manner to the RA and LA. The second noteworthy observation is the anticipated mechanism of the scar and low-voltage area formation in the LA in a CRF patient on HD who had no structural heart disease or no history of AF.\n\n【24】The P wave morphology of the AT in the present case was positive and bimodal in leads I, II, III, and and positive/negative in lead V1. As shown in Figure 2(b), there were slow conduction areas in the right and the superior sides of the LA scar. The wavefront went down to the right side of the scar and turned left below the scar through the slow conduction area. This propagation manner constituted the first positive component of the P wave in leads I, II, III, and . Interestingly, the AT wavefront propagated from the LA to the RA through the mid to inferior part of the septum only (Figure 4(a)), probably because of the Bachman bundle conduction disorder, which was generated by the existence of the anterior roof scar in the LA. The scar might have caused severe damage to the conductivity of the Bachman bundle. Hence, the wavefront, which propagated to the RA, went up the septum of the RA and turned around the TA in a counterclockwise manner, as shown in Figure 3(a). This is composed of the second positive component in leads I, II, III, and with a short duration of 50 msec. The duration of the P wave was about 190 msec and the residual duration of the AT CL was given by the slow conduction area located at the superior side of the LA scar (Figure 2(c)). The positive/negative P wave in lead V1 was explained by the spreading manner of the AT, which propagated from the mid to inferior septum of the LA to RA. This propagation style was similar to that of the AT originating from the aortic sinus of Valsalva. Wang et al. reported that the P wave morphology of AT originating from the noncoronary cusp and left coronary cusp is positive/negative 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【25】(a)\n\n【26】(b)\n\n【27】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【29】(a) The propagation map of AT with the LA, right atrium (RA), and CS. Arabic numbers indicate the time course of AT. The wavefront conducts around the LA scar with no excitation of the RA (images 1–3). The mid to inferior part of the RA began to activate (image 4). The RA wavefront went up to the RA septum and turned around the TA in a counterclockwise manner (images 5 and 6). The orange arrowhead indicates the AT wavefront. (b) The anatomical relationship between the LA low-voltage area and the ascending aorta, as well as between the LA scar and the pulmonary artery presented with the 3D electroanatomical map of the LA merged with computed tomography. As indicated by the red line, the LA scar was represented by grey area and the low-voltage areas were represented by red, yellow, and green areas.\n\n【30】Although it is well known that HD strongly promotes exacerbation of atherosclerosis, to the best of our knowledge, it is still unclear how LA remodeling progresses in patients with CRF on HD. Hori et al. reported that the contact areas, where the LA wall is anatomically in contact with the vertebrae, AS-Ao, or descending aorta (DS-Ao), are strongly associated with low-voltage areas and fractionated potentials 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Anatomical structures, such as the sinus of Valsalva, AS-Ao, DS-Ao, and the vertebrae, might put direct pressure on the LA and possibly extend the low-voltage area and the fragmentation potential formation, resulting in LA remodeling. In the present case, as shown in Figure 2(a), there was a scar area on the anterior superior of the LA. Low-voltage areas were found around the scar, specifically at the superior side (LA roof) and the right side of the scar (close to the RSPV). Notably, the scar region was located where a PA located in front of the scar with a short relative distance (Figure 4(b)). In addition, the low-voltage areas were very close to the sinus of Valsalva and the AS-Ao. Tekce et al. reported that even a single session of dialysis changed the LA diameter from  mm (before HD) to  mm (after HD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This result means that the stretching of the atrial myocytes occurred each time HD was performed, and the stretch itself has been proven to promote the LA remodeling. In the present case, the LA diameter measured by echocardiography also changed from 50.0 mm before HD to 45.7 mm after HD. Moreover, a dilated LA before HD might be considered to be closer to the PA and AS-Ao than that after HD. These areas of the LA were not only stretched by inner pressure before HD, but also compressed by anatomical structures (PA and AS-Ao). Such stretching and compression forces might injure the atrial myocytes and consequently induce a low-voltage area or scar formation in the LA.\n\n【31】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【32】LA volume changes caused by HD can create stretching forces in the atrium. The anatomical structure around the LA can provide the atrial myocytes with the compression force. Such mechanical stress might promote the LA remodeling, resulting in scarring or a low-voltage area, as well as a slow conduction area, formation in the absence of AF. This concept could help us develop a strategy for catheter ablation in CRF patients on HD in a more effective manner.\n\n【33】#### Competing Interests\n\n【34】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\n【35】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【36】Naoko Hijioka and Masashi Kamioka contributed equally to this work.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Pharmacologic data support a potential interactions between these drugs because PDE5 inhibitors and statins are metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450. In this family of enzymes, CYP3A is the dominant CYP in terms of both expression levels in the liver and the number of drugs metabolized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Both simvastatin and tadalafil metabolism involve principally CYP3A. The metabolism of simvastatin in human liver microsomes is catalysed primarily ( 80%) by CYP3A4/5, with a minor contribution ( 20%) from CYP2C8. Tadalafil during its metabolism is converted to a metabolite that binds irreversibly to the enzyme active site, permanently inactivating the enzyme. The inactivated enzyme must be replaced by newly synthesized CYP to regain activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Today in addition to the classical proerectile-effect, several studies have demonstrated that PDE5 can also influence vascular endothelium; given that the combinated therapy statins plus PDE5 could be very useful in patient with high cardiovascular risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 48-year-old man with a history of dyslipidemia and erectile dysfunction was admitted to our department due to a manifestation of progressive myalgia after comsumption of tadalafil. He had been taking simvastatin at doses of 20 mg/die for almost 8 days and recently he was prescribed tadalafil. Approximately 3 hours after the patient began tadalafil, he developed unexplained, severe muscle aches (particularly in the lower extremities). Gradually, these symptoms worsened with severe pain in the 3/5 of surface area over upper extremities and 2/5 of surface area over lower extremities, weakness in the pelvic and shoulder girdle regions. The penile erection was maintained for five days. According to his clinical history we stopped tadalafil and simvastatin therapy and we noted a significant improvement in muscular symptoms after 5 days. Further questioning revealed no symptoms of viral illness, or other identifiable causes of myalgias. He denied unusual or abnormal physical activity, trauma, burns, recent intramuscular injections or symptoms of coronary artery disease. His temperature was 37°C, pulse rate 87 b/min and blood pressure 125/75 mmHg. Laboratoristic analysis are reported in the Table 1. No substantial changes in the ECG were noted. Myopathy, probably drug induced, was diagnosed because there was no evidence of recent trauma or other potential causes of muscle damage. An intravenous fluid supplement was prescribed, but the weakness decreased slightly after he was discharged.\n\n【6】Table 1 \n\n【7】Serum values of some parameters during 5 days.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Approximately 95% of statin-treated patients tolerate this treatment without any adverse effects. Tadalafil (Cialis) is a potent reversible phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Physiologically, in response to sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released into the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum of the penis, resulting in elevation of cGMP levels and relaxation of the smooth muscle to produce an erection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Patients who are treated for erectile dysfunction are likely to take additional medications for preexisting conditions such as cardiovascular disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Statins and tadalafil are both metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system (particularly CYP3A4). In this family of enzymes, CYP3A is the dominant CYP in terms of both expression levels in the liver and the number of drugs metabolized. As a result of the broad substrate specificity exhibited by CYP3A and the polypharmacy often used by patients, alterations in CYP3A activity by induction or inhibition can result in metabolically based drug-drug interactions. In vitro studies were performed examining the ability of tadalafil to alter metabolism mediated by CYP3A in cultures of human hepatocytes or reversibly inhibit metabolism mediated by CYP3A in human liver microsomes. In addition, tadalafil was examined for its ability to cause mechanism-based inhibition of CYP3A-mediated reactions in human liver microsomes. Mechanism-based inhibition occurs when the drug is converted to a metabolite that binds irreversibly to the enzyme active site, permanently inactivating the enzyme. The inactivated enzyme must be replaced by newly synthesized CYP to regain activity; thus recovery is slowed after mechanism-based inactivation as compared with reversible inhibition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Other in vitro studies evaluated the effect of tadalafil on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A such as lovastatin. This study remarks that side effects such as myopathy could be even higher if a statin is used concomitantly with one of the most potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as tadalafil. So their concomitant use should be avoided. Though the meaning of this case is yet not clear, we speculate that this fatigue may be due to a low-grade muscle damage induced by tadalafil. Muscle toxicity is a potential adverse effect not only for statins, but also with 5PD . So a combination of tadalafil and statins may enhance the effect and induce muscle toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. In the patients treated with statins, tadalafil should not be the PDE5 inhibitors of first choice, because of its long half-life in order to avoid potentially life-threatening adverse effects.\n\n【10】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【11】Statins are used to reduce blood cholesterol and have been shown in multiple studies to reduce the risk of heart attacks, heart attack deaths, and strokes. The benefits of treating blood cholesterol with statins have been demonstrated in a wide variety of patient groups, including healthy patients. The major medical problem with statins is that they can produce muscle aching, weakness, and cramps in some patients. The incidence of myopathy could be even higher if simvastatin is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors such as 5PDi. Moreover muscle toxicity is a potential adverse effect not only for statins, but also with 5PDi so their concomitant use should be carefully monitored. Specially in the patients treated with statins, tadalafil should not be the PDE5 inhibitors of first choice, because of its long half-life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. At the same time the best statin to use might be rosuvastatin because it is not extensively metabolized by isoenzymes of the CYP system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Kounis syndrome is the concurrence of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) caused by coronary vasospasms, acute myocardial infarctions, or stent thromboses in case of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions. Kounis syndrome is mediated by mast cells that interact with macrophages and T-lymphocytes, causing degranulation and inflammation with cytokine release. It is a life-threatening condition that has many trigger factors and is most commonly caused by medicines. Case Presentation. A 71-year-old male was admitted with a fever of five days’ duration associated with cellulitis, for which he had been treated with clindamycin and flucloxacillin before admission. He was a diagnosed patient with hypertension and dyslipidemia five years ago. After taking the antibiotics, he had developed generalized itching followed by urticaria suggesting an allergic reaction. Therefore, he was admitted to the hospital. After admission, he developed an ischaemic-type chest pain associated with autonomic symptoms and shortness of breath. An immediate ECG was taken that showed ST-segment depressions in the chest leads V4–V6, confirmed by a repeat ECG. Troponin I was 8 ng/mL. Acute management of ACS was started, and prednisolone 10 mg daily dose was given. After complete recovery, the patient was discharged with aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, losartan, isosorbide mononitrate, and nicorandil. Prednisolone 10 mg daily dose was given for five days after discharge. Conclusion. In immediate hypersensitivity, with persistent cardiovascular instability, Kounis syndrome should be considered, and an electrocardiogram and other appropriate assessments and treatments should be initiated. Prompt management of the allergic reaction and the ACS is vital for a better outcome of Kounis syndrome.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cardiovascular manifestations associated with allergy, hypersensitivity, and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions began to emerge seven decades ago in the medical literature. However, the clinical condition of allergic angina syndrome, which progresses to allergic acute myocardial infarction, was not described until 1991 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Allergic angina syndrome and allergic myocardial infarction are ubiquitous diseases that affect patients of any age. They cover a broad spectrum of mast cell-activation disorders that are referred to as Kounis syndrome. The definition of this syndrome is the concurrence of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the setting of allergic or hypersensitivity and anaphylactic or anaphylactoid insults. These cases of ACS may occur due to coronary spasms, acute myocardial infarctions, or stent thromboses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The primary inflammatory cells involved in the development of Kounis syndrome are mast cells that interact with macrophages and T-lymphocytes. It causes mast cell degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, neutral proteases chymase, tryptase, heparin, and cathepsin-D, with increased production of leukotrienes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Medicines represent the most common trigger for Kounis syndrome in clinical practice. The most commonly reported medicines include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. ibuprofen), antibiotics such as amoxicillin/clavulanate, and anticancer drugs (e.g. fluorouracil) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Kounis syndrome is a complex situation involving two severe circumstances, an acute allergic reaction and an acute coronary event. Thus, the prognosis of Kounis syndrome is relatively poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Therefore, the management should address both prior given concerns that envisage the complexity of the management. Herein, we report a case of Kounis syndrome possibly triggered by antibiotics administered due to cellulitis of the right lower limb.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 71-year-old male was admitted with a fever of five days’ duration and a reddish swollen right lower limb that had occurred following a wound caused by a leech bite. He had initially consulted a general practitioner before admission who had diagnosed cellulitis, and the patient had been prescribed clindamycin and flucloxacillin on day 2 of the fever. After taking the antibiotics, he had developed generalized itching followed by urticaria. However, there had not been any shortness of breath. Then, antibiotics had been changed on day 4 of fever by the general practitioner due to the possibility of an allergic reaction. Then, he was given cephalexin. However, the allergic symptoms were persisting, and the wound condition had not been improved. Therefore, he was admitted to the local hospital on day 5 of fever. After being admitted to the hospital, he developed ischaemic-type chest pain associated with autonomic symptoms and shortness of breath. The pain was slightly reduced by a glyceryl trinitrate sublingual tablet given. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was taken immediately, showing ST-segment depressions in the chest leads, V4–V6 . A repeat ECG confirmed similar findings .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】Electrocardiogram taken immediately after admission, showing ST-segment depression in the chest leads, V4–V6.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【10】Repeat electrocardiogram taken after admission, showing ST-segment depression in the chest leads, V4–V6.\n\n【11】The acute management of ACS was carried out at the local hospital, and the patient was transferred to a tertiary-care center for further management. At the tertiary-care center, the antiplatelets and statins were continued. Enoxaparin 60 mg, six doses, and prednisolone 10 mg daily dose were given. ECGs  taken at the tertiary-care center showed normal findings. Troponin I level was initially 8 ng/mL and then reduced to 0.28 ng/mL four days after the onset of chest pain.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【13】Electrocardiogram taken at the tertiary-care center after treatment showing normal findings.\n\n【14】He was a patient diagnosed with hypertension and dyslipidemia for five years without any hypertensive complications. He had also taken treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease for seven years. Nevertheless, he did not have any previous history of diabetes mellitus, transient ischaemic attacks, or cerebrovascular accidents. He had a significant history of allergies to tetracycline, amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, clindamycin, and mushrooms. He did not have any family history of ischaemic heart disease. He was a heavy smoker who had consumed 40 pack-years of cigarettes and was an alcoholic who had taken four to five bottles of toddy per day for thirty years which amounted to 15 units per day; however, he claimed abstinence for five years.\n\n【15】After full recovery, he was discharged with aspirin, clopidogrel, atorvastatin, metoprolol, losartan, isosorbide mononitrate, and nicorandil. Prednisolone 10 mg daily dose was prescribed for five days.\n\n【16】He was next followed up at the cardiac rehabilitation clinic. Six months after the initial presentation, he presented again with stable angina, and the exercise ECG showed stage II inferolateral ischemia. A 2D echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 59% with normal left ventricular systolic dysfunction. We calculated his TIMI score, which was 6 out of 7. Although a coronary angiogram was planned, the patient defaulted follow-up.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Kounis syndrome was defined in 1991 as “the coincidental occurrence of chest pain and allergic reactions accompanied by clinical and laboratory findings of classic angina pectoris caused by inflammatory mediators released during the allergic insult” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It comprises the whole clinical spectrum of acute myocardial ischemia, from stable angina to acute myocardial infarction, which coincides with “allergic” (hypersensitivity, anaphylactic, or anaphylactoid) reaction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Three variants of Kounis syndrome have been described. The type I variant includes normal or nearly normal coronary arteries without risk factors for coronary artery disease. The type II variant includes the culprit but quiescent preexisting atheromatous disease. The type III variant includes coronary artery stent thrombosis in which aspirated thrombus specimens are stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa that demonstrate the presence of eosinophils and mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Type III variant has two subtypes; subtype a includes patients with coronary stent thrombosis, and subtype b includes patients with stent restenosis due to allergic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Recently, a new variant IV of Kounis syndrome has been proposed, not scientifically established yet 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Involvement of the cardiovascular system in anaphylaxis occurs in two-thirds of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Nevertheless, the incidence of Kounis syndrome during acute allergic reactions has not been precisely established 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In a prospective study performed at an emergency department, 27 out of 793 patients consulting for allergic reactions were diagnosed with Kounis syndrome, rendering an incidence of 3.4% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Myocardial injury detected by elevation of troponin I was diagnosed in 22 cases (7.3%) in another retrospective study reviewing 300 cases of anaphylaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Although anaphylactic reactions associated with cardiovascular alterations are frequent and transient, in some cases, they may result in extensive and life-threatening myocardial damage. In such incidence, many mast cells have been found in the tunica media and the adventitia of large coronary vessels and small intramural coronary arteries. During anaphylaxis, coronary hypoperfusion caused by systemic vasodilation, plasma leakage, volume loss due to increased vascular permeability, and reduced venous return can contribute to cardiac output suppression, leading to further myocardial damage and ventricular dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The primary inflammatory cells involved in the development of Kounis syndrome are mast cells that interact with macrophages and T-lymphocytes via multidirectional stimuli. During allergy, hypersensitivity, and anaphylaxis, mast cell degranulation occurs, and various stored and newly formed inflammatory mediators are released locally and to the systemic circulation. These inflammatory mediators include biogenic amines such as histamine, chemokines, enzymes such as the neutral proteases chymase and tryptase, cathepsin-D, peptides, proteoglycans, cytokines, growth factors, and arachidonic acid products such as leukotrienes, thromboxane, prostacyclin, PAF, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is shown that mast cells in human coronary atheromas contain TNF-α 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Mast cells can be typically activated via several pathways, which may contribute to Kounis syndrome. One is through allergen cross linking with allergen-specific IgE bound to high-affinity Fc epsilon receptor. Non-IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation can also occur via the anaphylatoxins, including complement C1q, C3a C4, C5a, and Factor B. This complement pathway activation involves IL-5 and tryptase, more commonly recognized in patients who develop renal failure or fatal cerebral events. Mast cells can also be activated via low-affinity Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X2 (MRGPRX2), which activates mast cells via non-Fcε receptors. Another possible pathway is through neuropeptides, including corticotropin-releasing hormone, neurotensin (NT), and substance P (SP) via high-affinity receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Risk factors of Kounis syndrome include a history of previous allergy, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Various causes have been found to trigger Kounis syndrome, and more triggers are being identified. The most common trigger of Kounis syndrome is antibiotics (27.4%), followed by insect bites. Other causes include foods, latex, and dialysate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Medicines that may trigger Kounis syndrome include analgesics, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and anticancer drugs.\n\n【24】Regarding Kounis syndrome triggered by antibiotics, cases have been reported on amoxicillin, amikacin, cefuroxime, penicillin, sulbactam/cefoperazone, piperacillin/tazobactam, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Clinical studies indicate that allergic patients who are simultaneously exposed to several allergens have more symptoms than monosensitized individuals. The more medicines an atopic patient is exposed to, the easier and quicker anaphylaxis and Kounis syndrome can occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Our patient was previously allergic to amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, clindamycin, and tetracycline. Nevertheless, the general practitioner had put on flucloxacillin and clindamycin without taking a proper allergic history. After identifying the allergic reaction, the antibiotics were changed to cephalexin, and the patient developed Kounis syndrome. Thus, there is a possibility that this patient was exposed to three possible allergens, which would have easily triggered Kounis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【25】A case of clindamycin-triggered Kounis syndrome has been reported in a 17-year-old boy who has taken treatment for acute tonsillitis and subsequently developing acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Our patient was treated with clindamycin and flucloxacillin, which might be the possible triggers of Kounis syndrome, manifested as acute anterolateral myocardial infarction with ST-segment depression in V4–V6 leads. However, it is difficult to determine which caused the symptoms since the patient claimed to be allergic to both antibiotics. There are no reported cases of Kounis syndrome secondary to flucloxacillin.\n\n【26】The diagnosis of Kounis syndrome is based on clinical symptoms and signs and laboratory, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and angiographic evidence. A variety of these findings might accompany allergic symptomatology that helps to establish the correct diagnosis. The symptoms include acute chest pain, chest discomfort, dyspnea, faintness, headache, nausea, pruritus, and skin itching. Therefore, entertaining a high index of paramount suspicion is important. Patients with systemic allergic reactions associated with clinical, electrocardiographic, and laboratory findings of acute myocardial ischemia should be suspected of having Kounis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Newer diagnostic techniques such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and myocardial scintigraphy can help to confirm the diagnosis. Increased serum tryptase, histamine, cardiac biomarkers, and cardiac troponins are beneficial findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In this case, the patient developed an ischaemic-type chest pain, and the immediately taken electrocardiogram showed ischaemic changes. He had an elevated troponin I level with symptoms of hypersensitivity, and the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome was made.\n\n【27】Management of Kounis syndrome is a complex task that requires rapid treatment decisions aimed at myocardium revascularisation and treating the concomitant allergic reaction. Currently, guidelines for the treatment of Kounis syndrome are lacking. Most of the evidence on the efficacy of the treatment is based on individual case reports or case series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. A recent review conducted by Kounis himself recommends different management approaches for the multiple kinds of variants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【28】The two main aspects of management include cardiological evaluation and treatment of ACS and emergency treatment of acute allergic reactions. As initial steps for managing ACS, nitroglycerine infusion or tablets can be given, and calcium channel blockers such as verapamil or diltiazem can be considered. Intramuscular epinephrine, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, glucocorticoid, and H1-blockers can be given to manage the allergic reaction after removing the tentative allergen. Next, continuous monitoring is indicated for the type I variant, and dual antiplatelet therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention can be performed for type II and type III variants. It is also essential to evaluate the ejection fraction and hemodynamic instability. Timely referrals for the CCU or ICU should be done 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. This patient was managed initially with nitroglycerin sublingual tablet and next with dual antiplatelet therapy. Six doses of subcutaneous enoxaparin and prednisolone to control the allergic reaction were also given. He was discharged with nitrates, dual antiplatelets, and antihypertensives, considering his chronic medical conditions. According to the literature, although metoprolol was given to this patient, it is contraindicated in Kounis syndrome. Beta-blockers can aggravate coronary vasospasms in patients with type II Kounis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【29】So far, there are only seven cases of Kounis syndrome reported in Sri Lanka. Among them, five cases have depicted ST-elevation myocardial infarctions. One case has reported amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-induced Kounis syndrome with widespread ST elevations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. In another case, the patient has presented with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia without any obvious trigger of hypersensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Two other cases of Kounis syndrome have been reported following snake bites, one following a hump-nosed pit viper bite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> and another a cobra bite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Another case has been reported following a hornet sting causing widespread T inversions in the electrocardiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In two cases, the patients have succumbed following Kounis syndrome, one following ceftazidime injection where postmortem found myocardial necrosis with elevated tryptase level suspecting the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The other fatal case of Kounis syndrome was an anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction following anaphylaxis after ingestion of prawns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Therefore, we report the second case of Kounis syndrome with non-ST-elevation of myocardial infarction and the first one with ST-segment depression in Sri Lanka.\n\n【30】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【31】This case emphasizes that physicians should be aware of allergic angina syndrome, also known as Kounis syndrome, when a patient simultaneously develops symptoms of ACS and hypersensitivity features. In such cases, other supportive investigations such as electrocardiograms and cardiac biomarkers should be conducted to support the diagnosis, and the management should be initiated promptly. Peripheral blood eosinophilia also supports the diagnosis of Kounis syndrome even in the absence of other features of hypersensitivity. Kounis syndrome is a life-threatening clinical entity regardless of the triggering allergen. Since the management of Kounis syndrome is more complex than solitary ACS, the recognized bodies need to make an evidence-based clinical guideline to manage the condition effectively. At the same time, pharmacovigilance is essential when prescribing medicines, especially when a patient has a significant allergic history.\n\n【32】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【33】The authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors express their gratitude to the patient who kindly gave consent for this case to be presented in this paper.

This is of particular importance for patients undergoing myocardial revascularization since this infection can be a trigger for the formation of restenosis in the area of a previously implanted coronary stent. Understanding the risk factors for stent thrombosis and restenosis is of particular importance in individuals at risk for adverse outcomes. The rarity of such situations makes the present study unique. Objective. Studying the peculiarities of restenosis and thrombosis of the coronary arteries in patients after coronavirus infection. Methods. The study was performed in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Emergency Hospital, Semey City, in 2021. We have examined the medical records of 10 consecutive patients with restenosis of coronary arteries after coronavirus infection and 10 matched-by-age patients with similar restenosis of coronary arteries who did not have coronavirus infection as a comparison group. To determine statistically significant differences between independent samples, we calculated the Mann–Whitney U test. Results. The average age of patients was 65.7 years. Only one case was classified as early restenosis (within 8 days of previous revascularization), two cases represented late restenosis, and seven cases were very late restenoses. In 70% of cases, restenosis was localized in the left anterior descending artery, in 30% of cases, it was in the right coronary artery, and in 40% of cases, it was in the left circumflex artery. In comparison with patients who did not have a coronavirus infection, there were statistically significant differences regarding IgG () and fibrinogen (). Conclusion. Patients with myocardial revascularization in the past have a higher risk of stent restenosis against the background of coronavirus infection due to excessive neointimal hyperplasia, hypercoagulability, increased inflammatory response, and endothelial dysfunction.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The gold standard for the treatment of coronary artery disease is myocardial revascularization using stents, balloon angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass grafting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Advances in myocardial revascularization, the introduction of drug-eluting stents, and effective antithrombotic therapy have made coronary restenosis rare in recent years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed our point of view about this pathology. This infection promotes thrombosis of arterial vessels and acts as a provoking factor in the development of acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction or unstable angina) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the high burden on the healthcare system and the sharply increased need for resources, the activity of interventional cardiology around the world decreased significantly, reducing the number of cardiac catheterization procedures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, the need for repeated cardiac surgery for restenosis of coronary vessels increased against the background of coronavirus infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Understanding the risk factors for stent thrombosis and restenosis is of particular importance in individuals at risk for adverse outcomes, especially in elderly patients with associated diseases.\n\n【5】##### 1.1. Aim of Research\n\n【6】Studying the peculiarities of restenosis and thrombosis of the coronary arteries in patients after coronavirus infection.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Methods\n\n【8】The study was performed in the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery of Emergency Hospital, Semey City, Kazakhstan, from May 2021 to December 2021. We have examined the medical records of ten consecutive patients with restenosis of coronary arteries after coronavirus infection and ten matched-by-age patients with a similar restenosis of coronary arteries who did not have coronavirus infection as a comparison group. In all patients during restenosis, stents of the third generation were installed (Resolute Integrity, Promus Premier, Xience Alpine, BioMatrix, and Orsiro). The clinical data of patients were collected from electronic medical records, including demographics, clinical symptoms and signs, coexisting conditions, imaging findings, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes. Data on previous myocardial revascularization and coronavirus infection were found retrospectively from medical records. For all patients, the diagnosis was made by experienced specialists. All reported events were verified by hospital electronic records from Complex Medical Information System and adjudicated by two cardiologists in consensus. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (as revised in 2013) and approved by the institutional ethical committee of Semey Medical University (reference number 7 from 16.03.2021). Informed consent and permission to publish were provided by the patients.\n\n【9】The study design is prospective single-center case series. To determine statistically significant differences between independent samples, we calculated the Mann–Whitney U\\-test.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【11】Case 1. A 65-year-old man was admitted to the hospital on June 23, 2021. He underwent coronary artery stenting twice (in 2016 and 18.01.2021). In May 2021, he suffered from severe COVID-19-associated pneumonia. Coronarography: the right type of coronary circulation. Left anterior descending artery (LAD): 50% stenosis at the orifice, 50–60% stenosis in the proximal part, and occlusion in the area of the previously implanted stent in the distal third with filling of the distal bed through intra-arterial anastomoses. Right coronary artery (RCA): restenosis of 90% of the previously implanted stent in the middle third.\n\n【12】Case 2. A 69-year-old man was admitted to the hospital on May 12, 2021. He had a myocardial infarction (MI) in 2014, with RCA stenting. COVID-19 in September 2020. Coronarography: the right type of coronary circulation. LAD: with uneven contours and stenosis of the middle third up to 80%. Left circumflex artery (LCx): with uneven contours, stenosis at the orifice up to 60%, and stenosis of the distal third up to 80%. RCA: previously implanted stent, restenosis up to 90% in the distal third.\n\n【13】Case 3. A 66-year-old woman was admitted to the intensive care unit on August 23, 2021, with anginal pain and a high level of cardiac markers.

At the control angiography: the lumen of the arteries was restored and the blood flow through the artery was TIMI III flow.  \nClinical characteristics and data of instrumental examination of persons with restenosis who underwent COVID-19 and comparison group are presented in Table 1. The average age of the studied patients was 65.7 years (from 46 to 80 years); in the comparison group, it was 66.2 years. All patients of the studied group were hospitalized for acute coronary artery disease requiring myocardial revascularization; seven of them had STEMI and three had NSTEMI (diagnosis confirmed by ECG), in comparison group situation was the same. Acute coronavirus infection (CVI) was observed only in two patients out of 10 cases (Cases 4 and 7); in one of them, severe COVID-associated pneumonia was diagnosed with a fatal outcome caused by acute heart failure. The second patient had a repeated case of CVI with an interval of 11 months after previous COVID-associated pneumonia against the background of pulmonary fibrosis and chronic respiratory failure of the III degrees, requiring constant oxygen support. The rest of the patients underwent CVI for the previous period from one month (Cases 1 and 9) to 8 months; infection was confirmed by elevated IgG levels .  \nSigns of acute respiratory failure, accompanied by a decrease in oxygen saturation, tachycardia, and tachypnea, were observed in six patients in the studied group. All patients of the studied group received oxygen support. Signs of respiratory distress syndrome were noted in two patients. In the comparison group, decreased oxygen saturation was found in three patients; however this rate was not less than 95%. There were no statistically significant differences in this indicator in the studied groups ().  \nPrevious myocardial revascularization in the studied group was carried out in terms of 8 days (Case 6) to 14 years. In three patients, the ejection fraction according to echocardiography was intact; in three patients, it was moderately reduced; in the remaining patients, it was decreased. In all cases, restenosis of the coronary arteries was observed; in most cases, its localization was the LAD; in three cases, it was RCA; in four cases, it was LCx. In the comparison group, the predominant localization was LAD (five cases), and in four cases, it was RCA. Decreased injection fraction in this group was found in five cases. There were no statistically significant differences in this rate in the studied groups (). In all cases, the underlying disease was accompanied by hypertension, and 40% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus.  \nAnalyzing laboratory parameters, all persons of the studied group had confirmation of a past coronavirus infection in accordance with the levels of IgM and IgG . In comparison with patients who did not have a coronavirus infection, there were no statistically significant differences regarding IgM (the rate of acute infection); however, such differences were found for IgG (indicator of CVI in the history) (; , respectively).  \nLymphopenia and thrombocytopenia characteristic of CVI were noted only in the case of a deceased patient (Case 4); he also had a pronounced leukocytosis, indicating the addition of a bacterial infection. In three cases, moderate leukocytosis was noted against the background of high levels of cardiac markers. A high D-dimer was found only in two cases (one case of acute CVI, the second in a patient who had CVI three months ago). With regard to the lipid profile, almost all patients showed a tendency to increase LDL levels to the upper limit of normal values, while HDL levels were at or below the lower limit of normal. There were not any statistically significant differences in the studied and comparison groups regarding these biochemical rates; however, for the fibrinogen level, such differences were significant ().\n\n【23】Table 1 \n\n【24】Clinical characteristics and data of instrumental examination of persons with restenosis who underwent CVI.\n\n【25】Table 2 \n\n【26】Laboratory indicators characterizing the presence of recurrent stent thrombosis in persons who underwent CVI.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【28】Restenosis is angiographically confirmed a narrowing of the lumen of the coronary artery by more than 50%, localized in the area of a previously implanted stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Most often, restenosis develops within the first three months after previous revascularization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. After six months, the risks of restenosis decrease and the process remains stable; since during this period, stent endothelization and remodeling of the coronary artery wall are completed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The mechanism for early restenosis development is associated with trauma to the vascular wall during device implantation, leading to an inflammatory response accompanied by the migration of neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, and the release of inflammatory mediators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Subsequently, the induction of migration of smooth muscle cells into the intima of the vessel with their accumulation and proliferation of fibroblasts is observed. Increased synthesis of the extracellular matrix causes thickening of the neoadventitia and neointima, narrowing the lumen of the coronary artery in the area of the preimplanted stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Thus, there is a direct relationship between the development of inflammation, the formation of neointima, and the development of restenosis at the site of the implanted stent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. After the damage to the intima of the coronary artery by a stent and increased platelet aggregation, their adhesion and secretion contribute to the induction of migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Coronavirus infection is characterized by an acute systemic inflammatory response that can lead to a cytokine storm. A prothrombotic environment and platelet activation aggravate the situation and increase the risk of thrombosis. An increase in the level of tissue thromboplastin leads to an increase in the level of thrombin and fibrin synthesis with the possible development of disseminated intravascular coagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>. Therefore, coronavirus infection can be a trigger for the formation of restenosis in the area of a previously implanted coronary stent through a complex mechanism, which can cause complications in the long-term period after CVI.\n\n【30】In the article, we presented a description of ten cases of coronary arteries restenosis in patients who had a coronavirus infection in comparison with the matched patients who had restenosis without CVI. In each group, only one case was classified as subacute restenosis, the other cases represented late or very late restenosis.\n\n【31】The available literature sources mainly provide information on cases of acute thrombosis of coronary artery stents after coronavirus infection. Thus, in a study conducted in Spain, a sharp increase in the frequency of stent thrombosis during the peak of the pandemic in March–April 2020 was noted, with a decrease in the frequency of coronary interventions by 38% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. These data were later confirmed by the results of other similar studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 17\\]</u>. A feature of our study is the development of restenosis of previously implanted stents in patients at different times after CVI. Only in two cases, coronavirus infection was present at the time of development of restenosis, of which in one case the patient had severe COVID-associated pneumonia with a fatal outcome, in the second case the patient had a repeated episode of an asymptomatic infection confirmed by a high level of IgM. However, given the low percentage of restenosis of coronary artery stents worldwide, our results suggest a possible association between recent CVI and stent restenosis.\n\n【32】In patients included in our study, the incidence of comorbidities did not differ from the comparison group and other populations of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Endothelial dysfunction induced by arterial hypertension, diabetes, or obesity contributes to the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells and the formation of neointimal hyperplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【33】An increase in the level of fibrinogen in the blood plasma can serve as a predictor of restenosis after endovascular stenting. Fibrinogen, accumulating in the atherosclerotic ally affected intima, penetrates into the arterial wall, where it binds to lipoprotein-α, low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which in turn triggers the synthesis of mediators involved in thrombosis. Growth factors, actively produced by platelets and monocytes, have a potentiating effect on hyperplasia and the proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells, thereby triggering the process of restenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In our study, in 60% of patients of the studied group, the fibrinogen level significantly exceeded normal values, and in the other patients, it was the upper limit of normal values, which could be associated not only with coronary heart disease but also with a previous coronavirus infection. In the patients included in our study, the level of lipoproteins practically did not go beyond the limits of normal values, which could be explained by the development of late and very late stent restenoses in them.\n\n【34】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【35】The results of our study suggest that patients with myocardial revascularization in the past have a higher risk of developing stent restenosis against the background of coronavirus infection due to excessive neointimal hyperplasia, hypercoagulability, increased inflammatory response, and endothelial dysfunction. Coronavirus infection can be a trigger for restenosis even in the long-term period after the disease, which is due to the long-term inflammatory process in the vascular wall and vascular remodeling associated with the activation of fibrosis processes. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of restenosis and thrombosis in patients after COVID-19.\n\n【36】#### Data Availability\n\n【37】The data used to support the study are included in the paper.\n\n【38】#### Additional Points\n\n【39】Small sample size and single-center study.\n\n【40】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【41】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.\n\n【42】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【43】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This research was funded by the Science Committee of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan (Grant no.

Initial treatment with pulsed corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulin, and cyclosporine seemed to suppress the activity of interstitial lung disease temporarily, but signs of relapse were detected such as elevation of serum KL-6 level and progressing pulmonary shadows in chest computed tomography scan. After polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column treatment, the areas of pulmonary shadows drastically decreased. Gradually, arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio recovered, and serum ferritin level and KL-6 level decreased. These findings indicate that polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column treatment could be promising in combination with conventional therapy for rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia associated with clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis, especially at the early phase of relapse.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic connective tissue disease which is characterized by inflammation of the muscles and the skin. It is also a systemic disease involving the joints, esophagus, lungs, and heart. Clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (C-ADM) is characterized by typical cutaneous manifestations and minor involvement of skeletal muscles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is well known that the interstitial lung disease (ILD) associated with C-ADM often presents with rapid onset and progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and that the type of ILD is resistant to conventional therapy and has a poor prognosis especially in East Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】It has been reported that direct hemoperfusion with polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column (PMX) effectively removed circulating endotoxin both in vitro and in vivo studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It was initially developed as a treatment for sepsis, and it has also revealed favorable effects on arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio in acute respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Here, we describe a patient of rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia associated with C-ADM whose relapse after intensive conventional therapy was successfully treated with PMX hemoperfusion.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 37-year-old man presented with skin rash for the last two months. He also had progressing dyspnea for the last two weeks and visited a hospital to consult with a physician. His oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was as low as 91% at room air in resting state, and he was admitted to the hospital. He had skin rashes in the face and on the hands. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan revealed nonsegmental pulmonary infiltrate and grand-glass opacity mainly distributed in the subpleural areas of the lower lobes. In addition, there were some legions of consolidation with air bronchogram in the peripheral lung, which implied traction bronchiectasis. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis showed increases in total cells ( /mL) and lymphocyte fraction (64.5%). Culture of BALF was negative. In transbronchial lung biopsy samples, lymphocytes and macrophages was infiltrated, and masson body-like fibrotic foci was formed.\n\n【7】He was suspected of rapidly progressing interstitial lung disease with dermatomyositis and transferred to our hospital. He had Gottron’s papules, mechanic’s hands, and spotted rashes between eyebrows, but he did not have heliotrope rash or other rashes on joints or body trunk. Manual muscle testing revealed no muscle weakness both in proximal and distal muscles. Fine crackles were audible in the bilateral lower lung fields. Laboratory findings on admission revealed a white blood cell count of 4,200/mm<sup>3</sup> with 76.1% neutrophils C-reactive protein was slightly elevated (3.21 mg/dL \\[standard value; 0–0.4 mg/dL\\]). His serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), KL-6, ferritin, aldolase, and D-Dimer levels were elevated (586 IU/L \\[119–229 IU/L\\]), 1835 U/mL \\[<500 U/mL\\], 842 ng/mL \\[20–280 ng/mL\\], 14.1 U/L \\[2.7–7.5 U/L\\], and 12.4 μg/mL \\[<1.0 μg/mL\\], resp.), but creatine kinase (CK) was not elevated (201 U/L \\[55-210 U/L\\]). He did not have antinuclear antibody, anti-Jo-1 antibody, or other anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with the patient’s serum revealed that he had a 140 kD protein band, which is supposed to be C-ADM-140/MDA5 antibody; however, further determination was not available in our case. Arterial blood gas test at O<sub>2</sub> inhalation of 3 L/min with nasal cannula revealed decreased levels of PaO<sub>2</sub> (68.7 Torr) and PaCO<sub>2</sub> (31.7 Torr). Plasma b-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was <4.0 pg/mL \\[<18.4 pg/mL\\], and ultrasound cardiography revealed that his cardiac function was normal. Skin biopsy was performed, and the findings were compatible with dermatomyositis. Electromyogram or magnetic resonance imaging of thigh muscles was omitted because respiratory failure was progressing and the treatment was made the highest priority. There were no signs of malignancy so far as we could check.\n\n【8】He was diagnosed as clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (C-ADM) with rapidly progressing interstitial pneumonia and treated with pulsed corticosteroids (methylprednisolone 1 g/day, days 0–3, 16–18) followed by high dose corticosteroids, intravenous cyclophosphamide (IVCY; 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 3, 22; 750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, day 41), intravenous immunoglobulin (20 g/day, days 6–10, 48–52), and cyclosporine-A (CSA; 200 mg/day, days 0–5; 250–300 mg/day, days 6-). Anticoagulation treatment with heparin followed by warfarin was also used (days 0-). In response to these initial treatments, consolidations and grand-glass opacities decreased in chest CT scans . Oxygen demand decreased from 4 L/min to 1-2 L/min to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> level at 90–95% in resting state. However, serum ferritin kept increasing and began to decrease two weeks afterwards.\n\n【9】On day 29, chest CT scans revealed progressing interstitial shadows again . CK was not elevated (130 U/L). Plasma BNP was slightly elevated (26.9 pg/mL), but there were no signs of heart failure. Although his oxygen demand or respiratory symptoms had not changed significantly, we thought that his interstitial lung disease was relapsing. Since a relapse after initial treatment of rapidly progressive ILD is often fatal, we decided to conduct intensive care in this early phase of the relapse, thus applied hemoperfusion treatment in this moment. On days 30 and 31, he underwent single course of PMX treatment, which was carried out at a flow rate of 80–100 mL/min for 12 h, twice at an interval of 24 h. Nafamostat mesilate (Torii Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) was used for anticoagulation. Following the hemoperfusion, the findings detected by chest X-ray and CT scans improved remarkably, and the serum ferritin kept decreasing. Oxygen demand improved gradually, reflected in the increase in arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio (from 215 to 313), whereas serum concentration of LDH and KL-6 still remained at high level . The dosage of oral corticosteroid was tapered gradually, and he was discharged with a prescription of 30 mg of prednisolone and 250 mg of cyclosporine. He was treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide repeatedly. There has been no recurrence in him for 6 months after the discharge.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Time course of medical treatments and changes in the lab data before and after treatment.

Discussion\n\n【15】We report a case of rapidly progressive ILD with C-ADM, whose relapse in spite of intensive therapy was successfully prevented by PMX hemoperfusion. We think that PMX is a potent therapeutic option in combination with the conventional treatment, especially in the early phase of the relapse of the ILD with C-ADM.\n\n【16】Acute/subacute interstitial lung disease in patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) is frequently fatal within months despite high dose prednisolone (PSL) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Acute/subacute ILD is more common in patients with C-ADM, which results in higher mortality rate in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. It is often resistant to conventional therapy and has poor prognosis especially in East Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. It was reported that HRCT patterns differed between anti-C-ADM-140 positive and negative patients in DM; lower lobes consolidation or ground-glass attenuation (GGA) pattern (50.0%) and random GGA pattern (33.3%) were the predominant patterns, and intralobular reticular opacities were absent in anti-C-ADM-140 positive cases, while lower lobes reticulation pattern (69.2%) was frequently seen in anti-C-ADM-140 negative cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. NSIP and DAD were seen in histological examinations of acute/subacute ILD with C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Furthermore, C-ADM-associated interstitial pneumonia takes an aggressive course even when the radiological and histological features are consistent with NSIP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In the present case, the radiological features were mostly consistent with lower lobes consolidation or GGA pattern, and there was traction bronchiectasis on admission, which is a predictor of rapid progression and poor prognosis of ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>; therefore he received intensive initial treatment with pulsed corticosteroids and IVCY, intravenous immunoglobulin, oral CSA, and warfarin.\n\n【17】It was reported that combination therapy with pulsed corticosteroids, CSA, and IVCY was promising for acute/subacute ILD with DM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It was reported that early intervention with CSA in combination with corticosteroid was effective, with tightly monitoring 2 h postdose blood concentration (C2) of CSA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 13\\]</u>. In this case, we also used CSA as an initial treatment and monitored trough as well as C2 level of CSA. There are reports that intravenous immunoglobulin is effective for ILD with DM/PM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>, and we also applied it twice with an interval of a month.\n\n【18】Although pulmonary coagulopathy is suspected to be involved in the pathogenesis of ILD, effectiveness of anticoagulation therapy for ILD is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>. As a maintenance therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), warfarin had negative effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. On the other hand, anticoagulation is known to be beneficial in acute exacerbation of various ILDs including IPF and C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. In our case, the patient presented with elevated plasma D-Dimer on admission, which might have indicated thrombus formation in pulmonary microcirculation, and we decided to begin anticoagulant therapy as an acute phase treatment.\n\n【19】In the present case, the intensive initial treatment with pulsed corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide twice, respectively, intravenous immunoglobulin once, and oral cyclosporine and warfarin succeeded in the induction of the remission to the rapidly progressing ILD with C-ADM. However, relapse was suspected soon after the initial treatment as progressing interstitial shadows without any signs of heart dysfunction. Although CT findings at the time of suspected relapse were not so prominent, we judged thatitwas a critical time point to decide good or poor prognosis; thus we conducted polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column (PMX) treatment.\n\n【20】PMX treatment was initially developed as a treatment for sepsis by removing circulating endotoxin. It has also revealed favorable effects on (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) ratio in acute respiratory failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The number of reports is limited, but it was also effective for rapidly progressing ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19–21\\]</u>. It has been reported that PMX treatment was also effective for ILD with C-ADM in combination with conventional treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22–24\\]</u>. Although there remains the possibility that the other immunosuppressants finally become effective, it seems that PMX played the major role in this case, since the progressing pulmonary infiltrates quickly cleared just after the PMX treatment.\n\n【21】However, the mechanism by which PMX improves pulmonary oxygenation in acute exacerbation of ILD (AE-ILD) has not been elucidated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The removal of plasma endotoxin does not have a major role, because serum levels of endotoxin were within the normal range in previously reported cases of AE-ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 22, 25–27\\]</u>. PMX treatment was known to reduce metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>, neutrophil reactive oxygen species 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>, neutrophil elastase, and interleukin-8 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. These mediators cause lung injury and increase vascular permeability as well as the intrapulmonary shunt ratio. These mediators are known to be released from neutrophils and monocytes. It has been shown that the polymyxin b-immobilized fiber column itself traps activated blood neutrophils and monocytes, which may be involved in the reduction of releasing mediators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31–33\\]</u>. In our case, blood neutrophil count and monocyte count were not reduced after PMX treatment. The mechanism by which PMX treatment improved the ILD should be studied further. A long perfusion duration (12 h) of PMX had better prognosis than short course (<6 h) for AE-ILD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 25\\]</u>, and we also applied 12 h for a hemoperfusion duration.\n\n【22】It has been reported that serum ferritin correlates with the activity of the ILD with C-ADM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. In our case, serum ferritin kept increasing for about a week after initiating intensive immunosuppressive therapies and began to decrease afterwards. There seemed to be a time lag of approximately two weeks between the decline of disease activity and decrease of the serum ferritin level.\n\n【23】KL-6 is a mucin-like glycoprotein expressed on type II pneumocytes. Serum KL-6 level has diagnostic and prognostic significance in ILD or acute respiratory distress syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35, 36\\]</u>. It has better diagnostic accuracy of ILD in comparison to SP-A, SP-D, and MCP-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37, 38\\]</u>.

Other physical examinations were unremarkable.\n\n【9】Hematology, biochemistry, and coagulation tests and cardiac enzymes were all in normal ranges.\n\n【10】His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, and no ST segment or T wave changes. A comprehensive transthoracic echocardiography revealed ejection fraction (EF) = 60%, mild mitral regurgitation, trivial tricuspid regurgitation, systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) = 30 MMHG, and a round pedunculated semimobile dense mass (1.6 cm 1.8 cm) in right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) with attachment to the base of the septum with no obstruction of RVOT .

Computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging are complementary methods in the diagnostic workup of cardiac tumors for assessment of the scope of myocardial and local invasion. Coronary angiography will typically be an essential part of the preoperative evaluation to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease and to appraise the feeding arteries or disclose encasement of coronary vessels by the tumor. The natural history of cardiac hemangioma is changeable. It can continue to proliferate, die down to grow, or revert 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6, 7\\]</u>.

Thrombotic complications associated with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections are rare, particularly in children; the occurrence of this complication in identical twins has not been previously reported.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common pathogen causing community-acquired pneumonia in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Extra pulmonary manifestations such as hematologic, neurologic, and mucocutaneous complications associated with Mycoplasma are well recognized. Thromboembolic events in association with mycoplasma have been reported. An analysis published in 2016 cited 9 pediatric cases of Mycoplasma\\-associated thromboembolic event 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. All of these patients had anti-phospholipid antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We report identical twins with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection complicated by pulmonary emboli in association with anti-phospholipid antibodies.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Patient 1\n\n【6】A 13-year-old Caucasian female presented with cough and fever of 1-week duration. Chest X-ray revealed left lower lobe segmental pneumonia. The patient was admitted to the hospital after she failed to improve. Intravenous ceftriaxone was added to azithromycin. Blood culture was negative, and sputum culture grew normal flora. Initial laboratory tests showed the following: hemoglobin of 12.2 (12–15 g/dl), white blood cell count of 4.5 (4.3–13.5 thous/μl), and platelet count of 236 (150–500 thous/μl). Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR was positive followed by elevated specific Ig M being 4.10 (<0.9) and IgG being 0.88 (<0.9). On day 3 of hospital admission, she developed increasing respiratory distress. Antibiotics coverage was broadened. Chest CT with contrast showed multifocal pneumonia with bilateral parapneumonic effusions. The patient ultimately required BiPAP for respiratory support and was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).\n\n【7】On day 2 of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, she complained of left calf pain with mild swelling. US doppler revealed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in left gastrocnemius, posterior tibial (left), and popliteal and peroneal veins, and chest CT was reread as showing filling defects involving segmental branches to the right middle lobe pulmonary artery and right lower lobe segmental pulmonary arteries. She was started on enoxaparin at a dose of subcutaneous 60 mg (1 mg/kg/dose) twice daily. Echocardiogram was significant for elevated right ventricle (RV) systolic pressure. Anti-phospholipid antibody studies demonstrated an elevated anticardiolipin IgG of 86 (0–14.9 GPL), IgM of 120.7 (0–12.4 MPL), normal IgA of <9.5 (0–11.9 APL), and anti-beta-2-glycoprotein IgG/IgM of <9.5/21.9 (<9.5/21.9 GGU/SMU). DRVVT was elevated to 54 with a normalized ratio of 1.3. On PICU day 4, antifactor Xa level was subtherapeutic and enoxaparin dose was adjusted to 70 mg after which the therapeutic level of antifactor Xa of 0.7 U/ml (0.6–1 U/ml) was achieved. On PICU day 5, based on her clinical improvement, antibiotics were weaned. She continued to improve and was discharged after 9 days.\n\n【8】At follow-up, her enoxaparin was switched to single daily dose (120 mg) to achieve a therapeutic level of 1.3 U/ml (1-2 U/ml) for a duration of 3 months. Symptoms completely resolved, and she returned to normal and full activities.\n\n【9】##### 2.2. Patient 2\n\n【10】The 13-year-old Caucasian identical twin of the patient cited above presented to the emergency department with cough of 9-day duration and left leg pain of 2-day duration. She was seen a week prior by her primary care doctor who started azithromycin. Two days later, she was noted to be hypoxic (89% on room air), tachycardiac (131 bpm), and febrile (38.4°C) in the emergency department. Lung exam showed diminished breath sound on the left, and left calf tenderness was noted. Initial laboratory tests showed the following: hemoglobin of 11.9 g/dl (12–15 g/dl), white blood cell count of 9.6 thous/μl (4.3–13.5 thous/μl), platelet count of 259 thous/μl (150–500 thous/μl), lactate of 1.2 mmol/l (0.5–2.2 mmol/l), and BNP of <10 pg/ml (0–100 pg/ml). Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR was negative followed by elevated specific IgM and IgG levels of 4.39 (<0.9) and 2.74 (<0.9), respectively. Echocardiography was unremarkable. Anti-nuclear antibodies were normal. Anti-phospholipid antibody studies demonstrated anticardiolipin IgG of 13.7 (0–14.9 GPL), IgM of 28.8 (0–12.4 MPL), normal IgA of <9.5 (0–11.9 APL), and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein IgG/IgM <9.5/<9.5 (<9.5/21.9 GGU/SMU). DRVVT was elevated to 54 sec (0–41 sec) with a normalized ratio of 1.3. A chest X-ray revealed right perihilar interstitial infiltrates. Antibiotic coverage was broadened. Doppler ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity showed normal venous flow dynamics. CT angiography demonstrated multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli in segmental distribution of bilateral upper lobes, right middle lobe, and left lower lobe, along with dense consolidation of the right lower lobe. She was admitted to the PICU where she was started on an intravenous heparin drip.\n\n【11】On day 2 of hospital admission, she was switched to enoxaparin 60 mg twice daily (1 mg/kg/dose). Initial antifactor Xa level was subtherapeutic. Dose was adjusted to 80 mg twice daily, and a therapeutic level of antifactor Xa of 0.7 U/ml (0.6–1 U/ml) was achieved. She demonstrated gradual improvement and was discharged home on day 6.\n\n【12】At follow-up, she was switched to single daily dose of enoxaparin (120 mg) with a therapeutic antifactor Xa level of 1.5 U/ml (1-2 U/ml) for a duration of 3 months. She had complete resolution of symptoms and returned to normal and full activities.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】There are acquired and inherited factors leading to a hypercoagulable state 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Acquired factors that promote coagulation pathways include surgery, pregnancy, hormonal replacement therapy, estrogen containing oral contraceptive, malignancy, inflammation, infection, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Genetic factors such as factor V Leiden and prothrombin G2021 A mutation are identified in a variable percentage of patients depending on demographics.\n\n【15】Mycoplasma pneumoniae\\-associated hypercoagulable state has been described to be secondary to endothelial damage leading to release of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of procoagulant pathways 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Pulmonary emboli are the third leading cause of mortality associated with mycoplasma infection if not diagnosed and treated promptly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Anti-phospholipid antibodies are found to be elevated in 1–5% of the healthy population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. They can also be elevated in bacterial infection, viral infections, and autoimmune diseases (i.e. lupus) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Elevated anti-phospholipid antibodies have also been reported after immunization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. The mechanism by which thrombosis is precipitated in patients with anti-phospholipid antibodies remains unclear.\n\n【17】Most patients with infectious causes of elevated aPL antibody return to normal levels within 2 or 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Thromboembolic events in association with elevated aPL in the setting of infection are difficult to differentiate from other causes. For both patients, prothrombotic and genetic laboratory evaluations were initiated after enoxaparin was discontinued to identify potential genetic prothrombotic variables in these identical twins. Laboratory studies revealed resolution of elevated anti-phospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin IgA, IgG, IgM, beta-2-glycoprotein 1 IgG and IgM, and DRVVT). The genetic evaluation was normal for factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, fibrinogen, thrombin time, factor VIII, protein C activity, protein S activity, plasminogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, homocysteine level, ANA screen, dsDNA, and lipoprotein A. Although heterozygosity for MTHFR C677 T was found in both patients, it was not thought clinically relevant in the context of normal homocysteine level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【19】Our report documents the unique occurrence of transient para-infectious anti-phospholipid antibodies provoked by Mycoplasma infection leading to venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in identical female twins. We found no identifiable genetic prothrombotic variables. This does not rule out an underlying unknown genetic factor promoting thrombosis in these identical twins.\n\n【20】#### Data Availability\n\n【21】No data were used to support the findings of this study.\n\n【22】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【23】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

While several cardiac complications of cardiac involvement have been previously described, the evolution towards cerebral stroke has been rarely reported. In this case report, we describe an atypical case of haematogenous metastatic invasion of the left atrium from pulmonary neoplasm extension presenting as an ipsilateral stroke whose ASCO classification changed during the clinical management.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Although cardiac metastases have been reported in up to 25% of patients with lung cancer in autoptic studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, the detection of cardiac involvement in these patients is relatively uncommon in clinical practice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>. The metastatic pathway to the heart is often lymphatic, but hematogenous patterns can also be observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. From a clinical point of view, invasion of the left heart may be a life-threatening event, potentially leading to a number of complications such as obstructed pulmonary venous flow 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, cardiac tamponade 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, ventricular arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, complete atrioventricular block 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, left ventricular inflow obstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, and myocardial infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Cerebral stroke as a result of systemic embolization from the left heart has been exceptionally reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> and may sometimes represent the first clinical presentation of the neoplasm. Adequate identification of the underlying cause of stroke is therefore of major clinical importance in these cases. Compared with the old Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification system, newer classification schemes such as the ASCO (A, atherosclerosis; S, small vessel disease; C, cardiac source; O, other causes) phenotypic system can facilitate the identification of the most likely cause by grading the probability of each factor and accounting for the extent of the diagnostic work-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This approach may be particularly useful when multiple potential mechanisms are present, since it reduces the prevalence of patients with stroke of indeterminate origin. In this report, we describe an unusual case of left atrial (LA) invasion from pulmonary neoplasm extension via the right upper pulmonary vein whose first clinical presentation was characterized by an ipsilateral stroke with evolving ASCO categorization during the management.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 76-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department because of left hemiparesis and dysarthria. His history was relevant for past smoking, systemic hypertension, and laryngeal cancer treated by total laryngectomy and tracheostomy 5 years earlier. His usual therapy included aspirin, losartan, and doxazosin. During the last 3 weeks, he had shown recurrent episodes of postural instability and paresthesia in the left arm. A brain computed tomography (CT) performed 2 weeks earlier had shown no significant abnormalities. At the current examination, chest and cardiac examinations were normal, blood pressure was 170/75 mmHg, heart rate was 77 bpm, body temperature was 36.5°C, and oxygen saturation was 95%. The ECG was normal. Neurological examination showed facial-brachial-crural left hemiparesis (NIH Stroke Scale = 8). A new brain CT showed an ipsilateral hypodense lesion in the left semioval center. The patient was hospitalized, and therapy with aspirin, methylprednisolone, ramipril, and dalteparin was started. An echo-Doppler of supra-aortic vessels showed subcritical stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and critical stenosis of the left common carotid artery with occlusion of proximal left internal carotid artery. An atherosclerotic stroke was diagnosed (ASCO A1b).\n\n【7】During the following hours, neurological conditions progressively improved. Routine chest X-ray evidenced a rounding mass projecting over the right upper lobe and extending towards the right upper portion of cardiac silhouette . Chest CT confirmed the presence of a large opacity with irregular borders, with invasion of the right upper pulmonary vein and extension into the left atrium . Transthoracic echocardiography showed massive LA invasion by a large, multilobed, highly mobile mass (48 × 35 mm) protruding through the mitral valve into the left ventricle during diastole (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). Transesophageal echocardiography confirmed LA invasion with occlusion of the right upper pulmonary vein and pericardial infiltration through the LA roof, allowing visualization of areas of vascularization and some regions of cystic colliquation within the mass (Figures 3(c) and 3(d)). The stroke was reclassified as ASCO C<sub>1</sub>. On day 7, sudden right hemiparesis with spatiotemporal disorientation occurred. Brain CT showed new multiple, diffuse hypodense lesions near the vertex in the left hemisphere . After careful clinical evaluation, the patient was considered at too high risk to undergo thoracic surgery. On day 20, cardiac magnetic resonance showed a further increase in the dimension of LA mass with subtotal obliteration of LA cavity . On day 23, the patient died because of cardiac arrest.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】Chest X-ray showing a rounding mass projecting over the right upper lobe and extending towards the right upper portion of cardiac silhouette.\n\n【10】(a)\n\n【11】(b)\n\n【12】(c)\n\n【13】(d)\n\n【14】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【16】Chest CT showing a large opacity with irregular borders in the right upper lobe (a), with invasion of the right upper pulmonary vein (b-c) and extension into the left atrium (d).

Discussion\n\n【32】Although relatively rare, metastatization of pulmonary neoplasm to the left atrium has been well documented, particularly in patients with primary lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. In a previous review of 215 lung cancer patients studied by gadolinium-enhanced 3D magnetic resonance angiography, an involvement of the proximal portion of the pulmonary veins and an extension into the left atrium were found in 9 (4.2%) and 2 (0.9%) patients, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Similarly, a more recent retrospective analysis of 4668 patients who underwent surgery for lung cancer found pathological evidence of pulmonary vein and LA involvement in 34 (0.7%) and 25 (0.5%) subjects, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. LA invasion usually occurs by two main mechanisms, including direct infiltration of myocardial tissue by contiguity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18–20\\]</u> and extension into the left atrium via the lymphatics and/or the pulmonary veins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21–28\\]</u>. Patients most commonly suffer symptoms related to lung cancer (e.g. cough, hemoptysis, and weight loss) or sometimes related to cardiac complications as the first clinical presentation. A limited number of reports previously described cardiovascular presentations secondary to systemic neoplastic embolization, including cerebral ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29–31\\]</u> or peripheral arterial occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Noteworthy, most previous reports of cerebral ischemia described events with typical contralateral presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 29\\]</u> or incidental detection of brain ischemic lesion by imaging techniques in asymptomatic subjects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 31\\]</u>. Although patients with metastatic involvement of the heart generally have poor clinical outcome, their management should include a careful assessment of surgical options. When appropriate, the treatment of choice is complete resection in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. However, in the majority of cases, cardiac metastases occur in patients with advanced neoplastic disease who have already undergone resection of the tumor of origin. In these cases, cardiac treatment is usually confined to palliative interventions to relieve cardiac compression or haemodynamic obstruction if indicated. Moreover, complete resection of the tumor is not always possible, and postoperative mortality is relatively high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33, 34\\]</u>.\n\n【33】In this report, we describe the case of a primary lung neoplasm extending into the left atrium via a pulmonary vein and complicated by stroke presenting as ipsilateral hemiparesis. Several atypical issues should be pointed out in this case: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> the clinical presentation as stroke with left hemiparesis and CT evidence of ipsilateral acute ischemic lesion, which might suggest the presence of uncrossed corticospinal tracts in our patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> the changes in stroke categorization according to the ASCO classification, related to the detection of left internal carotid artery occlusion with successive evidence of cardiac source of cerebral embolization; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the successive clinical evolution with sudden-onset right hemiparesis associated with multiple contralateral left-sided lesions, suggestive for an embolization pattern; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> the growth rate of LA mass, which rapidly led to LA cavity obliteration and cardiac death. It should be pointed out that since tissue analysis data were not available, caution is needed in interpreting these findings. Although both the clinical course and imaging data support the hypothesis of a metastatic nature of the mass, without histologic confirmation, the diagnosis cannot be considered as definitively established. From a practical point of view, this report highlights the importance of considering the ASCO classification as a dynamic tool to define the phenotypic nature of stroke and of considering echocardiography as a cornerstone in the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of patients with clinical evidence of cerebral ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.\n\n【34】#### Competing Interests\n\n【35】The authors declare that there are no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Acquired hemophilia A (AHA) is a potentially life-threatening autoimmune hemostatic disorder where autoantibodies that disrupt the functions of factor VIII (FVIII) are present in the circulation. The early diagnosis of AHA is difficult since the symptoms of AHA differ from those of congenital hemophilia A. Furthermore, the management of AHA is also more complex due to the presence of autoantibodies against FVIII (FVIII inhibitors). Here, we present three case reports and conduct a literature review of AHA with the aim to increase awareness and knowledge regarding the diagnosis and treatment of AHA. Case Presentations. We present three patients diagnosed with AHA in these case reports. The first patient was a young female, while the second and third patients were middle-aged and elderly males, respectively. All patients presented with a chief complaint of bruises without hemarthrosis and a history of bleeding. Laboratory examinations of the patients revealed isolated prolonged aPTT, normal PT, and the presence of autoantibodies against factor VIII, which are characteristics of AHA. Patients were then treated with corticosteroids to reduce the titer level of autoantibodies and received factor VIII transfusion to stop bleeding. Conclusion. AHA can be suspected in patients presenting with symptoms of bruises without hemarthrosis and without the history of bleeding. Isolated aPTT elevation with normal PT should raise high suspicion of AHA. The presence of FVIII inhibitors can help to confirm the diagnosis of AHA. Treatment consists of factor VIII transfusion and corticosteroid therapy. Bypassing agents are recommended as an alternative to FVIII transfusion.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

There are several fundamental differences between AHA and congenital factor VIII deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.

Second, the majority of AHA patients have cutaneous and intramuscular hemorrhage instead of hemarthrosis, which is commonly observed in congenital hemophilia A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>. Additionally, the symptoms of AHA also vary across patients, with some having mild symptoms and others having major bleeding, which complicates diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. Due to these differences and the lack of a past medical history of bleeding in many AHA patients, AHA is often not suspected or its diagnosis is difficult, which may delay the administration of treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7\\]</u>. Since the mortality rate of AHA is high, early diagnosis and management are important in reducing negative outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 7–9\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The incidence rate of AHA has been estimated at around 1.2–1.48 cases per million people every year, with a mortality rate of around 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–11\\]</u>. Additionally, the incidence of AHA increases with age, with the elderly population being highly predisposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 12, 13\\]</u>. Furthermore, AHA may be associated with pregnancy, autoimmune diseases, and cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3, 12, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we present case reports of AHA in three patients (a young female, middle-aged male, and elderly male) treated with either corticosteroids only or in combination with cyclophosphamide. By studying these cases and reviewing the recent guidelines, we humbly hope that this article may increase awareness and knowledge regarding the diagnosis and treatment of AHA.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentations\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【8】An 18-year-old female presented on 7 April 2019 with a chief complaint of bruises on both legs in the past 2 weeks, which were painless but becoming larger over time. The patient also complained of an unhealed abdominal surgical wound 1 month after surgery due to a ruptured cyst in the right ovary.\n\n【9】Two months prior, the patient suffered a fall and was taken to a traditional massage therapist. However, she complained of small bruises after receiving the massage. Furthermore, the bruises increased in size over time. She was then treated with tranexamic acid at a clinic, with only slight improvement. She admitted that bruising had occurred easily throughout the previous year; however, she never consulted a physician because the bruises were relatively small and healed spontaneously. The patient denied having any history of liver dysfunction, blood clotting disorder, allergy, or any chronic disease. Similarly, the patient’s mother also denied having any similar history of bleeding in the family.\n\n【10】On 7 April 2019, a physical examination of the patient was undertaken, showing stable vital signs and no other abnormalities. Laboratory investigation of blood taken on the same day revealed a normal complete blood count, normal PT of 10.7 s (normal value of 9.8–11.2 s), prolonged aPTT of 113.2 s (normal value of 31.0–47.0 s), elevated D-dimer of 610 μg/L (normal value of <440 μg/L), normal liver function, and normal kidney function. Additional laboratory results for factor VIII and factor IX levels were <1% (normal: 40–170%) and 63.5% (normal: 51–137%), respectively. Accordingly, factor VIII inhibitors were detected at 105.00 Bethesda units (BU) (normal: not detected). The patient was diagnosed with AHA on the basis of these clinical presentations and laboratory findings.\n\n【11】The next day, the patient underwent additional laboratory tests to exclude autoimmune diseases. These tests showed an ANA score of 1/320 with homogeneous patterns, while tests of anti-dsDNA, C3, and C4 were within normal limits. These results showed that autoimmune diseases were unlikely to be a precipitating factor of AHA.\n\n【12】The patient was treated with both tranexamic acid (3 × 1000 mg) and injection of human factor VIII (2000 IU) for 2 days (8-9 April 2019); however, there was no significant clinical improvement. On 9 April 2019, it was decided to treat the patient with methylprednisolone (3 × 16 mg; equivalent to a prednisone dose of 1 mg/kg/day for 1 month). After 1 month of follow-up, her clinical presentation and laboratory parameters showed improvements. The corticosteroid treatment was then continued. In the second month, the methylprednisolone dose was reduced to 2 × 16 mg. Subsequently, in the third month, it was tapered to 24 mg (16–0–8 mg). In the fourth month of treatment, bruising no longer occurred. The methylprednisolone therapy was nevertheless continued with a dose of 2 × 8 mg, which was reduced by 4 mg weekly until the patient achieved steroid-free status. No relapse in terms of bruises or bleeding was observed after 6 months without steroid. Timeline of events for case 1 is shown in Figure 1.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【14】Timeline of events and interventions for case 1.\n\n【15】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【16】A 52-year-old male presented on 4 August 2019 with a chief complaint of bruises on all four limbs for the previous 3 weeks. The bruises were accompanied by swelling. According to the patient, the bruises first spontaneously appeared on his left foot before and later also spreading to other limbs.\n\n【17】The medical history was unremarkable, with the patient denying any history of trauma, prior liver dysfunction, chronic diseases, medications use, and blood clotting disorder. Additionally, the patient also denied having any similar history of bleeding in the family. Laboratory examinations on 5 August 2019 showed a prolonged aPTT of 87.8 s, decreased factor VIII level of 1.33%, and presence of factor VIII inhibitor at 106.80 BU (normal: not detected). Hence, the patient was diagnosed with AHA on the basis of the clinical manifestations and laboratory results.\n\n【18】On 5 August 2019, the patient received human factor VIII injections (3 × 2000 IU for 1 day), which then continued with a dose of 2 × 2000 IU for 2 days. Other treatments received by the patient were 3 × 1000 mg of tranexamic acid and 500 cc of a packed red cells transfusion. Furthermore, the patient was given methylprednisolone (1 × 125 mg IV for 5 days), with the dose subsequently reduced to 1 × 62.5 mg IV for 4 days.\n\n【19】On 13 August 2019, a second evaluation of factor VIII inhibitor and factor VIII levels was carried out, which showed improvements: 26.24 BU (normal: not detected) and 3.8% (normal: 40–170%). Meanwhile, the bruises on all four limbs were still present but had faded when compared with before, indicating a clinical improvement. On 14 August 2019, the dose of methylprednisolone was reduced to 3 × 16 mg PO for 2 weeks with the plan to reduce the dose further to 8 mg per week for the next 2 weeks. On the same day, tranexamic acid therapy was halted based on the improvements in bruises. The patient was then discharged from the hospital on 14 August 2019 and scheduled for an outpatient visit.\n\n【20】However, on 15 August 2019, the patient was admitted to the emergency unit after he accidentally fell while walking. Wide bruises appeared around the buttocks and groin, accompanied by pain. His laboratory tests revealed 7.1 g/dL of Hb and an aPTT of 47.8 s (normal: 31.0–47.0 seconds). As a result, the patient received supporting treatments consisting of packed red cells transfusion and human factor VIII injections (2 × 2000 IU for 3 days). Subsequently, recombinant factor VIII was used instead of factor VIII injections (2 × 1500 IU for 3 days), with the dose subsequently reduced to 1 × 1500 IU for 10 days and then 1 × 1500 IU every 2 days until the patient was discharged. The patient was also given methylprednisolone (32–32–16 mg) during the first 3 weeks of treatment, before continuing with 32–32–8 mg during the last week. Throughout the treatment period, the patient was also examined several times to exclude the possibility of having an autoimmune disease and cancer. The results for ANA and anti-dsDNA were negative. Furthermore, C3 and C4 were within normal limits.\n\n【21】On 12 September 2019, there were significant improvements in clinical and coagulation parameters, with an aPTT of 31.5 s, factor VIII level of 33.2%, and an undetectable level of the factor VIII inhibitor. The patient was eventually discharged on 14 September 2019 and prescribed oral methylprednisolone (32–0–32 mg daily). The patient was advised to check his aPTT level every month, as well as factor VIII and factor VIII inhibitor levels 3 months later (January 2020), which were 8.1% and 3.16 BU, respectively. On the basis of these laboratory results, administration of cyclophosphamide tablets (2 mg/kg/day for 3 months) was considered according to a dose of 2 × 100 mg based on bodyweight of 96 kg. After the first 3 weeks of cyclophosphamide administration, factor VIII levels increased to 13.5%, whereas the inhibitor level was undetectable. Timeline of events for case 2 is shown in Figure 2.\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【23】Timeline of events and interventions for case 2.\n\n【24】##### 2.3. Case 3\n\n【25】An 87-year-old male patient was admitted on 3 January 2019 for swelling and painless bruising in his left hand for the past month. The patient denied any history of trauma, prior liver dysfunction, or blood clotting disorder. Furthermore, the patient also denied having any similar history of bleeding in the family. The patient had comorbidities of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage IIIB and prior cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n【26】One month prior to his admission, the patient had already been clinically diagnosed with AHA based on his clinical manifestations and laboratory findings (aPTT of 84.7 s) at a hospital in a different province. At that time, the patient was hospitalized and received a fresh frozen plasma transfusion, packed red cells PRC transfusion, and mycophenolate mofetil. The patient was then referred to a tertiary hospital for further evaluation.\n\n【27】A physical examination revealed the patient’s blood pressure to be 159/90 mmHg, while other vital signs were stable. The initial complete blood count after a laboratory examination highlighted a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC) count of 7.200/μL, and platelet count of 305.000/μL. The coagulation results showed an aPTT of 81.8 s (normal: 31.0–47.0 s). Further laboratory results showed a blood urea level of 107.9 mg/dL and serum creatinine level of 2 mg/dL.\n\n【28】Considering his clinical manifestation and prolonged aPTT, the patient was evaluated for factor VIII, factor IX, and factor VIII inhibitors, which were measured as <1% (normal: 40–170%), 109.5% (normal: 51–137%), and 10.56 BU (normal: undetected), respectively. Hence, the patient was diagnosed with AHA and chronic kidney disease.\n\n【29】The patient was orally administered methylprednisolone (3 × 16 mg) on 4 January 2019, before reducing the dose to 2 × 32 mg the next day and 2 × 16 mg on 14 January 2019. The patient also received human factor VIII injections (2 × 1000 IU starting on 4 January 2019 for 11 days) and cyclophosphamide (1 × 50 mg). On 14 January 2019, the factor VIII inhibitor level was reduced to 1.76 BU, and the aPTT was reduced to 43.2 s. On 29 January, the patient had no complaints; thus, he was discharged and prescribed methylprednisolone (2 × 16 mg) for 2 months. On the day of discharge, the patient’s aPTT was normal at 39.5 s (normal range: 31.0–47.0 s). Timeline of events for case 3 is shown in Figure 3.\n\n【30】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【31】Timeline of events and interventions for case 3.\n\n【32】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【33】##### 3.1. Diagnosis\n\n【34】The proper diagnosis of AHA is very important due to the associated mortality that results from severe bleeding. However, diagnosis is very challenging due to the rarity of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 7, 9\\]</u>. Another complicating factor is that AHA patients often have no history of bleeding or anticoagulant use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>. Furthermore, in contrast to hemarthroses which is common in congenital hemophilia A, bleeding in AHA predominantly occurs from the skin, muscles, and mucous membranes, making the symptoms nonspecific at best and confusing at worst 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 7, 14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Well-written clinical guidelines presented by Tiede et al. Kruse-Jarres et al. and Shetty et al. identified the first diagnostic pathway for suspected AHA as aPTT measurement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 17\\]</u>. The reason for this is that in AHA, there is often an isolated prolonged APTT without other abnormalities in coagulation, such as a prolonged PT or abnormal platelet count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 16, 17\\]</u>. However, an isolated prolonged aPTT can also be caused by deficiencies in other coagulation factors, such as FIX, FXI, and FXII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Hence, additional diagnostic modalities are recommended to properly diagnose AHA.\n\n【36】An aPTT mixing test is helpful in differentiating causes of isolated prolonged aPTT. In a mixing test, the patient’s plasma is mixed with an equivalent volume of normal plasma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. If a coagulation factor inhibitor is present, such as in AHA, the mixed plasma will still result in a prolonged aPTT due to the inhibition of coagulation factors. On the other hand, in a patient with only a coagulation factor deficiency (FVIII, FIX, FXI, and FXII), the mixing test would normalize the coagulation factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 16, 18\\]</u>.\n\n【37】The guidelines presented by Tiede et al. and Shetty et al. recommend conducting a mixing test after the aPTT test. By contrast, the guidelines by Kruse-Jarres et al. recommend that a FVIII activity concentration test be carried out in place of the mixing test (and after the aPTT test), which is only necessary if the FVIII test is unavailable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 17\\]</u>. Both Tiede et al. and Shetty et al. also recommended a FVIII test, but only after the mixing test is conducted. We agree with recommendation of Kruse-Jarres et al. that a mixing test may not be needed and can be skipped if an AHA diagnosis can already be confirmed by the low FVIII activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Another argument against the use of the mixing test is its lack of adequate standardization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【38】The measurement of the FVIII activity after aPTT test or mixing test is important as it can differentiate between the presence of AHA or lupus anticoagulants. A normal FVIII activity (≥50%) is highly indicative of lupus anticoagulants or other inhibitors such as FIX and FXI inhibitors, whereas a reduced FVIII activity level (<50%) instead indicates AHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16\\]</u>. The presence of lupus anticoagulants can be excluded using the dilute Russell’s viper venom time (dRVVT) assay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The final step of AHA diagnosis is a Bethesda assay to detect and measure FVIII autoantibodies in Bethesda units (BU) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【39】##### 3.2. Role of Hemostatic Agents\n\n【40】There are three focused objectives in AHA therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 12, 15\\]</u>. The first objective is to control and prevent further bleeding, if present, to maintain the patient’s vitals. The second objective is to eradicate factor VIII inhibitors in order to achieve complete remission. The third objective is to treat the underlying cause of the disease, if there is any.\n\n【41】For the first objective of bleeding control, hemostatic agents may be used. Currently, there are two types of hemostatic agents applied in AHA treatment: FVIII replacement therapy and bypassing agent (BPA) therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 12, 15, 21\\]</u>. Human FVIII (hFVIII) replacement therapy has been a mainstay treatment for congenital hemophilia A. However, hFVIII is not effective in the presence of high anti-FVIII inhibitor titers, which may quickly neutralize the transfused hFVIII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Nevertheless, when the antibody titer is <5 BU or BPA is not available, hFVIII replacement therapy can still be used as a first-line treatment, although the dose required is often high and the response may be unpredictable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 7\\]</u>. Indeed, a recent guideline by the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) in year 2020 also supported the use of FVIII replacement therapy for AHA patients with low-responding inhibitors (antibody titer < 5 BU) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【42】The issue of hFVIII inhibition such as in AHA patients with high antibody titer can be solved by using recombinant porcine-derived FVIII (rpFVIII), which should not be neutralized by the autoantibodies theoretically 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. However, there have been several observations in the literature of some AHA patients having inhibitors which cross-react with rpFVIII, resulting in a lack of or reduction in response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24–26\\]</u>. On the other hand, some patients may develop antiporcine FVIII antibody during therapy of rpFVIII 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. The recommended dose of rpFVIII is 50–100 U/kg for patients with no detected antiporcine FVIII inhibitor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. If there is a detectable antiporcine FVIII inhibitor, the dose should be increased to 200 U/kg for severe bleeding; however, the dose remains 50–100 U/kg for less severe bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Several literatures have recommended BPAs, which activate blood clotting without a need for factor VIII, instead of using recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) or plasma-derived activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) to control bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16, 17, 27–29\\]</u>. Physiologically, FVIII activates FX in the coagulation cascade pathway. However, FX can also be activated both directly and indirectly by rFVIIa through tissue FVIIa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Hence, a BPA such as rFVIIa can “bypass” the normal coagulation activation from FVIII, which is blocked by FVIII inhibitory antibodies. In the EACH2 study, rFVIIa and aPCC showed no significant difference in bleeding outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. However, it should be noted that there is a potential for rare thrombosis side effects from the use of BPAs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 17, 31, 32\\]</u>. The recommended dosage of aPCC is 50–100 U/kg every 8−12 h, whereas that for rFVIIa is 90 μg/kg every 2-3 h 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Generally, all AHA patients with bleeding should be administered hemostatic treatment. The choice of treatment depends mainly on treatment availability. BPAs should be chosen over replacement therapy if possible due to the advantage provided 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 16, 17\\]</u>. The main limitations of BPAs are their expensive cost and lack of availability in several countries, where they are, thus, not the main treatment of choice, such as in Indonesia and other developing countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. In these countries, factor VIII transfusion, therefore, remains the treatment of choice. A summary of the hemostatic therapies found in the literature is presented in Table 1.\n\n【45】Table 1 \n\n【46】Summary of hemostatic therapies found in the literature.\n\n【47】##### 3.3. Role of Tranexamic Acid and Desmopressin\n\n【48】Other hemostatic approaches, e.g. a combination of tranexamic acid with aPCC or rFVIIa, can help in maintaining clot stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 33–35\\]</u>. A study by Hvas et al. showed that a dose of 10 mg/kg is sufficient to achieve these effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>.\n\n【49】Desmopressin which works by increasing FVIII plasma concentrations transiently through FVIII secretion from endothelial cells should only be used for mild bleeding and low titer inhibitors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 36, 37\\]</u>.\n\n【50】##### 3.4. Role of Immunosuppressive Therapies\n\n【51】The elimination of factor VIII inhibitors can prevent future bleeding in AHA patients. The eradication of inhibitors using immunosuppressive therapy is recommended for all adults with AHA, despite some articles reporting that the presence of inhibitors can be spontaneously resolved to undetected levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. The consideration of this recommendation is based on the substantial mortality rate, morbidity rate, and cost of hemostatic treatment of acute bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, due to risk of infections from immunosuppressive therapies which may cause mortality, extreme caution should be exercised 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【52】There are currently three recommended immunosuppressive treatments: corticosteroid alone, corticosteroid combined with cyclophosphamide, or corticosteroid combined with rituximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6, 16\\]</u>. The corticosteroid dose can either be 1 mg/kg prednisone daily or 40 mg dexamethasone daily for 3-4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16\\]</u>. The cyclophosphamide dose should be 1-2 mg/kg, whereas that for rituximab should be 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> IV weekly for 4 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. A summary of inhibitor eradication therapies found in the literature is presented in Table 2.\n\n【53】Table 2 \n\n【54】Summary of recommended inhibitor eradication therapies found in the literature.\n\n【55】About 60–80% of patients achieved complete remission after a median of 5-6 weeks on immunosuppressive therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Whether the administration of a corticosteroid combined with cyclophosphamide produces a better response than corticosteroid alone is still unclear. One study showed no statistically significant difference in median time to remission between both groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In contrast, the EACH2 study showed faster remission in patients receiving combination of steroids and cyclophosphamide when compared with steroids only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Furthermore, a meta-analysis by Delgado et al. showed that the cyclophosphamide, with or without corticosteroids, was associated with better complete remission than corticosteroids only 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.\n\n【56】For rituximab, it is not shown to be superior than corticosteroids or cyclophosphamide in the EACH2 study; however, rituximab use was associated with longer time to remission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Currently, many guidelines recommend rituximab as second-line therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 16, 17, 28\\]</u>.\n\n【57】According to a prognostic study by Tiede et al. a low FVIII activity (<1 IU/dL) and >20 BU inhibitor titer were associated with a lower partial remission rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Furthermore, factors such as age, gender, and underlying disorder did not affect the partial remission rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. The same study also observed that low FVIII activity (<1 IU/dL), >20 BU inhibitor titer, and age >74 years were predictors of poor overall survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. Hence, it is recommended that corticosteroids be combined with rituximab or a cytotoxic agent such as cyclophosphamide as first-line therapy in patients with low FVIII activity and >20 BU inhibitor titer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【58】##### 3.5. Role of Intravenous Immunoglobulin\n\n【59】The role of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a first-line therapy exhibits no benefits, as shown by Delgado et al. in a review and meta-analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. Subsequent evidence also does not support the use of intravenous immunoglobulin for inhibitor eradication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 38\\]</u>. For example, the EACH2 study showed no significant improvement from adding IVIG to immunosuppressive therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Hence, IVIG is not recommended over other immunosuppressive therapies previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 16, 17\\]</u>.\n\n【60】##### 3.6. Lessons Learned\n\n【61】The first case report we presented demonstrates that AHA can occur in young females unrelated to pregnancy or autoimmune disease. A lack of pregnancy, therefore, does not necessarily exclude AHA diagnosis. Furthermore, we also reported two cases of idiopathic AHA. According to the cases above, an isolated subcutaneous hematoma without any bleeding history or other risk factors should warrant suspicion of AHA. Patients suspected of AHA should be screened for potential causes of AHA such as malignant diseases and autoimmune diseases.\n\n【62】Although it has been shown that the bleeding symptoms in AHA are usually severe, physicians should also be aware that mild bleeding can also occur in AHA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 16, 41\\]</u>. A thorough laboratory examination must be performed to establish the diagnosis of AHA. Important laboratory examinations for AHA include the aPTT, mixing test, FVIII activity level, and FVIII inhibitor level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 12, 16\\]</u>. However, considering the presented cases, we argue that the mixing test may not be needed if an FVIII concentration test is available. Additional examinations for differential diagnoses, such as of lupus anticoagulants and VWF, may not be required in cases of low FVIII levels if there is a positive result in the Bethesda assay.\n\n【63】The treatment of AHA consists of hemostatic management and immunosuppressive therapy. The former constitutes BPAs as the first-line therapy, with FVIII replacement therapy used if BPA is not available. The latter is indicated as a combination therapy when high FVIII inhibitor titers and low FVIII levels are detected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【64】These cases also demonstrate the poor correlation of FVIII inhibitor levels with bleeding severity. Therefore, physicians should make treatment decisions based not only on FVIII inhibitor levels but also the severity of bleeding symptoms.\n\n【65】##### 3.7. Strengths and Limitations\n\n【66】The limitation of this case report is the lack of complete and uniform laboratory examinations in all patients. Additionally, the diagnostic and treatment pathways that followed differed from those in the recommended guidelines; however, due to these differences, the case reports offer new perspectives that can be beneficial for clinical practice, especially in developing countries where resources are limited, since all patients achieved clinical recoveries. Last, the follow-up of some patients after treatment was not long enough.\n\n【67】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【68】AHA is a rare hematologic disorder where factor VIII becomes inactive due to autoantibody formation. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. As it tends to occur in patients with an unknown history of bleeding disorders, early diagnosis is often difficult. Diagnosis of AHA is determined on the basis of the detection of low factor VIII levels in the presence of factor VIII inhibitors. The principles of AHA therapy involve controlling and preventing further bleeding, eradicating factor VIII inhibitors, and treating the underlying cause of the disease.\n\n【69】#### Data Availability\n\n【70】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【71】#### Consent\n\n【72】Written informed consent was not required by institutional ethical committee due to the patients being sufficiently anonymized.\n\n【73】#### Disclosure\n\n【74】The first case study in this manuscript was presented as part of an abstract and poster presentation entitled “Practical Diagnosis and Management of Acquired Hemophilia A: Case Report” at “The Sixth National Congress of Indonesian Hemophilia Society” in Indonesia on 27-28 February 2021.

In the case of delayed facial palsy, the alarming symptom occurs several days or even weeks after uneventful surgery. The mechanism of the neural dysfunction is not readily defined. Surgical stress, intraoperative trauma, or laceration of the chorda tympani nerve with a resultant retrograde facial nerve edema can all be provoking etiological factors. A dehiscent bony facial canal or a multiple microporotic fallopian canal (microtrauma or laser effect) can also contribute to the development of this rare phenomenon. The most popular theory related to the explanation of delayed facial palsy at present is the reactivation of dormant viruses. Both the thermal effect of the laser and the elevation of the tympanomeatal flap can reactivate viruses resting inside the ganglion geniculi, facial nerve, or facial nuclei. The authors report the case histories of a 55-year-old female, and a 45-year-old male who presented with a delayed facial palsy following laser stapedotomy. The clinical characteristics, the therapeutic options, and the possibility of prevention are discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Delayed facial palsy occurring some days or weeks following uneventful stapedectomy or stapedotomy is a rare symptom with a favorable prognosis. The phenomenon was first described in 1973 by Althaus and House 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, who observed 5 cases (0.2%) among 2307 stapedectomy cases in their department. Overall, fewer than 40 cases have been reported in the literature. Shea performed 14,449 stapedectomies during four decades of ear surgery and encountered delayed facial paralysis in 11 cases (0.07%) within that period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Ng and Maceri reported the first 2 cases in the literature following laser stapedotomy in 1999 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Facial nerve palsy may occur either immediately or after some delay following stapes surgery. Immediate palsy may be due to local anesthetics and may regress within a few hours. Intraoperative severe surgical trauma or transection of the facial nerve can also cause complete facial paralysis immediately. Bonkowsky et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> observed delayed facial palsy that developed only 48–72 days after surgery, whereas in other literature reports the paralysis began even 5–16 days postoperatively, with complete recovery being achieved within 11–70 days in the vast majority of the cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>.\n\n【5】To date, out of 149 surgeries, 2 cases (0,01%) of delayed facial paralysis have occurred among the KTP laser stapedotomies performed at our department since 2006. Both patients recovered fully. The clinical characteristics, the therapeutic options, and the possibility of prevention are discussed below.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report 1\n\n【7】A 52-year-old female presented at our department with a bilateral progressive hearing loss in January 2010. Microotoscopic examination showed a normal eardrum and tympanic cavity, and audiometry revealed a conductive hearing loss on both sides; on the right, the average air-bone gap (ABG) was a mean of 34 dB on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz, while on the left side the mean ABG was 32 dB. The Carhart notch was present on both sides, and the mean bone conduction threshold was 5 dB on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz. The stapedial reflex was absent on both sides, while the multiple-frequency tympanogram indicated a resonance frequency of 1000 Hz on the left and of 1100 Hz resonance on the right side.\n\n【8】Explorative tympanotomy performed because of the suspicion of stapes fixation revealed that the stapes were indeed fixed. KTP laser stapedotomy was carried out on the left side as described earlier 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, whereby the stapes superstructure was removed, and a self-crimping heat memory Nitinol piston was implanted to reconstruct the ossicular chain. The postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 3 following surgery. On postoperative day 8, the patient developed parageusia and pain around the right ear after awakening. House-Brackmann grade II facial palsy later developed on the operated side . No signs of either acute external otitis or acute otitis media were detected, and the blood tests demonstrated normal parameters. Following admission, the patient received 60 mg of methylprednisolone daily (Medrol, Pfizer), which was gradually tapered off in 3 weeks. Acyclovir (Zovirax, Sanofi Aventis) was administered orally for 2 weeks.\n\n【9】(a)\n\n【10】(b)\n\n【11】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【13】Eight days following stapedotomy, House-Brackmann grade II facial palsy is observed on the right side: teeth showing (a) and lip rounding (b).\n\n【14】The patient gradually recovered, the facial nerve function improved, and the ear pain and the parageusia had regressed by postoperative day 36 . The audiometric evaluation revealed an ABG < 10 dB on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz, while the mean bone conduction threshold had improved by 5 dB relative to the preoperative results.\n\n【15】(a)\n\n【16】(b)\n\n【17】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【19】Thirty-six days following stapes surgery: the facial nerve function is intact, teeth showing (a) and lip rounding (b).\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Case Report 2\n\n【21】A 45-year-old male developed a progressive bilateral hearing loss in January 2011. His ability to understand speech understanding gradually deteriorated. Examinations in April 2011 suggested stapes fixation, but he refused explorative tympanotomy. At the following visit during the summer of 2013, the microotoscopic examination indicated a normal eardrum on both sides. Audiometry revealed a mixed hearing loss bilaterally; on the right side, the bone conduction threshold was a mean of 20 dB, and the air conduction threshold was a mean of 55 dB (35 dB ABG) on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz, while on the left side the bone conduction threshold was a mean of 25 dB and the air conduction threshold was a mean of 45 dB (20 dB ABG). The Carhart notch was present on both sides (2 kHz). The stapedial reflex was absent bilaterally, while the multiple-frequency tympanogram revealed a resonance frequency of 1250 Hz on the left and of 1750 Hz on the right side.\n\n【22】In September 2013, the patient underwent an uneventful KTP laser stapedotomy on the right side, while the ossicular chain was reconstructed with a self-crimping heat memory NiTiBOND piston. On postoperative day 13, he suffered House-Brackmann grade III facial palsy on the right side while shaving . The symptom was accompanied by a slight pain in the right ear. No signs of either acute external otitis or acute otitis media were detected, and the blood tests showed normal parameters. By postoperative day 42, the patient had recovered completely  following Medrol and Acyclovir therapy administered in the same manner as described in case 1, and the audiometric evaluation revealed a mean of 5 dB ABG on 0.5-1-2-3 kHz, while the mean bone conduction threshold had improved by 5 dB.\n\n【23】(a)\n\n【24】(b)\n\n【25】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【27】Thirteen days following stapedotomy, House-Brackmann grade III facial palsy is observed on the right side: teeth showing (a) and lip rounding (b).\n\n【28】(a)\n\n【29】(b)\n\n【30】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【32】Forty-two days following stapes surgery, the facial nerve function is intact: teeth showing (a) and lip rounding (b).\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【34】Delayed facial palsy occurring a few days or weeks following uneventful stapes surgery is an alarming symptom but generally with a favorable prognosis. There is some disagreement among authors as to the explanation of this phenomenon.\n\n【35】Zohar and Laurian hypothesized that such a Bell palsy-like condition may be provoked by surgical stress, assuming that this was reinforced by the fact that patients presenting with facial palsy generally exhibited trigeminal sensory deficits on the same side 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Surgical trauma to a dehiscent facial canal in the tympanic cavity may also lead to edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> and consequential paralysis of the facial nerve. Paulsen presented a case where reexploration was indicated due to facial nerve palsy that developed within 24 hours postoperatively; extensive edema in a dehiscent facial canal was reported to have dislocated the implanted prosthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Kaplan observed that microscopic dehiscence may occur in the medial part of the facial canal near the oval window, while the bony coverage of the canal is apparently intact. During surgery, tearing of the chorda tympani may lead to retrograde edema, and the heat effect of the laser can additionally provoke edema formation according to the macroscopic dehiscences in cases of laser-assisted stapes surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the past decade however the experience of Gerlinger et al. was somewhat different: they often found that the facial nerve was dehiscent, or laser vaporization of a cholesteatoma sac was requisite near the oval window 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【37】In the event of a dehiscent nerve canal, immediate facial palsy is indicative of neurotmesis or axonotmesis following either laser-assisted operations or cold technical manipulations. The favorable prognosis of delayed palsies has demonstrated the presence of neurapraxia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Recent publications suggest that the most reasonable explanation for delayed palsy is the reactivation of dormant viral infections (varicella zoster, herpes simplex 1-2, or Epstein-Barr). Herpes zoster or herpes simplex virus can undergo reactivation for either local or systemic reasons 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This explanation seems to be confirmed by the occasional occurrence of facial nerve palsy following acoustic neuroma operations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Surgical stress may provoke herpes simplex reactivation in dermatomes remote from the surgical site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Spine surgeons have reported the reactivation of herpes virus in the surrounding dermatomes following surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Viral reactivation may also follow local trauma of the skin branches of the facial nerve subsequent to the elevation of the tympanomeatal flap in any type of ear surgery (tympanoplasty, meatoplasty, etc.). Shea Jr. and Ge reported elevated virus-specific anti-IgG and IgM levels in a patient with delayed facial nerve palsy following stapedectomy, which appears to support the virus theory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Sugita et al. recentlyidentified herpes simplex virus particles in the geniculate ganglion, the facial nerve, and the nuclei of the facial nerve in a novel mouse model 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Facial nerve palsy was caused by the inoculation of these viruses through either the posterior part of the auricle or the anterior third of the tongue of the mice via the sensory branches of the facial nerve 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【39】Gadolinium-contrast MRI demonstrated significantly higher enhancement in the distal part of the internal ear canal, the labyrinth, the tympanic part and the geniculate ganglion in patients with Bell’s palsy, as compared with the control group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>. Cohen et al. reported corresponding contrast-enhanced MRI results in 2 patients with delayed facial nerve palsy following stapes surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Our cases occurred after laser-assisted stapedotomy. Fewer than 40 reports can be found that involve conventional or laser-assisted stapes surgery. The facial nerve canal in patients was apparently intact, and the surgical technique was standard. The laser equipment settings were as usual 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The history of the patients did not reveal frequent herpes infections. The lesson learned from our cases is that, besides an appropriate knowledge of laser physics, it is indispensable to apply cooling intraoperatively and to prefer cold instrumentation where a laser is not necessary (e.g. cutting the stapedial tendon). It appears essential to take into account the effect of scattering from the bare bony surface during laser vaporization and coagulation which may result in undesired heating of the facial nerve canal.\n\n【41】Despite the generally favorable prognosis of such cases, we do not rule out the administration of steroid and antiviral medication in the light of the theory of virus reactivation as the explanation of delayed facial nerve palsy. The need for surgical decompression of the facial nerve almost never arises. In cases of complete facial nerve palsy, repeated electroneurography should be considered. Contrast-enhanced MRI is recommended.\n\n【42】The question remains open as to whether or not to administer antiviral treatment preoperatively to a patient with a history of frequent herpes infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【43】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【44】通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>Delayed facial palsy may occur several days or weeks following uneventful stapedectomy, stapedotomy, or tympanoplasty. The prognosis is favorable in almost all cases.通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>Present knowledge suggests that the most reasonable etiology is viral reactivation (herpes zoster, herpes simplex, or Epstein-Barr).通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>In the event of a delayed palsy, acute infection must be ruled out.通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>Gadolinium-contrast MRI is recommended (to confirm tumor formation and higher enhancement in the fundus of the internal ear canal, the labyrinth, and the tympanic part).通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u>The lowest possible energy density should be applied, the use of high output should be avoided, and the heat energy generated during laser stapedotomy should be as low as possible.通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u>A defocused laser beam may scatter from the bare bony surface and may reach the occasionally osteoporotic facial canal.通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>Gelfoam saturated with cold saline may be beneficial if applied to the facial canal, the round, and the oval window (heat absorption and minimal scattering).通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u>The administration of antiviral medication and steroid may be advantageous following the development of delayed facial palsy.通用删除7(英):<u>(9)</u>Prophylactic antiviral treatment may be considered preoperatively if the patient presents with a history of frequent herpes simplex infections.\n\n【45】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【46】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no funding, financial relationships, or conflicts of interest to disclose.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Currently, there are few reports describing the use of reconstructive techniques in the treatment of cesarean scar endometriosis (CSE). Here, we report a case of CSE, a rare form of endometriosis caused by scars from obstetric and gynecological surgeries. Case Report. A 50-year-old woman became aware of a painful, deep scar mass in her lower abdomen during her menstrual period 10 years after her second cesarean section. This was diagnosed as CSE after the biopsy. Under general anesthesia, the mass, a portion of the rectus abdominis, and a 1 cm tumor-free margin were resected as a whole, and the abdominal wall was reconstructed with a soft artificial mesh. Results. No obvious recurrence or subjective symptoms were observed postoperatively or reported in the 1-year follow-up period. Discussion. Endometriosis appearing in a cesarean scar is rare; it is chiefly triggered by intraoperative mechanical implantation. In cases of surgical scar masses with a history of gynecological surgery and associated menstrual symptoms, this syndrome should be considered during diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Endometriosis is a benign gynecological disease characterized by the ectopic presence of active endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis occurs most commonly in the abdominal cavity, mainly in the ovaries, peritoneum, uterine ligament, and rectovaginal septum. Among cases of endometriosis occurring in the abdominal wall, those occurring in postcesarean scars are relatively rare, estimated to account for approximately 0.08% of all cases of endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, the incidence of this disease is estimated to be on the rise owing to the increase in cesarean sections worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Although many studies have described the treatment methods (including surgical resection and pharmacotherapy) and outcomes of endometriosis in postcesarean scars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>, only a few reports describe the use of reconstructive techniques such as abdominal wall plasty and the flap technique, to prevent recurrence and herniation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. We report a case of endometriosis in a cesarean section scar that required partial abdominal wall reconstruction.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 50-year-old woman presented with a painful lower abdominal mass that appeared during her menstrual cycle 10 years after her second cesarean section. The patient had a history of two cesarean sections, and no history of drinking, smoking, or taking medication. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed at the first hospital suggested a desmoid tumor; therefore, she was placed under observation. However, the size of the mass increased, and her subjective symptoms worsened; consequently, she visited the gynecology department at our hospital. The high levels of CA19-9 (152.21 U/mL) and CA125 (48.0 U/mL) in a blood test, in addition to her symptoms, led to the suspicion of endometriosis. We performed an excisional biopsy, which confirmed the diagnosis of endometriosis. Hormone therapy using oral luteinizing hormone was commenced but discontinued because of nausea. Surgery was planned for a radical cure. At the time of the visit, a mature scar with a transverse incision was found in the lower abdomen, and a golf ball-sized hard mass was palpable under the scar. The mass was partially adherent to the overlying skin and firmly adherent to the underlying rectus abdominis, and there was no skin redness or heat . MRI showed a substantial mass in the lower portion of the rectus abdominis, with slightly irregular borders and hypointensity on T1WI and T2WI . Surgery was performed under general anesthesia. After a skin incision along the scar tissue, a mass adherent to the anterior sheath of the rectus abdominis and partially infiltrating the muscle was identified. This mass was resected together with the rectus abdominis as a single mass, including a 1 cm margin. In addition, the posterior sheath of the rectus abdominis was partially resected, and the abdominal wall was reconstructed by implanting a soft artificial mesh .\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【7】Findings on initial examination.

The patient was satisfied with the results of the surgery and did not report any apparent recurrence or complications, such as hematoma, infection, or hernia, during the 1-year follow-up period.\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【23】Pathologic observations.

Discussion\n\n【25】Scar endometriosis is rarely reported in the gynecological literature and occurs in patients who have previously undergone obstetric and gynecological surgeries such as cesarean section, hysterectomy, perineal incision, and tubal ligation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. Previous reports reviewed cases of CSE diagnosed from 1951 to 2006 and showed that the incidence of CSE was 0.08% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>; however, a recent (2003 to 2010) study estimated the incidence to be about 2% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. This indicates that the incidence of CSE is increasing. In addition to pain and cosmetic problems, malignant transformation to clear cell carcinoma occurs in 1% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>; therefore, it is important for patients to be diagnosed and treated.\n\n【26】Although many theories have been postulated as to the cause of CSE, the most accepted theory is direct iatrogenic implantation of the endometrium into the wound margin during abdominal or pelvic surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Only approximately 20% of all patients with CSE show classic endometriosis symptoms of menstrual pain and accompanying changes in tumor size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. More often, patients complain of the presence of a mass (96%) and tenderness on palpation (87%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Differential diagnoses for these symptoms include fibromas, lipomas, suture granulomas, hernias, hematomas, lymphomas, desmoid tumors, and sarcomas. Various imaging modalities such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, and MRI are nonspecific but can help determine the extent of the disease and assist in planning for surgical resection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. While needle biopsies are useful for definitive diagnosis, it should be noted that they may result in the implantation of new endometrial tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Appropriate surgical treatment offers the best opportunity to make a definitive diagnosis and treat CSE. Resection should include a tumor-free margin of at least 1 cm around the solid tissue 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In addition, endometriosis infiltrating the muscles of the abdominal wall requires en bloc resection of the underlying musculature and fascia. In our patient, the abdominal wall was reconstructed with an artificial mesh to restore the integrity of the abdominal wall and prevent postoperative hernia formation. Our report, in which the patient progressed without postoperative complications or recurrence, supports several previous reports that claim that appropriate resection of CSE and reconstruction with artificial mesh is useful 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6, 7\\]</u>. Although the use of artificial mesh for abdominal wall repair can lead to complicated wound infections and risk of mesh erosion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, it is often chosen as it is associated with a shorter surgical time and more stable results than skin and muscle flap surgery, which is more invasive.\n\n【29】Hormonal treatments such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, danazol, and progesterone have been used and provide only temporary relief, and symptoms often recur with discontinuation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. However, preoperative hormone therapy has been reported to be effective in reducing the size of the mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>, and its use may be considered for future resection.\n\n【30】Our case demonstrates that accurate diagnosis of CSE, complete resection, and reconstruction with artificial mesh, can lead to good treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction. However, the long-term postoperative results cannot be determined at this time and require careful follow-up in the future.\n\n【31】Given the rarity of CSE, its diagnosis may be delayed, leading to frustration for both patients and physicians. CSE should be a differential considered by all surgeons. Proper mass resection and reconstruction of the abdominal wall where necessary are important for complete diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【32】#### Data Availability\n\n【33】Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.\n\n【34】#### Consent\n\n【35】The patient has given her permission for the publication of this report and the accompanying images.

The diagnostic features of the disease are characteristic, but the clinical presentation and patterns of destructions may vary between patients. Successful management of the disease is challenging especially if diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, but not impossible with the current therapeutic choices for the disease. A vast array of treatment modalities is available which can be employed in the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis with varying success rates, but a definite guideline for the management is yet to be formulated. However, with the exponential rate of developments in periodontal research, regenerative therapy, tissue engineering, and genetic technologies, the future seems promising in regard to options at managing the disease. This paper attempts to describe the clinical and radiographic diagnostic features and the current treatment options along with a suggested protocol for comprehensive management of generalized aggressive periodontitis patients with case reports and a brief review.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Aggressive periodontitis, as the name implies is a type of periodontitis where there is rapid destruction of periodontal ligament and alveolar bone which occurs in otherwise systemically healthy individuals generally of a younger age group but patients may be older 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Although its prevalence has been reported to be much less than that of chronic periodontitis, it can result in early tooth loss in the affected individuals if not diagnosed in the early stages and treated appropriately 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The disease is generally found to have a racial and sex predilection, with blacks and male teenagers having higher risk for the disease compared to whites and females, although reports vary between different ethnic groups and populations, with some populations showing prevalence as high as 28.8% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Aggressive periodontitis, first described in 1923 as “diffuse atrophy of the alveolar bone” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, has undergone a series of terminology changes over the years to be finally named as “aggressive periodontitis” in 1999 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. The disease which includes both localized and generalized forms was previously known as “early onset periodontitis” which included the three categories of periodontitis—prepubertal, juvenile, and rapidly progressing periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. It is interesting that the first ever reported detailed description of a recognized disease in early hominid evolution is a case of prepubertal periodontitis in an 2.5–3-million-year-old fossil remains of a juvenile Australopithecus africanus specimen which showed the typical pattern of alveolar bone destruction with migration of the affected deciduous molars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) is characterized by “generalized interproximal attachment loss affecting at least 3 permanent teeth other than first molars and incisors” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is a multifactorial disease where interplay of microbiologic, genetic, immunologic, and environmental/behavioral risk factors decides the onset, course, and severity. Pathogenic bacteria in the dental plaque especially Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u> have an indispensable role which elicits an aggravated host response which in turn is determined by the genetic and immunologic profile of the patient modified by environmental risk factors like smoking.\n\n【6】This paper attempts to describe the diagnostic features along with the periodontal management options of generalized aggressive periodontitis with the help of case reports with different clinical presentation and patterns of involvement and managed with different treatment modalities available. Finally an attempt to summarize the available protocol for a comprehensive management of GAgP is done which can serve as a guideline till more definite clear-cut guidelines are established for the disease in the future.\n\n【7】#### 2\\. Clinical Features\n\n【8】The most common reported complaints are a recently noticed flaring and progressing spacing of anterior teeth and bleeding from gums comparatively in a young patient but patients can be older as well (Figures 1(a)–1(c)).\n\n【9】(a)\n\n【10】(b)\n\n【11】(c)\n\n【12】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| (a) Patient presenting with flaring of the anterior teeth. (b) and (c) Deep pockets revealed by probing in a periodontium with lack of clinical inflammation. |\n| --- |\n\n【15】Patients may complain of halitosis and pus discharge from gums. Mobility of the affected teeth will be seen towards the later stages of the infection. Patients will be otherwise systemically healthy. Severe pain is rarely experienced by the patients except in situations where a periodontal abscess develops or a periodontal-endodontic infection occurs via accessory canals or tooth apex. Some patients may complain of a dull nagging type of pain from gums. Gingival recession may be seen and patients may complain of food impaction due to loss of contact points between teeth.\n\n【16】GAgP patients who smoke and/or maintain a poor oral hygiene demonstrate more severe destruction of periodontium compared to those who do not smoke or maintain a satisfactory oral hygiene (Figures 2(a)–2(e)).\n\n【17】(a)\n\n【18】(b)\n\n【19】(c)\n\n【20】(d)\n\n【21】(e)\n\n【22】(a) (b) (c) (d)   \n(e)\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| (a)–(d) Clinical and radiographic appearance of GAgP in a 25-year-old smoker with poor oral hygiene. (e) A 19-year-old smoker with GAgP demonstrating severe periodontal destruction. |\n| --- |\n\n【25】The disease progresses in alternating periods of activity and quiescence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. This leads to two types of presentation at the time of examination. In the periods of quiescence, patients are free of symptoms and the gingiva appears pink and healthy even though probing reveals deep periodontal pockets. Lack of visible signs of clinical inflammation despite the presence of deep periodontal pockets and severe attachment loss in an otherwise healthy young individual is the classic sign of aggressive periodontitis presenting at this stage (Figures 1(a)–1(c)). Probing should be done with calibrated periodontal probes at six sites around each tooth.\n\n【26】The periods of inactivity may remain for weeks to months or even years and will be followed by periods of active disease. During this period, there will be active bone destruction and attachment loss. When the patient presents in this stage, the gingiva will show all signs of mild to severe inflammation. Gingiva may be tender, fiery red, edematous, soft, and boggy. Bleeding on probing or even spontaneous bleeding and purulent exudation may be evident. Inflammatory gingival enlargement may also be noticed. The majority of the patients refer to dental consultation at this stage of the disease (Figures 3(a)–3(c)).\n\n【27】(a)\n\n【28】(b)\n\n【29】(c)\n\n【30】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| (a)–(c) Features of severe gingival inflammation presented at the stage of active disease. |\n| --- |\n\n【33】This stage may undergo spontaneous remission after a varying period of destruction and the inflammatory symptoms subside to reappear after a period of quiescence. Advanced stages of the untreated disease with severe periodontal destruction may show extrusion of teeth, mobility and pathologic migration, furcation involvement, generalized gingival recession, and loss of several teeth due to spontaneous exfoliation. Some patients may show systemic manifestations such as weight loss, mental depression and general malaise 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【34】#### 3\\. Radiographic Features\n\n【35】Localized aggressive periodontitis typically presents “arc-shaped” mirror image radiolucency in the first molars starting from the distal aspect of second premolars to the mesial aspect of the second molar. In generalized aggressive periodontitis, radiographs may show generalized bone destruction ranging from mild crestal bone resorption to severe extensive alveolar bone destruction depending on the severity of the disease. The defects may be a combination of vertical and horizontal defects (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)).\n\n【36】(a)\n\n【37】(b)\n\n【38】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【39】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| (a) Arc-shaped radiolucency at the 1st molar region in localized aggressive periodontitis. (b) Generalized distribution of bone loss seen in GAgP with vertical defects. |\n| --- |\n\n【41】#### 4\\. Diagnosis\n\n【42】Early diagnosis is of utmost importance for the prevention of extensive attachment loss and bone loss experienced in aggressive periodontitis. Diagnosis is made according to the criteria set by the American Academy of periodontology, 1999 classification of periodontal diseases and conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, using history, clinical features, and radiographic features aided by microbial examination if needed. Family history may reveal a history of early tooth loss in the parents or immediate blood relatives of the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The amount of microbial deposits will be inconsistent with the amount of destruction when compared to chronic periodontitis and plaque will be minimal. Comparison of serial radiographs helps in assessing the rapid rate of bone destruction and can aid in the diagnosis of the disease.\n\n【43】#### 5\\. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【44】Aggressive periodontitis can be differentiated from chronic periodontitis by the age of onset, rapid rate of disease progression, the nature and composition of the associated subgingival microflora, alterations in host immune response, and a familial aggregation of the diseased individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Systemic diseases like hematologic disorders and some genetic disorders also show periodontitis as a manifestation mimicking generalized aggressive periodontitis which can be ruled out by assessing the systemic status, hematologic data analysis, and immunologic profiling of the patient. In addition, there are rare reports of certain conditions like intraosseous sarcoidosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>, eosinophilic granuloma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20, 21\\]</u> and alveolar bone actinomycosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, presenting with extensive alveolar bone destruction like in aggressive periodontitis which can be differentiated by biopsy of the suspected lesions.\n\n【45】#### 6\\. Case Reports\n\n【46】##### 6.1. Case Report 1\n\n【47】A 32-year-old female patient presented with the complaint of a recently noticed spacing between the upper front teeth. (Figures 5(a)–5(d)).\n\n【48】(a)\n\n【49】(b)\n\n【50】(c)\n\n【51】(d)\n\n【52】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【53】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n| (a)–(d) Deep pockets were present even though signs of gingival inflammation other than bleeding on probing were absent. |\n| --- |\n\n【55】The patient noticed the spacing about 1 year before, after which she noticed it to be gradually increasing and associated with intermittent episodes of pus discharge which subsided on taking antibiotics as per advice at a local hospital. There were no associated complaints other than a cosmetic concern from the patient. There was no history of any previous dental treatment. Family history of similar complaints or early tooth loss could not be elicited. The patient was systemically healthy with no relevant medical history.\n\n【56】There were no abnormalities detected in extra oral examination except for a slightly tender and palpable left submandibular lymph node. Full complement of teeth was present. The oral hygiene status of the patient was good as revealed by the oral hygiene index. There was minimal amount of calculus and plaque. There was grade I mobility of 22, 31, 32, 21 and 22. Proximal contacts were lost between the teeth 14 and 13, 13 and 12, 21 and 22 and 22 and 23, 22 and 24 and between lower anterior teeth. There was labial migration and flaring of upper and lower anterior teeth with an evident distolabial migration of 22.\n\n【57】Gingival examination revealed normal color except for the labial aspect of 22 where it was slightly reddish. The margins were of knife-edge contour except for the labial aspect of 22 and 42 where it was bluntly rounded. The gingiva was firm and resilient except in the region on 22 where it was soft in consistency. There was no loss of stippling in the anterior regions. The position of the gingival margin was apical to the CEJ in the labial aspect of 22. There was generalized bleeding on probing, and exudation was present on the labial aspect of 22. All together there were minimal signs of inflammation other than bleeding on probing.\n\n【58】A full-mouth periodontal charting revealed generalized periodontal pockets and clinical attachment loss .\n\n【59】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 </u>\n\n| Periodontal charting showing generalized deep pockets and clinical attachment loss. |\n| --- |\n\n【61】Pockets were especially deeper in the molar and incisor regions with slightly lesser involvement in the premolar region. The clinical attachment loss ranged from a maximum of 10 mm in the midpalatal aspect of 16 to a minimum of 2 mm in the premolar regions.\n\n【62】An OPG and full-mouth IOPA X-ray were performed which revealed the generalized distribution of alveolar bone loss which was a combination of both horizontal and vertical bone loss . Routine blood examination results were within normal limits.\n\n【63】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 </u>\n\n| Orthopantomogram of the patient demonstrating generalized distribution of bone loss. |\n| --- |\n\n【65】Based on the history, examination findings, and the radiographic findings, a diagnosis of generalized aggressive periodontitis was made according to the criteria by AAP 1999 classification.\n\n【66】##### 6.2. Management\n\n【67】A thorough supragingival scaling was performed following which the patient was motivated for better plaque control. A sulcus brushing technique (modified Bass technique) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u> was demonstrated, and the patient was educated on the use of interdental cleansing aids including dental floss and interdental brushes. Chlorhexidine mouth wash was prescribed to further aid in plaque control. Systemic antibiotics (Amoxycillin and Metronidazole, 250 mg of each thrice daily) were prescribed for 8 days, and the patient was recalled after 2 weeks for evaluation of the response to treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>.\n\n【68】A subgingival scaling was performed after which the patient was advised to continue the chlorhexidine mouthwashes. A reevaluation 2 weeks after subgingival scaling showed a reduction in probing depths and absence of bleeding on probing.\n\n【69】A quadrant-wise full-mouth flap surgery was performed including bone grafting in relation to the molar regions where predominantly vertical or intrabony defects were detected. A modified Widman flap surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u> in conjunction with bone replacement graft was performed in the molar regions (Figures 8(a)–8(e)) whereas a sulcular incision flap (Kirkland flap) was performed in the maxillary and mandibular anterior region to minimize the recession after healing for esthetic purposes.\n\n【70】(a)\n\n【71】(b)\n\n【72】(c)\n\n【73】(d)\n\n【74】(e)\n\n【75】(f)\n\n【76】(g)\n\n【77】(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f)   \n(g)\n\n【78】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 8 </u>\n\n| (a)–(e) Modified Widman flap in conjunction with bone grafting performed. (f) Postoperative evaluation showing probing depth within normal limits. (g) 6-Month postoperative intraoral periapical radiographs. |\n| --- |\n\n【80】A preprocedural rinse with antimicrobial agent was done to minimize the bacterial count in the mouth. After adequately anesthetizing the surgical site with infiltration anesthesia and nerve blocks, the first incision (internal bevel incision) 0.5 mm from the gingival margin directing to the crest of the alveolar bone was made. The flap was reflected following which sulcular incision and interdental incision were made to remove the wedge of tissue. Curettage for granulation tissue removal was done following which a through subgingival debridement and root planning was performed. The defect was irrigated with normal saline, and a root conditioning with tetracycline was performed. The graft was a xenograft (Bovine graft—Ossopan), which was mixed with the blood from the surgical site and placed into the defect after presuturing the site with silk sutures. Care was taken to fill the graft to a realistic level and not to overpack the defect. Suturing was done after adapting the buccal and lingual flaps well. A periodontal pack was placed, and antibiotics and analgesics were prescribed for the patient for 5 days. A fluoride-containing mouthwash was prescribed postsurgically to the patient.\n\n【81】Healing was uneventful, and a postoperative evaluation 3 weeks after surgery showed absence of bleeding on probing and probing depths within normal limits (Figure 8(f)). The patient was put on regular recall appointments for evaluation of the gingival and periodontal status and maintenance therapy. A postoperative radiograph 6 months later showed a significant bone fill in the molar regions where grafting was done with an increase in bone density of the alveolar crest with corticated bone formations in the crest at the other areas (Figure 8(g)). The oral hygiene maintenance and compliance of the patient was excellent, and there were no signs of recurrence of the disease throughout the maintenance period. Since the patient was concerned about the esthetic appearance of the anterior teeth, she was advised to undergo adult orthodontic therapy after 1 year of surgery under regular periodontal monitoring and was referred to an orthodontic specialist for the same.\n\n【82】##### 6.3. Case Report 2\n\n【83】A 26-year-old male patient presented with the chief complaint of generalized pus discharge from gums which he had been experiencing intermittently for the past 2 years (Figures 9(a) and 9(b)). Pus discharge was associated with bad breath and usually subsided spontaneously after a few weeks. There was no associated complaint other than a generalized mild hypersensitivity to cold and sweet food. He had a history of extraction of lower left posterior tooth due to caries exposure and extraction of lower front tooth due to mobility about 1 year before. There was no history of any other dental treatment.\n\n【84】(a)\n\n【85】(b)\n\n【86】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【87】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 9 </u>\n\n| (a) and (b) Clinical presentation with deep pockets, recession, and pathologic migration of teeth. |\n| --- |\n\n【89】The patient was systemically healthy, and medical history did not reveal any relevant findings. Family history revealed that the patient’s mother had similar complaints of mobility, pus discharge, and spontaneous exfoliation of some teeth following which she consulted a dentist and underwent total extraction by the age of 40. The patient was a nonsmoker, and there was no history of use of any other forms of tobacco.\n\n【90】Extraoral examination revealed bilateral submandibular lymph node enlargement, which was firm, mobile, and nontender.\n\n【91】All teeth were present except for 46, 26, and 41. Tooth 46 was extracted due to caries and 41 was extracted due to mobility. Tooth 26 was grossly decayed with just root stump present. The oral hygiene status of the patient was fair with moderate deposits of calculus and plaque.\n\n【92】Intraoral examination revealed a normal color of gingiva except in the labial aspect of 31, 32, and 33 where the marginal gingiva was slightly reddish. Gingival margins were rounded, and exudation was present in relation to labial aspects of mandibular anterior teeth and maxillary central incisors. There was generalized bleeding on probing and recession in relation to most of the teeth, especially more in maxillary central incisors and mandibular anterior teeth.\n\n【93】There was grade I mobility of 15 and 22 and grade II mobility of 11, 12, 21, 31, 32, 33 and 42. Proximal contacts were lost between maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth with pathologic migration of 11, 21, 31, 32, and 42 and extrusion of 31. Grade II furcation involvement was present with molars and maxillary first premolars. A full mouth periodontal examination revealed generalized deep periodontal pockets and severe generalized clinical attachment loss .\n\n【94】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 10 </u>\n\n| Pretreatment periodontal charting shows deep pockets with generalized clinical attachment loss. |\n| --- |\n\n【96】Severe periodontal destruction was evident with more than 10 mm of clinical attachment loss at multiple sites especially in the incisor and canine regions.\n\n【97】OPG and IOPA X-rays revealed a generalized distribution of periodontal bone loss especially severe in the incisor and canine regions with the molars and premolars affected to a lesser degree . There was predominantly vertical bone loss in the canine and incisor regions. Routine blood investigations were within normal limits.\n\n【98】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 11 </u>\n\n| Orthopantomogram showing generalized bone loss with advanced vertical defect in 13 and 33 regions. |\n| --- |\n\n【100】A diagnosis of generalized aggressive periodontitis was made according to the established criteria (American Academy of Periodontology, 1999).\n\n【101】##### 6.4. Management\n\n【102】Supragingival scaling was performed, and the patient was educated in oral hygiene maintenance. The patient was advised to follow a modified Stillman technique of brushing since the patient had root exposure and hypersensitivity and also advised to use interdental brushes and dental floss for optimal plaque control. The patient was prescribed topical antimicrobial agents (metronidazole gel) along with chlorhexidine mouthwash for 2 weeks. A combination systemic antibiotic therapy of amoxicillin and metronidazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> was initiated, and a desensitizing agent was prescribed. A recall visit after 2 weeks showed reduction in inflammation and percentage of sites showing bleeding on probing. Exudation was persistent in relation to 11 and 33 regions. A subgingival scaling and root planing was performed following which a povidone iodine 5% irrigation was performed. A nonsustained professionally delivered local drug delivery with metronidazole gel was injected subgingivally at sites 33 and 11, following which a periodontal dressing was given at the site. The procedure was performed every 3 days for the next 2 weeks. Evaluation after 3 weeks showed complete absence of bleeding on probing, exudation, and significant reduction in probing pocket depth. The patient was put on maintenance therapy during which he continued with the topical antimicrobial agents and desensitizing agents and was evaluated for surgical therapy.\n\n【103】A full-mouth flap surgery with bone grafts (synthetic hydroxyapatite (HAP)), where indicated, was performed sextantwise at intervals of two weeks. In addition, the defect at site 33 was treated with guided tissue regeneration (GTR) with bioresorbable collagen membrane in conjunction with synthetic bone graft (HAP) (Figures 12(a)–12(f)).\n\n【104】(a)\n\n【105】(b)\n\n【106】(c)\n\n【107】(d)\n\n【108】(e)\n\n【109】(f)\n\n【110】(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)   \n(f)\n\n【111】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 12 </u>\n\n| (a)–(c) Flap surgery in conjunction with bone grafting (HAP) and papilla preservation flap between 11 and 21.

Radiographs showed bone fill in the region where bone grafts alone or in conjunction with GTR were used (Figures 13(c) and 13(d)). Regular recall appointments were given for maintenance therapy during which the treatment results were well maintained. However, there was a slight increase in recession due to shrinkage of gingiva on healing and hypersensitivity after the surgery which gradually subsided on regular use of desensitizing agents and fluoride mouthwashes.\n\n【114】(a)\n\n【115】(b)\n\n【116】(c)\n\n【117】(d)\n\n【118】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【119】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 13 </u>\n\n| (a) and (b) Postoperative photographs showing probing depths within normal limits with excellent gingival condition; however, there was slight increase in recession after healing.

Discussion\n\n【122】The key to successful treatment is early diagnosis. Early diagnosis helps in prevention of progression of the disease thus avoiding the possibility of advanced tissue destruction and alveolar bone loss. The earlier the diagnosis is the better the prognosis of the dentition will be. Furthermore since it has a tendency for familial aggregation, it is important to do a periodontal examination of siblings and other close blood relatives of the patient which helps in early diagnosis of the disease in the family members. Management of GAgP patients essentially consists of a nonsurgical phase, surgical therapy an interdisciplinary therapy and a lifelong supportive periodontal therapy.\n\n【123】##### 7.1. Nonsurgical/Etiotropic Phase of Therapy\n\n【124】Nonsurgical therapy remains the first line of antimicrobial therapy in GAgP. Early stages of the disease with mild to moderate periodontal and bone destruction may be managed entirely by nonsurgical therapy with systemic antibiotics as an adjuvant to mechanical therapy.\n\n【125】Therapy should start with attempts at controlling or eliminating the etiologic agents and modifiable risk factors for the disease. The disease has a strong genetic predisposition. The host response of the patient or the susceptible individual to pathogenic bacteria in the dental plaque plays a vital role in the pathogenesis and expression of the disease, and this host response is genetically determined and is an unmodifiable risk factor is at present by the current treatment measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. However, since the expression of the disease in susceptible individuals is also influenced by microbial and environmental risk factors, the disease can be successfully kept under control by controlling the microbial and environmental factors. This underlies the importance of optimal plaque control both by personally employed methods used by the patient himself and professionally employed plaque control measures by the dental team to the patient. Even a minimal amount of plaque is enough to elicit untoward host response in those patients susceptible to the disease, and a reduced resistance to the invasion of subgingival plaque can be compensated for by a correspondingly strong emphasis on total plaque control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【126】Mechanical plaque control can be successfully achieved by educating and motivating the patient if needed with the aid of disclosing solutions regarding the need for optimal plaque control, demonstration of brushing techniques (modified Bass technique for patients without gingival recession and modified Stillman technique in patients with hypersensitivity and generalized recession), and use of interdental cleansing aids like dental floss and interdental brushes where indicated. This behavioral modification from the patient needs a positive reinforcement and encouragement from the dental team. Regular recall appointments to monitor the efficacy of the patient’s plaque control measures are essential.\n\n【127】Chemical plaque control agents like chlorhexidine 0.12% or 0.2% mouthwashes, and 1% povidone iodine can be advised for further plaque control as an adjunct to the patient’s mechanical plaque control measures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Amine fluoride and stannous fluoride mouth rinses and tooth pastes as an adjunct to mechanical oral hygiene procedures in GAgP patients were found to be effective in controlling supragingival plaque accumulations in aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 30\\]</u>. Additionally use of fluoride mouthwashes is advised to help in remineralization of the exposed root surfaces, and for patients complaining of hypersensitivity, use of desensitizing toothpastes and mouthwashes is mandatory.\n\n【128】Smoking has been well documented as a significant risk factor for aggressive periodontitis with GAgP patients who smoke having more affected teeth and more loss of clinical attachment than nonsmoking patients with GAgP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Furthermore the response to periodontal therapy, both nonsurgical and surgical, regenerative therapy, and implant therapy is less than in nonsmokers, but former smokers respond similar to nonsmokers. This underlies the therapeutic effect of smoking cessation and cessation of other forms of tobacco, and patients should be advised of the benefits of smoking cessation and the potential risks of smoking in worsening their periodontal condition, and if needed expert counseling for cessation of the habit should be sought 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32–36\\]</u>.\n\n【129】###### 7.1.1. Mechanical Antimicrobial Therapy\n\n【130】Scaling and root planing (SRP) which eliminates the microbial bacterial load from the periodontal pockets and removes the local etiologic factors is performed either as a quadrant-wise SRP at 2-week interval or as a full mouth scaling and root planning completed on the same day. However, both modalities have been found to be efficacious with significant improvement in clinical parameters, and the clinician should select the treatment modality based on the practical considerations related to the patient preference and clinical workload 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>.\n\n【131】Another approach to mechanical antimicrobial therapy is a one-stage full mouth disinfection therapy devised by Quirynen et al. which was found to result in an improved clinical outcome and microbial improvement in early onset periodontitis compared to quadrant-wise SRP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. Full-mouth disinfection therapy includes full-mouth debridement (scaling and root planning, brushing of the tongue with 1% chlorhexidine for 1 minute, rinsing of the mouth with a 0.2% chlorhexidine solution for 2 minutes, and irrigation of periodontal pockets with 1% chlorhexidine solution), completed in 2 appointments within a 24-hour period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>.\n\n【132】###### 7.1.2. Photodynamic Therapy and Laser Irradiation\n\n【133】These have been tried as adjuncts to mechanical therapy to inhibit the pathogenic bacteria in periodontal pockets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41–44\\]</u>.\n\n【134】Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a noninvasive photochemical approach for infection control which combines the application of a nontoxic chemical agent or photosensitizer with low-level light energy and has shown clinical evidence of efficient eradication of periodontal bacteria from subgingival sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>. This novel therapeutic approach of antimicrobial therapy seems promising and is getting attention recently either as a monotherapy or as an adjunct to SRP in the nonsurgical treatment of aggressive periodontitis. Both PDT and SRP have been shown to have similar clinical results in the nonsurgical treatment of aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42, 43\\]</u>.\n\n【135】Laser irradiation of subgingival sites to eradicate periodontopathic microorganisms is also being considered in the nonsurgical therapy of periodontitis patients. Diode laser treatment has shown a superior clinical and microbiological effect when used along with SRP, compared to SRP alone or laser therapy alone in aggressive periodontitis patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>.\n\n【136】A regular recall visit preferably at one-week intervals should be performed especially at the initial stages of the treatment to monitor the efficiency of the patient’s plaque control measures and to assess the response of the patient towards nonsurgical therapy.\n\n【137】###### 7.1.3. Chemical Antimicrobial Therapy in the Management of GAgP\n\n【138】Role of Systemic Antibiotic Therapy in GAgP  \nSystemic antibiotics are indicated in aggressive periodontitis since the pathogenic bacteria like Aggregatibacter actinomycetem-comitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis have been found to be tissue invasive and mechanical therapy is insufficient to eliminate the bacteria from these sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58, 59\\]</u>. Systemically administered antibiotics with or without scaling and root planning and/or surgery provided greater clinical improvement in attachment level change compared to similar periodontal therapy without antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. Earlier tetracyclines were used extensively for this purpose since systemic tetracycline was found to be a useful adjunct to mechanical periodontal therapy in patients with aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46–48\\]</u>, but the concern for tetracycline resistance has shifted the focus to the use of other antibiotics both as combination therapy or serial antibiotic therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.  \nThe preferred combination antibiotic therapy at present for treatment of GAgP is 250 mg of amoxicillin thrice daily along with metronidazole 250 mg twice daily for 8 days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 49\\]</u>. It is one of the most evaluated drug combinations in GAgP, and there is ample evidence now to show that Amoxycillin-Metronidazole combination as an adjunctive treatment in GAgP at initial therapy significantly improves the results and hence should be preferred over other antibiotic regimens as the first-line treatment  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50–55\\]</u>.  \nThe usefulness of microbial testing may be limited because of the variability of test reports between different labs and the mixed flora, and hence an empiric use of antibiotics like the above-mentioned combination may be more clinically sound and cost-effective than bacterial identification and antibiotic-sensitivity testing in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.  \nSingle-agent therapy with Doxycycline 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53, 55\\]</u>, azithromycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>, metronidazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53, 57\\]</u>, and clindamycin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u> is effective when used adjunctively to nonsurgical procedure of SRP in AgP patients. The criteria for selection of antibiotics are not clear in AgP; the choice depends on the case, disease-related factors and patient-related factors like compliance, allergies, and potential side effects.\n\n【139】Table 1 \n\n【140】The list of antibiotic regimens with evidence of superior clinical outcome when used as an adjuvant to SRP in GAgP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 45–57\\]</u>.\n\n【141】###### 7.1.4. Local Drug Delivery of Antimicrobial Agents\n\n【142】Topical application of antimicrobial agents and local drug delivery is also a treatment option especially if there are localized areas of exudation and deep pockets not responding adequately to mechanical and systemic antibiotic therapy. Local drug delivery delivers the drugs at high concentrations at the site of infection when compared to systemic antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, this is an option in patients where there is intolerance to systemic administration of the antibiotic.\n\n【143】Several local anti-infective agents combined with SRP appear to provide additional benefits in PD reduction and CAL gain compared to SRP alone. Over the past 20 years, locally delivered, anti-infective pharmacological agents, most recently employing sustained-release vehicles, have been introduced to achieve this goal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>.\n\n【144】Though there is more evidence on its application in chronic periodontitis, till future researches are available; the same agents can be employed in aggressive periodontitis patients as well empirically. Adjunctive use of LDD agents like controlled release biodegradable chlorhexidine gluconate chip 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61, 62\\]</u>, tetracycline fibers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63, 64\\]</u>, and minocycline-Hcl gel 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[65\\]</u> has been tried in aggressive periodontitis with superior clinical outcomes. The decision to use local anti-infective adjunctive therapy remains a matter of individual clinical judgment, the phase of treatment, and the patient’s status and preferences.\n\n【145】An evaluation of the response to nonsurgical treatment is done 2-3 weeks after treatment during which the gingival and periodontal status of the patient will be reevaluated and compared with the pretreatment values to assess the response to therapy and to assess the areas which need surgical therapy. Sites with persisting pockets >5 mm depth, vertical bone defects which need regenerative therapy, difficult to instrument areas like furcation involvement, and areas which need recontouring or resective osteoplasty are indications for surgery.\n\n【146】##### 7.2. Surgical Therapy\n\n【147】It essentially consists of open flap debridement either alone or as a combination with resective or regenerative procedures. The main aim of a flap procedure is to get access and visibility to root and furcation areas so that a thorough instrumentation and debridement can be performed. Flap techniques like modified Widman flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>, modified flap operation/Kirkland flap (sulcular incision flap) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[66\\]</u> achieve this aim without eliminating the pockets. A resective flap procedure like undisplaced flap 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u> will eliminate the pockets as well but compromise the esthetics and function of the dentition by root exposure and resultant hypersensitivity and hence is not preferred usually when compared to modified Widman flap or sulcular incision flap.\n\n【148】Laser-assisted surgery (Nd: YAG laser) is suggested as a valid alternative to conventional scalpel surgical therapy, in individuals at increased surgical risk like in coagulation and platelet function disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[68\\]</u>.\n\n【149】###### 7.2.1. Regenerative Surgical Therapy\n\n【150】Regeneration of the periodontal supporting structures lost due to periodontal disease so that the form and function of the periodontium is reestablished has been an elusive or difficult-to-achieve goal for periodontal therapists.\n\n【151】Various modalities are being employed for periodontal regeneration which includes use of bone replacement grafts, barrier membranes or guided tissue regeneration (GTR), biologic modifiers like growth and differentiation factors (GDF), and extracellular matrix proteins like enamel matrix proteins (EMD) or use of a combination of the above techniques and materials which has been extensively reviewed elsewhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[69\\]</u>.\n\n【152】A sulcular incision flap or papilla preservation flap will be the ideal technique to minimize recession in the anterior regions due to esthetic reasons, and modified Widman flap or conventional/sulcular incision flap will be the technique of choice in the posterior regions when opting for bone grafting and another regenerative therapy. A papilla preservation flap is preferred for bone grafting when there is spacing between the teeth to obtain maximum coverage of the graft material at the interdental region and to prevent shrinkage of papilla on healing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[67\\]</u>. Biomodification of the root surface (Root conditioning) with citric acid, tetracycline, or fibronectin is preferable when performing bone grafting or GTR for better clinical results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[69\\]</u>.\n\n【153】###### 7.2.2. Bone Replacement Grafts\n\n【154】Bone grafting is indicated in vertical defects, and the success of the procedure depends on the type of defect. Three-walled or intrabony defect is the ideal defect for bone grafts and has a better success rate compared to a two-walled and one-walled defect. The type of bone graft which gives the maximum benefit with minimum tissue reaction is autograft 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[70\\]</u>, but there are limitations of obtaining it in large quantities as is needed in most cases of generalized aggressive periodontitis. A more feasible option is to use commercially available bone grafts, which are allograft, xenograft, or alloplastic materials.\n\n【155】Allografts used for periodontal grafts include mineralized freeze-dried bone allografts (FDBAs) which are osteoconductive, and decalcified freeze-dried bone allografts (DFDBAs) which are osteoinductive. Decalcification of the graft exposes the complex bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) from its matrix which can induce osteoblastic proliferation in the recipient site. DFDBA, because of its osteoinductive property, has shown to have better results than the alloplastic materials which are osteoconductive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[71\\]</u>. Allogeneic freeze-dried bone (FDBA) mixed with tetracycline powder along with systemic tetracycline has demonstrated a better clinical outcome in treatment of juvenile periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[72\\]</u>.\n\n【156】Xenografts used are either bovine derived or coral derived. An osteoconductive bovine-derived anorganic bone, Bio-Oss, has been successfully used in periodontal defects with resulting bone regeneration and new attachment in these defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[73–75\\]</u>. Human histologic studies have shown that a combination of Bio-Oss with either purified porcine collagen (Bio-Oss Collagen) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[76\\]</u> or a synthetic cell-binding polypeptide (Pepgen P-15) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[77\\]</u> has the capacity of inducing regeneration of the periodontal attachment apparatus when placed in intrabony defects. Coralline grafts implanted into human periodontal defects have produced better clinical results when compared to nongrafted sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[78\\]</u>.\n\n【157】Synthetic grafts/alloplastic grafts have been considered primarily as defect fillers. The most commonly used among alloplastic graft materials is hydroxyapatite (HAP) which is osteoconductive and has shown to have similar clinical effect to FDBA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[79\\]</u>. Other alloplastic grafts which can be used are beta tricalcium phosphate and bioactive glass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[80, 81\\]</u>.\n\n【158】A synthetic hydroxyapatite/equine type I collagen/chondroitin sulphate biomaterial (Biostite) has been found to show comparable improvements to Bio-Oss in terms of clinical attachment gain, pocket depth reduction, and radiographic bone fill in the treatment of deep intraosseous defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[82\\]</u>.\n\n【159】###### 7.2.3. Guided Tissue Regeneration\n\n【160】Guided tissue regeneration promotes regeneration by acting as a barrier which prevents apical migration of epithelium and exclude gingival connective tissue from the healing wound, thus allowing the pluripotent periodontal ligament cells to populate the site of healing enhancing new cementum and new attachment procedures.\n\n【161】GTR has shown to have a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement alone, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession, and more gain in hard tissue probing at reentry surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[83\\]</u>. Research has shown that GTR in conjunction with bone grafting has better potential for regeneration compared with either technique alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[74, 84, 85\\]</u>, and this outcome has been confirmed in aggressive periodontitis also with the use of bioresorbable membranes (Bio-Gide) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[75, 80\\]</u>.\n\n【162】###### 7.2.4. Biologic Mediators and Extracellular Proteins\n\n【163】A wide array of regenerative materials is being considered for use in periodontitis. Use of biologic mediators like growth factors (insulin-like growth factor (ILGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)) use of platelet-rich plasma which contains PDGF, extracellular matrix proteins like emdogain, etc. are of promising results. Application of enamel matrix proteins alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[86\\]</u> or in combination with bone grafts including bioactive glass has shown to result in the successful treatment of intrabony defects in aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[87\\]</u>.\n\n【164】Beneficial effects of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in the treatment of periodontal defects have been demonstrated by clinical and radiographic measurements together with reentry results showing marked improvements from baseline with increased stabilization of whole dentition including the hopeless teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[88, 89\\]</u>.\n\n【165】Various commercially available regenerative materials including bone replacement grafts, GTR membranes, enamel matrix derivatives, are in the market for use in periodontal therapy with varying results, and the choice of the material depends on the dentist’s preference and experience with the products helping in clinical judgment of the therapeutic results of individual products and procedures and their cost-benefit ratio.\n\n【166】##### 7.3. Role of Maintenance Therapy in Management of Aggressive Periodontitis\n\n【167】The importance of supportive periodontal therapy has to be stressed in management of aggressive periodontitis. Regular SPT was found to be effective in maintaining clinical and microbiological improvements attained after active periodontal therapy in early onset periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[90\\]</u>.\n\n【168】The maintenance therapy starts soon after the phase I therapy or nonsurgical therapy and should be continued throughout the lifetime of the patient. Or in other words, “maintenance therapy never ends” for a GAgP patient. In order to maintain the optimal results got by surgery and to prevent the recurrence of the disease, a lifelong maintenance therapy is mandatory because of the strong genetic susceptibility of the individual to the disease.\n\n【169】The frequency of the recall visits depends on the response of the individual to treatment and presence of other risk factors like environmental factors but generally will be more frequent than that in chronic periodontitis or in localized aggressive periodontitis. Any site which shows signs of recurrence of the disease like bleeding on probing which is considered as the first clinical sign of inflammation should be treated vigorously and monitored for resolution of the signs.\n\n【170】##### 7.4. Interdisciplinary Approach for Management of Resultant Esthetic, Functional, and Psychologic Problems in GAgP\n\n【171】A comprehensive management for total rehabilitation of the GAgP patients not only involves control of infection and arrest of progression and/or regenerative therapy by the periodontist but also incorporates a multidisciplinary approach to attend the esthetic, functional, and psychologic problems faced by the patient.\n\n【172】An orthodontic therapy with concomitant periodontal monitoring and prosthetic rehabilitation, if possible with the use of implants and psychologic counseling, may be needed for patients with advanced forms of the disease.\n\n【173】###### 7.4.1. Combined Periodontal-Orthodontic Therapy\n\n【174】Cosmetic concerns in young aggressive periodontitis patients will be high since the disease can result in flaring, protrusion, pathologic migration, and even extrusion of the anterior teeth. Malocclusion, pathologic migration and potential occlusal traumatism which can cause secondary trauma from occlusion can be corrected by orthodontic therapy in GAgP patients already stabilized by periodontal therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[91–94\\]</u>. Orthodontic treatment can be commenced once attachment gain and bone stability is achieved after periodontal therapy but is generally advised to postpone till 3 months to 1 year after active periodontal therapy. A combined periodontal and orthodontic treatment demands a detailed evaluation in both specialties, particularly when the periodontium is reduced. Periodontal evaluations are scheduled concomitantly with orthodontic appointments to monitor the periodontal stability as the tooth movement occurs.\n\n【175】###### 7.4.2. Prosthodontic Rehabilitation, Implant Therapy, and Implant Supported Prosthesis\n\n【176】Gingival recession with loss of interdental papilla especially in the anterior teeth is unaesthetic especially when the patient smiles and the feasibility of root coverage periodontal plastic surgery will be limited in generalized aggressive periodontitis because of the large number of teeth involved and the advanced interdental bone loss. A porcelain, resin, silicone, or copolyamide removable gingival prosthesis (gum veneer/gingival mask) can be fabricated to mask the recession and improve the appearance of the anterior teeth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[95\\]</u>. The restoration of the teeth lost due to periodontitis should be done with fixed or removable prosthesis depending on the bone support of the remaining teeth.\n\n【177】Contradictory to the earlier concept that implants are not a feasible option in GAgP patients, the use of implants and implant-supported prosthesis to restore the lost teeth is increasingly considered as a treatment option in well-maintained GAgP patients even though the risk of bone loss and attachment loss around implants is higher than that in chronic periodontitis patients or periodontally healthy individuals, with researches showing good survival of implants over a 10-year period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[96\\]</u>. Several reports are there which have successfully used osseointegrated implants in oral rehabilitation of partially edentulous patients treated for GAgP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[97–99\\]</u>.\n\n【178】###### 7.4.3. Psychotherapy\n\n【179】Perhaps the least recognized and the most underestimated aspect in the total rehabilitation of a patient with GAgP presenting with multiple tooth loss and/or advanced periodontal destruction necessitating extraction of multiple teeth is the need for psychological counseling and psychotherapy. It aims at attending the psychologic effect and potential mental depression following tooth loss due to rapid periodontal destruction which provides the patient with relatively less time to cope with the situation. The emotional effects of tooth loss are devastating for some patients and have a dramatic impact on their life, and they take longer time to come to terms with the tooth loss 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[100\\]</u>. Preparing the patients with advanced disease having multiple teeth with hopeless prognosis emotionally for extraction also has to be dealt with carefully by the dentist, if needed using multiple appointments, and the extent of the impact that bad news, such as having to lose teeth, has on an individual is most often dependent on the way in which the information is communicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[101\\]</u>. Depression, anxiety and social withdrawal are seen in patients with tooth loss, and resulting compromised esthetics can be helped with therapy, relaxation techniques, and, in some cases, antidepressants. Any of the above symptoms should be addressed with a qualified psychotherapist to improve the quality of life.\n\n【180】Psychotherapy has to be started immediately following the first appointment and should be continued concomitantly for total rehabilitation of the patient for a variable duration depending upon the psychologic status of the individual patient. In addition, stress reduction protocols may help in management of the disease as such in the view of the recent suggestions of the proposed mechanisms by which stress can contribute to the onset, exacerbation and maintenance of the periodontal disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[102\\]</u>. A recent study reported that psychotherapy offered at 3 levels (individual, group, and conjoint family psychotherapy) to GAgP patients gave positive psychologic effects that restored their ability to socialize in their environment contributing to their positive experience in life 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[103\\]</u>. The above facts suggest that psychotherapy be incorporated for the future protocols for treatment of GAgP patients suffering from emotional effects of tooth loss.\n\n【181】###### 7.4.4. Other Treatment Modalities and Future Trends in Management of Aggressive Periodontitis\n\n【182】Host modulation therapy with systemically and locally administered agents is under research for therapy in aggressive periodontitis. Subantibacterial dose of Doxycycline has been approved for use in chronic periodontitis, but its use in aggressive periodontitis has to be confirmed by research. Adjunctive use of locally administered alendronate gel with SRP for host modulation has shown promising results in aggressive periodontitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[104\\]</u>.\n\n【183】Newer generations of regenerative materials and advances in tissue engineering for regeneration and genetic engineering to modify the genetic risk factors seem to be really promising in the future. With further understanding of the genetic risk factors, a futuristic application of genetic screening tests will be in identifying the susceptible individuals and instituting the preventive measures to keep the gene expression and thus the disease under control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[105, 106\\]</u>.\n\n【184】###### 7.4.5. A Suggested Protocol for the Comprehensive and Total Rehabilitation of GAgP Patients with the Current Treatment Modalities\n\n【185】For more details see Figure 14.\n\n【186】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 14 </u>\n\n| The treatment commences with a nonsurgical phase following which psychotherapy sessions are started for the needy patients, and patients are put on maintenance therapy/supportive periodontal therapy thereafter. While the patient is on maintenance therapy, one or more of the 3 modalities of surgical periodontal therapy can be performed depending upon the indication and once periodontium has been stabilized, an interdisciplinary treatment for the restoration of lost teeth and correction of cosmetic problems is completed following which the patient continues for a “lifelong” maintenance therapy. |\n| --- |\n\n【188】#### 8\\. Conclusion\n\n【189】Even though the prevalence of aggressive periodontitis is much lower than chronic periodontitis, the management of aggressive periodontitis is more challenging compared to that of chronic periodontitis because of its strong genetic predisposition as an unmodifiable risk factor. Researchers are going on employing the potential several novel technologies in regenerating the lost periodontium including tissue engineering and genetic engineering.\n\n【190】The key to successful management at present lies in early diagnosis of the disease and rigorous treatment employing the different treatment modalities mentioned in the paper along with systemic antibiotic therapy followed by meticulous lifelong maintenance therapy. With the current treatment modalities, successful long-term maintenance of the dentition in a healthy and functional state can be achieved. A comprehensive periodontal treatment consisting of mechanical/surgical and systemic antimicrobial therapy is found to be an appropriate treatment regimen for long-term stabilization of periodontal health with arrest of periodontal disease progression in 95% of the initially compromised lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[107\\]</u>.\n\n【191】Further understanding of the etiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and host immune response in aggressive periodontitis along with advances in regenerative concepts, tissue engineering, and gene therapy is needed for formulating better management protocols in the treatment of generalized aggressive periodontitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare disease, classified as primary genetic primary cardiomyopathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. LVNC is caused by intrauterine failure of the myocardium to compact. LVNC is characterized by excessively prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses of the left ventricle that communicate with the left ventricular cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The major clinical manifestations of LVNC include heart failure, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, thromboembolic event, and sudden deaths. Atrial arrhythmia usually seen is atrial fibrillation. Atrial tachycardia is rarely reported in literature with LVNC. We report a rare case of focal left atrial tachycardia treated with radiofrequency ablation in a patient with left ventricular noncompaction.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】An 18-year-old male with no past medical history presented to emergency department for evaluation of persistent tachycardia. Two days prior to admission, he had an episode of atypical pleuritic left sided chest discomfort that lasted less than 5 minutes and resolved spontaneously. The patient had no significant family history of heart disease and denied any alcohol or drug abuse. Patient was asymptomatic, and exam was benign except for persistent tachycardia in 140 s to 150 s.\n\n【6】On arrival a 12 lead rest electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a narrow QRS tachycardia with P wave of 139 beats per minute (bpm) and nonspecific T wave abnormalities . Patient’s pulse rate gradually decreased to 115, and ECG showed narrow complex tachycardia with obvious P waves . A detailed review of ECG revealed inverted P waves in lead II and AVL, while the P waves were upright in III and AVF , suggesting the possibility of ectopic atrial tachycardia, most likely originating from left side. Although his pulse rate was high, but all blood tests including complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid stimulating hormone, D dimer and cardiac troponins, urine toxicology (only positive for cannabinoids), and chest X-ray were within normal limits. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe systolic dysfunction (EF: 30%) and evidence of noncompaction of the left ventricle. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed extensive apical and mid cavity obliteration of the papillary muscles and large trabeculations and intertrabeculation recesses in the left ventricle  with severely depressed ejection fraction (28%). There was no evidence of right ventricle involvement. In several views the noncompacted to compacted ratio was 2.7 to 1, easily meeting the criteria for noncompaction cardiomyopathy . Left atrium was moderately dilated (49 mm) with normal right atrium (38 mm), top normal left ventricle (diastolic 54 mm, systolic 62 mm).\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| 12 lead ECG on presentation.

Discussion\n\n【23】Cardiac rhythm disturbances occur frequently in LVNC. The electrocardiographic findings are usually abnormal, but no characteristic changes are defined. The abnormalities mostly reported are branch blocks, ST-T wave changes, AV blocks, left ventricle hypertrophy, and arrhythmias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Ventricular arrhythmias are the most common rhythm disturbance seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The intertrabecular recesses appear to be a favorable substrate for ventricular arrhythmias. There are several case series and reports describing ventricular ectopic beats, ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillations, and sudden cardiac deaths in these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Atrial arrhythmia usually seen is atrial fibrillation with reported incidence of 5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> to 29% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【24】The differentiation of narrow complex tachycardias (NCT) is a commonly encountered diagnostic dilemma. In this case the patient presented with an NCT, which initially appeared to be sinus tachycardia. Sinus tachycardia generally occurs in the setting of underlying physiologic stress or pharmacologic influence, namely, fever, infection, pain, hyperthyroidism, anxiety, stimulant drug use, or hypotension, among many others. Other causes of NCTs include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, sinus node reentrant tachycardia, unifocal atrial tachycardias, or multifocal atrial tachycardia.\n\n【25】Focal atrial tachycardias, by definition, originate from a single area of the atrium (unlike MAT), the location of which governs the appearance of the P wave. Our patient had focal atrial tachycardia arising from the left side because the P waves in lead II and AVL were inverted, while the P waves were upright in III and AVF. AT usually arises following atrial surgeries or diseased atrial tissue from underlying heart disease or enhanced automaticity, if there is no underlying heart disease. We believe that LVNC with atrial involvement was likely the cause of AT in our patient.\n\n【26】There were no reported cases of supraventricular tachycardia in a followup of 238 patients with LVNC for 4 years with periodic Holter monitoring 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although less common, SVT has been reported in patients in the setting of LVNC. Wolff Parkinson White syndrome and associated supraventricular tachycardia are described mostly in the pediatric patients with LVNC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. Ventricular preexcitation is common in pediatric patients, and orthodromic reentrant tachycardia was reported in some of those patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. One patient with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and another case of atrial flutter with extreme atrial enlargement in the setting of LVNC have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. One case of regular sustained likely macroentry atrial tachycardia (AT) was identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However, focal atrial tachycardia is rarely described in the literature in this patient population. There is one published case of focal AT in a patient with LVNC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, which could well represent reentrant tachycardia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The patient described in this case had a focal atrial tachycardia arising from the ridge anterior to the left sided pulmonary veins, which was successfully treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation. The focal AT was probably related to the moderately enlarged left atrium. Our report suggests that although rare, involvement of left atrial myocardium is possibile in LVNC, and these patients may present with focal atrial tachycardia.\n\n【28】#### Disclosure\n\n【29】This paper has not been submitted elsewhere, is not under review, or published previously.

Introduction\n\n【3】Primary dural lymphoma (PDL) is an extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a subtype of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). This lymphoma develops primarily from brain parenchyma, eyes, meninges, or spinal cord in the absence of systemic disease.

The prognosis of primary malignant dural B-cell-type lymphoma is relatively benign and may be treatable by surgical resection with or without postoperative focal radiotherapy. We report our experience in three cases of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma of dura mater (PDL) mimicking a meningiomas.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】From 2012 to 2018, in the Clinic of Neurosurgery of Ancona three patients affected by primary dural lymphoma have been admitted. The first patient was a 49-year-old man with clinical history of personality and mood change and the second a 64-year-old woman with onset of right-handed and lateral hemianopsia. An MRI study with contrast documented the presence of expansive lesions with surrounding edema and isointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, characterized by an intense post-contrastographic enhancement, with dural implant, located in the first case in the right frontal region, and in the second case, in the left occipito-parietal region . Due to the intracranial lesion position and imaging characteristics, a typical meningioma was suspected in both cases. Both patients underwent a craniotomy with complete macroscopic excision of the tumor. Intraoperatively, the lesions, even though adherent to the dural structures, appeared with infiltrative characteristics, variable consistency (pseudofibrous shoots), intense vascularization, and bleeding , but complete excision of tumor was performed in each case. Histology documented dense polymorphous lymphoid proliferation and large lymphocytes were found. Immunohistochemical study revealed specific antibody for B-cell lymphocytes in tumor cell membranes (CD20+, CD3−, CD30−, EMA−, CD79a+, MUM1+, IgMcit +, IgD−, CD10−, CD5−, Tdt−, Cd34−, BCL6, and BCL1 negative). The MIB-1 index was 15% in the first case and 20% in the second. These pathological features were compatible in each case with malignant lymphoma of diffuse large B-cell type. No extra cranial tumor was identified in further radiological exams in the two patients. In 2018, we observed a 26-year-old woman admitted at our department with one-month history of left arm weakness. Neurological examination was negative. A cerebral MRI study with enhancement documented a solitary right fronto-parietal dural-based extra-axial mass causing moderate mass effect. The lesion was isointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, presenting homogenous enhancement, with evidence of dural tail. Imaging characteristics were consistent with right fronto-parietal convexity meningioma , but a mass reduction of the lesion at CT-scan after 1 week of corticosteroid therapy raised a doubt . Right frontal craniotomy was performed with macroscopic excision of the tumor adherent to the dura with infiltrative characteristics a pseudofibrous consistency . The postoperative cranial wound infection was treated with antibiotics therapy without bone flap plates removal and complete recovery. Histopathological analysis documented lymphocytic and plasmacytoid cells, consistent with a diagnosis of PDL. Immunostaining was CD20+, CD3−, CD30−, EMA−, CD79a+, MUM1+, IgMcit+, IgD−, CD10−, CD5−, Tdt−, Cd34−, BCL6, and BCL1 negative, Mib-1 5%. Postoperatory staging studies PET and total body CT were negative. Only in the first case, the patient underwent adjuvant radiotherapy treatment. In the second and third cases, the watch and see option was chosen with radiological controls. Both patients are currently alive without recurrence, while in the first case, the patient died in 2015 due to complications not related to cranial pathology.\n\n【6】(a)\n\n【7】(b)\n\n【8】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】MRI study with contrast documented the presence of expansive lesions and isointense on T1-weighted, and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, characterized by an intense post-contrastographic enhancement, with dural tail, located in the first case in the right frontal region (a) and in the second case in the left occipito-parietal region (b).\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【12】Intraoperative image of first case: the lesions, even though adherent to the dural structures, appeared with infiltrative characteristics, variable consistency (pseudofibrous shoots), intense vascularization, and bleeding.\n\n【13】(a)\n\n【14】(b)\n\n【15】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【17】(a) MRI study with enhancement documented right fronto-parietal dural-based extra-axial mass causing moderate mass effect.

Discussion\n\n【21】Primary dural lymphoma (PDL) is a very rare disease, and most commonly it occurs in the 4<sup>th</sup>–6<sup>th</sup> decade of life predominantly in women. The incidence of this tumor varies from 0.6 to 3% of all brain neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>. Iwamoto et al. reported an incidence about 2.4% on 355 patients with primary CNS lymphoma in their institution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Meningeal involvement of lymphoma, as a result of systemic disease, can occur extremely rare. For patients with PDL the most predominant histopathological finding is a low-grade marginal B cell lymphoma (MZL).\n\n【22】Primary dural lymphoma (PDL) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of meningiomas. In O’Neil series of 15 patients with PDL, a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of meningioma was made in 14 out of 15 patients prior histopathological diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The PDLs share many features, including higher incidence in women and frequent occurrence of more than one extrassial lesion. When suspecting a PCNLS, enhanced MRI is the exam of choice, but neuroimaging findings are similar with meningiomas: both tumors present with extra-axial lesions that appear iso-hypointense on T1-weighted MR images and diffusely enhance with gadolinium. Moreover, dural tail sign, en plaque thickening of meninges, calvarial hyperostosis, and bone erosion have been common finding in both, but underlying vasogenic edema appears most common in PDL and depending on mass size and location 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 10\\]</u>. Cerebral convexities are the most common site of involvement, but other sites are falx, tentorium, sellar, and suprasellar regions. Other differential diagnoses include dural metastasis, fibrous tumors, gliosarcomas, leiosarcomas, or neurosarcoidosis.\n\n【23】Primary dural lymphoma is a rare disease, and no standard treatment is described in literature. Surgical total excision remains the gold standard of treatment. Because complete resection of PDL may be technically difficult due to multiple tumors and infiltrative and en plaque presentation, many adjuvant drugs were indicated: systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy with R-CHOP, high dose of methotrexate, cytarabione, and vincristine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. As reported in the retrospective analysis by Quinn et al. given the rarity of diagnoses and paucity of available data, an optimal treatment strategy is still under debate. If complete resection is achieved, clinical and radiological follow-up, with no additional treatment, is appropriate; however, in most cases, adjuvant treatment with either radio or chemotherapy is necessary. Adjuvant radiotherapy is preferable because PDL is very radiosensitive, and it requires relatively low doses of radiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. High-dose metrothexate and R-CHOP are the most effective drugs for parenchymal CNS lymphoma (PCNSL), but the effect is unclear in PDL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 9\\]</u>. In conclusion, there is no guideline in the treatment of PDL, so the decision should be tailored on each patient, based on the immunological and histopathological characteristics of the lesion. If leptomeninge are involved, chemotherapy or whole brain irradiation is required. Finally, when postoperative cranial wound infection develops the antibiotic therapy with or without tissue debridement grant recovery as in other surgical infections; the titanium plates of the bone flap may be maintained, but other complications may occur (subdural hematoma, subdural hygroma, intraparenchimal hematoma, hydrocephalus) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. A primary dural lymphoma has a better prognosis than parenchymal primary CNS lymphoma or systemic lymphoma with CNS metastasis. PDL are biologically indolent, with survival rates at 5 years around 70%, with positive response to surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 6, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【25】Primary dural lymphoma is a very rare disease, and it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of other tumors of dura mater and/or cranial bone. Our cases illustrate that intracranial lymphoma may rarely present as a wide dural-based mass mimicking a meningioma clinically, radiologically, and intraoperatively. So it must be considered in the differential diagnosis for all extra-axial enhancing lesions. Since PDL is very rare, there is no standard treatment for this tumor, so the decision should be tailored on each patient, based on the immunological and histopathological features of lesion. However, surgical excision and radiotherapy are the gold standard of therapy which grant good outcome.\n\n【26】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【27】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Here we describe three cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes in pregnancy treated at our clinic between 2009 and 2012. Two patients came for specialist examination during pregnancy, the third after pregnancy. These women had no prior overt diabetes and shared certain characteristics, that is, no family diabetes history, age over 35, normal prepregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy as of the early weeks of pregnancy, and high-titer anti-GAD antibody positivity. The patients had persistent diabetes after delivery, suggesting that they developed adult-onset type 1 diabetes during pregnancy. About 10% of GDM patients become pancreatic autoantibody positive and the risk of developing overt diabetes is higher when two or more autoantibodies are present (particularly GAD and ICA). GAD-Ab shows the highest sensitivity for type 1 diabetes prediction. We need to bear in mind that older patients might conceivably develop an adult-onset type 1 diabetes during or after pregnancy. So we suggest that women with GDM showing the described clinical features shall be preferably tested for autoimmunity. Pregnant patients at risk of type 1 diabetes should be identified to avoid the maternal and fetal complications and the acute onset of diabetes afterwards.\n\n【2】From 5% to 10% of diabetic patients have type 1 diabetes, which results from an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic cells. Autoantibodies directed against insulin, islet cells, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD), and tyrosine phosphatase IA-2 are markers of this immune destruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Here we describe three cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes in pregnancy treated at our clinic between 2009 and 2012.\n\n【3】The first concerns a 42-year-old woman who was referred for specialist examination in her 16th week of gestation (g.w.) to confirm a diagnosis of gestational diabetes. Her family history was negative for diabetes and her prepregnancy BMI was normal (22.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Based on her glycemic profiles, insulin therapy was begun in her 17th g.w. in addition to the already-prescribed dietary restrictions. During the pregnancy, the patient’s metabolic control was good (mean HbA1c 5.4%). The baby was delivered in the 39th g.w. (birth weight 3265 g). Postpartum OGTT revealed diabetes mellitus (2 h plasma glucose >200 mg/dL) with low blood insulin values (5–23.6 mU/mL), C-peptide 1.1 ng/mL, and anti-GAD Ab positivity (>2000 U/L), while HbA1c was 5.9%. In October 2010, the patient resumed insulin therapy and now has 4 injections a day, but her metabolic control remains poor (HbA1c 9.5%).\n\n【4】The second patient was 39 years old when she came for her first specialist examination. Her family history was negative for diabetes. Between 2004 and 2007 she had successfully completed two pregnancies, both complicated by gestational diabetes. Her prepregnancy BMI was normal (20.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). GDM had been diagnosed in the third trimester of the first pregnancy, but within the first two weeks of the second. Insulin therapy was needed in both pregnancies (right from the first few weeks in the second). Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed on postpartum OGTT after the second pregnancy. The patient took metformin therapy for several months, with no benefit. In April 2011, she was hospitalized and laboratory tests revealed: glycemia 170 mg/dL; HbA1c 7.3%, C-peptide 1.2 ng/mL; and anti-GAD Ab positivity (2000 U/L). She is currently on dietary restrictions alone.\n\n【5】The third patient was 36 years old and came for specialist examination in her 28th g.w. in February 2012. Her family history was negative for diabetes and her prepregnancy BMI was normal (22.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Given her poor glycemic profiles, insulin therapy was begun immediately in addition to dietary restrictions. In the 29th g.w. blood tests revealed anti-GAD Ab positivity (268 U/L) and low fasting plasma C-peptide levels (1.8 ng/mL). During the pregnancy, the patient’s metabolic control was good (mean HbA1c 6%). The baby was delivered in the 35th g.w. (birth weight 2520 g). The patient’s metabolic control is currently good (HbA1c 5.6%) and she is on dietary restrictions alone.\n\n【6】It is important to emphasize that these women had no prior overt diabetes and they did not meet the diagnostic criteria of diabetes (i.e. FPG ≥ 126 mg/dL or 2 h plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL during an OGTT, or HbA1c ≥6.5%, or random plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL). Before they were referred to us for examination, all three patients had fasting plasma glucose levels below 126 mg/dL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【7】These pregnant women shared certain characteristics, that is, no family history of diabetes, age over 35 years, normal prepregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy as of the early weeks of pregnancy, high-titer anti-GAD antibody positivity, and low fasting plasma C-peptide levels. The patients also had persistent diabetes after delivery, suggesting that they developed adult-onset type 1 diabetes during their pregnancy.\n\n【8】The literature on autoimmunity and pregnancy is limited. In most cases, GDM is characterized by a higher insulin resistance and lower insulin secretion, both of which are defects typical of type 2 diabetes. Women with GDM are consequently believed to be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. About 10% of GDM patients become pancreatic autoantibody positive, however, so—although type 1 diabetes generally develops in younger people (under 30 years old)—we need to bear in mind that older patients might conceivably develop an adult-onset type 1 diabetes during or after pregnancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>.\n\n【9】In our personal experience, these are the first cases of adult-onset type 1 diabetes occurring during pregnancy and our findings confirm the importance of identifying the risk of patients developing this type of diabetes.\n\n【10】Most studies have demonstrated that the presence of diabetes-related autoimmunity in patients with GDM predicts the occurrence of type 1 diabetes; the risk of developing overt diabetes is higher when two or more autoantibodies are present (particularly GAD and ICA). Füchtenbusch et al. have reported that two years after delivery the risk was 17% with one antibody, 31% with two antibodies, and 84% with three antibodies positivity. In the study of Nilsson et al. 83% of the patients with GDM and positivity for at least one autoantibody developed type 1 diabetes 4 years after delivery. Moreover, GAD-Ab shows the highest sensitivity for type 1 diabetes prediction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In addition, it has been found out that women with GDM and autoantibodies more frequently need insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>; however, it has to be underlined that these patients are younger than those included in our case reports.\n\n【12】Up to now there are not guidelines about which patients should be checked for autoantibodies. According to our experience, we suggest that women with GDM showing clinical features as no family history of diabetes, normal pre-pregnancy BMI, need for insulin therapy in the early weeks of pregnancy, and age higher than 35 years, shall be preferably tested for autoimmunity.\n\n【13】Pregnant patients at risk of type 1 diabetes should be identified to avoid the maternal and fetal complications of this form of diabetes developing during the pregnancy and, very importantly, the acute onset of diabetes afterwards. Women found anti-GAD positive should be considered at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes and should consequently be regarded as potential future candidates for immunomodulatory strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV) images of the brain, CVST usually manifests as a filling defect of the dural venous sinuses. Brain parenchymal involvement in CVST can be ranged from parenchymal oedema to haemorrhagic infarctions. Though the most frequent cause of haemorrhagic infarction in brain is CVST, other rare causes such as cerebral venous outflow obstruction due to neck vein pathology have been reported. We report a rare case of haemorrhagic brain infarctions secondary to bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis in a 17-year-old woman, who has presented with worsening headache and seizures. She had high susceptibility of getting venous thrombosis for being a young female on oral contraceptive pills. While reporting a rare cause of cerebral haemorrhagic infarctions, this case report highlights the need for having a high degree of suspicion to diagnose CVST. Further, this case report emphasises the value of prompt and adequate imaging of neck veins if the haemorrhagic infarction presents with patent cerebral venous sinuses.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is an uncommon disease, annually affects nearly 5 per million adults, accounts for 5% of young strokes, and shows female predominance. Early diagnosis and timely treatment of CVST would prevent serious neurological complications. However, a vague presentation of CVST warrants a high degree of suspicion to diagnose early 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The CVST manifests as a filling defect of cerebral veins in contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is as sensitive as CT venography in detecting CVST, in which CVST again manifests as a filling defect in venous sinus. Though the brain parenchymal involvement is not an essential feature of CVST, if present, brain involvement can be ranged from parenchymal oedema to haemorrhagic infarctions. Pathophysiology of brain parenchymal involvement is explained by poor venous drainage and associated high venous pressure that leads to poor arterial perfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Though the most prevalent cause of poor venous drainage in haemorrhagic cerebral infarction is CVST, other rare causes have also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Here, we report a rare case of bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis as the cause of poor venous drainage that leads to cerebral haemorrhagic infarctions.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 17-year-old married woman presented with three episodes of generalised tonic-clonic seizures. She was confused on admission. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 11: she opened her eyes to verbal command; verbal response was confused; showed withdrawal motor response to pain. She had on and off headaches for the last ten years that worsened to become a persistent headache for the last two weeks. She vomited intermittently for last seven days prior to the admission. Her past medical, surgical, and family histories were unremarkable with no history of abnormal coagulability, malignancy, trauma, or recent infection. Notably, she did not involve in activities that can cause neck trauma or repetitive neck compressions. She was nulliparous and on oral contraceptives for an unknown duration.\n\n【8】On examination, she was afebrile; vital parameters were normal. Except for a low GCS score as described earlier, general, systemic, and neurological examinations were unremarkable. No localising or lateralizing signs were found; the pupils were equally reacting to light. Since she was confused, cognitive behavioural assessment was not performed. Initial blood investigations were normal. Following initial resuscitation, she was transferred to the Radiology unit for computed tomography scan (CT) of the brain.\n\n【9】Initial assessment was performed with noncontrast CT scan of the brain and has shown a large haemorrhagic infarction in the left frontal lobe anteroinferiorly, with minimal oedema of the surrounding brain parenchyma. Even though there was minimal mass effect on the frontal horn of the left lateral ventricle, no significant midline displacement was found. Additionally, mild cerebral parenchymal oedema was found in the parasagittal region of the right frontal lobe  with no significant mass effect or midline shift. No evidence of extra-axial or intraventricular haemorrhages was found. The density of dural venous sinuses was equal to the density of the basilar artery; no hyperdensity in venous sinuses to suggest acute dural venous sinus thrombosis (CVST).\n\n【10】(a)\n\n【11】(b)\n\n【12】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【14】Noncontrast CT brain at presentation, indicating (a) haemorrhagic infarction in the left frontal lobe (black arrow) and (b) focal cerebral oedema in the right frontal lobe (white arrow).\n\n【15】Three days later, her condition further deteriorated: opened eyes only to pain; produced only incomprehensible sounds; limb flexion observed for pain stimulation; frequent seizure episodes not responded to medications. Hence, she underwent pre- and postcontrast-enhanced CT scan of the brain and the neck. Precontrast CT brain has revealed a new haemorrhagic infarction in the right frontal lobe, while the left frontal infarction has involved in size . The CT venography has shown bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis that extends from the jugular bulb to the confluence of subclavian veins . Despite having filling defects in the central part of the veins, periphery of internal jugular veins were opacified with contrast, suggesting partial recanalisation of thrombosed veins. However, the dural venous sinuses and both subclavian veins were patent . Bone window images revealed normal appearance of bilateral styloid processes; there was no impingement of styloid processes on the internal jugular veins.\n\n【16】(a)\n\n【17】(b)\n\n【18】(c)\n\n【19】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【21】Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT brain and neck, indicating (a) haemorrhagic infarctions in both frontal lobes ; oedema in the left occipital lobe with loss of grey white demarcation (arrow head).

Despite adequate treatment, one week after the admission, the patient succumbed due to diffuse cerebral oedema and transtentorial herniation.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【29】We have presented a rare case of bilateral internal jugular vein thrombosis associated with cerebral haemorrhagic infarctions. Though the frequent aetiology of cerebral haemorrhagic infarctions is dural venous sinus thrombosis, in our case extensive neck vein thrombosis was the aetiology. Even though cases with CVST propagating into the internal jugular veins and vice versa have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, isolated internal jugular vein thrombosis manifested as venous infarctions is almost unheard.\n\n【30】The proposed mechanism for cerebral venous (haemorrhagic) infarctions is reduced venous return that leads to high pressure in intracerebral veins. High venous pressure consequently leads to poor arterial perfusion, cell necrosis, and haemorrhages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. If a venous infarction is evident in a patient with patent cerebral venous sinuses, other rare causes of reduced venous return, such as neck vein pathology, have to be excluded 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Typically, patients with internal jugular vein thrombosis or obstruction present with transient facial oedema, with or without associated neck swelling. However, the majority of neck vein thrombosis present with subtle signs such as pain and swelling at the angle of the jaw 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. The atypical presentation of internal jugular vein thrombosis in our patient has rendered the diagnosis difficult. Perhaps, worsening of the existing headache had indicated the onset of internal jugular vein thrombosis. At presentation, the thrombi in internal jugular veins were recanalised indicating subacute presentation. For being a young female who was on oral contraceptives, our patient was considered to be at high-risk category to develop venous thrombosis. Imaging studies to evaluate veins particularly are recommended for the patients with headaches of uncertain diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The incidence of internal jugular vein thrombosis (IJVT) is still unknown, while internal jugular vein catheterisation (incidence 66% of total catheterisations) being the most frequent secondary cause 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Malignancy, neck trauma, infections, and hypercoagulable status are considered as the other frequent secondary causes of IJVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Similar to our case study, the diagnosis of IJVT can be made with CT or MR venogram studies or with venous Doppler study of the neck. Venogram studies report higher sensitivity rates over Doppler studies due to excellent contrast resolution among soft tissue. CT and MR venogram studies report nearly equal sensitivity in detecting CVST. Contrast-enhanced MR venogram said to be with a higher sensitivity compared to former. Although we have reported cerebral venous infarction, as a rare complication of IJVT, pulmonary embolism (10.3%) and post thrombosis syndrome (14.4%) are considered to be the frequent complications of IJVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【33】CT imaging of the brain reliably differentiates venous infarctions from arterial infarctions. Contrary to arterial infarctions, venous infarctions are frequently associated with parenchymal haemorrhages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The typical cerebral venous infarctions (in noncontrast CT brain) are flame-shaped heterogeneous (mixed hypo- and hyperdense) areas in the brain parenchyma, which are commonly subcortical in position. The hyperdense areas of the lesion represent parenchymal haemorrhages. Arterial infarctions are wedge shaped, involving both cerebral cortex and medulla, which are usually confined to an arterial territory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Differentiation of arterial infarction from a venous infarction is crucial owing to different patient treatment and management protocols 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【34】The prognosis of CVST is multifactorial. As in our case, the venous thrombosis that present with haemorrhagic infarction delineates an unfavourable outcome. Other factors associated with poor prognosis are old age, deep cerebral vein thrombosis, associated cerebral infection, or a cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Such patients need intense monitoring and treatment to prevent short- and long-term squeal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Identifying the aetiology of venous infarction is empirical for successful patient management. Frequently the aetiology of venous infarction is CVST. In noncontrast CT brain, CVST manifested as hyperdense dural venous sinus. However, venous sinus hyperdensity was seen only in 25% of CVST. False-positive venous sinus hyperdensity can be a typical manifestation in dehydration, increased haematocrit, or the presence of concomitant subarachnoid haemorrhages. Similar to our patient, the dehydrated patients have equal densities in both cerebral arteries and veins.\n\n【36】Presence of CVST can be confirmed using a postcontrast CT scan of the brain, preferably in a CT venography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Typically, the location of cerebral haemorrhagic infarction is related to the site of the CVST. Since the parenchymal changes of CVST is often related to the venous drainage territory of the brain, the site of infarction can be used as a guide to locate the CVST. Often bilateral parasagittal infarctions represent superior sagittal sinus thrombosis; ipsilateral tempero-occipital and/or cerebellar infarctions may represent transverse sinus thrombosis; and bilateral periventricular, basal ganglia, and thalamic infarctions represent deep cerebral vein thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. Considering all, authors recommend CT or MRI venography of the brain and neck to diagnose or exclude venous thrombosis, for every patient with haemorrhagic infarctions present with patent cerebral venous sinuses. Considering the availability and being able to perform at the bedside, the Doppler study of the neck veins is a complementary option to CT and MR venography. However, the sensitivity of venous Doppler in detecting thrombosed vein is much lower than CT or MR venography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【37】While presenting a rare case of cerebral venous infarction secondary to internal jugular vein thrombosis (IJVT), authors would like to highlight the following limitations. In this case, IJVT is evaluated only with contrast-enhanced CT study, and the majority of radiological features of IJVT would be described if venous Doppler studies of the neck and MR venography are also combined. Confirming the association between venous infarction and IJVT is suggested using an adequate sample of similar cases. Further studies with a sufficient sample size are recommended to evaluate the prognosis and treatment efficacy of IJVT.\n\n【38】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【39】Since early diagnosis and treatment determine favourable patient outcome, the patients with cerebral haemorrhagic infarctions should image promptly and adequately to diagnose associated venous pathology, such as CVST, jugular vein thrombosis, or any other form of venous outflow obstruction.\n\n【40】#### Consent\n\n【41】Informed consent has been obtained from the patient’s husband.\n\n【42】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【43】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this report.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Herein, we present an ESD-treated lesion with deep sm invasion removed without complications, such as bleeding or perforation, from a patient at high-risk for surgical intervention. A successful ESD was achieved although the sm invasion was greater than 1000 m from the muscularis mucosae, and the nonlifting sign was positive. It is our belief that this procedure should be performed at least in patients at high-risk for surgical intervention. At present, we have removed 16 lesions with deep sm invasion by ESD without complications, demonstrating that deep sm cancer can be successfully resected by this technique as a local resection. Herein, we report on one of these cases\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In Japan, as shown in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>, EMR is the treatment of choice for superficial early colorectal cancer due to the minimal invasiveness and efficacy of the procedure. However, when dealing with flat lesions greater than 20 mm in diameter, the rate of piecemeal resection, incomplete removal, and local recurrence after EMR increases, as discussed in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. Endoscopic submucosal (sm) dissection (ESD) is a recently used technique that enables en-bloc resection of large colorectal tumors allowing a more precise histopathological analysis of the resected specimen, as shown in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. However, as cited in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>, colorectal ESD has not been widely adopted even in Japan mainly due to its technical difficulty and increased risk of perforation.\n\n【4】Herein, we report on an ESD-treated lesion with deep sm invasion removed from a patient at highrisk for surgical intervention. The role of ESD for lesions with sm invasion greater than 1000  m from the muscularis mucosae is discussed.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 79-year-old male was diagnosed to have a lesion of 28 mm in diameter located in the rectosigmoid colon, with a 0- macroscopic type . Pathological findings of biopsy specimens revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. The nonlifting sign was positive. As discussed by Matsuda 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, high magnifying observation with crystal violet staining showed an invasive pattern with irregular and distorted epithelial crypts in the demarcated area suggesting sm invasion greater than 1000  m from the muscularis mucosae. Open surgery was the first choice offered to the patient. However, as he was considered to be at high risk for surgical intervention due to his history of two acute myocardial infarction episodes and an abdominal aorta bypass procedure, endoscopic resection of the lesion was recommended to avoid open surgery.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Conventional view of a 0-IIa+IIc lesion located in the rectosigmoid colon.

The en-bloc resection and removal of the specimen was completed in approximately 80 minutes without any complication .

Discussion\n\n【19】According to the Paris classification of superficial neoplastic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, lesions with sm invasion of less than 1000  m from the muscularis mucosae should be removed by ESD. In contrast, lesions with sm invasion exceeding 1000  m are currently considered for surgical resection, as shown in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. In this particular case, due to the patient’s critical heart condition, ESD was performed although the sm invasion exceeded 1000  m in depth, and the nonlifting sign was positive.\n\n【20】At the National Cancer Center Hospital a total of 16 cases with deep invasive sm lesions have been successfully removed by ESD, with negative lateral and vertical margins observed during histopathological analysis of the resected specimen.\n\n【21】During ESD for sm cancer, a direct observation of the sm and muscle layers possibilitates a total sm resection. If the lesion has invaded the muscularis propria though, ESD should not be performed because of the risk of colonic perforation. However, as discussed by Saito 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, the use of the B-knife in ESD has decreased the perforation rate. By using this device, a safer procedure is achieved probably because the electric current is centered to the tip of the needle, as shown in 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【22】This case has demonstrated that the removal of lesions with sm invasion greater than 1000  m from the muscularis mucosae can be successfully resected by ESD as a local resection.

Our case was 53-year-old man admitted to emergency department with symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and general fatigue in February 2012. His laboratory findings showed hypercalcemia and thrombocytopenia. CT showed a large multinodular mass in the right lobe and, extending through left lobe of the liver. We considered the diagnosis of hypercalcemia of malignancy with elevated calcium levels and suppressed PTH level with the existence of skeletal bone metastasis and the absence of parathyroid gland pathology. Treatment of hypercalcemia with IV saline, furosemide, and calcitonin improved the patient symptoms. After the 8th day of admission, calcium level, thrombocytopenia, and other symptoms were normalized. Patient was sustained surgically inoperable and transferred to medical oncology department for the purpose of palliative chemotherapy and intended radiotherapy for bone metastasis. Hypercalcemia relapsed 4 weeks after discharge and patient died at the 5th month after admission due to disseminated metastasis. We should be aware of CC with symptomatic hypercalcemia and rarely low platelet count. The correction of hypercalcemia provides symptomatic relief and stability of patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】CC is a well-known malignancy which has a poor prognosis. Its prevalence has been estimated to be 5.3% in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 17.5% in patient with CC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Generally, hypercalcemia with an advanced disease and the interval between the discovery of hypercalcemia and the patient death is typically less than one year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Although chemotherapy for CC is administered to inoperable patients, the results are largely disappointing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】53-year-old man was admitted to our clinic at February 2012 with symptoms of general fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting. His past history was unremarkable and he only complained of 20 kilos' weight loss extending over 4 months. Physical examination was unremarkable other than an enlarged liver extending to 5 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory tests showed WBC of 9430 K/μL, hbg of 12.4 g/dL, hct of 36.2%, plt of 2000 K/μL, calcium of 14.9 mg/dL (8.6–10.2), phosphate of 1.8 mg/dL (2.6–4.5), albumin of 3.4 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 295 通用删除7(英):<u>(40–130)</u>, and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) of 363 U/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–60)</u>. PTH was suppressed to 5 pg/dL 通用删除7(英):<u>(15–65)</u>, and CA 19-9 was as high as 2384 U/mL (<27). Patient consulted endocrinology and hematology departments and medical treatment was applied. Peripheral blood smear staining showed thrombocytopenia. Thorax and abdominal CT, abdominal MRI, and FDG-PET studies were performed. Abdominal USG showed a large tumor with hypoechogen pattern in right lobe of the liver. CT revealed  cm size hypoattenuating multinodular tumor mainly filling the right lobe of the liver with irregular boundaries (Figure 1(a)). Thorax and brain CT were normal. T1-weighted MR images showed the tumor as a hypointense area and T2-weighted images showed it as a slightly hyperintense area with contrast enhancement of peripheral zone being liable to confluent multiple lesions in right lobe of liver with retrocaval and aortocaval multiple metastatic lymphadenopathy and metastatic lesions on right iliac and right femoral bones (Figure 1(b)). Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed pathological signal intensity of 10.7 of a standardized uptake value in CC of liver, in renal hilum, in bilateral aortocaval lymph nodes, and in six places of bones as C-5, T-11, and S-1 vertebral corpus, right iliac bone, and left and right ischium (Figure 1(c)).\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| (a) CT scan,  cm size hypoattenuating multinodular tumor mainly filling the right lobe of the liver with irregular boundaries.

After the patient stability and normal platelet count were obtained, we performed USG guided trucut liver biopsy. USG guided trucut liver biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CC. Neoplastic cells stained positively by cytokeratins 7 and 19. Patient was evaluated surgically as inoperable with evidence of radiological and pathological findings and was directed to medical oncology department for purpose of palliative chemotherapy with intended radiotherapy for bone metastasis (Figures 1(d), 1(e), and 1(f)).\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| After treatment, relationship with calcium and thrombocyte level. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】At the end of first month of the oncologic treatment, patient was readmitted to hospital with worsening of consciousness state and relapsed hypercalcemia (11.5 mg/dL), while thrombocyte count was normal. Calcium level was higher than normal levels but not as high as first admittance to lead to thrombocytopenia again. Medical treatment of hypercalcemia rapidly stabilized the patient consciousness state. In spite of the chemoradiation treatment, disseminated metastasis developed and patient died in the 5th month of diagnosis.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】CC is a rare neoplasm which accounts for approximately 3% of the gastrointestinal cancers worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although surgical resection remains the only curative treatment, most patients with CC are not operable candidates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Hypercalcemia is a serious and frequent complication and a sign of advanced stage of malignant disease, occurring in 10% to 20% of patients with malignancies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It has been estimated to be of 5.3% in patients with HCC and 17.5% in patients with CC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Approximately 85% of patients with cancer and hypercalcemia have metastatic bone disease. The remaining 15% have some other etiology for hypercalcemia as paraneoplastic syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy (HHM) is characterised by elevated calcium, low serum phosphorus, low PTH, and low vitamin D levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The type of hypercalcemia has been associated with the abnormal secretion of various proteins, including PTH-rP by the tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. HHM is usually manifested as certain type of malignancies and is generally associated with squamous-cell carcinomas of esophagus, lung, head, and neck. HHM is rarely seen with CC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The present case had multiple metastatic bone lesions. So, predominantly, these lesions were thought of as the reason for hypercalcemia. And the mechanism of hypercalcemia had no effect on treatment of our case, so we did not need to differentiate etiology of hypercalcemia.\n\n【15】Medical treatment of hypercalcemia is composed of IV hydration with saline, loop diuretics, and antiresorptive agents such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Thrombocytopenia in these cases may occur for many reasons and can be seen in some liver tumors like angiosarcomas and hemangiomas. The relationship between hypercalcemia and thrombocytopenia is not clear but in literature it is stated that there is correlation between hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia also impairs granulocyte function by interfering with ATP synthesis, increasing platelet diameter, and shortening platelet survival so it triggers the marked platelet disappearence. And these lead to thrombocytopenia and reactive megakaryocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In this case thrombocyte level was as low as 2000 K/μL. But there was not any spontaneous bleeding. So we did not need transfusion. The patient was treated with IV saline, diuretics, and calcitonin.\n\n【17】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【18】We presented a case of metastatic CC with symptomatic hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and low platelet count. With increased calcium levels and suppressed PTH with existence of metastatic bone disease clinician should recognize this rare presentation of CC. The correction of hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia provides correction of thrombocytopenia.\n\n【19】#### Consent\n\n【20】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s and his first degree relatives for publication of this case and involving images.\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Authors’ Contribution</u>\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Muharrem Battal and Ozgur Bostanci were involved in management and treatment of this patient, Bayindir Gürbulak and Oguzhan Karatepe drafted the paper, and Yasar Ozdenkaya reviewed the literature.

Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is an aggressive Epstein–Barr virus-associated T cell lymphoma. Clinical syndromes of AITL are not confined to fever and lymphadenopathy, and patients may initially present with polyclonal plasma cell proliferation, which may obscure the underlying disease of AITL, delaying diagnosis. Case Presentation. Here, we report two AITL patients with excessive plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and ascites even mimicking plasma cell leukemia. Both of them had poor endings. Conclusions. Our report emphasizes the complexity of the clinical manifestations of AITL, which aims to increase the alertness of physicians and improve the rate of early diagnosis. Integrated diagnostic approaches such as histopathology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular biology are essential for accurate diagnosis and precise therapy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is an Epstein–Barr virus-associated neoplasm of CD4+ T follicular helper cells (TFH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Patients usually present with B syndrome, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and immune-related syndrome/signs. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia and various autoimmune manifestations are distinct features of AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Histologically, the architecture of lymph node is partial or complete effacement with proliferation of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) and high endothelial venules (HEVs). Small to medium-sized neoplastic lymphocytes are present in a polymorphous inflammatory background containing histiocytes, eosinophils, reactive lymphocytes, and immunoblasts. The immunoblasts consist of early stage plasma cell (PC), lymphocytes with plasmacytoid features, and large plasmacytoid cells with blast-like nucleusi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that the neoplastic T cells express most pan-T cell antigens (e.g. CD3, CD2, and CD5), and at least 2-3 TFH-associated antigens consist of CD4, ICOS, CXCL13, CD279/PD1, CD10, BCL6, and CCR5 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The absence of surface CD3 and the coexpression of CD4/CD10 represent the typical phenotypic aberrancy of AITL by flow cytometry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Recurrent mutations in RHOA<sup>G17V</sup> (Ras homology family member A), TET2 (tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2), DNMT3A (DNA methyl transferase 3 alpha), and IDH2 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, mitochondrial) are genetic features of AITL, followed by mutations of some T cell receptor- (TCR-) related genes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. IDH2<sup>R172</sup> mutations are relatively specific to AITL with an incidence of 20–30%, especially co-occurring with chromosome (Chr5) gain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. IDH2 mutant cells in AITL may be sensitive to alkylating agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Cytogenetically, gain of Chr5, Chr3, and Chr21 is often observed in AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Reactive polyclonal plasmacytosis occurs in various situations, such as viral infection (EBV, parvovirus B19, and hepatitis), autoimmune diseases, and serum sickness. Excessive plasmacytosis in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) associated with hypergammaglobulinemia in AITL have been reported in the past few years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–21\\]</u>. Early diagnosis can be very challenging. Here, we present two male patients with excessive polyclonal PC proliferation in BM, PB, and ascites. Both of them had poor endings. The purpose of this article is to highlight the complexity of the clinical features of AITL to enable physicians recognize the disease at an early stage. Integrated diagnostic approaches such as histopathology, flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and molecular biology are essential for accurate diagnosis and precise therapy.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Clinical Cases\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 69-year-old man with a medical history of atrial fibrillation was admitted to our hospital due to fever for one month. Laboratory tests showed white blood cells (WBC) 14.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, hemoglobin (Hb) 113 g/L, platelet (PLT) count 85.6 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and fibrinogen 0.96 g/L. Serum globulin increased to 72.9 g/L. Polyclonal high gamma globulin was observed in serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) (IgG 70.3 g/L, IgA 16.10 g/L, and IgM 3.32 g/L). Chest computerized tomography (CT) revealed generalized lymphadenopathy, significantly enlarged left and right atriums, pulmonary hypertension, and splenomegaly. The 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram monitor showed atrial fibrillation and ST-T changes. Atrial fibrillation was not treated regularly; diltiazem hydrochloride and enoxaparin sodium were suggested by a cardiovascular physician. Concerning the lower fibrinogen and PLT count of the patient, heparin was not given for anticoagulation.\n\n【8】(a)\n\n【9】(b)\n\n【10】(c)\n\n【11】(d)\n\n【12】(e)\n\n【13】(f)\n\n【14】(g)\n\n【15】(h)\n\n【16】(i)\n\n【17】(j)\n\n【18】(k)\n\n【19】(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j)   \n(k)\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【21】(a) BM aspirates suggesting plasma cell proliferation (Wright’s stain) (×1000).

(i) B cells positive for CD20 (×400). (j) Multiparameter flow cytometry showing polyclonal plasma cells proliferation in the bone marrow. (k) Multiparameter flow cytometry showing polyclonal B cells in the bone marrow.\n\n【22】Morphologically, PC accounted for ∼54% in BM aspiration (Figure 1(a)) and ∼44% in PB smear (Figure 1(b)). Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in BM showed polyclonal PC proliferation with a proportion of ∼45.9% (Figure 1(j)). MFC and TCR/IgH receptor gene rearrangement tests were negative in BM and PB.\n\n【23】After BM and lymph node (LN) biopsies were obtained, the patient received symptomatic treatment and fever was controlled. Plasma exchange could temporarily decrease levels of globulin. One week later, he complained of drowsiness and inability to lift his upper limbs, and thereafter, he gradually developed lethargy and progressive decline in blood oxygen saturation. Cervical LN biopsy suggested angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that tumor cells express CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD43, and PD1, and they were negative for CD20, CD10, and BCL6. CD21, CD23, and CD35 showed irregular FDCs proliferation (Figures 1(e)–1(i)). Rare small lymphoid cells were positive for EBV (by EBER in situ hybridization). The results of this patient’s examination are shown in Figure 1. The diagnosis of AITL was established, and the patient received low-dose COP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 400 mg, vindesine sulfate 2 mg, and dexamethasone 15 mg). However, severe respiratory distress emerged on the third day of chemotherapy, and the patient eventually died of respiratory and circulatory failure.\n\n【24】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【25】A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of fever and cytopenia for 2 months. He went to a local hospital initially. Laboratory tests showed Hb 83 g/L, PLT count 53 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, and serum globulin 68.8 g/L. The T-SPOT test was positive. Ultrasound examination revealed right pleural effusion, abdominal effusion, and generalized lymphadenopathy. No acid-fast bacilli or malignant tumor cells were found in ascites. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of left cervical LN was negative. He received a diagnostic antituberculosis therapy, which suspended in the fifth day due to sudden high fever, and pleural effusion was increased. Thereafter, he went to the tuberculosis specialist hospital, and no acid-fast bacilli were found in the pleural and ascites effusion. Finally, two months later, after clinical symptoms appear, he was referred to our hospital. Laboratory tests showed WBC 6.8 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, Hb 53 g/L, and PLT count 42 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Serum globulin was more than 100 g/L. SPEP and IFE demonstrated polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia (IgA 14.7 g/L, IgG 89.4 g/L, IgM 6.73 g/L, and IgG4 4.96 g/L) and Coomb’s test was positive. Human immunodeﬁciency virus, sera cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B serology, and hepatitis C serology were negative. Plasma EBV DNA was 1.19 × 10<sup>3</sup> copies/ml, and seven days later, it was quantified by qRT-PCR as 3.768 × 10<sup>6</sup> copies/2.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells, EBV-infected B cells. Symptomatic treatment of anti-infection, red blood cell transfusion, and plasma exchange was failed to prevent disease progression.\n\n【26】(a)\n\n【27】(b)\n\n【28】(c)\n\n【29】(d)\n\n【30】(e)\n\n【31】(f)\n\n【32】(g)\n\n【33】(h)\n\n【34】(i)\n\n【35】(j)\n\n【36】(k)\n\n【37】(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) (j)   \n(k)\n\n【38】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【39】(a) Bone marrow aspirate suggesting Rouleaux formation and plasma cell proliferation (Wrights stain) (×1000).

(l) Multiparameter flow cytometry showing mature B cells with light chain negative in ascites.\n\n【40】LN immunohistochemistry revealed tumor cells with CD3, CD5, PD1, and BCL2 positive and CD10 negative, suggesting AITL, which was verified by ancillary examinations results. The results of this patient’s examination are shown in Table 1 and Figure 2. A diagnosis of AITL was established, and the patient received a cycle of R-CHOP regimen (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone). Serum globulin was decreased to 84.8 g/L on the fourth day of chemotherapy. However, polyserous effusions and serum globulin levels had not been improved. The blood coagulation disorder is worse than before, and the performance of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) appears. Ultimately, the patient abandoned treatment and discharged.\n\n【41】Table 1 \n\n【42】Ancillary examination results of BM, ascites, and LN.\n\n【43】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【44】Clinical procedures of AITL are diverse and aggressive. BM, spleen, skin, and liver are the most common extranodal involvement sites. Effusion/edema/ascites occurs in 25–53% of patients and are usually nonneoplastic. BM involvement can be seen in 28–60% patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. MFC seems to be more sensitive to detect involvement than morphology in BM. The neoplastic T cells ranged 0.1–20% of total cells examined by MFC (median, 0.6%) in morphology-negative patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The reason may be that AITL often have a rich background of reactive cells, resulting in a low proportion of tumor cells. However, BM aspirate only counts 200 nucleated cells, which may cause a decrease in sensitivity. It is worth noting that flow cytometry still has diagnostic pitfalls in the diagnosis of T-NHL. On the one hand, due to the polymorphism of the phenotype of T lymphocytes, reactive T lymphocytes may have changes in the expression intensity of pan-T antigens. But the clonality of T cells cannot be identified like B lymphocytes using restricted expression of light chains. The detection of T cell receptor β\\-chain constant region 1 (TRBC 1) may be helpful, and its polyclonal expression can play a role in exclusion, but the monoclonal expression of TRBC1 does not confirm that it must be an abnormal clone. On the other hand, in the following situations, the tissue samples are contaminated by formaldehyde or apoptosis too fast, and the cells lose their viability; there are not enough channels to detect pan-T markers, such as four-color flow cytometry; there are not enough cells for analysis, such as fine-needle aspiration samples, or the proportion of abnormal cells is extremely low; or the abnormal T cells only had changes in expression intensity instead of loss of pan-T antigens expression; or the analysts does not have enough experience; all of these circumstances can lead to negative results. As to AITL, according to our preliminary experiences, apart from the above reasons, abnormal T lymphocytes do not express T cell receptor αβ in nearly ∼57% (51/90) cases. It is impossible to use TRBC1 to judge the monoclonality of suspicious T cells. In addition, AITL has a subtype of sCD3+CD4+CD7-phenotype, the pan-T markers only loss CD7, the expression intensity of CD3 is isointensity, or slightly diminished compared with normal T cells. There are a small amount of sCD3+CD4+CD7-cells in the normal bone marrow, and the proportion of this group of cells may increase under reactive conditions; this kind of AITL is prone to be missed. The addition of more markers of follicular helper T lymphocytes can be helpful to increase positive rate. At last, the bone marrow invasion of AITL is not 100%, so the negative detection in the bone marrow cannot rule out the diagnosis. In patients without BM involvement, trilineage cytopenias and polyclonal plasmacytosis can be observed as secondary features. In our report, patients presented with hypergammaglobulinemia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, and one patient had polyserous cavity effusions. BM and ascites examinations were performed prior to the diagnosis of AITL. BM aspirate revealed significantly Rouleaux formation with excessive plasmacytosis, mimicking plasma cell leukemia. Paradoxically, PC and immune globulin were both polyclonal. There was no evidence of BM involvement in both of them. Large B cells without surface and cytoplasm light chain expressed were observed in ascites of the second patients by MFC, resembling diffuse large B cell lymphoma. The negative of IgH receptor gene arrangement was nonsupport. With the experience obtained from the first patient, we suggested the probability of AITL of the second one, and rebiopsy was recommended.\n\n【45】LN biopsy is indispensable but not always available. Integrated diagnostic approaches including MFC and molecular genetics examinations are essential for accurate diagnosis. As to the second patient, histopathology suggested AITL by reexamination of LN, and neoplastic T cells detected by MFC and the clonal of TCR gene rearrangement verified the diagnosis. But the immunophenotyping of tumor cells by MFC in LN were CD2+, CD7−, sCD3+, CD4+, and CD10−, not the typical sCD3−/CD4+ or CD10+ immunophenotyping. It probably cannot distinguish AITL from other peripheral T cell lymphoma. But the usage of MFC can quickly exclude reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, T cell rich large B cell lymphoma, and plasma cell diseases, which are difficult to differentiate by pathology. The NGS test detected the recurrent mutations of TET2 and IDH2<sup>R172k</sup>, which further verified the diagnosis, and may be potential therapeutic targets.\n\n【46】AITL have a dismal prognosis with a five-year overall survival (OS) of 32–41% and a seven-year OS of 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. Older age (>60 years old), elevated WBC and IgA levels, thrombocytopenia, high international prognostic index and prognostic index for PTCL-U scores, and number of extranodal involvement sites >1 were adverse factors for OS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 25, 26\\]</u>. Patients with AITL with polyserous effusions seem to have poor endings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 28\\]</u>. Plasma cell hyperplasia seems to have no prognostic significance in AITL patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. We reviewed the clinical history, diagnosis, and treatment process to speculate the possible causes of poor endings. The first patient had a history of atrial fibrillation without regular treatment. Excessively elevated PC may lead to blood stickiness, which may increase the burden on the heart and further induce atrial fibrillation. The treatment to prevent thrombosis formation was unavailable because of lower fibrinogen and PLT count. The manifestations of unable to lift limbs, somnolence, and the sudden decline in blood oxygen saturation lead to the hypothesis of cerebral thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism. Cerebral infarction may be the direct cause of death. We speculate that the underlying cardiocerebrovascular diseases may make prognosis worse in patients with AITL and excessive plasma proliferation, consistent with Kelsey Sokol’s report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. The second patient presented with severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and polyserous cavity effusion at onset, excessive polyclonal PC emerged in BM, PB, and ascites without neoplasm T cells infiltration. The T-SPOT test was positive; he was initially misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. The delayed diagnosis time superadded multiple adverse prognosis indicators that lead to poor conditions of the patient.\n\n【47】The relationship between excessive proliferation of PC and AITL has not been expounded comprehensively. TFH is helpful for differentiation of B cells to PC or memory B cells in lymphoid tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. In the AITL-NGO mouse model, AITL tumor cells were proved to act as TFH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. PC proliferation was accompanied by extensive secretion of IL-6, and the secretion of immune globulin can be completely stopped by adding anti-IL-6 and anti-CD126 (IL-6 receptor) monoclonal antibodies, which manifested that IL-6 is necessary for PC proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. The ultimate differentiation of EBV-infected B cells into PC was related to EBV replication, which is suppressed by a strong T cell immune response in EBV-seropositive healthy people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. EBV-positive B cells can be detected in 66–86% patients of AITL, on account of immunosuppression due to AITL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. Tumor T cells, cytokines, and EBV infection may potentially cause polyclonal plasma cell expansion. In our second patient, EBV copies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was increased to millions, IL-6 levels elevated in sera, and these results were consistent with the past literatures. Whether PC component be a reflection of earlier disease or not should be further explored.\n\n【48】In conclusion, the clinical manifestations of AITL patients are diverse. AITL should be highly suspected in patients presenting with exuberant polyclonal PCs in extranodal sites, combined with syndromes of generalized lymphadenopathy, high EBV copies, and presence of autoimmune antibodies. Integrated diagnostic approaches are essential for accurate diagnosis and precise therapy. Cardiocerebrovascular diseases may be an adverse factor for patients with AITL and significant plasmacytosis, which need to be verified in the future by more samples.

Here, we report the case of a 46-year-old male with a swelling of the right maxilla. After proper diagnosis, he was treated with enucleation and curettage of the tumor. The defect was filled with a pedicled buccal fat pad flap. The mesenchymal origin from the dental follicle of the fibromyxoma is the most plausible explanation. Radiological examination with MRI, CT, and conventional radiography contributes to the differential diagnosis from other benign tumors, such as the ameloblastoma. Its management is surgical and comprises enucleation and curettage or en bloc resection. Patients must be monitored for at least two years postoperatively in order to diagnose possible recurrence. According to the literature, the maxilla is a rare location of a fibromyxoma and, to our knowledge, our case is the 30th presented case of a fibromyxoma of the maxilla.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Odontogenic fibromyxoma represents a rare slow-growing benign neoplasm, usually occurring in the 2nd and 3rd decades of life, rarely in children or adults over 50 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. It is described as a myxoma with abundant collagen fibres. Myxomas in general represent from 2.3% to 17.7% of all odontogenic tumors with fibromyxomas representing a small number of all myxomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Their size varies and in case of multilocular myxomas it may reach 4 cm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. They do not metastasize to the lymphatics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.

Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 46-year-old male was referred to the outpatient department of the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic of the General Hospital “G. Papanikolaou” of Thessaloniki, with a swelling of the right maxilla. The swelling occurred 8 months prior to the consultation. Facial and mucosal numbness, pain, or tooth mobility was absent.\n\n【7】The medical anamnesis of the patient did not reveal anything in relation to the pathological condition. Radiological investigation by means of a panoramic radiograph was not helpful in diagnosing the lesion. Waters’ view revealed complete obstruction of the right maxillary sinus. A Computed Tomography (CT) imaging of the maxilla revealed a large radiolucent lesion extending from the area of the right canine to the area mesial to the first molar. Examination with Computed Tomography (CT) Scan showed expansion of the walls of the right maxillary sinus, obstruction with low density tissue of the whole cavity, and local erosion of the walls . The intravenous administration of contrast agent showed no enhancement of the lesion. Involvement of the floor of the left maxillary sinus, partial obstruction of the ethmoid sinus, and slight thickening of the mucosa of the left frontal sinus are indicative of a secondary sinusitis. The nasopharynx and lateral pharyngeal spaces were normal.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Axial Computed Tomography (CT) reveals expansion of the walls of the right maxillary sinus, obstruction with low density tissue of the whole cavity, and local erosion of the walls. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】The lesion was approached by means of a lateral rhinotomy incision, with enucleation and curettage of the tumor.\n\n【11】The lesion had a solid consistency and was totally resected .

Exclusion criteria were not relevant papers, interviews, books’ and conferences’ abstracts, comments, replies to author and to editor, and unsupported opinion of an expert. 43 articles met our criteria. In order to record only reports of fibromyxoma and not myxoma, the articles were further sorted, in order to include those reports of fibromyxomas that were mentioned under the general term myxoma. Finally, 19 articles met all criteria and were chosen for further evaluation  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–26\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Table 1 \n\n【22】Reported cases of fibromyxoma of the maxilla.\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Myxoma/fibromyxoma is a rare odontogenic neoplasm. Fibromyxoma is classified as a specific type of myxoma with a higher fibrous/myxoid tissue ratio than myxoma. There is a discrepancy regarding the reports of fibromyxoma, as many of them are classified under the general term “myxoma”, making the review of the literature difficult. According to Dutz and Stout, the term myxoma was first used by Virchow in 1863, but the term fibromyxoma was described by Marcove et al. in 1964 who reported extragnathic locations of fibromyxoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27, 28\\]</u>. We use the term myxoma/fibromyxoma as it is being used in many histopathological books in order to describe myxomas of the jaw bones. The review of the literature for previous reports of fibromyxoma was based on case reports that clearly report a “fibromyxoma”.\n\n【25】Myxomas/fibromyxomas are usually located intraorally most often in the posterior regions of the mandible, its angle and ramus and rarely extraorally 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 29\\]</u>. The maxilla and anterior region of the mandible are rarely affected. The lesion can be diffused or well defined, uni- or multilocular. It is characterized by a mucous or gelatinous grayish-white tissue that replaces the spongy bone and displaces the cortical plates of the jaws 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Root displacement and resorption may be present 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It may refer to hard and also to soft tissues.\n\n【26】Previous theories stress that the lesion derives from the neural sheath or is the result of degeneration of fibromas, lipomas and so forth, due to the chronic irritation and the degenerative processes following tissue anoxemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Recent studies advocate that myxomas/fibromyxomas arise from the mesenchymatous tissue of the dental follicle, thus being described as odontogenic with fibroblasts playing the major role in cell dispersal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This explanation fails to describe soft tissue myxomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. They probably arise from supportive structures of the teeth like the gingiva and the periodontal ligament 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Histopathological characteristics of the myxoma/fibromyxoma are the hypocellularity, the presence of stellate, spindle-shaped cells into a loose myxoid extracellular matrix with cells presenting with thin, long cytoplasmic prolongations that give to the tissue characteristics of immature mesenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. The fibromyxoid lesion may present loci of calcification or ossification and a higher amount of collagen fibres and vessels than a typical myxoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The presence of cells positive for actin fibres suggests that myofibroblasts may play a crucial role in cell proliferation in cooperation with the islands of odontogenic epithelium and mast cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Myxomas are diagnosed with radiological, histological, and histochemical investigation. The radiological investigation reveals homogenous radiolucencies or sclerotic trabeculations with different appearances, like “honeycomb”, “soap bubble”, and “tennis racket” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. In our case, the lesion appeared as a large radiolucent area with no trabeculations.\n\n【29】Radiological examination plays a crucial role for the differential diagnosis of myxomas/fibromyxomas and also between benign myxomas and malignant neoplasms with myxomatous tissue. In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), the lesion shows low-signal intensity in T1 and high-signal intensity in T2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In contrast, Kawai et al. advocate that the high-signal is shown in T1 and not in T2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. These discrepancies may be related to the ratio of fibrous/myxoid tissue, the viscosity, the concentration of proteins, the presence of haemorrhage and the hypocellularity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 31\\]</u>. Immunohistochemical examination uses antibodies against specific biological substances of neuronal, muscular, epithelial, and mesenchymal tissues. The evaluation of the presence of vimentin, an intermediate filament of the cytoskeleton characterises mesenchymal tissues, thus also myxomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Fibromyxomas also contain a high amount of hyaluronic acid 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>.\n\n【30】During the process of differential diagnosis pathological conditions that should be included are ameloblastoma, central haemangioma, fibrous dysplasia, odontogenic cysts, aneurysmal cysts, central gigantocytic granuloma, metastatic neoplasms, well-differentiated liposarcoma, and other rare entities like desmoplastic fibroma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 33\\]</u>.\n\n【31】The main pathological condition that may lead to difficulties in diagnosis is the ameloblastoma, especially when the bony septa are curviform 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. An important characteristic for differential diagnosis is the fact that when a contrast agent (Gd-DTPA) is being administered, in case of the ameloblastoma the MRI shows strong enhancement of the solid portion of the tumor, in contrast to the myxoma that shows homogenous high signal intensity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is also important to mention that root displacement and resorption is not unique in ameloblastoma.\n\n【32】The treatment of the fibromyxoma is surgical and involves enucleation and curettage. The avoidance of recurrence is strongly related to the complete resection of the lesion. The patient should be monitored for at least two years after the surgical intervention due to the higher rate of recurrence during this period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Myxomas/fibromyxomas show a recurrence rate between 25% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> and 43% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This is strongly related to the nature of the lesion, presenting without a sheath, thus making the complete removal difficult. Other odontogenic tumors, like the keratocyst or the ameloblastoma show a higher recurrence rate of 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>–58,3% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u> and 55%–90%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>. The frequency of recurrence of a fibromyxoma of the jaws is higher than that of any other bone thus having a poorer prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[36\\]</u>.\n\n【34】It is stressed that complete resection and peripheral osteotomy is the treatment of choice depending on the size and behaviour of the tumor and results in a lower rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7, 33, 37\\]</u>. Simon et al. suggest that radical resection with a margin of 1,5–2 cm of healthy bone is the treatment of choice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Small bony defects of the maxilla, under 5 cm, can be reconstructed by means of a pedicled buccal fat pad flap (BFP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38, 39\\]</u>. Greater bony defects require the positioning of an obturator prior to the reconstruction with a graft.\n\n【35】In conclusion, the maxilla is a rare location of a fibromyxoma. The radiological examination by means of CT and MRI plays an important role in the diagnosis of a fibromyxoma and in the differential diagnosis from other pathological entities such as the ameloblastoma. Its management is surgical and ranges from enucleation and curettage to complete resection and peripheral osteotomy according to its size. Patients must be monitored for at least two years postoperatively in order to diagnose possible recurrence.\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or organisations that could inappropriately influence or bias our work.

We conducted a review of children who were diagnosed with bronchiectasis due to foreign body retention in a university hospital between 2014 and 2019. Five patents were studied (four boys, one girl; age range: 15 months to 13 years old). Computed tomography showed localized cylindrical bronchiectasis in all five patients. After removal of the foreign body by bronchoscopy, the prognoses were good. Patients with localized cylindrical bronchiectasis should be examined to exclude foreign body. As long as foreign body aspiration is diagnosed early and appropriately removed, the possibility of a lobectomy or even mortality is greatly reduced.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Bronchiectasis is defined as the presence of reversibly or irreversibly widened bronchi due to damage to the bronchial walls. Common causes include postinfectious, aspiration syndromes, defects in host defenses, genetic syndromes, anatomical defects, and external airway compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In contrast, foreign body (FB) obstruction is an uncommon cause of bronchiectasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The causal relationship between cases of FB aspiration and bronchiectasis has not yet been established. In this article, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristic of patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis due to FB retention in our hospital between 2014 and 2019. Here, we wished to provide clinicians with useful data on the characteristics of bronchiectasis that result from FB inhalation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Objectives and Design\n\n【5】We retrospectively reviewed five patients diagnosed with bronchiectasis due to FB retention from January 2014 to January 2019. We analyzed the following patient demographics: sex, age, basic disease, symptoms, signs, the nature of FB, FB localization, period of retention, computed tomography (CT) results, bronchographic findings and prognosis.\n\n【6】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【7】Patients characteristics are listed in Table 1. The five patients comprised four boys and one girl with ages ranging from 15 months to 13 years (mean: 6.7 years). The FB identified included a sunflower seed, teeth, two nut, and a tapioca pearl . The patients presented with recurrent cough, fever, or wheezing; one patient also experienced hemoptysis. Physical examination found wheezing in two cases, wet rales in one case, and decreased breath sounds in one case. One patient had basic disease, and the others were normal. None had histories of typical aspiration. The FB location was the left lower lobe in two patients, and the right lower lobe in three patients. CT showed inflammation, emphysema, and localized bronchiectasis. Bronchographic examination revealed granulation tissue formation in three patients. Repeated X-ray examination showed that bronchiectasis disappeared after 1 or 6 months. In one case, the patient experienced neither fever nor cough for 3 years after removal of the FB and refused repeat X-ray examination.\n\n【8】Table 1 \n\n【9】Clinical data of the five patients.\n\n【10】(a)\n\n【11】(b)\n\n【12】(c)\n\n【13】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【15】The images of CT and bronchoscopy of case 5: (a) shows bronchiectasis in posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe; (b) shows a spherical foreign body in the posterior basal segment of the right lower lobe (c) shows the picture after removal of foreign body.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Aspiration of an FB into the trachea, and subsequently the bronchus, can occur in all age groups and most commonly occurs in infants and little children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Once this occurs, identification of the FB is crucial, and hopefully occurs before bronchiectasis develops; the obstructive increases the risk of chronic infection and subsequent bronchiectasis. The incidence of bronchiectasis due to FB aspiration is reported to be between 1% and 5.6% in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, approximately 500 patients admitted for FB aspiration in our hospital per year; therefore, the incidence of bronchiectasis in our study was lower than reported.\n\n【18】In our study, the mean age of patients with bronchiectasis due to FB was higher than that of all patients with FB. In addition, all the patients do not have histories of FB aspiration. The FBs were usually organic. CT revealed that bronchiectasis caused by FB was localized cylindrical bronchiectasis, mainly located in the lower lobes.\n\n【19】Aronoff reported in a systematic review that 18 of 989 patients, approximately 2%, with noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis had FB aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The risk of bronchiectasis depends on the size, shape, localization, and the retention time of the FB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The type of the FB and the time of retention within the tracheobronchial system are the most important factors. It has also been reported that the risk of bronchiectasis increases with retention time from aspiration to diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Sirmali et al. reported that the earliest case of bronchiectasis developed 25 days after aspiration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, FB aspiration does not always lead to bronchiectasis, even after 4-5 years. Therefore, the occurrence of bronchiectasis is likely determined by several factors.\n\n【20】Because many patients do not report histories of FB aspiration and do not experience typical aspiration symptoms, this disease is often missed, making diagnosis more challenging. Doctors of patients with impaired mental statuses or swallowing mechanisms should be more vigilant about the possibility of FB inhalation, as was the scenario in one of our cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. CT or bronchoscopic examination should be performed for patients with long-term cough, who are nonresponsive to routine treatment, who experience repeated occurrences of the same symptoms, have recurrent or persistent consolidations in the same location, or have unexplained hemoptysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Furthermore, obtaining a proper history is crucial. Whenever a choking episode is mentioned in the patient’s history, tracheobronchoscopy is indicated without relying on other diagnostic tools 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Recently, flexible bronchoscopy is also recommended for children newly diagnosed with bronchiectasis to exclude a foreign body or obstructive lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Bronchoscopic removal of a retained FB may be difficult because of the presence of granulation tissue and copious secretions. In one of our case, the granulation tissue was lysed and frozen with liquid nitrogen before removal. In our study, all five patients recovered completely after successful FB removal. After 1–6 months, a repeat CT showed that the bronchiectasis had disappeared. Vergnon reported a case who had bronchiectasis due to pen cap retention for 41 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The successful removal of the cap leads to significant recovery, avoiding further invasive approach. It has been reported that neglected, inorganic FBs can cause permanent bronchiectasis after several years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>. These patients sometimes require lobectomy because of recurrent infection after removal of FB. As long as the FB is diagnosed early and removed by bronchoscopy, the need for lobectomy and the risk of mortality can be reduced.\n\n【22】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】To reduce the risk of bronchiectasis secondary to FB aspiration, proper histories must be obtained. In addition, CT or bronchoscopic examination should be performed for patients with long-term cough, repeated occurrences of the same symptoms, recurrent or persistent consolidation in the same location in the lungs, or unexplained hemoptysis. Impaired mental statuses or swallowing mechanism in patients should arise suspicion of FB aspiration. Finally, patients with localized cylindrical bronchiectasis should be examined for FB aspiration.\n\n【24】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【25】All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the Ethical Standards of the Institutional and/or National Research Committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n\n【26】#### Consent\n\n【27】Informed written consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report and any accompanying images.\n\n【28】#### Disclosure\n\n【29】CARE Checklist 通用删除7(英):<u>(2016)</u> statement: the authors have read the CARE Checklist 通用删除7(英):<u>(2013)</u>, and the manuscript was prepared and revised according to the CARE Checklist 通用删除7(英):<u>(2016)</u>.\n\n【30】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【31】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 81200022).

We have previously reported the use of dual mask for ventilatory support of a patient postoperatively (Porhomayon et al. 2013). Here, we report an evaluation of the dual mask in four patients with overlap syndromes. Application of dual mask provided adequate oxygenation with lower continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)/bilevel positive airway pressure (BIPAP) pressure levels.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Obesity is a worldwide epidemic with numerous studies reporting increases in prevalence of this serious condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is one of the common disorders of breathing and sleep disorder (BSD) in general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. OSAS is also highly prevalent in the obese population. Its prevalence is estimated to be between 2% and 25% in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Since obesity is on the rise, it is logical to assume that the incidence of unrecognized or undiagnosed sleep apnea may be even higher in both medical and surgical population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and OSAS are an example of overlap syndrome where both diseases affect nearly 10% and 5% of the adult population over 40 years of age, respectively. Both conditions may coexist in about 0.5% of the population. Patients with overlap syndromes may have a greater or more sustained sleep-related oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) desaturation than do patients with COPD with the same degree of bronchial obstruction. They have an increased risk of developing hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency when compared with OSAS alone. In patients with overlap syndromes, hypoxemia and hypercapnic induced pulmonary hypertension can be observed in the presence of mild to moderate bronchial obstruction. This is different from “usual” COPD because the two syndromes may induce much greater changes in hemodynamic and respiratory as well as neurological functions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The gold standard therapy for OSAS and overlap syndrome remains CPAP or Bi-PAP therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In some conditions, CPAP/BIPAP therapy alone fails to provide satisfactory oxygenation. In these situations, O<sub>2</sub> is often added to CPAP/BIPAP mask. Severe sleep apnea may coexist with other overlap syndromes such as COPD, congestive heart failure (CHF), pulmonary fibrosis, neuromuscular disorders, chronic narcotic use, or central hypoventilation syndrome. They are among conditions that may need additional supplemental O<sub>2</sub> during the titration process. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the application of dual mask device in four patients in our sleep laboratory before full implementation in a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Material and Methods\n\n【6】Dual mask is a system with an adjustable port for connection of nasal cannula . The length of nasal cannula can be adjusted from outside mask by the patient. Mask is connected to a hose that contains both room airs from CPAP/BIPAP and oxygen tube. Nasal cannula dwells within the shell and is connected to an oxygen concentrator. We evaluated the efficacy of the dual mask in the sleep lab in four patients with overlap syndromes. This study was approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Mercy hospital of North Iowa, and informed consent was obtained from all patients.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Application of dual mask to patient face. |\n| --- |\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【10】##### 3.1. Case  1\n\n【11】This was a 61-year-old female with complaints of excessive fatigue, history of loud snoring, and CHF. She was on acetaminophen with codeine for shoulder pain. Her apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was 53.5 in her first sleep study. During her second night of polysomnogram (PSG) for CPAP titration, she failed CPAP due to continuous desaturation and frequent apneas and hypopneas. Therefore, she was switched to BIPAP. Despite increasing BIPAP pressure to 22/18 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, she continued to have desaturation until 3 liters of O<sub>2</sub> was added to her BIPAP. O<sub>2</sub> saturation stayed in low 90s and high 80s on this setting, but the patient was nervous and unable to tolerate this pressure especially due to leakage from her full-face mask. The patient was scheduled for a second night of CPAP/BIPAP titration. Titration started with dual mask and with 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub> via nasal cannula. At CPAP of 10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, AHI was 1.2 with good patient tolerance and O<sub>2</sub> saturation .\n\n【12】Table 1 \n\n【13】Treatment parameters and results.\n\n【14】Table 2 \n\n【15】Treatment parameters and results/with dual mask.\n\n【16】##### 3.2. Case  2\n\n【17】This was a 51-year-old male with history of COPD and daytime fatigue. He underwent a split night PSG. His AHI was 35 with minimum desaturation in low 60s. CPAP was applied. Right away, the patient started to have central apneas; therefore, BIPAP was applied. The patient was a major mouth breather, so technician tried every full-face mask with or without chinstrap. None of them kept a good seal due to patient’s beard. Low tidal volume and events still noted due to mouth breathing. At BIPAP pressure of 15/11 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 liters of O<sub>2</sub> was applied, but it did not improve the saturation. Technician was unable to establish a final pressure due to numerous central apneas and desaturation.\n\n【18】Around 0300, dual mask with 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub> was applied and titration started with BIPAP of 8/4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. At BIPAP pressure of 12/8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, saturation remained in low 90s with AHI = 1.4 .\n\n【19】Table 3 \n\n【20】Treatment parameters and results.\n\n【21】Table 4 \n\n【22】Treatment parameters and results/with dual mask.\n\n【23】##### 3.3. Case  3\n\n【24】This was a 58-year-old male with congestive heart failure, excessive daytime somnolence, and witnessed apnea. His previous PSG was suggestive of mixed obstructive and central apneas with AHI of 44.5. He failed CPAP titration in his first sleep study due to recurrent arousal and desaturation. The patient had 4 pillows and a rolled-up towel underneath his head. BIPAP was applied at the start of the second study at an initial pressure of 8/4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. The patient initially chose a medium size full-face mask but switched to a size large later on in the study due to mask leakage issues. The patient had difficulty tolerating BIPAP pressure of 20/16 cm H<sub>2</sub>O.\n\n【25】A dual mask was applied and titration started at pressure of 6/4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub>. At the pressure of 12/8 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with 3 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub>, most of abnormal respiratory events resolved. This pressure was easily tolerable, without any significant leakage .\n\n【26】Table 5 \n\n【27】Treatment parameters and results.\n\n【28】Table 6 \n\n【29】Treatment parameters and results/with dual mask.\n\n【30】##### 3.4. Case  4\n\n【31】This was a 68-year-old female with history of witnessed apneas and CHF. She was a chronic smoker. She was scheduled for a split night study and her AHI was 38 during the first part of sleep study with desaturations in low 70s. CPAP was applied around 2320. Pressure of 7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O was looking good until patient aroused. Subsequently, she started to have many central apneas; therefore, BIPAP was applied. At the BIPAP pressure of 14/10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub> was added and it was increased to 3 liters/min at BIPAP pressure of 18/12 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. BIPAP and CPAP both failed and technician was unable to establish a final pressure due to numerous central apneas that were mainly during rapid eye movement sleep. She requested to end the study around 0200 because the mask was hurting her face. Sleep technician tried several different types of masks and a small Quattro full-face mask was used. She was a major mouth breather. The patient slept in the supine position for entire study.\n\n【32】In her second night of PSG, she was started on BIPAP titration with dual mask and 2 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub>. At the pressure of 14/10 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with 3 liters/min of O<sub>2</sub>, most apneas/hypopneas and snoring resolved .\n\n【33】Table 7 \n\n【34】Treatment parameters and results.\n\n【35】Table 8 \n\n【36】Treatment parameters and results/with dual mask.\n\n【37】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【38】Clinicians are experiencing an ever increasing number of patients presenting with overlap syndromes to the surgical wards and operating rooms. The managements and monitoring of patients with overlap syndromes remain complicated. Both positive pressure ventilation and oxygen therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> remain the standard of care for treatment of patients with overlap syndromes. However, poor mask fit due to facial and anatomical features reduces the efficacy of such therapy in the immediate postoperative period. Alternative strategies are needed to better provide oxygen and positive pressure ventilation. A new novel device described previously in the postoperative period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> and now tested in our sleep laboratory may provide additional support to the surgical and medical providers.\n\n【39】Higher CPAP/BIPAP pressure can lead to higher leakage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and may increase nasal drying or congestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, cause pressure sores on the bridge of the nose, and contribute to difficulty in exhaling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In current clinical practice, O<sub>2</sub> is added to CPAP/BIPAP mask usually from a small hole into the mask or to CPAP/BIPAP hose; hence, added oxygen becomes diluted by CPAP/BIPAP flow and is also subject to leakage. Therefore, patients rarely get the benefit of supplemental O<sub>2</sub>. Adding O<sub>2</sub> to the patient’s mask is not practical because it can easily get disconnected when patient changes position during sleep. This is one of the most common patients’ complaints when O<sub>2</sub> line is directly connected to the mask. Connecting an adjustable cannula to full-face or nasal mask and delivering supplemental oxygen directly to nostrils rather than bleeding it into the mask space or hose will provide higher oxygen saturation during inhalation with the help of CPAP/BIPAP pressure.\n\n【40】As demonstrated in the four cases discussed previously, we were able to use the dual mask to improve respiratory parameters in all 4 patients with OSAS and overlap syndrome.\n\n【41】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【42】The goal is to deliver supplemental O<sub>2</sub> directly to patients’ nose in order to minimize dilution and leakage and to provide higher oxygenation with minimum CPAP/BIPAP pressure. That is expected to result in lower pressure-related side effects and subsequently higher compliance rates. Also delivering both room air and O<sub>2</sub> via only one tube and one machine provides more convenience and decreases the chance of O<sub>2</sub> disconnection by patient movements.\n\n【43】#### Disclosure\n\n【44】The authors do not have any financial or personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work.

The largely nonspecific symptoms and delayed presentation pose a serious diagnostic challenge. Medical management with either anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is recommended, but there are no reports of successful dual therapy. We report a case of spontaneous bilateral vertebral artery dissections (VADs) treated with both anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy and a literature review on clinical presentation and the current medical and surgical management options. A 37-year-old healthy female presented to the emergency department with worsening neck pain and headache for two weeks despite over-the-counter medication, block therapy, yoga, and deep tissue neck massage. She denied any trauma but admitted to multiple roller coaster rides over the past few months. CT angiography was concerning for VADs, and MRI brain revealed multiple strokes in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory. Cerebral arteriography confirmed the diagnosis of VADs. The patient was initiated on warfarin, along with atorvastatin and aspirin. She was discharged home with no complications and followed up with neurology as an outpatient. MR angiography after three months revealed complete resolution of the dissection. The patient did not report any bleeding complications from dual therapy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cervical artery dissection presents at any age, with a wide range of symptoms. Although uncommon in the general population, it is a recognized cause of ischemic stroke in younger patients. The internal carotid artery is most commonly affected, but occasionally, other arteries can be involved as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The incidence of vertebral artery dissection is estimated to be 2.6–3/100 000 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. According to Schievink, bilateral VAD accounts for 10 to 25% of all causes of ischemic stroke in young patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Bilateral VAD may be fatal due to the potential compromise of the posterior cerebral circulation.\n\n【4】Early diagnosis is crucial to achieve better outcomes, especially when the presentation is vague or asymptomatic. Headaches, neck pain, and dizziness are common complaints seen in young to middle age individuals presenting to outpatient clinics and emergency centers. These symptoms can be attributed to benign conditions such as migraine, tension headaches, and myofascial or musculoskeletal pain; therefore, the diagnosis of VAD is frequently missed or misdiagnosed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. A common theme amongst VAD is patients with recent minor neck trauma or maneuvers damaging the underlying cervical vessels, including chiropractic manipulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The VAD diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion combined with various imaging modalities. Therefore, this case would be of high interest to both general practitioners and emergency medicine physicians, who most frequently deal with unspecific head and neck pain. Management of VAD depends on several factors including clinical presentation, time of onset, anatomic findings, number of vessels compromised, and contraindications to specific therapies. Therapeutic options include thrombolysis, conservative management with antithrombotic drugs (antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents), endovascular management, and surgery. Timely diagnosis and initiation of treatment can help prevent more serious complications. Prognosis appears promising, as recurrent dissection rate after the first month is approximately 1% per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. We report the case of a young female who presented 2 weeks after initiation of neck pain. The diagnosis of VAD and multiple strokes was made. We highlight our management approach and outcome. Additionally, we present a review of literature on the most common clinical presentations and management options available to date.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 37-year-old Caucasian female with a history of dyslipidemia, asthma, and fibroids presented to the emergency room reporting two weeks of bilateral posterior neck pain and headaches. She initially presented with right-sided neck pain, which she attributed to various physical activities and sleeping in uncomfortable hotel beds. Of note, she described multiple recent visits to a theme park and enjoyed numerous roller coaster rides. The pain was achy, constant in nature, extending to the back of the eyes, and rated as 4 on a 10-point scale. Her pain persisted and increased in severity despite acetaminophen use and application of heating pads. She then tried block therapy, yoga, and deep tissue neck massage. The pain then became bilateral, even more severe, followed by an episode of severe dizziness and nausea which prompted the emergency room visit. Her family history was negative for connective tissue diseases. The patient was taking oral contraceptive pills and had discontinued statin therapy a few years ago. She denied using tobacco products, illicit drugs, or excessive alcohol.\n\n【8】Initially, vital signs were within normal limits. Physical exam revealed a nontoxic appearing young woman in no visible distress. Neck exam was significant for muscular tenderness but no midline or cervical spinous process tenderness. There was no rigidity, with full active and passive range of motion without pain. Brudzinski and Kernig signs were negative. The ear canals showed no abnormalities; there were no hearing deficits. No carotid bruits were present, and the neck was supple. Neurological exam revealed a normal cranial nerve exam, +5/5 muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities symmetric bilaterally, normal sensory exam, normal finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin testing, and no dysdiadochokinesia. Gait was intact, and she had no dysarthria or nystagmus.\n\n【9】Based on her history of recent roller coaster rides, worsening neck pain after yoga, and deep tissue neck massage, the following differential diagnosis was considered: intracranial bleeding, stroke, cervical artery dissection (CAD), and cervical spondylosis. Complete blood count and urinalysis were unremarkable. Basic metabolic panel showed abnormal cholesterol levels (total cholesterol: 224 mg/dl, triglycerides: 168 mg/dl, and LDL: 131 mg/dl). Beta-HCG was <2, and troponins were negative. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm. Autoimmune and vasculitis workup showed an elevated sedimentation rate of 27 mm/hr \\[0–22 mm/hr\\] but negative antinuclear antibodies, Smith antibody, and RNA antibody. Rheumatoid factor and C-reactive protein were within normal limits.\n\n【10】Chest X-ray was unremarkable. CT head/brain without IV contrast showed nonspecific left cerebellar hypodensities that may represent age-indeterminate embolic infarcts/injuries among other possible etiologies, with no acute intracranial hemorrhage (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). Head MRI without contrast (DWI sequence) showed large areas of acute ischemia in the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory with additional smaller areas of acute ischemia in the left superior parasagittal cerebellum. CT angiography of the head and neck with and without IV contrast demonstrated a relatively abrupt change in the caliber of the left V3 vertebral artery suggestive of dissection and a short segment high-grade narrowing of the right vertebral artery also highly suggestive of a dissection . Carotid arteries were within normal limits. Twenty-four hours after admission, the patient presented with a second episode of dizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and tingling sensation in both hands, which prompted further evaluation with the cerebral angiogram. The exam confirmed the bilateral VAD and revealed the presence of a subintimal clot on the left VA at V4 with loss of 50% of lumen , not previously observed in previous images. MR angiogram was not performed in the initial evaluation.\n\n【11】(a)\n\n【12】(b)\n\n【13】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【15】Noncontrast CT of the head (a) and brain MRI-DWI sequence (b) showing several well-circumscribed near fluid attenuation regions in the left cerebellum, the largest of which measures 3.5 cm transverse diameter. This is suggestive of left cerebellar ischemic stroke. There is no acute hemorrhage, midline shift, or hydrocephalus.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【17】CTA shows a short segment of high-grade narrowing of the cervical right vertebral artery at the C2-3 level.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【19】Cerebral angiography showing a dissection flap extending across the C1 loop and to the foramen magnum. Subintimal clot is seen medially in the vessel wall with 50% loss of lumen in the V4 segment. This abrupt change in the caliber of the left vertebral artery shows dissection.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【21】Cerebral angiography shows right vertebral artery dissection right past the C3 level at which a small pseudoaneurysm is noted in the artery anterior wall. This pseudoaneurysm tapers into the dissection which extends just beyond the C2 loop. There is marked reduction in luminal diameter and noticeable delay in antegrade flow distal to the dissection.\n\n【22】The patient was evaluated conjointly with neurology, neurosurgery, and interventional neuroradiology. Upon diagnosis of bilateral VADs, all consultants unanimously recommended systemic anticoagulation for 3–6 months and repeat imaging in 3 months to evaluate for healing. The patient was not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy given the time of presentation and NIHSS of 0. Intravenous heparin at 1,000 units/hr without initial bolus and close monitoring was preferred over standard therapy due to the high risk of hemorrhagic transformation. Additionally, aspirin and atorvastatin were also started. The patient developed mild vaginal bleeding upon discontinuation of birth control pills. The episode stopped shortly after and no interventions were needed. Mirena intrauterine device was recommended should the bleeding worsen while on anticoagulation but was never placed as the bleeding stopped shortly after.\n\n【23】A second neurology opinion, obtained per patient request, recommended to continue systemic anticoagulation for 3–6 months along with aspirin and atorvastatin. The patient was continued on IV heparin and titrated carefully for activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) goal of 50–55 seconds. She was given aspirin 325 mg daily initially and then decreased to aspirin 81 mg when aPTT became therapeutic. Atorvastatin 10 mg was continued throughout the hospital stay, without complication. The patient was eventually bridged to warfarin with an international normalized ratio (INR) goal of 2–3 with intention to continue for 3–6 months. At discharge, the patient continued with both low dose aspirin and warfarin without complications or neurological deficits. She follows up with neurology as outpatient. INR was monitored biweekly and remained within therapeutic range throughout the 3 months. MR angiography after three months showed complete resolution of the dissection . The patient did not report any bleeding complications from dual therapy.\n\n【24】(a)\n\n【25】(b)\n\n【26】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【27】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n【28】MR angiogram at 3-month follow-up showed complete resolution of bilateral dissection.\n\n【29】#### 3\\. Literature Review\n\n【30】A systematic review through PubMed was conducted without any restrictions. We used the keywords: “bilateral,” “vertebral artery,” and “dissection.” The reference sections of the eligible results were screened for any potential missed cases of relevance to ensure the inclusion of all reported cases of bilateral vertebral artery dissection. Our search yielded one hundred and one manuscripts. Exclusion criteria included artery transections, unilateral dissections, dissection secondary to known aneurysms, congenital or acquired vasculopathies, dissection in arteries with anomalous origin, patients with connective tissue disorders, cases presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage, pediatric patients, patients with chromosopathies, articles other than case reports or case series, and articles not available in English. Thirty-two manuscripts describing cases of bilateral vertebral artery dissection in patients were included in our review and are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【31】Table 1 \n\n【32】Reported cases of bilateral vertebral artery dissection.\n\n【33】In our review, the age of presentation ranged between 23 and 52 years old. Of the thirty-two cases, eighteen (56.2%) were female patients. These baseline characteristics were consistent with previous reports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 14\\]</u>. Among the identifiable risk factors for vertebral dissection, we found five patients presenting with associated comorbidities: one patient with chronic hypertension, three with a history of migraines, and one with acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 17\\]</u>. The remaining cases were otherwise healthy young adults. Thirteen cases of bilateral VA dissection (40.6%) presented spontaneously and without an identifiable trigger. Among those with a potential source of trauma, 6 patients were associated with chiropractic manipulation (Cases 1a, 4, 13, 17, 21, and 28), 6 to motor vehicle accident (Cases 3, 5, 6a, 11, and 12), 4 to sports with or without direct trauma (Cases 10, 14, 22, and 26), and one case followed 2 weeks postpartum (Case 25). Similar to our case, there were 2 cases associated with recent use of roller coasters (Cases 16 and 19).\n\n【34】The most common clinical presentations were occipital headache, unilateral or bilateral neck pain, and vertebrobasilar symptoms (dizziness, nausea, and vertigo). Two patients with multivessel compromise that included bilateral internal carotid artery dissection also presented with monocular vision loss or gaze deviation (Cases 19 and 25). The least common presentations were three cases of locked-in syndrome, one case of Horner syndrome, and one case of Brown-Sequard syndrome (Cases 3, 5, 6, and 9). In these cases, there was an extended compromise of the basilar artery, bilateral internal carotid arteries, or thoracic vertebral artery. Of all reported cases, one patient died 2 weeks after the development of symptoms (Case 1b).\n\n【35】Anticoagulation therapy with heparin was started in all nonsurgical patients once any contraindications were ruled out. One patient with extensive compromise of the posterior circulation required immediate thrombolytic therapy (Case 22). In this case, clinical deterioration followed, and the patient underwent suction thrombectomy 24 hours later. Follow-up 12 months after surgery showed clinical improvement with residual right incomplete hemianopsia. In another patient, stent placement was indicated given multiple vessel involvement, severe compromise of posterior circulation, and high risk of distal embolization (Case 25).\n\n【36】At discharge, most patients continued anticoagulation with warfarin for at least 3 months. The addition of other drugs and duration of treatment were variable. Chakrapi et al. reported use of prolonged anticoagulation with warfarin for six months, clopidogrel for eighteen months, and aspirin indefinitely. For most cases, follow-ups 3 to 6 months after the initial episode showed clinical improvement and partial to complete resolution of the arterial dissections.\n\n【37】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【38】We report a case of bilateral VAD with embolic strokes in a young woman presenting with worsening posterior neck pain, headaches, and vertigo. We suspect that exposure to constant repetitive microtrauma during roller coaster rides may have caused the dissections, with subsequent deep tissue massage and block yoga mobilizing intramural thrombus causing the subclinical strokes.\n\n【39】Neck pain remains a very common complaint among patients. Approximately 10% of adults experience neck pain at any time, but only about 1% will develop further neurologic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Common causes of neck pain include cervical strain, internal disc disruption, cervical facet-mediated pain, “whiplash” syndrome, and myofascial pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>. Clinical symptoms that are persistent, worsening, or are associated with neurological deficits may suggest more serious causes.\n\n【40】An arterial dissection can occur at any age, and it is a recognized cause of stroke, especially in younger patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>. The false lumen produced by the dissection can cause luminal stenosis or thrombosis, compromising the blood flow. A retrospective study of patients with cervical artery dissections found that, in patients with acute stroke, 85% was attributed to the thromboembolic mechanism, while only 12% was attributed to hypoperfusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>. In young adults, the cases of nontraumatic bilateral cervicocephalic artery dissections are less common but not rare. About 5–10% of carotid and 38% of VAD are bilateral. In a case series, bilateral spontaneous dissection was found in 8.1% of all patients with VAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>.\n\n【41】In a review of 83 patients with unilateral vertebral artery dissection, without consciousness disturbance at admission, unilateral or bilateral headache was the most common complaint (60 cases), followed by neck pain (41 cases), and vertigo (20 cases). Statistically, unilateral headache and/or neck pain was more common in cases with definite vertebral artery dissection compared with other classifications per the Spontaneous Cervicocephalic Arterial Dissections Study () 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. In the thirty-two cases of bilateral VAD we reviewed, 62.5% (20 patients) presented with either head or neck pain as the chief complaint. Ten cases reported involvement of other vessels: bilateral internal carotid in Cases 13, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 15; basilar artery in Cases 15 and 18; and multiple vessels in Cases 9 and 22. Therefore, medullary and pontine symptoms such as vertigo, dysphagia, and Horner syndrome predominated in these cases.\n\n【42】An analysis of a national trauma database showed that VADs only comprised 0.01% of all patients admitted with head and neck trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>. Observational studies have produced a list of mild mechanical triggering events. Relevant to our case, amusement park rides have been implicated in VADs. Schneck et al. reported a case of a 34-year-old female who was misdiagnosed with labyrinthitis after presenting to her primary care physician complaining of vertigo. She had recently been to a national amusement park where she went on all but one ride. Similar to our case, the patient developed neck pain uncontrolled with analgesics and subsequently developed neurologic symptoms of blurry vision. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed bilateral VAD without infarction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Our patient’s dissection was complicated by multiple strokes, most notably in the left PICA territory but fortunately without any evidence of Wallenberg syndrome, Horner syndrome, or gait disturbances.\n\n【43】Multiple dissections are more frequently found in women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Arnold et al. used prospective hospital-based registries to identify risk factors and outcomes in patients with spontaneous cervical artery dissections. They found that 1.5% of patients had multiple dissections, and the majority was women. Additionally, these patients did not have any family history of such dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, or connective tissue disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45\\]</u>. This is similar to our patient who had two dissections on imaging and no identifiable risk factors.\n\n【44】Traditionally, VADs are classified as extracranial and intracranial. Extracranial dissections in the hyperacute period can be treated with thrombolytic therapy. Outside said period, antithrombotic therapy with either single or dual antiplatelet or anticoagulation agents is the treatment of choice. VAD management remains challenging as there are no conclusive treatment guidelines. Anticoagulation therapy is controversial in intracranial dissections given the theoretical higher risk of bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Per the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, antithrombotic treatment with an anticoagulant or platelet inhibitor for at least 3–6 months is reasonable for patients with extracranial carotid or vertebral artery dissection associated with ischemic stroke or TIA (level of evidence: B) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[47\\]</u>. However, there is no clear consensus regarding management for the use of anticoagulation over antiplatelet therapy, or both, in patients without atherosclerotic disease in vertebral artery dissection.\n\n【45】Most recently, the CADISS trial compared antiplatelet treatment with anticoagulant treatment for extracranial carotid and vertebral artery dissection. It showed that recurrent stroke at 3 months is rare, with no significant difference between the two treatment groups. Although more strokes occurred in the antiplatelet group, this difference was counterbalanced by one major subarachnoid hemorrhage in the anticoagulant group 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. Based on these results and several retrospective studies, the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends either antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy for 3 to 6 months in patients with CAD-associated ischemic stroke (class of recommendation IIa, level of evidence B-NR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. Some authors may favor antiplatelet treatment given its safer profile and the risk of warfarin inducing expansion of the intramural hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u>. However, this and other complications such as hemorrhagic transformation are rare events. Our literature review indicates that most physicians gravitate towards early anticoagulation with heparin and then transitioning to oral warfarin. This action may be supported by the theoretical benefit of anticoagulation in the prevention of occlusion of a stenotic vessel and minimization of distal embolization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46, 51, 52\\]</u>.\n\n【46】The combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy is controversial, as it increases the hemorrhagic risk. However, even in the setting of hemorrhagic transformation, antithrombotic therapy could be continued based on the individual risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>. In this patient, we took into consideration her past medical history (dyslipidemia and recent OCP use), low risk of bleeding (Has-bled score of 2), the high grade, bilateral compromise of the vertebral arteries, presence of a subintimal clot in close proximity to the basilar artery, and acute embolic strokes. Our approach allowed for management of her risk factors, prevention of recurrent strokes, and potential lethal compromise of the basilar artery by distal embolization. In this particular case, the authors concluded that the benefits of such therapy outweighed the risks. To our knowledge, this is the first report of dual antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy in bilateral VAD. The patient was closely monitored in a neurologic progressive unit with serial neurovascular assessment without any eventualities. Upon discharge, she continued with the same regiment, and no adverse events were reported.\n\n【47】There are no concrete data on the ideal duration of antithrombotic therapy. Current recommendation is to continue antithrombotic therapy for 3 to 6 months, as the vessel heals. Further treatment should be tailored based on imaging findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Chakrapi et al. reported one case of bilateral ICA and VA dissection that was managed with prolonged anticoagulation therapy plus dual antiplatelet therapy. At 6 months follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic, and warfarin was discontinued. The 1-year CT scan results showed residual dissection of 30% in the right ICA and persistent 30 to 50% dissection in both VA. For these reasons, the patient continued clopidogrel for 12 months (18 months in total since the episode) and aspirin indefinitely 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>.\n\n【48】Some studies are proposing the use of new oral anticoagulant agents (NOAC) as an attractive therapeutic alternative. A recent retrospective observational study compared the use of NOAC to conventional anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in patients with CAD. The results show that NOAC have similar rate of recurrence of stroke, lower risk of major bleeding, but higher risk for radiologic worsening than conventional anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies. Additionally, two case reports showed complete resolution of the lesion at 3 and 6 months follow-up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[53, 54\\]</u>. In one of the reports, there were two cases of minor bleeding (hemorrhoidal and metrorrhagia), none of which required discontinuation of therapy.\n\n【49】NOAC have been found safer than warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[55\\]</u>. In addition to their safety profile, NOAC may be a more attractive choice for younger patients who are socially active, as there is no need for continuous monitoring of medication or interference with diet and lifestyle. On the contrary, titration is required in older patients with renal dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[56\\]</u>. However, randomized clinical trials should be conducted to determine if NOAC are effective and safe in this population.\n\n【50】Endovascular management (EM) is considered in patients with progression of disease despite antithrombotic treatment, those presenting with pseudoaneurysm or in those not amenable for anticoagulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[50\\]</u>. The safety and efficacy of EM have been explored in several retrospective studies, with overall good outcome profiles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57, 58\\]</u>. In a retrospective study, 140 patients with CAD were treated with stent placement. In the follow-up period, imaging showed improvement of the vascular stenosis. Additionally, only 1.4% of the patients presented with stroke events after the intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[57\\]</u>. A meta-analysis of 39 retrospective studies involving different treatment modalities for VADs in adults was done to determine clinical outcomes of patients who were treated endovascularly. Overall, 75.11% had excellent outcomes, 10.10% had good outcomes, and 13.70% had poor outcomes. Of significance, postoperative complications occurred in 10.52%, with 2.73% exhibiting vasospasm, 3.03% experiencing postoperative rebleeding, and 6.31% developing ischemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[48\\]</u>. While most studies showed clinical and radiologic improvement of the vascular lesion and an acceptable rate of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[59\\]</u>, conservative medical management remains the treatment of choice. Current indications for EM in CAD include recurrent ischemic events, high-grade arterial stenosis dissection with significantly limited flow, expanding pseudoaneurysm associated with dissection and occlusion, and failed medical treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[58\\]</u>. Surgical treatment may be indicated when the patient presents with recurrent strokes despite medical treatment and failed or not a candidate for endovascular therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[49\\]</u>.\n\n【51】In our review, two patients required surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31, 60\\]</u>. The first patient presented with worsening symptoms 24 hr after thrombolytic therapy, requiring suction thrombectomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[60\\]</u>. The second patient had dissection of multiple cervical vessels and severe compromise of the posterior circulation. For these reasons, three overlapping stents were placed in each vertebral artery. Both patients recovered successfully with minimal sequelae. When choosing a treatment modality, whether it is operative versus nonoperative, complications for each should be taken into careful consideration.\n\n【52】Per AHA guidelines, the management of additional risk factors should take place as soon as possible. Dyslipidemia is a well-known cardiovascular risk factor, and its management with statins has become a staple in ischemic strokes secondary to atherosclerotic disease. The role of dyslipidemia in the pathophysiology of artery dissection is less clear. Gupta et al. reported that traumatic dissections of the cervical arteries are more likely to occur in a vessel exposed to vascular risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[61\\]</u>, and Yamada et al. reported correlation between dyslipidemia and vascular repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[62\\]</u>. However, most patients with VAD are young and present without classic cardiovascular risk factors. We considered statin therapy appropriate in this patient given her particular risk factors (history of dyslipidemia and traumatic VAD).\n\n【53】There are not any evidence-based recommendations on the restrictions or continuation of physical activity after an episode of CAD. Although participation in sports has been reported in many cases, causation has not been demonstrated. The recurrence of CAD is uncommon, with a reported incidence of 2% within the first month of the event and a year incidence of 1% after that 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[63\\]</u>. This information is insufficient to draw any conclusions regarding the role of physical activity in the recurrence of CAD. Some experts recommend patients with dissection to avoid contact sports, chiropractic manipulation, and activities that involve abrupt mobilization of the neck 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[46\\]</u>. Prospective studies to determine the effect of different levels of physical activity on the recurrence of CAD may be unfeasible, given the low rate of recurrence. In this case, the patient was advised to avoid any contact sports, manipulation of the neck, yoga, and roller coasters.\n\n【54】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【55】This case was written to raise awareness for health care providers, especially general practitioners and emergency department physicians, regarding injuries in the adult population after amusement park rides and/or other physical activities which involve excessive, forceful, or repetitive movements of the neck. We report a case of bilateral VAD complicated by embolic strokes in a young patient presenting with worsening posterior neck pain and headaches. These general complaints are unspecific and common in previously healthy patients. This diagnostic challenge requires an astute clinician to combine symptoms with key historical elements. Since patients can present immediately after the event or several days later when conservative management has been unsuccessful, it is imperative to keep a broad differential diagnosis in patients with neck pain that is nonresponsive to initial conservative management. We insist on the importance of high clinical suspicion to facilitate an early diagnosis.\n\n【56】Management-wise, most cases treated with anticoagulation therapy resolve in the following six to twelve months period without major neurologic deficits, especially in absence of intracranial vessel compromise. There is no consensus on whether antiplatelet therapy is superior to anticoagulation therapy, but current evidence favors the use of antiplatelets in the cases of intracranial dissection and extracranial dissection without ischemic symptoms. If there is evidence of thrombus or severe vessel occlusion, anticoagulation therapy may be preferred in order to prevent distal embolization. Our review showed that most physicians opt for anticoagulation with heparin during the intrahospital stay and bridge to warfarin at discharge. Antithrombotic therapy duration has not been defined yet, but it is usually carried for 3 to 6 months or until evidence of a well-established healing or resolution of the dissection. Reports on the use of NOAC show initial positive outcomes, but larger prospective studies are required before reaching definitive conclusions. The addition of other drugs such as atorvastatin, aspirin, or clopidogrel is left to the physician’s discretion and the patient's individual risk factors. Successful management with endovascular and surgical procedures has been reported in several cases, but their safety and efficacy are yet to be proven in randomized clinical trials. There are not any evidence-based recommendations on the restrictions or continuation of physical activity after an episode of CAD. Experts’ advice is to avoid contact sports, high-risk activities, and neck manipulation.\n\n【57】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【58】The authors declare no conflicts of interest in preparing this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Postoperative perineal hernia may be defined by the protrusion of intra-abdominal viscera through a defect in the pelvic floor into the perineal region. Perineal hernias are infrequent complications following abdominoperineal operations with a recent retrospective study estimating the prevalence to be 0.34% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common presenting symptoms are that of pain and a dragging sensation or discomfort on standing, but urinary symptoms, intestinal obstruction, or perineal skin breakdown may also occur. Various approaches have been described for repair of perineal hernias including open transabdominal, transperineal, or combined abdominoperineal repairs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The use of laparoscopic transabdominal repair of perineal hernias is not well-described in the medical literature to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–10\\]</u>. Concerns about the insertion of intra-abdominal meshes to close peritoneal defects are largely founded upon the risk of adhesions, mesh infection, and the potential for fistula formation. These concerns, however, are tempered by the development of new synthetic meshes used in the increasingly popular technique of laparoscopic incisional hernia repairs. These meshes are reported to reduce the incidence of mesh-related morbidity and facilitate a minimally invasive approach to reconstructive surgery for large abdominal wall defects with the recognised benefits of laparoscopy. We present a case report demonstrating the benefits of laparoscopic repair of postoperative perineal hernia following laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection (APR) using a nonabsorbable mesh to repair the defect.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 69-year-old man presented with a history of rectal bleeding. Digital rectal examination revealed a palpable, fungating rectal lesion. Following EUA and biopsy, the lesion was confirmed as squamous cell carcinoma. Staging computed tomography scans did not reveal any distant metastasis. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy a preoperative MRI showed reduction in tumour size from 8.5 to 4.7 cm. The patient successfully underwent laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection of the rectum and formation of colostomy. He was discharged day 6 postoperatively with wounds intact.\n\n【7】Histology revealed an invasive poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with extension into the perianal soft tissues. Lymphovascular space and perineural invasion were identified but all resection margins were negative for tumour. The tumour was classified as a y T 2 N 0 M 0 lesion.\n\n【8】At six-month clinical followup, he complained of a reducible, painless incisional perineal hernia extending into the scrotum . He subsequently underwent elective laparoscopic mesh repair of this perineal hernia.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Preoperative picture showing the perineal hernia defect. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】The operation was performed in lithotomy position. A urethral catheter was placed to decompress the bladder. Pneumoperitoneum was established using the Hassan technique via a curvilinear infraumbilical incison. Three additional 5 mm ports were placed under direct vision using a 10 mm 0° laparoscope. One was positioned in the right lower quadrant, one in the right upper quadrant, and a third was placed in the left lower quadrant. At laparoscopy, there was no evidence of disease recurrence. Placement of the patient in a steep trendelenburg position facilitated division of adhesions with mobilisation of the small bowel loops out of the hernial defect . Both ureters were identified. The defect was repaired using a nonabsorbable composite mesh (Composix E/X Oval, 1 8 × 2 3  cms (Bard Nordic, Sweden) ellipse mesh, 7 × 9   ). The mesh was inserted through the 12 mm optical port and tacked anteriorly to the symphysis pubis and pelvic brim using a stapler device (StatTack, Autosuture, Tyco Healthcare UK Ltd). It was anchored to the sacrum using the endotacker. The remaining mesh was laparoscopically sutured to the surrounding pelvic brim and lateral abdominal wall, taking great care to avoid the ureters, iliac vessels and inferior epigastric vessels, using interrupted 3/0 vicryl sutures (Ethicon.Inc).\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Intra-abdominal view of bowel loops mobilised from perineal wall defect. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged 2 days later.

Discussion\n\n【18】Perineal hernias may be classified as primary (congenital or acquired) or secondary (postoperative). They are infrequent complications of major pelvic surgery and when present are usually asymptomatic. Aboian et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> recently showed in a retrospective study a prevalence rate of symptomatic postoperative perineal hernias of 0.34% with a more common prevalence associated with those who have had cancer operations. Smoking, female gender, and chemoradiotherapy are other important risk factors. The duration between surgery and hernia formation is usually between six months and five years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The patient described in this case report had many of these risk factors including a rectal tumour, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and smoking.\n\n【19】Surgical repair of a postoperative perineal hernia is indicated if there is pain or discomfort, skin erosion over the herniated sac, or intestinal obstruction and involves mobilisation and reduction of the contents of the hernial sac with closure of the defect. Many techniques have been reported including transperineal, transabdominal and the combined abdominoperineal approach. Given the low prevalence of such hernias there is, however, no consensus as to which approach is best. Aboian et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> in their review suggest that the abdominal approach has advantages that confer superiority over the transperineal option, with better exposure for dissecting out sac contents, hernial boundaries and pelvic contours. In addition, it also provides good access for mesh positioning and allows for exclusion of small bowel from the repair. Despite the increase use of laparoscopy as a surgical technique, to date there have been few reports of its application to repair of postoperative perineal hernias 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Laparoscopy has the advantage of quicker recovery time, faster recovery of bowel function, and decreased immunological stress while offering the same advantages as open abdominal surgery including good visualisation of intra-abdominal contents and the ability to survey for evidence of tumour recurrence intraoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In support of this, our results using laparoscopic repair demonstrate that it is an excellent alternative to other surgical repair techniques with good early postoperative outcomes.\n\n【20】Various techniques to repair the defect in the pelvic floor have previously been used. These include synthetic mesh repair, omentoplasty, musculocutaneous rotation flaps, and free facia lata flaps 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>. Nonabsorbable meshes, such as that used in this case report, are increasingly being used to provide a new pelvic floor in cases of large defects. The composite mesh which has a hydrophilic film reduces the risk of visceral adhesions while the nonresorbable polyester mesh provides long-term reinforcement of soft tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Again, we have demonstrated good early results with the use of this mesh but further long-term followup is warranted.\n\n【21】In conclusion, symptomatic perineal hernias, which are rare complications of pelvic surgery, require surgical repair. Many approaches have previously been described. We have demonstrated that the use of laparoscopy with repair of the pelvic floor defect using nonabsorbable synthetic meshes offers an excellent alternative with many potential advantages over open transabdominal and transperineal repairs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Discussion\n\n【24】CD is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–6\\]</u>. It is variously named as angiofollicular hyperplasia, giant lymph node hyperplasia, angiomatous lymphoid hyperplasia, localized nodal hyperplasia, and lymphoid hamartoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>. CD has a wide age distribution ranging from adolescence to seven decades 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【25】In 1972 Keller et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> divided CD in three histologic types: hyaline vascular type (75–90%), plasma cell type (10–25%), and mixed type (1–4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. The hyaline-vascular type is characterized by small-to medium-sized follicles that contain small blood vessels that penetrate atrophic germinal centers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. The mantle zone lymphocytes arrange in concentric layering at the periphery of follicles resulting in an onion-skin appearance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The interfollicular stroma is also vascular 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

The unicentric form is usually of hyaline-vascular type, pauci symptomatic with favorable prognosis and commonly involves the mediastinum 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Most cases of multicentric CD are of plasma cell type, associated with anemia, fever, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–4, 9\\]</u>. Another rare new histologic variant of multicentric CD is plasmablastic type which runs an aggressive course with higher incidence of progression to lymphoma or Kaposi sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【27】The etiology of CD is unclear. There is a strong evidence of HHV-8 participation in development of multicentric CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. It is hypothesized that HHV-8 via production of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is responsible for lymphoplasmacytic and vascular proliferation, and use of blocking antibody against IL-6 receptor may result in symptom resolution 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【28】In our case osseous metaplasia was observed in a lymph node involved by hyaline-vascular type of CD. Among hematologic malignancies, amyloid-producing dyscrasia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma were reported to produce heterotopic bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Two theories for this phenomenon are proposed: (i) tumor cells directly differentiate into osteoblasts, (ii) tumor cells secrete substances which induce osteoblastic differentiation in adjacent mesenchymal cells. One of these suggested substances that induce osseous metaplasia in epithelial tumors is bone morphogenic protein (BMP) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. BMPs are members of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) which stimulates differentiation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts through binding to appropriate receptor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Bull et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> demonstrated that HHV-8 will downregulate BMP-4 (an osteogenic factor), so osseous metaplasia in CD may be produced by other substances. IL-6 is may be the responsible factor. Although this interleukin is considered as a bone resorption factor, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u> it may play a role in bone formation and osteoblast proliferation, too 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 13\\]</u>. Also amyloid deposit may be seen in CD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, and this could be site for osseous metaplasia, but no amyloid deposit was seen in our case.\n\n【29】The differential diagnosis of CD is non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (follicular, mantle cell, and marginal zone B cell lymphoma), Hodgkin’s lymphoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and a variety of reactive lymphadenopathies such as rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren, HIV, and drug sensitivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.

What Is Your Diagnosis?\n\n【12】##### 2.1. Diagnosis: Human Orf (Ecthyma Contagiosum)\n\n【13】Case Synopsis  \nA 61-year-old sheep farmer presented with a painful nonpruritic ulcerated lesion on the left hand that had been present for approximately 5 weeks. He neither had previous history of similar lesions nor did he have a history of cancer or other dermatologic conditions. Physical examination demonstrated a 1 cm pearly, umbilicated papule with raised borders .  \nA biopsy  showed an asymmetrical nodule with parakeratotic crust and acanthosis with thin epidermal strands extending deeply in the underlying dermis. The upper dermis showed marked edema and capillary proliferation. The deeper dermal part of the lesion showed extensive lymphocytic infiltration. One red intranuclear inclusion was identified in the epidermal keratinocyte .\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】Our patient was a sheep farmer who presented with a raised umbilicated pearly lesion of his left hand that was ulcerated with raised borders. Clinically, it could easily be mistaken for a basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The central umbilication could also suggest keratoacanthoma or a lesion caused by molluscum infection though such lesions are usually much smaller. Milker’s nodules should be considered too. Both the clinical history of sheep farming and the microscopic features including the eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion body in the keratinocyte suggest a diagnosis of human orf (ecthyma contagiosum). The diagnosis may be further confirmed by electron microscopy done on the fluid obtained from the orf lesion showing ovoid cross-hatched virions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), although not readily available, can definitely identify orf virus from frozen tissue specimens, vesicle material, or scab debris from orf lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Ecthyma contagiosum is a zoonotic disease caused by the parapoxvirus that causes “sore mouth” in sheep and goats and orf in human. In ruminants, it is evidenced by exudative lesions found on the muzzle, eyelids, oral cavity, feet, or external genitalia. It is more common in younger animals. The disease in ruminants is highly contagious to humans and other animals; infected sheep and also freshly vaccinated sheep or goats are the source of infection to people. Transmission can be by direct contact with lesions or indirectly from contaminated object such as hair or clothing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Parapoxvirus is made up of a dense DNA core surrounded by a less dense capsid and 2 narrow electron dense outer layers. After an incubation period of 3–7 days, parapoxvirus infections produce 1–3 painful lesions measuring 1-2 cm in diameter. During the next 6–8 weeks, the lesion passes through 6 clinical stages: maculopapular, target, acute weeping, nodular, papillomatous, and finally regressive stages 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Microscopically, in the maculopapular stage, there is vacuolization of cells in the upper third of the stratum malpighii leading to multilocular vesicles. Eosinophilic intranuclear or cytoplasmic inclusion bodies can be seen. Vacuolated epidermal cells with inclusion bodies characterize the target stage. Ballooning degeneration also occurs in the target stage and affects keratinocytes rupture with a tendency to coalesce and produce reticulated vesicles. Additionally, in the epidermis, there is an elongation of the rete ridges. Many newly formed dilated capillaries and a mononuclear infiltrate are present in the dermis. This is followed by the acute weeping stage which is characterized by necrosis and a massive infiltrate of mononuclear cells throughout the dermis. Some biopsies of orf may have a marked reactive lymphoid infiltrate with CD30 positive T cells mimicking lymphoma. On progression to the nodular stage, a lichenoid reaction with a high percentage of histiocytes is seen in the skin. In the final papillomatous stage finger-like downward projections are displayed in the epidermis along with vasodilatation and chronic inflammation in the dermis. This results in resolution and regression of the lesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The natural history of the disease is complete resolution and no treatment is indicated. But antiseptic agents to prevent the superinfection and in some selected cases imiquimod can be applied 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Although, immunity is short lived, reinfection frequently appears but no human-to-human transmission occurs. Investigation into prevention of ecthyma contagiosum in ruminants through vaccination is thought to be the best way to control infection. Vaccines are available that offer some efficacy in sheep but do not prevent disease in goats. Research into effective and economical vaccines is ongoing. If infection is controlled in the ruminant population, human infection and its economic and environmental consequences should decrease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7\\]</u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

There are two types of MacTel: type 1 with aneurysmal telangiectasia and type 2 with parafoveal telangiectasia. MacTel type 1 or unilateral parafoveal telangiectasis (Group 1B IJRT) typically occurs in one eye of relative young men. The temporal half of the macula is involved by the telangiectasis, and the macular oedema and hard exudates lead to vision reduction. No treatment has been established although some encouraging effects have been obtained by argon laser photocoagulation (PC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>, intravitreal or sub-Tenon’s capsule injection of triamcinolone acetonide (IVTA or STTA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>, or intravitreal bevacizumab (IVR) or ranibizumab (IVB) injections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u> in small case series.\n\n【4】We present two patients with MacTel type 1 who were refractory to photocoagulation (PC), STTA, and IVB but responded to pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with intraoperative endolaser focal PC.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【6】This was a retrospective study of two eyes of two patients with MacTel type 1 who did not respond to focal PC delivered by an integrated slit lamp, to STTA, and/or to IVB. After discussing the possible treatment options including repetition of earlier treatments, an informed consent was obtained for our technique of PPV combined with intraoperative endolaser focal PC. Both patients underwent PPV combined with endolaser focal PC during the surgery. The diagnosis of MacTel type 1 was based on the fundus examination, FA, and OCT after the exclusion of neovascular maculopathy, secondary macular telangiectasia, and diabetes. Both eyes had cystoid macular oedema (CME) and showed a prompt filling of both the superficial and deep capillary networks of the telangiectatic vessels. There was also late intraretinal staining by fluorescein. The follow-up period was 19 months for Case 1 and 11 months for Case 2.\n\n【7】The ocular examinations included measurements of the BCVA, ophthalmoscopy, fluorescein angiography (FA), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Serial SD-OCT B-scan images were obtained with the Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA). The foveal thickness (FT) was measured as the distance between the internal limiting membrane and inner border of the retinal pigment epithelium at the foveal centre with the computer-based caliper built into the OCT system. The vertical and horizontal B-scan images across the fovea were used to determine the foveal thickness.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Case Reports\n\n【9】##### 3.1. Patient 1\n\n【10】A 79-year-old woman complained of blurred vision in her right eye and came to our clinic. Her BCVA was 20/100 OD and 20/25 OS. FA showed telangiectasia temporal to the fovea with pronounced fluorescein leakage in the late phase in the area of the telangiectasia. OCT showed cystoid macular edema (CME) in the area surrounding the leakage . The right eye was diagnosed with MacTel type 1 and received STTA, IVB twice, and focal PC through a slit lamp. These treatments failed to decrease the leakage on FA and resolve the CME. The BCVA was not improved.\n\n【11】(a)\n\n【12】(b)\n\n【13】(c)\n\n【14】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Finding of the right eye of Patient 1 with idiopathic macular telangiectasis (MacTel) type 1 on her first visit.

After core vitrectomy, a posterior vitreous detachment was created by suction through the vitreous cutter. The internal limiting membrane was made more visible with triamcinolone acetonide particle (Maqaid), and it was grasped and peeled with a microforceps. Then, focal PC was performed on the fluorescein leakage points with a 25-gauge endolaser probe and 100 to 120 mW power so that the focal retinal edema was treated.\n\n【18】After that, the CME decreased and the BCVA improved gradually to 20/25 in 3 months. The leakage of fluorescein was not present, the CME could not be detected in the OCT images, and the foveal thickness decreased from 420 to 140 μm . During the 19-month follow-up period, the BCVA and the CME progressively improved .\n\n【19】(a)\n\n【20】(b)\n\n【21】(c)\n\n【22】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Findings of the right eye of Case 1 taken 3 months after surgery.

Patient 2\n\n【28】A 69-year-old woman with no relevant medical history presented with decreased vision in her left eye of 1-week duration. She had been diagnosed with macular oedema associated with MacTel type 1 and underwent IVB and focal PC in a private clinic. The treatments were not effective, and she was referred to us two months later.\n\n【29】Our examination showed that her BCVA was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS. FA revealed ectatic capillaries temporal to the fovea with leakage in the late phase in both eyes but especially in the left eye. SD-OCT showed severe CME in the left eye . She was diagnosed with MacTel type 1 and underwent PPV with intraoperative endolaser focal PC as in Patient 1.\n\n【30】(a)\n\n【31】(b)\n\n【32】(c)\n\n【33】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| Findings of the left eye at the first visit of Case 2.

Discussion\n\n【44】Our results showed that PPV with endolaser focal PC can improve the BCVA and reduce the CME in patients with MacTel type 1. Our cases had not responded to focal PC through an integrated slit-lamp system, STTA, and/or antiangiogenic drugs, but after PPV with endolaser focal PC, the vision and CME improved. These findings strongly suggest a causal relationship between the treatment and the improvements.\n\n【45】Several treatments have been reported to be effective for MacTel, especially for type 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8, 11\\]</u>, and there are few reports on the treatment of MacTel type 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8–10\\]</u>. IVTA or STTA has been reported to be effective in some cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–7\\]</u> because steroids are anti-inflammatory and might maintain the blood-retina barrier. Recently, antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab or ranibizumab have been reported to be effective in some cases of MacTel type 1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u>. Antiangiogenic drugs are known to reduce neovascularization and oedema; however the follow-up times in those reports were relatively short and some cases had recurrences. Therefore, the efficacy of those therapies has still not been definitively determined.\n\n【46】At present, there is no consensus regarding the treatment of MacTel. Our two patients had no or only limited improvement clinically and angiographically after PC, STTA, and/or antiangiogenic therapy. Thus, we believed that intraoperative endolaser focal PC may be more effective because it allows for better accuracy in treating the lesions than through an integrated slit-lamp delivery system. Focal PC through a slit lamp has several disadvantages. The site of the lesion can be easily affected by micromotions of the eye, the use of a joystick and manipulation of the contact lens require considerable technique and experience, reflected light from the contact lens can reduce the visibility of the macular region, and the endolaser beam can be delivered at different angles which can reduce the energy to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) over the fovea. The RPE is located in the outer layer and microaneurysm is in the inner layer, and the laser beam that is delivered obliquely from the inner and central side arrives relatively peripheral to the outer layer. This can prevent damage to the RPE. And finally, the endolaser procedure is not influenced by an opaque media, and the intravitreal laser probe can be brought very close to the retinal surface.\n\n【47】However, there are also drawbacks to the endolaser photocoagulation such as the difficulty for repeated treatments because of the risks associated with intraocular surgery.\n\n【48】There are several factors that may have played a role in improving the macular edema after PPV with endolaser focal PC. The removal of the vitreous and/or ILM may have reduced the level of pathological cytokines or chemical mediators adjacent to the telangiectasia. There are several reports showing that ILM peeling is effective treatment for macular edema secondary to diabetic retinopathy (DME) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u> and retinal vein occlusion (RVO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Although the mechanism of the ILM peeling has not been fully understood, it might have contributed to the successful outcome. The intraoperative use of TA may have similar effect as STTA or IVTA although its use was only transient. The effectiveness of PPV alone can be assessed if intraoperative PC was not done. But the therapeutic protocol did not allow it. In addition, Sigler et al. reported that PPV was not effective against nonproliferative idiopathic MacTel type 2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. MacTel type 1 is mainly exudative and nonfamilial, while type 2 is primarily nonexudative, obstructive, and occasionally familial. This may explain the differences of our results from the results of Sigler et al. In addition, some cases of MacTel type 1 respond well to antiangiogenic drugs but not type 2.\n\n【49】There are some limitations in our study. This was a retrospective study of only 2 patients. In addition, the follow-up period was short, and there were no controls. However, we believe that PPV with endolaser focal PC is effective and should be considered as an optional treatment for selected cases of MacTel type 1 especially in refractory cases. These treatment protocols should lead to an improvement in both the BCVA and macular edema.\n\n【50】In conclusion, we have experienced two patients with MacTel type 1 who were refractory to photocoagulation (PC), STTA, and IVB but responded to pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with intraoperative endolaser focal PC.\n\n【51】Although further investigations are needed to elucidate the rationale and to establish its indication, we think a stepwise approach to the management of the disease with the use of surgical management can be considered when conventional treatment fails.\n\n【52】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【53】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【54】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>No author has a financial or proprietary interest in any material or method mentioned.

Examination revealed areflexia over all four limbs, associated with reduced muscle strength, but no sensory or cranial nerve deficit. Initial concern was Guillain-Barre syndrome given the acute flaccid paralysis following COVID-19 infection. However, investigations revealed severe hypokalaemia (1.7 mmol/L) and primary hyperthyroidism. He was treated for thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) with β\\-blockers, antithyroid medications, and intravenous potassium chloride (KCl). Despite frequent monitoring of potassium, rebound hyperkalaemia occurred with prompt resolution of paralysis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】This is the first case report of TPP occurring after COVID-19 infection, which presented with acute flaccid tetraparesis. COVID-19 infection is associated with multiple complications including neurological, endocrinological, and autoimmune diseases. TPP is an uncommon complication of Graves’ disease and may mimic other neurologic complications of COVID-19 infection such as demyelinating disorders. This emphasises the importance of assessing for metabolic disorders. In patients with severe hypokalaemia, a thyroid panel should be checked, bearing in mind the association between COVID-19 infection and Graves’ disease. Finally, the acute management of patients with TPP and severe hypokalaemia can be challenging, and judicious potassium replacement with frequent monitoring is imperative to avoid rebound hyperkalaemia.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Summary\n\n【5】A previously well 32-year-old Chinese male presented to the emergency department with acute weakness of bilateral upper and lower limbs. He slept well the night before, but was unable to walk or lift his lower limbs upon waking. Upper limb strength was also reduced bilaterally. He had no numbness, facial drooping, slurring of speech, blurring of vision, or incontinence. There was no preceding headache, neck pain, or trauma. He had been diagnosed with COVID-19 upper respiratory tract infection ten days ago, and his symptoms of fever, runny nose, cough, and sore throat had since resolved. However, he reported weight loss of 5 kg over the past few weeks. He took a carbohydrate-rich diet mainly consisting of rice, which he had taken the night before as well. He did not notice any neck pain or swelling, palpitations, or diarrhoea. He had no personal nor family history of neuromuscular disease, thyroid disease, or hypokalaemia and was not on any long-term medications or supplements.\n\n【6】On examination, he was afebrile but tachycardic (heart rate 116 beats per minute). Blood pressure was 127/73 mmHg and respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute. He was alert and conversant with clear speech. Tone was reduced in all four limbs, associated with absent biceps, triceps, supinator, knee, and ankle reflexes. There was profound weakness of his lower limbs and trunk (power 2/5 both proximally and distally), with less severe weakness in his upper limbs (power 3/5proximally, 4/5distally). There was no sensory deficit. Cranial nerves were intact with preservation of respiratory, ocular, and bulbar muscular function. He had a small diffuse goitre that was nontender, with no bruit. Fine tremors were present in both the hands. There were no signs of thyroid eye disease or pretibial myxoedema.\n\n【7】There was initial concern for Guillain-Barre syndrome given his acute flaccid paralysis following COVID-19 infection. Other differentials included hypokalaemic or thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP). Subsequent investigations  revealed severe hypokalaemia (1.7 mmol/L) and primary hyperthyroidism (FT4 28.96 pmol/L; TSH <0.004 mIU/L), establishing the diagnosis of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. TSH receptor antibody was positive (2.4 U/L), consistent with Graves’ disease. Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia but no u-waves .\n\n【8】Table 1 \n\n【9】Initial investigations\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【11】Electrocardiogram.\n\n【12】He was transferred to the high dependency unit, placed on telemetry monitoring, and initiated on intravenous (IV) potassium chloride (KCl) replacement. Despite receiving 56 mmol of KCl, his serum potassium level fell from 1.7 mmol/L to 1.6 mmol/L in the first four hours (prior to thyroid function test results). When primary hyperthyroidism was confirmed, he was initiated on oral propranolol 20 mg, carbimazole 20 mg, continued on IV KCl replacement, and serum potassium improved to 2.2 mmol/L. Potassium levels were checked frequently every four hours, and his subsequent potassium rose rapidly to 6.3 mmol/L. This was accompanied by prompt resolution of his paralysis, and muscle strength in all four limbs returned to normal. Potassium infusion was immediately stopped, and he was given IV Actrapid 10 u with 40 ml of 50% dextrose to correct hyperkalaemia. Serum potassium recovered to 4.6 mmol/L. Carbimazole 20 mg OM and propranolol 20 mg TDS were continued, and serum potassium levels remained stable . He was discharged with advice to avoid strenuous exercise and large carbohydrate portions, which may precipitate attacks of TPP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. He will be reviewed in a month to adjust the dosage of carbimazole, with an eventual aim for definitive therapy of Graves’ disease.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【14】Serum potassium trend.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】This is the first case report of TPP occurring after COVID-19 infection, which presented with acute flaccid tetraparesis. Diagnosis can be a challenge as TPP can mimic neurological complications of COVID-19 infection such as Guillain-Barre syndrome. TPP is an uncommon complication of thyrotoxicosis, rarely affecting Caucasians, and patients tend to have mild clinical and biochemical features of hyperthyroidism, making the diagnosis more difficult 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【17】##### 3.1. Acute Flaccid Tetraparesis Associated with COVID-19 Infection\n\n【18】Multiple neurological complications following COVID-19 infection have been reported, including ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, and acute encephalitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Though rare, cases of acute myelitis and demyelinating disorders (such as Guillain-Barre syndrome) have been reported, giving rise to acute tetraparesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Postulated mechanisms include direct viral invasion of the nervous system, cytokine storm, or molecular mimicry inducing an immune response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Zuberbühler et al. conducted a review of 48 published cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with COVID-19 infection, with neurologic manifestations occurring at mean of 12.1 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Most patients (87.5%) required treatment with IV immunoglobulin therapy.\n\n【19】This patient’s presentation of acute tetraparesis and areflexia occurring ten days after COVID-19 infection was consistent with Guillain-Barre syndrome. However, it is imperative to exclude metabolic causes such as hypokalaemia or hypocalcaemia. Hypokalaemic and thyrotoxic periodic paralysis occur when there is an intracellular shift of potassium, leading to hyperpolarisation of cell membrane potential, and resultant flaccid paralysis and areflexia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This can lead to the misdiagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome and emphasises the importance of obtaining results of serum electrolytes prior to instituting treatment such as immunoglobulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【20】In TTP, excess thyroid hormone mediates an increase in β\\-adrenergic receptor density and postreceptor mechanisms, which enhances tissue sensitivity to β\\-adrenergic stimulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This leads to increased sodium-potassium ATPase activity on skeletal muscles and an intracellular shift of potassium. Excess thyroid hormone also increases insulin response which in turn stimulates sodium-potassium ATPase activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. TPP is a rare complication of thyrotoxicosis, with an incidence of 0.1% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. It is more common in Asian populations (incidence of up to 2%), and this may be due to a genetic predisposition or altered sodium-potassium channel mechanisms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Like in our patient, it is most often observed in young males between 20 and 40 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【21】There have not been any reported cases of TPP in association with COVID-19 infection thus far. Rajesh et al. reported a case of a 34-year-old male with COVID-19 infection who presented with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The pathophysiology of hypokalaemic periodic paralysis appears to be similar to TPP, with shifts of potassium intracellularly being the main culprit. Association between COVID-19 and thyroiditis has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, postulated to be related to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), the receptor for cellular entry of the COVID-19 virus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The mRNA encoding for the ACE-2 receptor has been found to be expressed in thyroid follicular cells, making them susceptible to viral entry, which may then give rise to thyroiditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. COVID-19 infection is also known to be a trigger for various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, mainly via molecular mimicry 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>, and cases of Graves’ disease occurring after COVID-19 infection have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. It is postulated that COVID-19 infection may trigger Graves’ disease by altering the immune system in susceptible individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Although this patient had a history of mild weight loss that preceded his COVID-19 infection, this had not been associated with any other symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, and the onset of paralysis occurred only after the COVID-19 infection.\n\n【22】Thus, this patient’s recent COVID-19 infection may have exacerbated his hyperthyroidism, with his gender, age, and ethnicity making him particularly susceptible to developing TPP.\n\n【23】##### 3.2. Treatment of Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis\n\n【24】Immediate treatment of TPP is necessary to reverse paralysis and prevent cardiopulmonary complications. For treatment of thyrotoxicosis, β\\-blocker therapy is vital in the acute phase, as it inhibits β\\-agonist stimulation and prevents intracellular shift of potassium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This acts as a temporising measure till euthyroidism is achieved. Antithyroid drugs aid to control hyperthyroidism, but ultimately, these patients should be offered definitive therapy to eliminate the risk of subsequent paralysis attacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Management of severe hypokalaemia in these patients can be challenging. These patients are at risk of respiratory muscle paralysis, and fatal arrhythmias have occurred in cases of treatment delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19–21\\]</u>. Hence, immediate potassium replacement must be instituted. At the same time, caution must be exercised to avoid large quantities of potassium. Hypokalaemia in TPP is due to transcellular shift and not a total body deficit from renal or gastrointestinal losses, and reversal of the transcellular shift may lead to rebound hyperkalaemia. Hence, serum potassium levels must be monitored closely throughout replacement. Our case illustrated the difficulty in predicting the degree and rapidity of response to KCl replacement and β\\-blocker therapy. Despite propranolol and carbimazole therapy, as well as 90 mmol of KCl, patient’s potassium level remained extremely low at 2.2 mmol/L with persistent severe paralysis of all limbs. However, a further 40 mmol of KCl replacement resulted in a rapid rise of serum potassium levels to 6.3 mmol/L.\n\n【26】A case-controlled study conducted by Lu et al. demonstrated that recovery time was significantly shorter in subjects with TPP who received IV KCl administration (10 mmol/h) compared to those who did not (6.3 ± 3.8 h vs. 13.5 ± 7.5 h) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. However, rebound hyperkalaemia (>5.5 mmol/L) occurred in 40% of patients who received IV KCl. Another case series of 24 patients with TPP conducted by Manoukian et al. reported that rebound hyperkalaemia (>5.0 mmol/L) occurred in 40%, especially if more than 90 mEq of KCl was given within 24 hours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Thus, while KCl replacement does hasten recovery in patients with TPP, especially in those with risk of cardiopulmonary compromise, judicious amounts should be used (<10 mmol/h or <90 mmol/24 h), with continuous telemetry and close monitoring for rebound hyperkalaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 23\\]</u>.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusion and Learning Points\n\n【28】COVID-19 infection has been described to trigger a myriad of complications, including various autoimmune disorders. In a patient presenting with acute flaccid paralysis following COVID-19 infection, both neurological (e.g. acute myelitis, demyelinating conditions) as well as metabolic (electrolyte disturbances and hypokalaemia) disorders should be considered. Although TPP is a rare entity, a thyroid panel should be checked in COVID-19 patients with severe hypokalaemia, bearing in mind the association between COVID-19 and Graves’ disease. Last, the acute management of patients with TPP and severe hypokalaemia can be challenging, and judicious KCl replacement with frequent monitoring is imperative to avoid rebound hyperkalaemia.\n\n【29】#### Data Availability\n\n【30】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【31】#### Consent\n\n【32】Written consent was obtained from the patient for this case report.\n\n【33】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【34】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Clinically, this lesion resembled an actinic keratosis. Although histological examination revealed a focal acantholysis, the finding of a moderate-to-severe dysplastic epithelium was consistent with the diagnosis of acantholytic actinic keratosis with moderate/severe dysplasia. Nevertheless, the complete resolution of the lip lesion after systemic therapy for pemphigus vulgaris led us to reconsider the possibility that we were dealing with a pemphigus vulgaris with unusual clinical and histological features. The previously reported cytological dysplasia was better regarded reactive rather than neoplastic, likely as the result to the inflammatory injury.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】A 67-year-old woman was referred to our department with a 4-month history lesions on her face, trunk, and upper extremities. The lesions consisted of multiple painful blisters and erosions covered with crusts. General laboratory screening, including a complete blood count, was within normal limits. The Tzanck test of a smear from the base of a blister on a trunk lesion showed many acantholytic cells. The indirect immunofluorescence test showed that the serum of the patient contained IgG antibodies that reacted with the intercellular region of normal squamous epithelium. The direct immunofluorescence test, performed in a cutaneous biopsy, showed IgG and C3 deposits to the full thickness of the epidermis. The immunoblotting revealed the presence of antibodies directed at the extracytoplasmic domain of the 130 kD epithelial desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein 3. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris was made. Unexpectedly, a dry whitish scaly lesion of the upper lip, that resembled clinically an actinic keratosis, was also observed (Figure 1(a)). Therefore, we decided to perform an incisional biopsy on this lesion. Histological examination showed acantholysis and a diffuse cytological atypia of the epidermis, consisting of cells with enlarged, vesicular, focally hyperchromatic, nuclei (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). The underlying dermis showed diffuse and marked inflammatory infiltrate, with lymphocytes and eosinophils, that focally involved the epidermis. Solar elastosis and vascular ectasia were additionally seen (Figure 2(a)). Although the finding of acantholysis was consistent with the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris, the possibility of an acantholytic actinic keratosis with moderate/severe dysplasia could not be completely ruled out. We decided to undertake the therapy for pemphigus vulgaris and to wait for the outcome of the lesion of the lip. Therapy with systemic prednisone (50 mg/die), cyclophosphamide (25 mg/die), and erythromycin (1800 mg/die) was administered with good results.

Discussion\n\n【15】Pemphigus vulgaris usually begins in the mouth with painful erosions, and after a period of weeks or months, the blisters spread to involve the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. The mouth lesions, including those occurring in the lip, clinically present as fragile, flaccid blister, which develops on normal or erythematous skin/mucosa, and rapidly rupture, leaving a painful crusted, bloody erosion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Histologically, these lesions are characterized by rounded acantholytic cells with intensely eosinophilic cytoplasm, pyknotic nuclei, and perinuclear halos. The most striking feature in our case was the finding of a dry whitish scaly lesion in the upper lip, that closely resembled of an actinic keratosis. Histologically, this lesion showed focal acantholytic epidermis with moderate-to-severe cytological atypia in association with a diffuse and marked dermal inflammatory infiltrate. However, the resolution of the lip lesion after systemic therapy for pemphigus vulgaris was strongly in favour of the diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris with unusual clinical and histological features. In this regard, the detected cytological atypia was better regarded to be reactive rather than dysplastic, likely as the result of diffuse dermal inflammatory injury. Therefore, although benign and malignant tumours may occasionally arise in the context of some acantholytic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>, the diagnosis of dysplasia/in situ carcinoma should be made with extreme caution in patients affected by pemphigus vulgaris.\n\n【16】In conclusion, considering that the observation we made may be seen in many patients affected by pemphigus vulgaris, such patients would benefit more from the therapy for pemphigus vulgaris instead of a biopsy.

The study evaluated these five subjects using clinical, laboratory, electrophysiological, and genetic testing. The findings showed that clinical features demonstrated no pes cavus, no significant weakness in the hands or feet, normal reflexes in four out of the five subjects, and mild to normal electrodiagnostic findings. The variant was associated with painful and numb feet with diminished sensation to pinprick. This study suggests that GDAP1 variants may be associated with very mild, predominantly sensory Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease, warranting continuing research for this type of the disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT) reflects a group of inherited neuropathies affecting 1 in 2,500 individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. CMT type 1A is the most common CMT, accounting for approximately 60% of those with a genetic diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Classically, CMT is characterized by distal weakness, foot structural deformities, sensory abnormalities, areflexia, and abnormalities in gait 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Genetic advances have allowed the classic CMT phenotype to be expanded and evaluated for idiopathic unexplained neuropathies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The rare forms of CMT still need to be understood. This study aims to elucidate our understanding of the clinical features of heterozygous GDAP1 mutations.\n\n【5】GDAP1 mutations can present in both heterozygous and homozygous forms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. GDAP1 mutations are responsible for demyelinating intermediate and axonal recessive CMT and CMT 2K, a rare dominant axonal CMT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7–10\\]</u>. The majority of GDAP1 mutations are biallelic giving rise to autosomal recessive CMT, which can present as either demyelinating 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, axonal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, or intermediate CMT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Although the homozygous presentation is typically very severe with early childhood onset with motor and sensory involvement and possible vocal fold paresis, the heterozygous form seems much less severe with a late-onset mild sensory presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【7】This study further describes the clinical presentation of GDAP1 mutations and adds to the knowledge of heterozygous GDAP1 mutations.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Methods\n\n【9】All subjects received care at the AdventHealth Orlando Neuroscience Institute. All had neurological records evaluated. In addition, four out of the five individuals had electrodiagnostic testing performed. Genetic testing for inherited neuropathies was performed through Invitae (San Francisco, CA) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Three pathogenic variants in the GDAP1 gene were identified, and one variant of uncertain significance in the GDAP1 gene was also detected.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【11】Case 1. As a child, this subject had no difficulties with running, walking, roller skating, or biking. She was not athletic and was the slowest runner compared to her peers at school but was healthy and active. Her symptoms first started in her 50s when she started to have difficulty with fatigue and numbness in her toes. Occasionally, she will have pain. She has no weakness but does have some difficulty with climbing stairs. Her son was diagnosed with CMT at age 10 due to high arches, which prompted her evaluation for CMT.\n\n【12】Case 2. In her youth, she had no difficulties with running, walking, balance, or athletics. She was a slow runner in general and had weak ankles. Her symptoms started in her 20s when she experienced burning foot pain after standing for prolonged periods. In her 40s, she felt that she started to develop numbness in her feet and mild difficulty with dexterity in her hands. Examination revealed absent Achilles reflexes.\n\n【13】Case 3. As a child, she had no difficulties with running, walking, roller skating, or biking. Although she was not athletic, she was a fast walker. She had some mild tremors throughout her life. She developed burning, tingling, and extreme sensitivity to cold at age 67. She has numbness in her thumbs and paresthesias in her hands and feet. Neurological examination is intact except for absent Achilles reflexes. Both her father and her daughter have CMT 2K.\n\n【14】Case 4. Daughter of the Case 3 proband: as a child, she was athletic and the fastest runner compared to her peers in school. She had cramps and growing pains but no other symptoms; she has normal foot structure. Then, in her 40s, she developed numbness in her left toes and obtained genetic testing due to her mother’s CMT diagnosis.\n\n【15】Case 5. As a child, he was athletic. In his early 50s, he started to develop constant daily pain in both plantar aspects of his feet below the middle toe area. He also has a numb feeling as if someone wrapped duct tape around his foot. Despite pain relieving interventions, including neurontin, pregabalin, marijuana, and acupuncture, he has not had pain relief. He has difficulty walking due to his balance. He had a ruptured Achilles tendon. He walks and rides his bike daily. EMG/NCS showed minor abnormalities to suggest a possible sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Exam is significant only for absent ankle jerk reflexes and pinprick sensation decreased up to ankle.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【17】CMT can have various symptoms and signs, including mild paresthesias, as evidenced in this study. In some cases, genetic testing can reveal underlying causes of idiopathic mild neuropathies.\n\n【18】The findings from the subjects with a heterozygous pathogenic GDAP1 missense variant  demonstrate that all presented with a mild sensory neuropathy; all except one subject had a late-onset neuropathy developing after age 40. Electrodiagnostic testing was normal in one of the five individuals, with the other two individuals having minor nerve conduction abnormalities. Neurological exam was normal except for decreased pinprick in proband 1, absent reflexes in proband 2, and absent Achilles reflex in proband 3. There was no family history in proband 2. Proband 1 had a son with high arches in his feet at age 10. Proband 3 has a daughter with numbness in her left toe and a father who had a neuropathy. Proband 5 developed pain in his feet in his 50s.\n\n【19】Table 1 \n\n【20】Clinical Results of individuals with a heterozygous GDAP1 missense variant.\n\n【21】Previous studies of heterozygous GDAP1 variants suggest a late-onset, slowly progressive, and mild neuropathy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9\\]</u>. Another earlier study suggested a wide variability in age of onset and severity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Zimon et al. 通用删除7(英):<u>(2011)</u> also reported heterozygous GDAP1 variants with various age onset, but unlike our study, some subjects presented with walking difficulties. However, similar to our study, some subjects were asymptomatic, perhaps due to incomplete penetrance or the nature of the heterozygous form. Electrodiagnostic studies revealed an axonal or an intermediate pattern. A previous study suggested that five variants in the GDAP1 gene (p.Arg120Gly, p.Arg120Trp, p.His123Arg, p.Gln218Glu, and p.Arg226Ser) had a milder and indolent clinical course 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In general, heterozygous carriers were milder.\n\n【22】The GDAP1 variant is a rare CMT variant in which autosomal recessive and dominant forms can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The GDAP1 gene in a heterozygous form results in a suspected pathology localized to abnormalities in mitochondrial fusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Classical CMT2 is an axonal CMT with reduced amplitudes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Our subjects had completely normal or borderline electrodiagnostic testing at the time of their evaluations, as seen previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This can make the diagnosis challenging.\n\n【24】Our subjects were comprised of four women and one man. Men may need to be separately investigated as there might be a gender difference or variability among this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【25】In summary, CMT should be considered a possible differential in mild late-onset sensory neuropathies with normal to borderline abnormal nerve conduction studies.\n\n【26】#### Data Availability\n\n【27】The data used to support this article can be made available by the corresponding author on request.\n\n【28】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【29】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author would like to express her special thanks of gratitude to a fabulous success coach, Dean Graziosi; AdventHealth Orlando Neuroscience Institute; her family/close colleagues; and Seema Sernowitz for her editing services.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Myiasis is rarely manifested in the urogenital system. Herein, we report a case of urogenital myiasis in a 49-year-old rural woman complaining of maggots in the urine and severe genital itching.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The term myiasis is derived from the Greek root mya meaning flight and was coined by Hope FW in 1840 when describing the infestation of living vertebrae with dipterous larvae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This condition involves the infestation of living vertebrae with dipterous maggot larvae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Human myiasis (HM) is globally reported and is mostly prevalent among families with a poor socioeconomic status residing in tropical regions. It is, however, not limited to these regions and manifests as a global agricultural concern when occurring in domestic animals. In humans, this condition is usually induced by parasites related to an animal host. Cutaneous myiasis is the most prevalent clinical form of the condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Nasopharyngeal myiasis involves the infection of the nose, mouth, sinuses, and ears. Other forms include ocular myiasis (ophthalmomyiasis) and intestinal myiasis due to the ingestion of the organism. Vaginal and urogenital myiasis is rarely reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Herein, we present a case of urogenital myiasis in a 49-year-old woman.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 49-year-old rural woman presented three days ago to our Charity Clinic, complaining of maggots in the urine and severe genital itching. Her family occupation was farming and animal (sheep, goats, and cows) husbandry, and they had a relatively low economic status.\n\n【6】She reported foul-smelling vaginal discharge for the past six months but had not visited the clinic due to fear of social stigma. She reported no history of underlying diseases, trauma, or insect bite to the vaginal area. She did not smoke cigarettes but used hookah. In the past six months, the patient did not have sexual intercourse and had regular menstruation.\n\n【7】She reported wearing underpants and skirts. The physical exam revealed erythema in the labia major and around the groins due to severe itching. In the vaginal exam, inflammation and a large number of maggots were observed in the urethral meatus, labia minora, and vaginal canal, progressing to near the cervix. Still, the cervix seemed intact on colposcopy. Infection and necrosis were observed in the labia minora due to the existence of larvae that ate away at the tissues. No significant lymphadenopathy was observed. Many maggots were sampled for microscopical examination. About 50-60 maggots were separated from the labia minora and about 10 from the vaginal canal. Blood (WBC: 9.2/mm<sup>3</sup>, Hgb: 14gr/dl) and stool test results were normal, but urine analysis reported a large number of larvae (a maximum size of 4 mm) without RBC or WBC. The morphology of the larvae was compatible with flies (family Insect) . The patient could not afford an entomological examination of the parasite. Cystoscopy was requested to examine bladder and urinary tract infection. Cystoscopy revealed gross erosion and burrowing of the left lateral urethral wall, and large clots embedded with maggots were identified within the bladder lumen.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】Urine analysis reported a large number of larvae (a maximum size of 4 mm) without RBC or WBC. The morphology of the larvae was compatible with flies.\n\n【10】The bladder was quickly rinsed, and a Foley catheter was placed for one week. About 30 maggots were removed after rinsing the urinary tract. To remove the maggots possibly existing deep into the vaginal tissue, 15% chloroform in paraffin oil was used to rinse the patient’s vagina for 48 hours. The infected and necrotic parts of the labia minor were debrided. To prevent reinfection and secondary bacteremia, the patient was treated with amoxicillin, clavulanic acid (1.2 g twice a day), and metronidazole (500 mg three times a day) for one week. She was admitted to the gynecology ward for one week. Upon discharge, she was recommended to keep her vagina and living environment clean and not to wear skirts when working at the farm or with animals. Two weeks later, cystoscopy results were normal, the infected parts of the labia minora were improved, and no maggots were found in the vaginal exam.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Myiasis is an ectoparasitic infection of humans and vertebrae, the most prevalent form of which is cutaneous myiasis. Nasopharyngeal myiasis involves the infection of the nose, mouth, sinuses, and ears. Other forms of this condition include ophthalmomyiasis, intestinal myiasis, and urogenital myiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Infestation with larvae can be caused by obligate or facultative parasites. When dipterous larvae enter the human tissue, they follow three stages of growth and feeding, after which they transform into pupa and then to mature flies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. Cochliomyia hominivorax, Chrysomya bezziana, and W. magnifica are the most prevalent flies causing obligatory human wounds worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【13】Urogenital myiasis constitutes only 0.7% of human infestations, with very few cases reported so far 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 8\\]</u>. A recent systematic review found the vagina as the most prevalent site of female urogenital myiasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our case, myiasis involved the labia minora, urinary bladder, urethral meatus, and vaginal canal. Therefore, the flies may lay their eggs near the urethra, and then, the larvae hatch and migrate to the bladder.\n\n【14】The risk factors of external urogenital myiasis include a low socioeconomic status, inappropriate health conditions, poor mental and physical health, a lack of personal hygiene, cervical cancer, urinary tract stents, and sexually transmitted infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Treatment aims to clean the tissue from larvae. Sometimes, manual pressure is enough for cutaneous myiasis, which is usually performed before visiting the doctor. Surgery is almost always indicated for the migratory form of the disease. The general myiasis management protocol includes the mechanical removal of all the visible larvae, followed by debridement and, occasionally, rinsing with disinfectant solutions and bandaging, until all the maggots are removed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The use of 15% chloroform in olive or other oils, or even ether, demobilizes the larvae. In our patient, the vagina was rinsed with 15% chloroform in liquid paraffin for 2 days.\n\n【16】Myiasis can be prevented by using DEET (chemical name, N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) containing pesticides and mosquito nets. Ironing is an effective method for killing the eggs. Other preventive measures include wearing long-sleeved clothes to cover the wounds and not sleeping outdoors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【17】#### Data Availability\n\n【18】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【19】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【20】This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hamadan University of Medical Science (IR.UMSHA.REC.1400.877)\n\n【21】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【22】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Some patients develop severe complications such as bowel perforation, infarction, obstruction, or irreversible bladder dysfunction. Early diagnosis is critical for management of lupus enteritis and cystitis. We report a 48-year-old Japanese man who presented with initial manifestations of abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and bloody feces. The diagnosis was delayed due to atypical initial symptoms, resulting in clinical worsening. Physicians should be aware of typical computed tomography findings of lupus enteritis and lupus cystitis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic chronic inflammatory disease. While fever, joint pain, and rash are the most common symptoms, some patients predominately show manifestations in the hematologic, renal, or central nervous system. This lack of typical presentation often causes delay in diagnosis of SLE. Although lupus enteritis is relatively uncommon, it may lead to life-threatening complications such as bowel perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Early diagnosis is of great importance in management of lupus enteritis. Here, we describe a patient who presented with lupus enteritis and lupus cystitis as initial manifestations of SLE, for whom the diagnosis was delayed due to the atypical presentation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】On July 14, 2015, a 48-year-old Japanese man was admitted to an outside hospital with fever, vomiting, intermittent abdominal pain, severe diarrhea, and bloody feces. Laboratory test results were as follows: white blood cell count, 2200/μL; hemoglobin, 14.9 g/dL; platelets, 14.9 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; C-reactive protein (CRP), 21.2 mg/dL; amylase, 529 U/L (normal < 120 U/L); albumin, 3.1 g/dL (normal > 3.8 g/dL); urea nitrogen, 48 mg/dL; creatinine, 1.33 mg/dL; and urine protein, 1+. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed bowel wall thickening and enhancement. A colonoscopy identified edematous changes from the ileum to the rectum. Colon biopsy showed lymphocyte infiltrations in the mucous membrane covering the epithelial cells. These findings led to a diagnosis of severe infectious enteritis. With antibiotics and bowel rest, diarrhea and abdominal pain partially improved. On August 5, oral intake was resumed. However, the gastrointestinal symptoms recurred, and abdominal CT still showed edematous bowel wall. It was thought unlikely that the symptoms were caused by infectious enteritis alone. On August 20, he was referred to us in the Department of Clinical Immunology at Kitano Hospital, and his symptoms were reevaluated. On admission, no alopecia, rash, oral ulcers, arthritis, neurological disorder, or bladder irritation was noted. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the epigastrium and diminished bowel sounds. Laboratory test results were as follows: anti-nuclear antibody (indirect immunofluorescence test) 1 : 160 (normal < 1 : 40); anti-dsDNA antibody 55.8 IU/mL (normal < 12 IU/mL); CH50 24.2 U/mL (normal: 30–50 U/mL); C3 88 mg/dL (normal: 65–135 mg/dL); C4 32 mg/dL (normal: 13–35 mg/dL); and urine protein 0.39 g/gCr. Chest CT showed bilateral pleural effusions.

Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with SLE developed with lupus enteritis. Intravenous administration of methylprednisolone (100 mg/day) was started immediately. However, 2 weeks later abdominal CT still showed bowel wall thickening and enhancement , engorgement of mesenteric vessels , bladder wall thickening , ascites, and bilateral pleural effusions. He was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg) for 3 days, followed by intravenous methylprednisolone (100 mg/day). Bowel wall thickening rapidly improved, and the ascites and bilateral pleural effusions disappeared. The steroid was gradually tapered and changed to oral administration. However, his gastrointestinal symptoms recurred when the oral prednisolone dose was 40 mg/day (0.8 mg/kg/day). Intravenous cyclophosphamide at 1100 mg (750 mg/mm<sup>2</sup> BSA) was administered. He was discharged on oral prednisolone (35 mg/day) followed by monthly intravenous cyclophosphamide without recurrence.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【7】CT scan reveals bowel wall thickening and enhancement and engorgement of mesenteric vessels.

Discussion\n\n【11】Lupus enteritis is typically steroid-responsive with prompt treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. However, some patients develop severe complications such as bowel perforation, infarction, or obstruction. Early diagnosis is critical for management of lupus enteritis. However, clinical symptoms of lupus enteritis are often nonspecific with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody feces. Unless a patient presents with typical symptoms of SLE, such as fever, rash, joint pain, and/or hematologic, renal, or central nervous system manifestations, diagnosis can often be delayed. The most useful tool for the diagnosis of lupus enteritis is abdominal CT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Typical CT findings of lupus enteritis include bowel wall thickening with enhancement (target sign), engorgement of mesenteric vessels (nodular sign and comb sign), and increased attenuation of mesenteric fat 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6, 7\\]</u>. Also, lupus enteritis and lupus cystitis often occur concurrently; the common mechanism is thought to be smooth muscle dyskinesia due to immune complex-mediated damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate involvement of the urinary tract if lupus enteritis is suspected. In our patient, bowel wall thickening with enhancement (target sign), engorgement of mesenteric vessels (nodular sign and comb sign), and bladder wall thickening were also identified by retrospective analysis of the first abdominal CT. Physicians should be aware of the typical CT findings of lupus enteritis (target sign, nodular sign, and comb sign) and lupus cystitis (bladder wall thickening), although these findings are not specific to lupus enteritis as the above described abnormalities can also be seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【12】Several studies evaluated predictive factors for the recurrence of lupus enteritis. Koo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> have suggested that involvement of the colon and urinary tract may be associated with the recurrence of lupus enteritis. Kim et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and Yuan et al. demonstrated that bowel wall thickening (>8 or 9 mm) was a risk factor for recurrence. In addition, Yuan et al. showed that lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated serum amylase were associated with severe adverse events. Consistent with these findings, our case had involvement of the colon and urinary tract, bowel wall thickening (10 mm), lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated serum amylase, suggesting the patient was at high risk for recurrence and severe adverse events. As intravenous cyclophosphamide is recommended for patients with severe or steroid-resistant lupus enteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5, 8, 9\\]</u>, our case was successfully treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide. However, corticosteroids might have been adequate for the management of lupus enteritis if the case had been promptly diagnosed. Early diagnosis is of great importance for the optimal management of lupus enteritis.\n\n【13】#### Competing Interests\n\n【14】The authors declare that they have no competing interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Discussion\n\n【18】The overall reported prevalence of amniotic bands in the UK and Western Europe varies between 0.44 to 0.48 (per 10,000 births) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Circumferential congenital constriction band of the abdomen is extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>. Some common characteristics of the congenital constriction band of the abdomen have been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The constriction band follows a single segment that is higher on the back. The constriction ring may be located above or below the pelvic brim. The depth varies from a shallow groove to a deep gutter and usually extends only up to the first fascial layer.

This case has two peculiarities. First the pancreatic metastasis was treated just with medical therapy, that is, Sunitinib, instead of the surgical therapy that is mostly considered. Secondly, the pancreatic lesion showed different characteristics on the computed tomography scan compared to the usual pancreatic metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma. The pancreatic metastasis totally regressed after medical treatment and nowadays, four years after the diagnosis, the patient is disease-free.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The presence of pancreatic metastases from solid tumours is a rare event, with an incidence rate varying from 1.6% to 11% in autopsy series of patients affected by advanced neoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The neoplasms that could give these types of metastases are melanoma, lung tumours, colic neoplasms, breast cancer, and with a higher rate of frequency the kidney tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】The patient, a 75-year-old female, had a positive oncological anamnesis: her brother was affected by rectal neoplasm and her three aunts were affected by breast cancer, bladder cancer, and rectal cancer, respectively. The patient was under medical treatment for hypertension and due to the onset of general malaise, anemia, and asthenia, she performed a total body contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan. CECT total body scan was performed with a triphasic study of the abdomen and with a urographic phase. The scans showed the presence of an expansive solid growing mass with multilobulated shapes on the left kidney. The lesion was 90 mm (Longitudinal Diameter-LD) × 85 mm (Transversal Diameter-TD) × 96 mm (Anteroposterior Diameter-APD) sized (Figures 1(a), and 1(b)). The mass infiltrated the renal pelvis and the mid calyx (Figure 1(c)); proximal ureter was encased but not infiltrated (Figure 1(d)). The mass showed an inhomogeneous enhancement after contrast medium administration due to the presence of solid parts; many colliquative-necrtotic areas and intralesional calcifications were also found (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). An enlargement of the ipsilateral splenic vein, 9 mm sized (Figure 2(c)), and many intralesional collateral vessels were also observed (Figure 2(d)). No radiological signs of thrombosis of the main arteries or veins were detected. At the istm of the pancreas a nodular round-shaped lesion, 6 mm in size, was observed. The lesion, isodense in the precontrast scans (Figure 3(a)), after contrast medium administration, appeared hypervascularized in all the three phases of the study with a rich vascular supply (Figures 3(b), 3(c), 3(d), and 3(e)) and was referable, due to its contrastographic behavior, to a local metastasis or to a primitive neuroendocrine tumor. The pancreatic lesion showed on CECT scan unusual characteristics for a metastasis from renal clear cell carcinoma and, before considering surgical excision of the pancreatic mass, we decided that biopsy of the pancreatic lesion was needed in order to assess its nature. So the patient underwent a left nephrectomy with surrenalectomy and at the same time biopsy of the pancreatic lesion was performed. At the histological examination the renal mass resulted to be a clear cell carcinoma and the pancreatic lesion was found to be a metastasis of clear cell renal carcinoma.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| (a) and (b) show the presence of the renal lesion with multilobulated shapes, in the left kidney, 90 mm (LD) × 85 mm (TD) × 96 mm (APD) in size.

So, the patient started medical treatment with Sunitinib, 50 mg/day for two cycles. Due to the onset of grade III skin toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity, the dose of Sunitinib was reduced to 37.5 mg/day for other six cycles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. After three months of treatment another CECT total body scan was performed. CECT scan showed in the posterior-basal segment of the inferior right lobe, close to the pleural wall, a solid nodular lesion, 10 mm (LD) × 8 mm (TD) × 8 mm (APD) sized (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). The hypervascularized pancreatic lesion was not more observed; a hypodense round-shaped lesion in the same region was observed (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)) which was a colliquative-necrotic outcome of the therapy. Considering that the lung lesion appeared during treatment with Sunitinib we thought that the best therapeutic choice was to remove surgically the lung lesion, mainly for two reasons. The first reason was that the patient was in good general clinical condition with adequate lung function and the lesion was surgically resectable. So, according to guidelines, surgery was indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The second reason was that the lung lesion appeared during treatment with Sunitinib, while the pancreatic metastases disappeared, so there was a possibility that the lung lesion was a second malignancy. In our case we decide to surgically remove the lung lesion in order to cure the patient and also because a histological characterization of the lung lesion was needed in order to differentiate the lung lesion from a second malignancy. Therefore, the patient performed surgical removal of the lung lesion. Histological examination deposed for metastasis from clear cell renal carcinoma.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| Images show the presence of the nodular lesion in the posterior basal segment of the inferior right lobe ((a) and (b)) and the pancreatic lesion after the treatment appeared hypodense due to necrotic-colliquative phenomena ((c) and (d)).

The following CECT exams showed the outcomes, such as metallic clips, of the left nephrectomy and surrenalectomy (Figure 5(a)), and of the resection of the lung metastasis (Figure 5(b)); no local relapses were seen in both the organs. The previous hypodense lesion seen at the istm of the pancreas totally regressed and no other pancreatic lesions were observed (Figure 5(c)). Nowadays the patient is under oncological follow-up; she is in a good state of health, and she is disease-free for 47 months from the diagnosis of the tumour and for 20 months from the end of the treatment with Sunitinib.\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n| Images show the absence of local relapses after the surgery in the left kidney (a) and in the lung (b); the hypodense pancreatic lesion was not more detectable at the pancreatic istm and no other pancreatic lesions were seen (c).

Discussion\n\n【19】The presence of pancreatic metastases from solid tumours is a rare event, with an incidence rate varying from 1.6% to 11% in autopsy series of patients affected by advanced neoplasms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The neoplasms that could give this type of metastases are melanoma, lung tumours, colic neoplasms, breast cancer, and with a higher rate of frequency kidney tumours 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Metastasization to the pancreas is most likely due to haematogenous spreading and the site of the tumour, right or left kidney, is an independent prognostic factor of metastasization. This occurs, as described in the analysis of Sellner et al. for the high affinity of the renal cancer cells for the parenchyma of the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In a review of the literature performed by Sellner et al. diagnosis in only 35% of the cases was made in asymptomatic patients. In the remaining 65% of cases, the patients had various symptoms including the following: abdominal pain (20%), gastrointestinal bleeding due to infiltration of the duodenum (20%), obstructive jaundice (9%), weight loss (9%), pancreatitis, and diabetes (3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In many cases the metastases were metachronous with appearance 2–18 years after the diagnosis of the primary tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The treatment of the metastases is usually surgical, with good results in terms of overall survival (about 43 months) and disease-free survival (23.6 months), while the 5-year survival after surgery is between 43% and 88% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Usually metastases from clear cell renal carcinoma on CT scan are isoattenuating in the unenhanced phase, as observed in our case. After contrast medium administration pancreatic metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma usually closely resemble the appearance of the primary carcinoma, showing on CECT scan irregular and not well-rounded shapes, a nonhomogenous and irregular contrast enhancement, and a central hypoenhancing necrotic portion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. Despite these general features, in our case the pancreatic metastasis on CECT scan showed well-rounded shapes and a homogenous and uniform contrast enhancement without any hypoenhnacing necrotic portion. According to the literature and to our daily radiological experience small hypervascular lesions, with rounded shapes and with a rich and uniform contrast enhancement, as observed in our case, rarely could be referred to metastases from renal clear cell carcinoma. Most often small pancreatic lesions, with rounded shapes and with a uniform contrast enhancement on CECT scan, could be referred to neuroendocrine pancreatic tumours, primitive or metastatic to the pancreas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. For these reasons the pancreatic lesion observed in our case presented, on CECT scan, unusual characteristics for a metastasis from renal clear cell carcinoma and this is why the biopsy of the lesion was performed.\n\n【20】In our case the diagnosis of the pancreatic metastasis is synchronous to the primary tumour, unlike the majority of the cases reported in the literature, where the metastases appeared many years after the diagnosis of the primary tumour. In our case the symptomatology was very mild and nonspecific, not clearly indicative of the presence of a pancreatic lesion. Although the guidelines indicate the need for a complete local excision, in our case the patient, who had just performed ​​a major abdominal surgery with nephrectomy, was not in suitable clinical conditions to undergo a second surgical procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Thus, the type of treatment we have chosen was pharmacological, using Sunitinib an inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase receptor. Regarding the pulmonary mass, because it appeared during the treatment with Sunitinib, we had thought it was probably a selection of a clone of resistant cells or a second malignancy, so, considering that the patient at that time was in a good clinical condition to perform another surgery, the best therapeutic choice was the surgical resection in order to make a correct differential diagnosis and to obtain a complete eradication of the lung lesion. The management of lung metastases while on Sunitinib treatment must be assessed individually. The target is to reach the complete eradication of the disease with a multimodal approach. Unfortunately, currently there are no randomized trials designed to gain information about the correct timing of treatment strategy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The data reported in the literature show that metastasectomy after initial systemic therapy gave partial or complete response in a majority of patients. In these patients the median survival was 4.7 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In patients with a single resected pulmonary metastasis a 5 year-overall survival of 50% has been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Moreover, it must be considered that there is a difference if the lung metastasis is already present before starting treatment with Sunitinib or if it appears during therapy. In the second case a II line pharmacological treatment is indicated, if metastasectomy is not possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Regarding the choice to continue or discontinue the systemic treatment after achieving a complete response, in the literature there are some studies on few patients, so the results are not yet conclusive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. It has been suggested that, after complete response, there may still be residual cancer cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Some articles published in literature affirm that the discontinuation of chemotherapy may allow the cells to proliferate and lead to disease recurrence, whereas continuation of chemotherapy maintains therapeutic pressure on the residual cancer cells, preventing disease recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Based on these data we continued treatment after achieving a complete response but, due to poor tolerance of the patient, we had to stop the treatment.\n\n【21】However our patient, 47 months after the diagnosis and 20 months after the end of the therapy, is in good condition and disease-free. It is important to remember that patients with pancreatic metastases from renal cancer could be symptomatic but also asymptomatic. Considering that renal clear carcinoma could give metastases even after many years the remission of the disease, a long time follow-up with periodic radiological exams should be performed in patients who had a renal clear carcinoma. Even if the treatment for pancreatic metastasis from renal clear carcinoma is surgical, also the medical therapy for the metastatic lesions could be considered and each case must be assessed individually.\n\n【22】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【23】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Idiopathic acquired leukonychia is a rare chromatic disorder of the nail not associated with other abnormalities and discernible etiology. Our case report did not link the inheritance of leukonychia with diverse clinical syndromes. To our knowledge, only five cases of idiopathic, acquired, true total leukonychia were found in literature. This case was the sixth patient with asymptomatic idiopathic, white fingernails, and toenails without a hereditary cause.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Leukonychia refers to whiteness of the nails which can occur either in patches or involving the entire nail 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The condition can be either true leukonychia, with involvement of the nail plate, or pseudoleukonychia, caused by subungual and nailbed abnormalities.\n\n【4】Leukonychia may be acquired or inherited. Acquired leukonychia is frequently associated with trauma, drugs such as chemotherapeutic agents, 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> systemic or local infections—such as typhoid fever, hepatic cirrhosis, ulcerative colitis or leprosy, hypocalcaemia, and, very commonly, minor trauma. True leukonychia can be inherited as an isolated condition or as one of several other reported syndromes. There are a number of autosomal, dominantly inherited leukonychia syndromes, including leukonychia totalis, in which leukonychia occurs in combination with kidney stone and sebaceous cysts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>, as well as leukonychia, with sensory-neural deafness and knuckle pads, known as the Bart-Pumphrey syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u> .\n\n【5】Table 1 \n\n【6】Classification of true leukonychia.\n\n【7】Classification of the so-called true leukonychia may also be based on the distribution of white blotches, known as leukonychia punctata, leukonychia striata, leukonychia partialis, or leukonychia totalis. Idiopathic true leukonychia is a much rarer condition, with only a few reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–11\\]</u> cases. The following is the case history of a man with persistent, progressive idiopathic leukonychia.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】The 34-year-old male patient was admitted in the Department of Dermatology, University of Palermo (Italy), complaining of color changes on the nails. The symptoms were observed synchronously and had apparently been present for 11 years. When the patient was 23, he developed simultaneous leuconychia partialis of both the fingers and toenails. There was no evidence of atopy, lichen planus, alopecia areata, or psoriasis.\n\n【10】The patient was without a previous medical history. He reported not having taken any drug specific and not to be exposed to chemical agents. He also had no peripheral neurovascular disorders. On examination, striata and total leukonychia of all twenty nails was found . Further clinical examination revealed soft nails with slow growth, without other cutaneous or visceral abnormalities.\n\n【11】(a)\n\n【12】(b)\n\n【13】(c)\n\n【14】(d)\n\n【15】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| (a)-(b) Both hands had opaque nail plates characteristic of leukonychia totalis. (c)-(d) The patient toenails exhibited leukonychia totalis and partialis. |\n| --- |\n\n【18】A progression over the years from leuconychia partialis to leuconychia totalis was demonstrated. On examination, the patient had no central nervous system, eye, ear, hair, teeth, or skin abnormalities.\n\n【19】There was no family history of nail disease, the patient was born to nonconsanguineous parents and had two older siblings, a brother and sister, without any features of the disease. There was no family history of atopy, psoriasis, lichen planus, alopecia areata, or any other illnesses. Repeated potassium hydroxide preparations and fungal cultures of the white nails were negative.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】Leukonychia is a whitening of the nail plate. It was first described by Mees in 1919, as an associated finding in arsenic intoxication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The physiologic mechanism leading to this phenomenon is not entirely clear. According to Newton's theorem, a surface appears white when it reflects the radiation of visible light. This mechanism can be proposed in explaining leukonychia. Because true leuconychia is thought to be due to abnormal matrix keratinization, with persistent parakeratosis and keratohyaline granules in the nail plate, parakeratosis and dissociation of the keratin bundles may play a role in the modification of the solar light reflection by the ungueal plates.\n\n【23】Several studies have provided evidence for the association of total leukonychia with diverse clinical syndromes, including leukonychia with palmoplantar keratoderma and atrophic fibrosis, pili torti 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, congenital hypoparathyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, onychorrhexis, and cataracts and the LEOPARD syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

{"seq_id": "83e353df-2b40-4dc1-860f-5f4fe401dfcd", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Hypercalcemia is a relatively common clinical problem in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Primary pathophysiology is the entry of calcium that exceeds its excretion into urine or deposition in bone into circulation. Among a wide array of causes of hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the most common, accounting for greater than 90 percent of cases. Concordantly, there has been a resurgence of milk-alkali syndrome associated with the ingestion of large amounts of calcium and absorbable alkali, making it the third leading cause of hypercalcemia (Beall and Scofield, 1995 and Picolos et al. 2005). This paper centers on a case of over-the-counter calcium and alkali ingestion for acid reflux leading to milk alkali with concordant use of thiazide diuretic for hypertension.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Sippy, almost 100 years ago, developed a calcium-laden milk and antacid regimen for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The rationale was to neutralize the hyperacidity that was deemed responsible for peptic ulcer disease. The Sippy regimen until the 1970s was used for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, a disorder that was predominant in middle-aged men, when nonantacid treatment was first introduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Sippy's original recommendation consisted of the hourly administration of milk and cream together with what became known as the Sippy powders, which were 10 grains (1 grain = 65 mg) each of heavily calcinated magnesia and sodium bicarbonate, alternating with a powder that contained 10 grains of bismuth subcarbonate and 20 to 30 grains of sodium bicarbonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Hardt and Rivers in 1923 gave a detailed description of the toxicity that was associated with the antacid and milk regimen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The symptoms consisted of nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, musculoskeletal pains, and weakness followed by prostration. There was an associated elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine, alkalosis, and albuminuria. Cope in 1936 first recognized hypercalcemia as a major feature of this toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. He also showed a rapid resolution of alkalosis and hypercalcemia after cessation of treatment, but the recovery of renal function was much slower. Fundamentally, the differentiation of milk-alkali syndrome from primary hyperparathyroidism was evident due to the absence of hypophosphatemia and the resolution of the hypercalcemia once treatment with antacids was stopped. Burnett et al. in 1949 described a chronic variant of the milk-alkali syndrome in which renal failure was persistent and soft tissue calcifications were extensive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】Punsar and Somer in 1963 classified milk-alkali syndrome into three different types: acute, subacute (Cope’s syndrome), and chronic (Burnett’s syndrome) toxicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Shortly thereafter, McMillan and Freeman formulated a comprehensive table and compared clinical presentation, biochemical findings, and resolution of the three different types of the milk-alkali syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The subacute form (Cope’s syndrome) was seen during therapy with calcium and alkali that had been used intermittently for years. In contrast to the acute form, there was less rapid improvement in symptoms and the recovery of renal function was slower. The chronic form (Burnett’s syndrome) occurred after a long history of ingestion of large amounts of calcium and alkali. Presentation of Burnett's syndrome included complains of pruritus, diffuse musculoskeletal symptoms, nephrocalcinosis, and band keratopathy with large soft tissue calcium deposits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8\\]</u>. Although symptoms usually improved with the discontinuation of calcium antacids, the resolution of hypercalcemia was slow, especially in patients with large soft tissue deposits of calcium. Renal insufficiency often improved but did not resolve completely.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】Our patient is a 64-year-old Caucasian male who presented to the emergency room (ER) with a 2-week complaint of progressive weakness, dizziness on ambulation, nausea, and per accompanying family members, a deterioration in mental status. In the ER, he was hemodynamically stable, but serum analysis was significant for hypercalcemia of 16.9 with corrected calcium per serum albumin 18.2 (normal 8.4–10.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), formula for corrected serum calcium = measured serum calcium + 0.8 \\ (normal albumin – measured patient albumin)), alkalosis with bicarbonate 34.6 (normal 21.0–31.0 millimole per liter (mmol/L), renal insufficiency with BUN 30 (normal 6–20 mg/dL) and creatinine 4.0 (normal 0.5–1.2 mg/dL), total protein 5.8 (normal 6.2–8.2 g/dL), albumin 3.0 (normal 3.2–5.0 g/dL), phosphorus 3.1 (normal 2.5–4.6 mg/dL), WBC 11.5 (normal 4.5–10.0 K/cumm), hemoglobin 14.3 (normal 13.0–17.0 g/dL), hematocrit 40.9 (normal 39.0–52.0), and platelets 341 (normal 140–400 K/cumm). Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia at 106 beats per minute, normal PR, and QRS intervals with QT/QTc 304/400 msec. Arterial blood gas showed alkalemia: pH 7.48 (normal 7.35–7.45), pCO<sup>2</sup> 46 (normal 35–45 mm/Hg), and O<sup>2</sup> saturation 99% (normal 95–98).\n\n【8】With this physical presentation, hypercalcemia with renal insufficiency and alkalosis, he was admitted to acute medicine floor. Management included aggressive fluid resuscitation with normal saline, acute coronary syndrome rule out, telemetry placement for cardiac arrhythmia monitoring, and workup for the etiology of hypercalcemia. On thorough history and chart review, the patient admitted to taking large quantities of over-the-counter calcium supplementation in the form of TUMS for his chronic acid reflux spanning over 3 decades. Recently, over the past several weeks, due to worsening reflux symptoms, he had increased his daily TUMS from 5-6 tablets to as much as 20–30 tablets per day. He had previously been seen in a cardiology clinic (6 months prior to this presentation) for followup of hypertension (HTN) and was started on low-dose hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg per day. He was seen in a pulmonary clinic for followup of lung nodule (which had previously been worked up as benign) and in a gastrointestinal clinic 2 months after cardiology visit and was noted to have serum Ca of 11.6. He was counseled extensively on stopping over the counter acid suppression and given prescription of omeprazole 40 mg BID which he decided not to take.\n\n【9】Etiology workup revealed ionized calcium (iCa) at 8.3 (normal 4.48–5.28 mg/dL), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) < 3.0 (normal 10–65 pg/mL) indicating non-PTH-mediated hypercalcemia, parathyroid-hormone-related peptide (PTHrp) at 0, Vit D 1,25 <8 (normal 18–64 pg/mL), and Vit D 25 at 23 (optimum level 25–80 ng/mL) ruling out malignancy and hypervitaminosis. Other causes were also ruled out with normal serum thyroid studies, serum protein electrophoresis, chest radiograph, and chest CT showing no new changes and renal ultrasound being benign. Gastroenterology and nephrology consults were obtained to conclude the diagnosis of milk-alkali syndrome and to formulate multidisciplinary plan. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed grade IV reflux esophagitis, distal esophageal stricture, gastritis, and erosive duodenitis. Pathologic specimen was reported as benign squamous hyperplasia with negative stain for H. pylori. Initial fluid resuscitation was supplemented with IV proton pump inhibitor twice a day and nutrition evaluation and recommendation; all of which resulted in impressive resolution of hypercalcemia and restoration of renal functions to normal thus confirming milk-alkali syndrome. Patient was later discharged home on omeprazole 40 mg twice a day (BID) and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg. As followup, he was seen in internal medicine clinic 3 months after discharge with serum Ca of 10.6, albumin 4.3, improvement in reflux symptoms, and baseline functional status.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】In the milk-alkali syndrome, hypercalcemia develops because the input of calcium (dietary intake and intestinal absorption) exceeds the output (primarily renal excretion). About 4 to 60 g/d of calcium carbonate has been reported to induce the milk-alkali syndrome, indicating that factors besides calcium intake contribute to the development of the milk-alkali syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Factors that can increase calcium input include increased dietary calcium intake, ingestion of supplemental calcium, enhanced intestinal absorption of calcium usually resulting from stimulation by vitamin D that is present in some calcium supplements, and other dietary factors. Calcium-containing compounds have also been shown to directly increase gastric acid secretion by stimulating the CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor) when ingested orally, which in turn increases the availability of free calcium for absorption 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【12】It is likely that bone, the primary repository for calcium, increases calcium uptake but becomes saturated during high calcium exposure. The capacity of bone to increase calcium uptake per unit of bone changes with age as does the extent of bone remodeling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. Randall et al. in 1961 gave insight into the time course of this syndrome after observing 40 men with peptic ulcer disease who were treated with milk and either aluminum hydroxide or calcium carbonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In the milk–carbonate group (12 grams of calcium per day), the mean plasma calcium concentration rose within 24 hours from 10 mg/dL to 11 mg/dL (2.5 to 2.75 mmol/L). In 9 of 20 patients treated for one week, the plasma calcium concentration reached or exceeded 11.3 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) and, in a few cases, exceeded 12 mg/dL (3 mmol/L). The mean plasma bicarbonate concentration rose slightly, but in three of the 20 patients exceeded 31.5 meq/L. The plasma creatinine concentration rose from 1.2 to 1.4 mg/dL (106 to 124 mmol/L) on the third day. The plasma phosphate concentration rose during the first few days. One patient developed the acute milk-alkali syndrome with hypercalcemia preceding the development of renal insufficiency and alkalosis. From this study, it can be concluded that although exposure to excessive calcium and alkali ingestion can cause marked increases in serum Ca and bicarbonate in rare cases, mild intermittent hypercalcemia can be seen in a significant number of patients.\n\n【13】Renal vasoconstriction secondary to hypercalcemia leads to a fall in glomerular filtration rate, and hypercalcemia directly stimulates tubular hydrogen ion secretion and, therefore, bicarbonate reabsorption leading to metabolic alkalosis. The alkalosis helps to maintain hypercalcemia and volume depletion by enhancing the activity of the CaSR and by increasing calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule via the pH-sensitive calcium channel, the transient receptor potential vanilloid member 5 \\[TRPV5\\] 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–19\\]</u>. Volume contraction due to vomiting, diuretics, or the natriuretic effects of hypercalcemia further aggravates hypercalcemia and alkalosis. Marked hypercalcemia can lead to the patient presenting with acute toxicity (nausea, vomiting, weakness, and mental changes with psychosis or depressed sensorium).\n\n【14】After extensive clinical and laboratory evaluation, no evidence of malignant disease or primary hyperparathyroidism was seen in our patient. No cause of hypercalcemia could be identified other than the ingestion of large amount of CaCO<sub>3</sub> (calcium carbonate) with concurrent use of thiazide diuretic. Along with the pathophysiology of hypercalcemia secondary to large calcium intake and absorption as mentioned above, thiazide diuretics are known to reduce urinary calcium excretion and produce mild hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. In the kidney, distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs about 8% of the filtered Ca load. This occurs via epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. In the steady state, the cell must extrude all penetrating Ca, which occurs via a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase and through Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger located on the basolateral surface of the cells of the distal tubule. Thiazides inhibit the Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup> symport in the early distal convoluted tubule, thus causing a decrease in intracellular Na. This, in turn, enhances the activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger, creating an increased driving for Ca resorption through the epithelial Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. The final effects increased Ca reabsorption leading to hypercalcemia. In a novel study, Nijenhuis et al. showed that mice that lacked active distal Ca<sup>2+</sup> reabsorption (TRVP5-knockout) developed hypercalcemia with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) treatment and that enhanced passive Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport in the proximal tubule rather than active Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport in distal convolution explains thiazide-induced hypocalciuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【15】In conclusion, the ingestion of absorbable calcium, metabolic alkalosis, and concomitant use of thiazide diuretic can produce severe hypercalcemia which can be potentially more life threatening than is generally observed with either agent alone. This must be taken into account while prescribing thiazide diuretics for hypertension to patient with gastric reflux disease due to the ready availability of nonprescription medication containing CaCO<sub>3</sub>.\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests.</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Authors’ Contribution</u>\n\n【19】通用结尾删除-1:<u>B.

HSP in the adult population is rare, and no case has been described of HSP in liver cirrhosis with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We present the case of a 58-year-old male with liver cirrhosis, who was subsequently diagnosed with SBP and later HSP. In this patient, the diagnosis of HSP was demonstrated clinically by his palpable purpura, diarrhea, hematuria, and abdominal pain and confirmed pathologically by his renal and skin biopsies demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis and IgA complexes. We believe that this is an example of altered IgA processing in cirrhosis leading to the development of IgA immune complexes and ultimately HSP. The patient additionally had SBP, which may have increased his risk for developing HSP given antigen processing by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues leading to immune complex deposition, which may not have been effectively cleared in the context of his liver disease. The patient unfortunately died of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which is unclear to be due to his underlying cirrhosis or a gastrointestinal manifestation of HSP itself.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a small vessel systemic vasculitis, predominantly affecting children, with ninety percent of cases occurring in the pediatric population. HSP is characterized by a tetrad of manifestations, specifically palpable purpura, arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal disease, with gastrointestinal and renal involvement more prevalent in older adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. The characteristic finding is leukocytoclastic vasculitis accompanied by IgA immune complexes within affected organs. Gastrointestinal symptoms of HSP can range from mild symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain to gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bowel ischemia, and bowel perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. About half of cases of HSP are preceded by an upper respiratory infection or other underlying infections. HSP in the adult population is rare, and no case has been described of HSP in liver cirrhosis with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). We present the case of a 58-year-old male with liver cirrhosis and SBP, confounded by the diagnosis of HSP.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 58-year-old male with past medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, depression, HTN, chronic alcohol abuse, and BPH, presented to our hospital with worsening left-lower quadrant abdominal pain over three weeks and painless hematuria for five days. He had no known history of liver or kidney disease. Physical examination was significant for abdominal distension and left-lower quadrant abdominal tenderness. His initial labs demonstrated pancytopenia (white blood cell count 3.3, hemoglobin 7.7, hematocrit 23.4, and platelets 95), acute kidney injury (creatinine 1.6, unknown baseline), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 3.0), hyponatremia (sodium 129), and a nonanion gap metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate 15.5), Table 1(a). Urine studies showed large amount of blood and RBCs with some hyaline casts and proteinuria, and urine electrolytes showed FeNa of 0.8%, Table 1(d). CT abdomen showed a nodular margin of the liver with mild intrahepatic biliary dilation, suggesting chronic liver disease, along with splenomegaly. US abdomen confirmed heterogeneous and nodular contour of liver with splenomegaly and moderate amount of ascites, likely sequelae of cirrhosis, with dopplers negative for thrombosis. The nodular liver on CT, thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, splenomegaly, and moderate ascites all helped establish the new diagnosis of liver cirrhosis.\n\n【6】Table 1 \n\n【7】(a) Initial labs. (b) Other labs. (c) Paracentesis. (d) Urine studies.\n\n【8】Despite further labs to exclude viral, autoimmune, and other causes, Table 1(b), the etiology of his liver cirrhosis remained unclear, attributable to NASH versus alcohol given his history of uncontrolled diabetes and chronic etoh abuse, Table 1(b). Diagnostic paracentesis was performed, showing glucose 182, LDH 79, albumin 0.9, and protein 1.7 with 6400 RBCs and 1850 nucleated cells (51% granulocytes, 17% lymphocytes, and 32% tissue cells), Table 1(c). Cytopathological examination revealed no neoplastic cells, and bacterial culture was negative. The corrected neutrophil count of 917 and serum-ascites albumin gradient of 2.1 were consistent with SBP and portal hypertension, Table 1(c).\n\n【9】After diagnosis of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class B, MELD 6) and SBP, he was treated with IV ceftriaxone (2 g daily) and IV albumin (1.5 g/kg on first day and 1 g/kg on third day). He was placed on protonix given portal hypertension with unknown variceal status and was monitored for signs of hepatic encephalopathy, though he mentated well with no asterixis on exam. Repeat diagnostic paracentesis on day 3 demonstrated resolution of his SBP with 8150 RBCs and 305 nucleated cells (3% granulocytes, 51% lymphocytes, 45% tissue cells, and 1% eosinophils).\n\n【10】Despite the underlying diagnosis of liver cirrhosis and SBP, the basis of his renal dysfunction and hematuria continued to remain a mystery. Cystoscopy was negative for malignancy, and his urine sediment did not reveal any dysmorphic RBCs. Quantification of his proteinuria revealed a protein: creatinine ratio of 1.9. There was concern for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) given his low FeNa and bland urine sediment. He was given albumin with no improvement in his renal function in addition to treating underlying SBP, while additional treatments such as midodrine and octreotide were not pursued given his high MAPs. Work-up for other causes of his renal failure continued.\n\n【11】Four days after admission, he had diarrhea, and thirteen days later, he developed new purpuric macules and papules, approximately 0.3–1.5 cm in size, most prominent on his elbows but also on his abdomen, buttocks, back, and inguinal folds. Skin biopsy showed fibrin, neutrophils, and neutrophil fragments near vessels with mixed cellular infiltrate and extravasated erythrocytes, Figures 1(a) and 1(b). Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies showed deposition of IgA and C3 in vessel walls, supporting the diagnosis of HSP, Figures 1(c) and 1(d). Due to worsening renal function with creatinine rising to 4.9, renal biopsy was performed revealing mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, Figures 2(a) and 2(b), with crescents, Figures 2(c) and 2(d), and IgA, Figure 2(e), also consistent with HSP. He was given one dose of solumedrol 500 mg IV and started on prednisone 60 mg, which was tapered to 50 mg daily, with protonix to decrease GI bleeding risk. The purpuric lesions subsequently resolved with corticosteroid treatment.\n\n【12】(a)\n\n【13】(b)\n\n【14】(c)\n\n【15】(d)\n\n【16】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【18】Skin biopsy, right arm.

Due to concern for worsening renal failure, uremia, and oliguria, he underwent emergent hemodialysis. His course quickly deteriorated as he became acutely hypotensive, with a sudden hemoglobin drop to 4.8. After two units of transfusion to hemoglobin of 8.8, he coded one day later with profuse hematemesis after an episode of bright red blood per rectum and died.\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【29】In this patient, the diagnosis of HSP was demonstrated clinically by his palpable purpura, diarrhea, hematuria, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis was confirmed pathologically by his renal and skin biopsies demonstrating leukocytoclastic vasculitis and IgA complexes. While HSP is predominantly a pediatric disorder, its existence in adults is rare and its association with liver cirrhosis is even more scant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. There are only a few case reports describing the association between liver cirrhosis and HSP. For example, Aggarwal et al. reported one of the first cases of liver cirrhosis with acute renal failure and HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Our case, however, is the first to show the significant extent of HSP in liver cirrhosis due to the combined renal and skin manifestations along with the additional complicating factor of SBP, which may have triggered his course of HSP.\n\n【30】Alcohol liver disease is characterized by IgA deposits in a continuous pattern along liver sinusoids, in addition to skin capillaries and mesangium of renal glomeruli. The liver contributes to the clearance of intravascular IgA, causing patients with chronic liver disease to show an increase in serum IgA concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Van de Wiel et al. studied the presence and concentration of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes in patients with alcoholic liver disease and patients with other nonalcoholic liver diseases with comparable serum IgA levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. He concluded that the presence of circulating IgA-containing immune complexes was directly related to the severity of liver damage and substantiated the pivotal role of the liver in clearing circulating IgA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The role of liver cirrhosis in the development of HSP is intriguing since this patient’s chronic liver disease may have precipitated the development of HSP with defective liver metabolism of IgA circulating immune complexes, leading to deposition in the skin and kidneys.\n\n【31】The diagnosis of SBP is particularly unique in this case and has not been previously reported in case reports of patients with combined HSP and liver cirrhosis. Observations in children with HSP have confirmed approximately 30–65% of IgA vasculitis cases occur after an upper respiratory tract infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Some propose that increased synthesis of IgA due to antigen processed by the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue leads to development of the disease by immune complex deposition between antigens and IgA in the skin, gut, and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In this particular case, it could be hypothesized that SBP may have triggered antigen processing by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the gut and the subsequent development of IgA complexes, with impaired clearing due to the patient’s underlying liver cirrhosis, leading to the significant extent of his HSP.\n\n【32】This patient unfortunately had a rapid decline due to his hospital stay. The extent of his HSP with combined renal and skin manifestations has previously not been described in the literature in association with liver cirrhosis. While he received corticosteroid treatment, this does not prevent nephritis or alter the course of HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. His renal failure may have also been worsened by SBP and underlying cirrhosis, in addition to his IgA nephropathy. His ultimate hematemesis may have been due to variceal hemorrhage in the context of his liver cirrhosis, though gastrointestinal hemorrhage is known to be a rare manifestation of HSP.\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【34】This is a unique case of significant HSP with both renal and skin manifestations along with SBP in a patient with underlying liver cirrhosis. While HSP is rare in adults, we believe that this is an example of altered IgA processing in cirrhosis leading to the development of IgA immune complexes and ultimately HSP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The patient additionally had SBP, which may have increased his risk for developing HSP given antigen processing by mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues leading to immune complex deposition, which may not have been effectively cleared in the context of his liver disease. The patient unfortunately died of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, which is unclear to be due to his underlying cirrhosis or a gastrointestinal manifestation of HSP itself.\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【37】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors first acknowledge St. Raphael’s Campus of Yale New Haven Hospital including all medical and nursing staff for the care of this patient.

Subacute thyroiditis (SAT) is an inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland, usually triggered by a recent viral or bacterial infection of upper respiratory tracts. The disease is characterized by neck pain radiating to the ears and thyroid gland tenderness. In most cases, it is associated with a transient episode of hyperthyroidism, which is followed by euthyroidism. However, sometimes, it manifests itself with hypothyroidism. Case Presentation. The present report described a case of SAT who was a 55-year-old man presenting to an endocrine clinic with tachycardia, tremor, and neck pain radiating to the jaw and ears. His thyroid function test revealed thyrotoxicosis, and thyroid ultrasound findings were consistent with SAT. The patient reported a history of COVID-19 about 15 days before presentation, which was confirmed by a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions. It is of great importance for physicians to note that thyrotoxicosis in a patient with a recent history of COVID-19 can be due to SAT. Therefore, they should not begin antithyroid drugs without ordering proper investigations.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of a case of pneumonia with unknown etiology in Wuhan, China. Investigations on this case by the Chinese scientists led to the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). On March 11, 2020, the mentioned disease, which was named as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), was declared a pandemic by the WHO. According to the mentioned organization, 254,256,432 cases of infection, as well as 5,112,461 cases of related mortality, had been reported until November 17, 2021 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The first clinical findings reported included respiratory symptoms associated with bilateral pulmonary ground-glass lesions on CT scan and radiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Since then, some extrapulmonary manifestations have also been reported as early disease manifestations or related complications, including gastrointestinal, hepatic, biliary, pancreatic, cardiovascular, ophthalmologic, and neurological manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Until March 26, 2021, twenty-two cases of subacute thyroiditis (SAT) were reported that were potentially due to concomitant or recent COVID-19 . However, there were no reports of any associations between the coronavirus infections and SAT before the current pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The present study reported a case of SAT after recent COVID-19.\n\n【4】Table 1 \n\n【5】Review of previous post-COVID SAT.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 55-year-old man living in Tehran, Iran, presented to the emergency department with complaints of diffuse neck pain extending to the jaw, severe and frequent coughs, and hot flashes. On clinical examination, the thyroid gland was tender, while the vital signs were normal. The patient reported a recent COVID-19 diagnosed with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 about 15 days before presentation, for which he was treated with favipiravir and corticosteroids (AMP dexamethasone 8 mg daily for 3 days). A thyroid function test (TFT) with the CLIA method was ordered for the patient, which showed elevated T3 and T4 and decreased TSH . The cell blood count (CBC) results were as follows: WBC, 10.4 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l (normal range: 4–10 × 10<sup>3</sup>/mm<sup>3</sup>); RBC, 3.95 × 10<sup>12</sup>/l (normal range: 4.6–6.2 10<sup>12</sup>/l); Hb, 11.9 g/dL (normal range: 13–17 g/dL); HCT, 34.5% (normal range: 39–50%); PLT, 432 × 10<sup>9</sup>/l (normal range: 140–400 10<sup>9</sup>/l); and lymphocyte rate, 19% (normal range: 20–45%). Also, the following inflammatory markers were elevated as well: ESR, 121 mm/h (normal range: up to 20 mm/h) and CRP titer, 92.6 mg/l (normal range: <10 mg/l). The thyroid ultrasound revealed a mild diffuse goiter with a focal and ill-defined hypoechoic area, which is a characteristic finding of SAT . The patient denied any history of thyroid diseases or chronic medication use. Stasiak and Lewiński 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u> proposed new diagnostic criteria for COVID-19-induced SAT based on the new characteristics of SAT triggered by SARS-CoV-2. We compared the abovementioned criteria  with the clinical findings of our patient, finding that the present case met the criteria for COVID-19-induced SAT, so the patient was diagnosed with SAT induced by COVID-19, for which he received aspirin as the first-line treatment. Following 10 days of treatment, no improvement was observed, and the patient complained of front neck pain while talking. Therefore, prednisolone 25 mg/d was prescribed for the patient. Following three weeks of prednisolone treatment, the symptoms were resolved, and thyroid function tests repeated for the patient indicated that T3, T4, and TSH levels returned to their normal ranges.\n\n【8】Table 2 \n\n【9】TFT at multiple time points during the patient illness.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【11】Thyroid ultrasound findings.\n\n【12】Table 3 \n\n【13】Comparison the mentioned criteria with the clinical findings of our patient.\n\n【14】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【15】The first report of COVID-19-induced SAT was an 18-year-old woman with symptoms consistent with SAT that was initiated 15 days after an episode of mild COVID-19 diagnosed by a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 at that time. The primary symptoms of this patient were the typical symptoms of SAT, including low-grade fever, neck pain, fatigue, and palpitations. Laboratory tests ordered were consistent with SAT and included accelerated ESR, elevated CRP, and thyrotoxicosis in the thyroid function test. Patients underwent corticosteroid therapy, leading to symptom resolution in a few days 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. After the publication of the mentioned report, the 2-week interval between COVID-19 and SAT was considered to be relatively short. However, other case reports and case series studies published afterward showed that surprisingly, SAT symptoms could initiate shortly after the beginning of COVID-19. According to the observations, SAT symptoms may develop concomitant with COVID-19 or shortly after, with a maximum interval of 6 weeks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u> . Although neck pain might be attributed to a viral infection, so it is usually underreported, and the prevalence of painless COVID-19-induced SAT is increasing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 21–24\\]</u>. Thus, it seems that neck pain, which was a symptom previously regarded as the key diagnostic criterion, is not always present. However, in our search, only one case of painless SAT was reported as a “case report” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Our patient had a complaint of neck pain. In fact, 3 groups of patients may develop painless COVID-19-induced SAT. The first group includes the patients with COVID-19 who are taking NSAIDs or analgesics due to their COVID-19-related symptoms. Therefore, they may not feel any neck pain due to the analgesic effects of these medications. The second group includes the ICU-admitted patients with COVID-19-induced SAT who cannot feel or express pain due to their condition or strong medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Finally, the third group includes patients with true, painless COVID-19-induced SAT.\n\n【16】Since asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is highly prevalent, it is recommended to order PCR tests for all patients presenting with SAT symptoms. This painless course may be related to reduced lymphocytic-plasmacytic infiltration in the thyroid gland due to lymphopenia present in COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. In general, few patients with SAT develop the signs and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. However, a sudden onset of tachycardia, the deterioration of previous tachycardia, and the onset of arrhythmias are the typical symptoms of COVID-19-induced SAT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 19\\]</u>. Thyroid function tests in SAT patients with severe COVID-19 have shown thyrotoxicosis with elevated FT4 and reduced TSH and FT3, which corresponds to the simultaneous presence of SAT and nonthyroidal illness syndrome during the course of severe systemic disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The development of thyroid diseases in the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been associated with various mechanisms of thyroid damage, including excessive immune response, the immunodeficiency associated with infection, or direct cellular damage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 27\\]</u>. SARS-CoV-2 exhibits significant tissue tropism, including high affinity to the thyroid tissue. The key factor in SARS-CoV-2 infection is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, which enables viral entry. Thyroid cells are rich in ACE-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 23, 24, 28, 29\\]</u>. According to Rotondi et al. the mRNA encoding the ACE-2 receptor is highly expressed in thyroid follicular cells, making them a potential target for SARS-CoV-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. The highest incidence of SAT has been reported in middle-aged women, and the females account for 75–80% of all SAT cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26, 31\\]</u>. However, the symptoms suggestive of SAT are present in 10% and 20% of ICU-admitted patients with COVID-19 and those hospitalized in non-ICU wards due to this disease, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 23\\]</u>. Moreover, some pediatric cases of SAT have been reported recently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32, 33\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Stasiak et al. showed that the susceptibility to SAT and the chance of recurrent SAT could be related to HLA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34, 35\\]</u>. They performed a study on Caucasian population, reporting that the risk of recurrence was significantly higher in patients with both HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01 and HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>35 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Also, they demonstrated that even the ultrasound characteristics of SAT thyroid lesions were related to HLA, with HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01 being the determining factor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. According to their findings, multiple hypoechoic blurred lesions typically observed in SAT were rarely found in patients positive for HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01. These patients had different ultrasound patterns, which were mostly observed in patients with only HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01, without any haplotype correlated with SAT. Most of these patients had a unilateral and single lesion that was homogenously hypoechoic and had filled the whole affected lobe, mimicking a large thyroid nodule. However, in patients with both HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>18 : 01 and HLA-B<sup>∗</sup>35, the main difference from the typical pattern was related to the shape of SAT lesions, which were patchy or round, imitating actual thyroid nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. It is worth mentioning that we did not perform any HLA testing for our patient.\n\n【19】Regardless of proper diagnosis and treatment, the chance of SAT recurrence is relatively high and varies between studies from a few to over 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34, 36\\]</u>. These controversies are probably due to different study populations (Caucasian vs. Asian). Recurrences of SAT can occur either soon after the treatment completion or after a significant time interval, sometimes many years from the first episode 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Until recently, the cause of SAT recurrences was unknown. The only findings were that excessively fast tapering of corticosteroids was one of the causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. As a matter of fact, the differential diagnosis of SAT is challenging and necessitates ruling out the false negative and false positive SAT cases due to disease mismanagement or any serious undiagnosed conditions, such as covert malignancies. Since hospitalized patients usually receive corticosteroids as the COVID-19 treatment protocol, treating any undiagnosed SAT in these patients does not often result in serious problems. However, the misdiagnosis of hyperthyroidism in the outpatients with symptoms suggestive of painless SAT might be challenging, and any misuse of antithyroid drugs should be avoided. The other important issue is that SAT can be the only sign of COVID-19. So, patients with SAT should be tested for COVID-19 to prevent disease spread.\n\n【20】According to other studies, 24 cases of concomitant or post-COVID-19 subacute thyroiditis were reported until March 26, 2021. If we consider the present study, 18 of these patients were female, while 7 were male. Subacute thyroiditis is a disease which is more common in women than men, but our case was male. The age range of the male patients was 34–58 years, while it was 18–69 years for women. Our patient’s age was in the age range of the mentioned patients.\n\n【21】The duration between COVID-19 infection and the onset of subacute thyroiditis was 1–6 weeks, including one week for 1 case, two weeks for 4 cases (include our case), three weeks for 1 case, four weeks for 13 cases, five weeks for 1 case, and six weeks for 2 cases. Concomitant onset was observed in 4 patients. Our patient’s previous infection with COVID-19 was confirmed by PCR, but in 10 cases, there was no mention of the previous PCR test for COVID-19 confirmation, and just the clinical findings and high-risk occupation and communications of patients were considered. Of these 10, 8 cases had serological tests indicated past infection with COVID-19. Thyroid function tests (TFT) showed thyrotoxicosis in all patients, including our patient, except for one case in which TFT was not available. In terms of ultrasound findings, they supported subacute thyroiditis in all patients (including presented case) except for 2 cases that ultrasound was not available. All patients treated with NSAIDs or corticosteroids or both responded well to the treatment .\n\n【22】#### Data Availability\n\n【23】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【24】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【25】This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hamadan University of Medical Sciences (ID: IR.UMSHA.REC.1400.008).\n\n【26】#### Consent\n\n【27】The patient has given his permission for the publication of this report and the accompanying images.\n\n【28】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【29】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This study was supported by the Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is almost always acquired, with rare cases of congenital TTP (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome). Acquired cases are divided into acute idiopathic TTP and secondary TTP, which has been seen in association with collagen vascular disease, bone marrow transplantation, malignancy, pregnancy, infections, and drugs such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, ticlopidine, and antineoplastic agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, adult onset Still’s disease, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, dermatomyositis, and rheumatoid arthritis in association with TTP have been described so far in many patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–12\\]</u>. In contrast, mixed connected tissue disease (MCTD) in association with TTP is extremely rare and has only been described in nine patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–21\\]</u>. Here, we describe the 10th case of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) complicated by TTP and discuss the complexity of its management in a developing country.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 42-year-old Afro-Brazilian woman was admitted to emergency department with gradual neurologic disorientation, associated with severe headache and episodes of vomiting for three days. The patient had a past history of mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) for 4 years. Her clinical presentation included Raynaud’s phenomenon associated with puffy fingers, arthralgias, mild arthritis (nonerosive and nondeforming), and myalgia. She also had a pericardial effusion 3 years ago that seems to be related to MCTD. Laboratory studies revealed that the patient had an ESR of 70 mm/hr, positive rheumatoid factor (titre >128), positive ANA (1 : 1280) with speckled pattern, and positive anti-U1-RNP (>240 U/mL). Anti-DNA, Anti-SM, Anti-CCP, Anti-Jo1, Anti-SS-A, Anti-SS-B, Anti-SCL-70, Anticentromere, ANCA, and Anticardiolipin were negative. She reported having used only prednisone for the treatment of MCTD, currently using 10mg/kg/day. She also had hypertension on regular treatment for the last 10 years.\n\n【6】On admission she was awake, dehydrated (+/4+), pale (2+/4+), confused, and disorientated with a Glasgow coma scale of 13 points and without focal neurologic deficit. The blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg, pulse 108 per min. and temperature 37.2°C. Clinical examinations of the cardiovascular, respiratory systems, and abdomen were normal. There was edema in the lower limbs (2+/4+). Complete blood cell count showed a normocytic normochromic anemia and thrombocytopenia . Peripheral blood smear demonstrated anisocytosis, poikilocytosis with schistocytes, and thrombocytopenia . Biochemical analysis revealed elevated levels of serum LDH (1,830 U/L) and bilirubin (total 4.1 mg/dL, direct 2.1 mg/dL and indirect 2.0 mg/dL). Direct Coombs test was negative, and PT and aPTT were normal. Her urine exam was positive to protein (3+), leukocyte (2+), hemoglobin, (4+), bilirubin (1+), and urobilinogen (2+) with negative nitrite. Other laboratory data are summarized in Table 1.\n\n【7】Table 1 \n\n【8】Laboratory data.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Blood Smear with anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, polychromatophilia (polychromasia) with schistocytes, and thrombocytopenia (1000x). |\n| --- |\n\n【11】Clinical identification of nonimmune haemolytic anemia with presence of red cell fragmentation, thrombocytopenia, and altered level of consciousness led to the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura secondary to autoimmune disease, since the patient was previously diagnosed as MCTD. Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (80 mg/day) scheme was initiated after administration of antiparasitic therapy (prophylaxis of strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>), fresh frozen plasma (15 mL/kg/day), and red blood cells transfusion with blood pressure monitoring and use of diuretics to prevent fluid overload.\n\n【12】She evolved in 24 hours with high fever (39.2°C); blood pressure was 160/80 mmHg, and subsequently, with decreased level of consciousness, she underwent endotracheal intubation and was transferred to the Intensive care unit (ICU). The infusion of fresh frozen plasma was progressively increased to 25–30 mL/kg/day. During hospitalization, she presented with pneumonia and received ceftriaxone and clindamycin. Abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no specific abnormalities.\n\n【13】After 5 days in the ICU, she showed good clinical outcome, with improvement of neurologic and respiratory parameters, allowing weaning and withdraw of mechanical ventilation. Throughout the period her blood pressure was kept under strict control with captopril, amlodipine, atenolol, methyldopa, and losartan, as well as periods of sodium nitroprusside.\n\n【14】After 20 days of hospitalization, the patient presented progressive improvement in microangiopathic anemia, increased haemoglobin, and platelets, and a progressive decrease of LDH and reticulocytes . She was not submitted to plasmapheresis. There was normalization of blood pressure with concomitant gradual reduction in the volume of fresh frozen plasma infused and reduction of prednisone. She was discharged from the hospital with antihypertensive drugs (clonidine and amlodipine) and prednisone (20 mg/day). After 40 days of symptom onset and 20 days after discharge the patient was asymptomatic and laboratory tests improved .\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Following the discovery that TTP is associated with a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>, it was suggested that ADAMTS13 deficiency may become the definition and diagnostic criterion for TTP. But many patients who fulfill the clinical diagnostic criteria for TTP do not have ADAMTS13 deficiency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 25\\]</u>. For some authors, measurements of ADAMTS13 activity are not required and do not conclusively confirm the diagnosis of TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. In this way, the diagnosis of TTP is based on the presenting clinical features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Prompt diagnosis of TTP is critical to begin treatment and reduce patient’s mortality.\n\n【17】Patients diagnosed with TTP may have additional disorders including autoimmune diseases. In this group systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common, followed by antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, adult onset Still’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis and dermatomyositis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–12\\]</u>.\n\n【18】TTP associated with mixed connected tissue disease is rare and has only been described in nine patients  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–21\\]</u>. Most of these cases were women (8 : 1) with the median age of 40 years. The mortality was high (45%), early, (within 2–45 days) and associated with serious neurological impairment (seizure and coma). Our case presented a good clinical evolution in spite of serious neurological manifestations which points to a worse prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 19\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Table 2 \n\n【20】Characteristics of TTP in patients with MCTD.\n\n【21】The pathogenic processes of thrombotic microangiopathy in patients with connective tissue diseases are heterogeneous. ADAMTS13 activity is significantly decreased in this group of patients. However, only a minor population presents neutralising autoantibodies against ADAMTS13, which was associated with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, lower platelet counts, and better therapeutic outcomes. A major population has normal or moderately reduced ADAMTS13 activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this group, the mechanisms of development of TTP remain unclear. There is a higher prevalence of anti-endothelial cell antibodies in the sera of MCTD patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u> and depressed plasma fibrinolytic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>, suggesting that a MCTD related vasculitis and thrombotic microangiopathy may have been involved in the pathogenesis of TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 17\\]</u>. In patients with systemic sclerosis, renal crisis remains one of the potential processes related to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, accelerated hypertension and acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29, 30\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Previous reported cases were treated with various therapies including steroids, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), plasma exchange (PE), prostacyclin, vincristine, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab and aspirin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–21\\]</u>. Today, the mainstay of treatment of acute TTP is plasma exchange 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Before the plasma treatment era, survival of patients with TTP was only 10%. Then, almost 20 years ago, plasma exchange was reported to increase survival to 78%, compared to 51% survival for patients treated with plasma infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Nowadays, however, there are some places that plasma exchange still unavailable. In these cases, high volume of plasma infusion (30 mL/kg/d) may be indicated if there is to be an unavoidable delay in plasma exchange 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 32, 33\\]</u>. Adjuvant corticosteroid treatment is also used with the intention to suppress the activity of auto-antibodies against ADAMTS13 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 26\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The clinical team’s intention was to transfer the patient to start plasmapheresis, but by the critical condition, it was not possible immediately. So, we started FFP infusion and immunosuppression with prednisone 1 mg/kg/day and the patient gradually improved. The high volume of fresh frozen plasma could only be provided because of patient’s good cardiac and renal function associated with a strict blood pressure control.\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【25】Although the occurrence of TTP is rare in MCTD patients, it is important to recognize TTP as a cause of thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia in any patient with autoimmune diseases. Prompt institution of treatment remains the cornerstone of treatment of TTP even if plasma exchange is not available like what frequently happens in developing countries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is an uncommon situation that may lead to several neurological complications. We report varicella zoster virus (VZV) meningitis in a 14-year-old healthy boy with no antecedent of rash. On his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, VZV DNA was detected. The rapid HIV test was negative. The treatment using acyclovir (20 mg/kg/8h) was effective, and the child’s clinical condition rapidly improved.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella zoster virus. It causes severe complications in adults and adolescents. Immunodeficient people are particularly at a higher risk of developing primary multisystemic infection with pulmonary, neurological, and/or hepatic complications. Reinfection is probably more common than previously thought, but its management is similar to primary infection. Reactivation, commonly known as shingles, may also manifest in the form of meningitis, vasculopathy, and disseminated shingles in immunodeficient patients.\n\n【4】We report a case of a healthy child with viral meningitis due to VZV reactivation. The rare isolation of VZV in CSF in immunocompetent children and the absence of skin rash make this case interesting.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 14-year-old healthy boy presented with a headache, vomiting, and a fever for over 5 days. He also had neck stiffness. He had no past history of skin rash and was neither recently vaccinated nor in contact with infected individuals. He had chickenpox at 18 months and had completed all his vaccines according to the Moroccan national vaccination program.\n\n【7】On physical examination, the patient was febrile at 38.1°C; he had nuchal rigidity, without any abnormal neurological signs or skin rash. The vital signs were as follows: pulse rate was 64 beats/minute, respiratory rate was 20 beats/minute, and SpO<sub>2</sub> was 99% on room air. Laboratory tests revealed normal white blood cells and platelet count (WBC: 9830/mm and PLT: 277.000/mm) and normal C-reactive protein (0.3 mg/L).\n\n【8】Due to the presence of the meningeal syndrome, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was drawn and analyzed. It contained 60/mm<sup>3</sup> of WBCs and 80% mononuclear; CSF protein was 27 mg/dl, and CSF glucose was 77 mg/dl (serum glucose: 115 mg/dl). He was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone awaiting bacterial culture.\n\n【9】On the second day of evolution, the child still had the headache. Results of bacterial culture came out negative, and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the CSF for bacterial and viral identification revealed varicella zoster virus (VZV). The intravenous ceftriaxone was stopped, and acyclovir was started at a dose of 20 mg/kg every 8 hours for a duration of 10 days.\n\n【10】On the 3rd day of treatment with acyclovir, the patient became apyretic and asymptomatic. A rapid HIV test was requested in view of the PCR results; it also came out negative.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】The varicella zoster virus (VZV) belongs to the family of Herpesviridae, a double-stranded DNA virus enclosed in a cubic symmetry nucleocapsid surrounded by a seed coat and an envelope. Being a fragile virus, it is quickly degraded by heat and loses its infectious power after a freeze-thaw cycle. It is fundamentally dermotropic; the virus has neurotropism like the herpes simplex virus (HSV), and it can also remain latent in sensory ganglia. The reactivation of the virus leads to clinical manifestations of shingles and sometimes to a disseminated disease in immunocompromised children.\n\n【13】Children who are in contact with varicella in the first year of life may have zoster during childhood, but there are no publications to support this and further demonstrate that these children are at a higher risk for VZV associated with central nervous system (CNS) manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The CNS manifestations, especially in meningitis caused by VZV, might be as a result of both primary and reactivated disease or might be the cause of vaccine strain reactivation in immunocompetent children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【15】Meningitis in varicella zoster is rare. A report by Galil et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> showed that, in a series of 859 adults, only 0.5% presented with herpes zoster infection. Pahud et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported meningitis at 50% in a series of 26 patients presenting with VZV PCR-positive in cerebrospinal fluid in patients aged between 12 and 85 years (median, 46 years).\n\n【16】Other cases report that meningitis in children is usually associated with skin rash due to the past history of varicella primary infection or due to the reactivation of the VZV 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5–7\\]</u>. Sometimes, the CNS manifestation may appear before the skin rash in varicella and in herpes zoster 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Aseptic meningitis due to VZV is usually associated with varicella in immunocompromised children. The absence of rash is uncommon in immunocompetent children according to a report from a hospital in southern Iran in which 2 cases out of 30 were positive for PCR of CSF: VZV was isolated from these samples which were collected from children aged between 2 months and 15 years presenting with aseptic meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In adults, only one case was reported in a woman presenting with aseptic meningitis with hypoglycorrhachia without skin rash 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The uniqueness of our case lies in the fact that this incident of aseptic meningitis which affected an immunocompetent child was due to VZV reactivation, but the child did not present any skin lesions. In pediatrics, it is rare that the PCR in cerebrospinal fluid can isolate VZV in case of unexplained aseptic meningitis.\n\n【19】We conclude that aseptic meningitis is one of the rare complications of VZV reactivation without skin rash and PCR is the first go to diagnostic test to identify the etiology of the viral meningitis. In case of meningitis due to VZV, eventual treatment with acyclovir intravenously for 7 to 10 days has been recommended for immunocompetent children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【20】#### Data Availability\n\n【21】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【22】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【23】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n【24】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【25】All authors’ contributed to this work and agreed to the final version of this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The exact mechanism of GH remains unknown, but fluctuations in blood glucose and insulin levels play important roles in promoting glycogen accumulation. We report a case of a 16-year-old female diagnosed with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus with hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes. The patient experienced multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis, and she also had celiac disease diagnosed 2 years previously based on serology and a duodenal biopsy. The laboratory analyses results were compatible with acute hepatitis, and the celiac serology was positive. Other investigations ruled out viral hepatitis and autoimmune and metabolic liver diseases. Ultrasound and computerized tomography (CT) scans of the abdomen revealed liver enlargement with diffuse fatty infiltration. A liver biopsy revealed the presence of abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. PAS staining was strongly positive, which confirmed the diagnosis of GH. There were no features of autoimmune hepatitis or significant fibrosis. Duodenal biopsy results were consistent with celiac disease. Despite our efforts, which are supported by a multidisciplinary team approach that included a hepatologist, a diabetic educator, a dietitian, and an endocrinologist, we have encountered difficulties in controlling the patient’s diabetes, and she persistently maintains symptomatic hepatomegaly and abnormal liver biochemistry. Given the patient’s age, we assumed that these abnormalities were related to patient noncompliance. In conclusion, GH remains an under-recognized complication of type 1 DM that is potentially reversible with adequate glycemic control. The awareness of GH should prevent diagnostic delay and its implications for management and the outcome.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Glycogen hepatopathy is characterized by glycogen deposition in hepatocytes due to both glycogen synthesis and the inhibition of glycogenolysis. This condition has been described in type 1 diabetes mellitus and occurs as a result of an imbalance in the production and degradation of glycogen following insulin introduction. This imbalance leads to the abnormal accumulation of glycogen in hepatocytes and results in hepatomegaly and the leakage of transaminases out of liver cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Although the mechanism of the development of GH is still unrecognized, it is clear that fluctuations in blood glucose and insulin levels play an important role in promoting glycogen accumulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We report a case of a 16-year-old female diagnosed with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on insulin therapy. She was referred to an adult hepatology outpatient clinic due to hepatomegaly and elevated liver enzymes that were discovered incidentally during a routine workup a year previously.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 16-year-old female was referred to an adult hepatology outpatient clinic due to elevated liver enzymes that were discovered incidentally during a routine workup one year previously. She had T1DM diagnosed 4 years previously and was receiving insulin therapy with an average requirement of 1.2 units/kg/day. However, her diabetes was poorly controlled (hemoglobin A<sub>1C</sub> 11.5%), and she had multiple admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\n【7】She was frequently nauseated and frequently complained of abdominal distension associated with mild to moderate colicky intermittent epigastric pain. There was no history of liver disease, blood transfusion, herbal ingestion, or cholelithiasis. She was not an alcohol or drug consumer and was not taking any medication other than insulin. Additionally, she did not exhibit any symptom or signs compatible with acute or chronic hepatitis. The patient had celiac disease diagnosed 2 years previously based on serology and a duodenal biopsy. She was on a strict gluten-free diet. Her elder brother had T1DM, and her younger brother had eczema. There was no family history of liver diseases or other autoimmune disorders. Her menarche occurred at 12 years of age, and her periods were irregular.\n\n【8】Physical examination revealed a body mass index of 22.7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. She had a nontender distended and tense abdomen with hepatomegaly. She had no ascites or stigmata of chronic liver disease. Her pubertal development was normal. The physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.\n\n【9】During her clinical follow-ups, she had several severe flares of serum transaminases that returned to normal within days without any specific treatment. Her laboratory analyses were compatible with acute hepatitis  with concomitant increases in gamma-glutamyl transferase (164 U/L, normal <55) and alkaline phosphatase (286 U/L, normal <180). Her liver function panels were all normal and included albumin (39 g/L), INR (0.81), and total bilirubin (4 µmol/L). Her lipid profile was abnormal with elevated triglycerides (5.26 mmol/L) and a cholesterol level of 7.2 mmol/L.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【11】Liver enzymes pattern.\n\n【12】A complete blood cell count, renal profile, and ferritin level were normal.

A complete workup for autoimmune and metabolic liver disease was unremarkable and included tests for serum ceruloplasmin, copper, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha-fetoprotein, and immunoglobulins. Additionally, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-nuclear smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), and liver-kidney microsomal antibody (LKM1) were all negative. The celiac serology was positive. Her thyroid function, FSH, LSH, and prolactin levels were normal. Her vitamin D level was low (58.29 nmol/l normal >145), and her vitamin B12 and folate levels were normal.\n\n【13】The ultrasound and CT scans of the abdomen revealed liver enlargement (23 cm span) with a bright, coarse echotexture. She exhibited no splenomegaly or ascites. A liver biopsy revealed the presence of abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes. The PAS staining was strongly positive. Perls staining revealed no iron deposition. There were no features of autoimmune hepatitis or significant fibrosis . A duodenal biopsy revealed total villous atrophy with an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes and crypt hyperplasia consistent with celiac disease.\n\n【14】(a)\n\n【15】(b)\n\n【16】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【18】(a) Liver biopsy showing presence of abundant glycogen in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and (b) a strongly positive PAS stain.\n\n【19】Despite our efforts, which were supported by a multidisciplinary team approach that included a hepatologist, diabetic educator, dietitian, and endocrinologist, we have encountered difficulties in controlling the patient’s diabetes, and she is persistently symptomatic with hepatomegaly and abnormal liver biochemistry. Given the patient’s age, we initially assumed that these abnormalities were related to patient noncompliance.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】From a historical point of view, in 1930, Pierre Mauriac described Mauriac Syndrome (MS) as a rare complication of poorly controlled type I DM in children. MS is characterized by overloading of the hepatocytes with glycogen, hepatomegaly, and abnormal liver enzymes. MS is associated with growth failure, delayed puberty, and cushingoid features. These complications were first described shortly after the introduction of insulin in 1922 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Hepatic glycogen deposition was described as a feature of MS, but more recently it has been described in the absence of other MS features. Even more recently, this condition has been known as glycogenic hepatopathy (GH) and has been described in children, adolescents, and young adult with poorly controlled type I DM. MS has recently been reported in patients with type II DM who are receiving insulin therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The disease results from glycogen synthesis and the inhibition of glycogenolysis. In the state of hyperglycemia, glucose enters hepatocytes independent of insulin and is subsequently converted into glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) by glucokinase. This high level of G-6-P can allosterically stimulate glycogen synthesis via the activation of glycogen synthase. When insulin is administered, it has a covalent modification effect on both glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis that involves the promotion of the dephosphorylation of both the glycogen phosphatase and glycogen synthase enzymes. This effect leads to an imbalance in the production and degradation of glycogen, and the hepatocytes subsequently abnormally accumulate glycogen. Swelling of the hepatocytes leads to the leakage of liver transaminases and hepatomegaly. This condition can occur as early as two to four weeks after the initiation of insulin therapy or as a late complication of poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. However, not all diabetic patients who exhibit poor glycemic control develop GH. It has been suggested that a regulatory protein is responsible for the marked glycogen accumulation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>; however, recent studies have failed to demonstrate such an effect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6–8\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Although the mechanism of the development of GH is still unrecognized, it is clear that fluctuations in blood glucose and insulin levels play an important role in the promotion of glycogen accumulation. This process can be controlled by either stabilizing the persistent hyperglycemia with infrequent large doses of insulin, such as those given during ketoacidosis, or alternately by the administration of glucose to patients who are receiving excessive insulin to treat the hypoglycemic episodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Several studies have demonstrated that intensive glycemic control or the normalization of glucose metabolism in post-pancreatic transplantation leads to the normalization of liver enzymes and resolves hepatomegaly.

Graves’ disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. Common manifestations of Graves’ disease include weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, fatigue, tremors, and exophthalmos, occurring in more than 50% of patients. In rare cases, findings may predominate in one organ system; isolated findings of diarrhea, anxiety, or gynecomastia (as in our case) may occur, distracting from the correct diagnosis. Case Report. We report on a 37-year-old male who presented to the primary care clinic with the chief complaint of a tender right-sided breast mass and with an associated loss of appetite and forty-pound weight loss. Laboratory evaluation revealed suppressed TSH and elevated free T4. A bilateral diagnostic mammogram revealed bilateral gynecomastia. A nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan was subsequently ordered, which showed the diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with homogenous increased uptake throughout, consistent with Graves’ disease. Conclusion. It is important to keep a high index of suspicion for thyroid disease as hyperthyroid states may be deceiving in presenting with single organ system involvement. Although it is rare, gynecomastia is a known finding in Graves’ disease and can be the presenting sign. Patients with unexplained gynecomastia or breast masses should be screened for thyrotoxicosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Graves’ disease is an autoimmune thyroid disorder that is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The disease is characterized by a hyperthyroid state secondary to autoantibodies that bind to and activate thyrotropin receptors, leading to an increase in thyroid hormone production 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Patients of any age can be affected, however, the peak incidence is reported between the ages of 30 and 50 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Common manifestations of Graves’ disease include weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, fatigue, tremors, and exophthalmos, occurring in more than 50% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Rare manifestations such as localized dermatopathy and thyroid acropachy (i.e. clubbing) have been reported in less than 1% of cases. Men may present with decreased libido or erectile dysfunction, and women may present with irregular menses 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In rare cases, findings may predominate in one organ system; isolated findings of diarrhea, anxiety, or gynecomastia (as in our case) may occur, distracting from the correct diagnosis. Gynecomastia is a common finding in hyperthyroidism, but it is rarely the presenting symptom 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We present a case of Graves’ disease with a less common presentation of a unilateral breast mass.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 37-year-old Caucasian male presented to the primary care clinic with the chief complaint of a tender right-sided breast mass. The patient also reported decreased appetite and a forty-pound weight loss over the preceding five months. The breast mass had been present for about six weeks and was not associated with galactorrhea. The patient denied any fevers or night sweats and denied taking any hormonal or nutritional supplements. There was no reported family history of breast cancer or endocrine disorder. During a physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits, and the patient was noted to be thin, with a BMI of 21.6. Breast examination revealed a one-centimeter-by-one-centimeter, tender, right-sided mass without nipple discharge. The thyroid gland was nonpalpable, and there was no evidence of lymphadenopathy.\n\n【6】Laboratory evaluation revealed TSH of 0.01 mIU/L (reference range 0.40–4.5 mIU/L) with free T4 3.3 ng/dL (reference 0.93–1.7 ng/dL) and total T3 335 ng/dL (reference 80–200 ng/dL). The thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level was noted to be >500 (normal <122%). Prolactin was found to be 7.2 ng/mL (reference range 4.0–15.2 ng/mL), and testosterone was noted to be 624 ng/dL (reference range 800–1080 ng/dL). A bilateral diagnostic mammogram revealed bilateral gynecomastia, right greater than left . A nuclear medicine thyroid uptake scan was subsequently ordered, which showed the diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with homogenous increased uptake throughout, consistent with Graves’ disease.\n\n【7】(a)\n\n【8】(b)\n\n【9】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【11】Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the (a) right breast and (b) left breast showing flame-shaped subareolar densities consistent with gynecomastia.\n\n【12】On initial presentation, there was a high index of suspicion for breast cancer due to presenting symptoms of the right-sided breast mass associated with significant weight loss. The bilateral diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound were ordered for further workup of possible malignancy. Hyperthyroidism was also considered due to weight loss and palpitations; however, it was initially lower on differential diagnoses.\n\n【13】The patient was started on atenolol 25 mg daily upon laboratory diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. After confirmation of Graves’ disease on the thyroid uptake scan, the patient was referred to endocrinology. He was subsequently prescribed methimazole 10 mg twice daily.\n\n【14】After two months of treatment with twice daily methimazole, repeat bloodwork showed TSH 0.45 mIU/L (within normal limits), free T4 0.39 ng/dL (normal 0.93–1.7 ng/dL), and total T3 58 (normal 80–200). On repeat evaluation, the breast mass was no longer palpable, and the patient reported significantly improved energy levels and decreased palpitations. The weight of the patient, however, was unchanged. Over the last five years, multiple attempts at tapering off methimazole have been unsuccessful. He has been maintained on 5 mg methimazole daily with stable thyroid function labs. He has declined definitive therapy with radioactive iodine ablation.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Gynecomastia is defined as an enlargement in glandular tissue of the breast, which may present as unilateral or bilateral breast enlargement. This condition is commonly seen in patients with chronic liver disease and as a result of certain drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although it is rare, gynecomastia has been described as a common finding in hyperthyroid states, specifically in Graves’ disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. As a cutaneous feature of thyrotoxicosis, gynecomastia can be seen in 10–40% of cases; however, it is rarely seen as the presenting feature of the disease. It has been reported as a presenting feature of hyperthyroidism in less than ten cases to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【17】The development of gynecomastia involves an imbalance between free estrogen and free androgen actions in breast tissue. Breast tissue enlargement occurs when there is a relative increase in estrogen production. In hyperthyroid states, the increase in concentration of sex hormone-binding globulin binds testosterone more avidly than estrogen, leading to an increase in the concentration of bioavailable estrogen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Treatment of hyperthyroidism with control of thyrotoxicosis results in resolution of gynecomastia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Our patient presented with the chief complaint of a unilateral breast mass associated with forty-pound weight loss. This presentation was initially concerning to the patient and physician for breast cancer due to the predominant involvement of only one organ system. On further investigation with diagnostic mammogram, the patient was found to have bilateral gynecomastia. Laboratory work and thyroid uptake scan confirmed diagnosis of Graves’ disease.\n\n【19】It is important to keep a high index of suspicion for thyroid disease as hyperthyroid states may be deceiving in presenting with single organ system involvement. Although it is rare, gynecomastia is a known finding in Graves’ disease and can be the presenting sign.

This tumor has a grave prognosis. We report to the best of our knowledge the first case of infantile scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumor in a 6-month-old male baby who presented with a right parietal scalp mass since the age of 1 month. This mass was initially diagnosed as scalp hemangioma based on clinical and imaging findings. However, this mass was growing fast which necessitated excision. Pathologic examination after excision showed a malignant tumor composed of sheets of rhabdoid cells. Immunohistochemically, this tumor tested positive for vimentin, CD 99, glypican-3, synaptopysin, WT-1, CK, and EMA. INI-1 immunostain was lost in the tumor cells. Subsequently, this tumor was pathologically diagnosed as extracranial scalp rhabdoid tumor. After tumor excision, the patient was referred to pediatric oncology to receive chemotherapy. Experience with scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumors is limited. However, this tumor in other organs carries a grave prognosis. Although scalp extracranial rhabdoid tumor is an extremely rare tumor, it should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of infantile scalp masses given the need of combined surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Masses in the head have a broad differential diagnosis and are usually divided into congenital versus acquired. Usually, CT and MRI are used in the evaluation of these masses initially.

The patient was referred to pediatric oncology for staging and treatment.\n\n【41】This patient was treated according to the European rhabdoid protocol. However, the patient received just intensive chemotherapy as there was no role for radiotherapy or for autologous bone marrow transplant because of the age of the patient. The intensive chemotherapy given was composed of multiple chemotherapy regimens including the following chemotherapeutic agents: doxorubicin, ifosfamide, carboplatinum, etopside, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and actinomycin-D.\n\n【42】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【43】Rhabdoid tumors can involve the CNS primarily and are termed atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT). However, rhabdoid tumors can be extracranial either involving the kidney primarily or involving the soft tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【44】Malignant extracranial rhabdoid tumor diagnosis depends on morphologic pathologic features which are nonspecific for this tumor, since the differential diagnosis also includes other tumors such as Ewing’s sarcoma, Wilms’ tumor, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, clear cell sarcoma, congenital mesoblastic nephroma, synovial sarcoma, undifferentiated sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and epithelioid sarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Histologically, soft tissue rhabdoid tumors (STRT) show noncohesive single cells, clusters, or sheets of large tumor cells with abundant glassy eosinophilic cytoplasm, an eccentric vesicular nucleus, and an extremely large nucleolus with immunohistochemistry showing positivity for vimentin and/or cytokeratin, and the diagnosis is confirmed with loss of INI-1 stain on immunohistochemical staining 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>.\n\n【45】Malignant Extracranial rhabdoid tumor has been reported in multiple soft tissue organs such as neck, back, retroperitoneum, pelvis, and chest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. We present to the best of our knowledge the first infantile extracranial rhabdoid tumor arising in the scalp although there has been a prior case report of congenital malignant rhabdoid tumor of the scalp by Cobb et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. After surgical excision and pathologic diagnosis, the patient was referred to pediatric oncology for treatment. Given the rarity of malignant extracranial rhabdoid tumor, standardized treatment protocols have not yet been popularized worldwide. Generally, treatment protocols are based on a multimodal approach, combining surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Despite many attempts to improve these various regimens, malignant extracranial rhabdoid tumor is still described as lethal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 8\\]</u>. At our institution, we used the European rhabdoid protocol for treatment, and this particular patient received just intensive chemotherapy given the young patient’s age as there was no role for radiotherapy or autologous bone marrow transplant.\n\n【46】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【47】Extracranial rhabdoid tumor is a rare tumor with grave prognosis, and diagnosis is based on histological and immunohistochemistry findings specifically a negative INI-1 immunohistochemical stain. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first infantile extracranial rhabdoid tumor of the scalp even though there has been a prior report of a congenital extracranial rhabdoid tumor of the scalp.\n\n【48】#### Data Availability\n\n【49】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【50】#### Consent\n\n【51】Parent’s permission was obtained to publish this case report.\n\n【52】#### Disclosure\n\n【53】This research article was performed as part of employment by the Royal Jordanian Medical Services.\n\n【54】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【55】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Recently, as biological agents are becoming widely used for autoimmune disorders, there have been a growing number of reports of the development of autoimmune processes related to these agents. A 52-year-old Japanese woman with psoriasis developed liver damage two months after initiation of anti-TNF-α therapy with adalimumab. Liver histological findings were compatible with AIH, and positive conversions of ANAs were detected. The patient was treated with prednisolone and had a good response. While some cases of AIH triggered by anti-TNF-α therapies have been reported, the pathogenesis remains unspecified. When elevation of liver enzymes is observed with high IgG levels and seropositivity of ANA during the course of anti-TNF-α therapy, liver biopsy findings may be essential and important to make definitive diagnosis of AIH.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Approximately 9% of the cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are triggered by drugs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Recently, as biological agents are becoming widely used for autoimmune disorders, there have been a growing number of reports of the development of autoimmune processes related to biological agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. According to the registry data of the BIOGEAS project (a Spanish registry devoted to collecting data on the use of biological agents in adults with systemic autoimmune diseases), up to 2009, more than 800 cases developed autoimmune diseases associated with biological agents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. While drug-induced lupus, vasculitis, optical neuritis, interstitial lung disease, and inflammatory ocular disease accounted for more than 50% of new-onset autoimmune disorders, AIH also accounted for 2.0% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 52-year-old Japanese woman with a 12-year history of psoriasis started anti-TNF-α therapy with adalimumab for exacerbation of skin lesions. The patient was not a habitual drinker and had no concomitant medications at the onset of the therapy. Hepatobiliary enzymes prior to therapy were within normal limits: asparate aminotransferase (AST) 20 U/L (normal value 8–38), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 24 U/L (normal 4–44), and γ\\-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 43 U/L (normal 16–70). Hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody were negative. Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) measured using ELISA were also negative, 9.7 index (cutoff < 20).\n\n【6】Two months later, after six doses of adalimumab, she developed malaise with liver damage that continued after the discontinuation of adalimumab. A blood test three months after discontinuation showed the following: AST 240 U/L, ALT 224 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 723 U/L (normal 104–338) and GGT 228 U/L. Whilst serological tests for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus were all negative, her serum immunoglobulin G levels were elevated (1969 mg/dL; normal 870–1700) and homogeneous and speckled-type ANAs were both present at titers of 1 : 160. Anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody, and anti-DNA antibody were negative. A percutaneous liver biopsy four months after discontinuation of adalimumab showed marked portal lymphoplasmacytic inflammation with periportal interface hepatitis and scattered lobular necroinflammatory changes . Accordingly, we diagnosed the patient as AIH and this was confirmed using simplified international diagnostic criteria (score 8 points; definite AIH ≥ 7) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The patient was treated with 30 mg of prednisolone per day (0.5 mg/kg/day: standard initial therapy regimen for AIH in Japan) for 2 weeks with the reduction of the dose by 5 mg every 2 weeks, and the maintenance dose was set at 5 mg per day. Two months later, her hepatobiliary enzymes returned to normal. While the patient is still under the maintenance therapy, the relapse of AIH has not been observed.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Liver biopsy.

Discussion\n\n【10】Some 20 cases of AIH triggered by anti-TNF-α therapy have been reported to date 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We have summarized the seven psoriatic cases with anti-TNF-α induced AIH, among which two patients were treated with adalimumab  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–8\\]</u>. The median time and the number of doses of anti-TNF-α drugs to the onset of liver damage were 2 months and 3 times, respectively. All cases discontinued anti-TNF-α therapy after the onset of liver damage and six were treated with corticosteroid, with or without azathioprine. All cases had good responses to the therapies and prognosis; the liver damage was resolved within approximately 3 months in five cases. The same tendency was also seen in the cases other than the psoriasis reported previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Table 1 \n\n【12】Reported cases of psoriasis with AIH triggered by anti-TNF-α therapy.\n\n【13】One report suggested that it is sometimes a challenge to distinguish drug-induced AIH from de novo AIH or drug-induced liver injury because the clinical, biochemical, serological, and histological patterns may be similar in all these groups 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Furthermore, patients treated with biological agents may have various forms of simultaneous autoimmune disease and ANAs before treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Certain data also suggested that 3% of AIH cases had psoriasis as a concurrent autoimmune disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【14】Our patient could be diagnosed with AIH by positive conversion of ANAs after anti-TNF-α therapy and liver histological findings. In particular, liver biopsy findings must have been important to make definitive diagnosis of AIH.\n\n【15】The pathogenesis of AIH triggered by anti-TNF-α therapy remains unspecified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. TNF-α itself is suspected of contributing to the development of AIH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, and an AIH case treated with anti-TNF-α inhibitor has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In a certain case, AIH did not relapse after switching to another anti-TNF-α drug 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Perhaps, like other drugs, reactive metabolites of the anti-TNF-α drugs, which can be recognized by the immune system as neoantigens, may be one of the causes of AIH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Occasionally, some patients may develop AIH after starting anti-TNF-α therapy for autoimmune disorders. Perhaps, most of them will develop AIH few months after initiation of the treatment and this will be resolved by intensive immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, routine liver function test may be recommended during the course of anti-TNF-α therapy. When elevation of liver enzymes are observed with high IgG levels and seropotivity of ANA, liver biopsy findings may be essential and important to make definitive diagnosis of AIH.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Discussion\n\n【18】Cornu cutaneum is a projectile, hyperkeratotic nodule in places of the body which are sensitive to sunlight and called cutaneous horns because of their similarity of their macroscopic shape 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Apart from sunlight, traumas are also included in their etiology as a case reported as cornu cutaneum on the feet of the patient 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Our patient had a lesion in nasal vestibule supporting the traumatic etiological factors. He felt itching as the mass grew and he scratched; therefore, repeated traumas were made by the patient himself.\n\n【19】Cornu cutaneum is generally a slow developing mass. Our patient had nasal obstruction symptoms for more than 3 months and the mass became visible from outside the nose within a month. Cornu cutaneum is generally a benign lesion but is reported to have relation with malignant or premalignant diseases. Histological researches show that basal membrane invasion supporting differential diagnosis should include a wide range from seborrheic keratosis to squamous cell carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Predisposing factors include benign (seborrheic keratosis, viral verrucae, and molluscum contagiosum), premalignant (solar keratosis, arsenic keratosis, and Bowen’s disease), and malignant (squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, metastatic renal cell carcinoma, granular cell tumours, sebaceous carcinomas, and Kaposi’s sarcoma) diseases. Differential diagnosis can only be made by careful histopathological investigation of the basal lamina 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Excisional biopsy can be made for diagnosis and treatment. We treated and diagnosed our patient with excisional biopsy. Isolated cornu cutaneum has dead keratin cells without any living tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Our pathological examination also showed papillomatous keratin lamellas without any alive cells.\n\n【21】As a result, as mostly seen in places which are sensitive to sunlight, cornu cutaneum from nasal vestibule is a rare disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u> which is a slow developing benign lesion characterized by necrotic tissues without any living cells microscopically.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【23】Apart from sunlight, traumas are included in etiology of cornu cutaneum. As mostly seen in places sensitive to sunlight, cornu cutaneum from nasal vestibule is uncommon suggesting the effect of traumas. Pathological examination also showed papillomatous keratin lamellas without any alive cells. There are a few reported cases of cornu cutaneum resulting from nasal vestibule. Our case is important as nasal vestibule is a rare place for cornu cutaneum to be seen.\n\n【24】#### Consent\n\n【25】The patient in this paper has given his informed consent for the case report to be published.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>All the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The diagnosis of extraintestinal salmonellosis requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and should be considered in patients with deep-seated abscesses especially if they are immunocompromised. We present a case of salmonella causing gastroenteritis complicated by an intramuscular abscess of the left leg. With prompt recognition and multidisciplinary management, the patient recovered with no serious sequela.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Salmonella infection can cause a wide range of presentations especially in immunocompromised hosts. In this case, we describe a 55-year-old Chinese Singaporean man, who presented with acute onset of nonbilious and nonbloody vomiting with diarrhoea and left leg pain. He was found to have gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Group C complicated by an intramuscular abscess of his left leg. We reviewed the literature in the context of this unusual presentation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 55-year-old Chinese Singaporean man with a background of Polycythemia Rubra Vera (PRV), currently on treatment with hydroxyurea and anagrelide, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, was admitted with a four-day history of nonbilious, nonbloody vomiting accompanied with nonbloody diarrhea. This was associated with fever and also left leg pain and swelling. He had no other infective symptoms including cough, sputum production, or dysuria.\n\n【6】Physical examination revealed pyrexia (temperature: 38.9 degrees Celsius), blood pressure of 140/60 mmHg, and pulse rate of 80/min. His left calf was erythematous, swollen, warm, and tender. His abdomen was soft and nontender with no bruits. No pitting oedema was present. Routine blood investigations showed normal inflammatory markers and biochemistry . Ultrasound of the left lower limbs showed thrombosis of the left posterior tibial vein. Blood and stool cultures on admission grew Group C Salmonella.\n\n【7】Table 1 \n\n【8】Initial blood test results.\n\n【9】He was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LWMH) for deep venous thrombosis.\n\n【10】However, he had persistent fever and became hypotensive on the 10th hospital day. Repeat blood cultures grew Group C Salmonella, but repeat stool culture grew Group B Salmonella. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed no evidence of vegetation. Computed tomography (CT) aortography did not reveal aortitis.\n\n【11】Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the left lower limb was performed. It showed a multiloculated collection with enhancing rim and septa centered within the tibialis posterior muscle, measuring approximately 13.9 × 4.4 × 4 cm with adjacent myositis and fasciitis .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【13】Axial, T2 weighted, fat saturated, STIR MR image showing loculated fluid signal within the tibialis posterior muscle , suggestive of a collection.

Intraoperatively, a multiloculated intramuscular abscess in posterior tibialis muscle was observed; 15 mls of frank pus was drained. Two drains were inserted, with the inferior drain at the residual space of the posterior tibialis muscle and superior drain into the space between the posterior tibialis and soleus. Intraoperative pus culture grew Group B Salmonella.\n\n【23】His condition improved dramatically following the drainage with resolution of pyrexia and hypotension. IV ceftriaxone was continued for a total duration of six weeks with oral metronidazole. LWMH was administered for six weeks as well. He remained well six months after discharge.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, is an important disease in many developing countries. It is estimated that there are approximately 22 million typhoid cases and ~200,000 deaths per year worldwide 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Enteric fever is caused by Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi. In contrast, focal infections such as osteomyelitis and endovascular infections tend to be caused by nontyphoidal salmonellae (NTS). While NTS commonly cause endovascular infections with mycotic aneurysm of aorta as the most common site 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>, myositis and other soft tissue infections have been previously described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. The type of infection depends on both host factors and, to a lesser degree, on the serotype of salmonellae 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Transmission usually occurs by the oral-faecal route 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u> via consuming contaminated drinking water and food sources, such as poultry, eggs, dairy products, vegetables, and fruits. Our patient did not give a clear history of dietary indiscretion but half-boiled eggs are commonly consumed in Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【28】In microbiology laboratories, salmonellae are now rapidly identified using automated systems 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.

A Malaysian study on NTS bacteraemia found that 55 out of 56000 blood cultures collected over four years grew NTS. An extraintestinal focus was found in 30% of cases, most commonly the lung and soft tissues (7.3% each). The study also described higher mortality in immunocompromised patients (30.6% versus 5.3% in immunocompetent patients) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Atherosclerosis and HIV infections are the most common predisposing factors for systemic salmonella infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>, although recently the emergence of defects or autoantibodies directed against the interferon gamma pathway has been shown to be a major underlying cause of systemic salmonella infections, particularly in Southeast Asia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Warning signs of extraintestinal infection would include localized tenderness in the musculoskeletal system, pleuritic pain suggesting a pleural pathology, chest pain, or embolic phenomena suggesting a mycotic aneurysm.\n\n【33】In our patient, despite adequate treatment of his salmonella bloodstream infection and his deep vein thrombosis with ceftriaxone and LWMH, he became hypotensive and it was only with drainage of his intramuscular abscess that his condition began to improve.\n\n【34】It is important that physicians be alert for timely diagnosis of extraintestinal salmonella infections, especially in immunocompromised patients with the risk of complications which may be potentially fatal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【35】#### 4\\. Learning Value\n\n【36】The diagnosis of extraintestinal salmonellosis necessitates a high degree of clinical suspicion. The majority of individuals with immunocompromised immune systems present with extraintestinal infections. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to treat immunocompromised patients with extraintestinal salmonella infections and abscesses.\n\n【37】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【38】Dr. Veeraraghavan Meyyur Aravamudan, Dr. Phang Kee Fong, Dr. Jong Sze Chin, Dr. Yang Shiyao Sam, Dr. Pavel Singh, and Dr. P.

Insufficiency fractures of pubic rami are rare occurrences in association with total hip arthroplasty (THA). Postoperative stress fractures occur due to increase of patients activity following years of disability. The physician should consider the possibility of a pelvic insufficiency fracture in patients with RA after THA, if the patients present with groin pain. We demonstrate here the first case of bilateral insufficiency fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone following THA.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】THA is effective for decreasing pain and improving the loss of function. Acute hip pain within the first few years after THA is unusual when the components are correctly positioned. The differential diagnosis, dislocation, infection, and periarticular bursitis or tendinitis, are considered. Insufficiency fracture around components also should be considered as part of differential diagnosis.\n\n【4】Several reports showed cases of insufficiency fracture of pubic rami after THA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. However, insufficiency fracture of bilateral pubic rami and iliac bone following THA has never been reported. Here, we report a case of a patient who complained of bilateral pelvic pain following bilateral THA who was found to have bilateral insufficiency fractures of pubic rami and iliac bone.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 62-year-old woman suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) underwent a left THA in 2007 and a right revision THA in 2009. The patient was treated with various doses of glucocorticoid for long term. After surgery, she was able to walk without support. However, ten months postoperatively, she presented with complaints of left groin pain that initially was associated with physical therapy sessions. The symptoms became more constant. She denied a history of a fall or of another traumatic event. Radiographs, at that time, did not show any significant findings. She was treated with anti-inflammatory medication and weight-bearing with use of a cane in the right hand. Over the next 2 months, the left groin pain was disappeared. After 4 month, the left pubic pain was recurrent. She did weight-bearing with use of a cane in the right hand again. However, she presented right groin pain several days later. Symptoms were worse with weight bearing and walking. Furthermore, several days later, both sides of buttock pain were presented and unable to walk.\n\n【7】Radiographs showed fractures of both pubic rami. Computed tomography (CT) showed bilateral fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone . Evaluation for metabolic bone disease was performed. There was no significant evidence evaluated by blood examination.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| CT image showing pelvis.

By this time, all symptoms had subsided.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】Stress fractures are classified into three subgroups: fatigue fracture caused by repetitive stress for normal bone, insufficiency fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile bone, and pathologic fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile invaded bone by tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Zwartelé et al. reported systematic reviews of cementless THA in RA patients, and they concluded that cementless acetabular cups were rarely associated with mechanical complications including acetabular fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, Fukunishi et al. reported that 11 patients in 171 RA patients (6.4%) who underwent cemented THA suffered from pubic rami fractures postoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Isdale reported the bone quality in RA patients was poor, and insufficiency fractures of the pubic rami in RA appear to be more common than had been recognized 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In our case, the subtype of stress fracture is thought to be classified into insufficiency fracture caused by repetitive stress for fragile bone due to RA. The bone quality of this patient might be poor, because the patient was treated with glucocorticoid for long term.\n\n【15】The patient performed revision THA by using Kerboull-type acetabular reinforcement device. Several reports demonstrated the results postoperatively using Kerboull-type acetabular reinforcement device 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. However, there was no report of pubic rami fracture after THA. Therefore, the fracture may not be associated with acetabular component design.\n\n【16】Most pelvic insufficiency fractures occur in women, particularly those with osteoporotic bone. The patients have impaired activity levels prior to THA. After surgery, many of these patients are pain free and get activity at a much higher level than preoperatively. Therefore, they are susceptible to the development of an insufficiency fracture if the bone quality is poor. In our case, the mechanism of fracture is thought as follows. Firstly, the insufficiency fracture of left pubic rami occurred due to daily activity. The patient was placed on limited weight-bearing, with use of a cane in the right hand. This increased the stress on the right side, and the fracture of right pubic rami was occurred. Both sides of pubic fracture increased the stress on both iliac bone, and the fractures of both iliac bones were caused.\n\n【17】Insufficiency fractures are differentiated from acute fractures, which occur early in the postoperative period as a result of press-fit insertion of cementless acetabular components in osteopenic bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The physician should consider the possibility of a pelvic insufficiency fracture in patients with RA after THA. If the patient presents with groin pain, the patient should be treated with weight-bearing as conservative management.\n\n【19】However, pelvic discontinuity by both pubic rami and iliac bone fracture occurred in our case; even we recommended weight-bearing at the time of initial fracture of left pubic rami. We reported the first case of bilateral insufficiency fracture of pubic rami and iliac bone following THA.\n\n【20】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【21】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Janina Tubby for her assistance with English rewriting.

When compared with the incidence of complications associated with insertions into the internal jugular vein or the subclavian vein, complications associated with insertions into the femoral vein are less frequent. In this paper, we describe a very rare complication of femoral vein catheter insertion—namely, catheter displacement into the inferior epigastric vein.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

The patient developed fever, subcutaneous swelling, and redness in right lower quadrant of the abdomen 11 days later . An axial abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan for suspected phlebitis and cellulitis revealed that the catheter was located in the right inferior epigastric vein. Swelling of the adjacent right lower rectus abdominal muscle and subcutaneous tissue was also evident . Intravenous hyperalimentation was stopped and the catheter was removed.

Catheters have been inserted into the inferior epigastric vein very rarely; only three cases have been reported in Japan (written in Japanese) as far as we know. Use of the inferior epigastric vein as an alternate route in children with difficult central venous access has been previously reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. There are fewer complications associated with femoral vein catheter insertions than with either internal jugular vein or subclavian vein insertions. Infectious risk of catheter placement in femoral vein is higher compared to those in internal jugular vein or subcvlaian vein.\n\n【15】The indications for catheter placement for intravenous hyperalimentation are basically considered when the enteral nutrition is difficult for some reasons. The enteral nutrition should be considered as a first-option alternative for most of patients. In this case, the patient was planned to have the operation for a gastric fistula. Nasal feeding tube was not inserted, because the patient was easy to have epistaxis.\n\n【16】Despite we initially confirmed catheter position by plain radiography, we could not demonstrate the displacement. Catheter migration was not confirmed by plain radiography in any of the previously reported cases. The cellulitis in our case completely resolved in a few days after catheter withdrawal. Two of the previously reported cases needed operations for wound drainage (cases written in Japanese).\n\n【17】In conclusion, the possibility in adults as well as children of intravenous catheters migrating into smaller vessels, such as the superficial and inferior epigastric veins, should be recognized after insertions into the femoral vein.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The clinical presentation of LS is highly variable with heterogeneity in the disease-associated symptoms of cerebellar, motor, and extrapyramidal dysfunction and common infections. There is no effective treatment for this condition; as such, the prognosis of this condition is very poor with death occurring within the first few years of life. In this study, we report the first LS case in Latvia with SURF1 pathogenic variants in two siblings. The difficulties encountered establishing a diagnosis for the first proband and the effective prenatal diagnosis for the second offspring that led to termination of the pregnancy are discussed.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

Our report details the clinical presentation, the investigation process leading to confirmation with particular emphasis on the underlying genetic heterogeneity, and the available treatment options.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Description\n\n【7】A 22-month-old male child was referred to Children’s Clinical University Hospital in Riga from another hospital due to an episode of hypoglycaemia (1.6 mmol/L). His general health condition was evaluated as serious. He was the second child of nonconsanguineous parents and was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy. Physical and psychomotor development was documented to be delayed.\n\n【8】Laboratory findings showed metabolic crisis—ketotic hypoglycaemia, abnormal acid-base balance, increased anion gap, lactic acidaemia 5.11 mmol/L (reference range: <2.5 mmol/L), and lactic aciduria 4993 mmol/L (reference range: 0–200 mmol/L). Physical examination detected a rash on the patient’s face and body, oedema of the face and both lower limbs, generalised low muscle tone, and hepatomegaly (+3 cm below the costal margin). His weight was 12 kg, and his height was 77 cm (−3 SD). Neurological investigation disclosed severe hypotonia, ataxia, and muscle hypotrophy.\n\n【9】The patient had feeding difficulties due to aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. As his health condition was considered serious, the boy was admitted to the intensive care unit where he developed a high-degree fever. Several blood samples were taken for microbiological diagnostics, and culture results revealed the presence of Gram-positive flora. Fluctuating elevated lactate levels were also detected in his blood: 5.11 mmol/L initially, then 3.29 mmol/L and 2.88 mmol/L (reference range: <2.5 mmol/L).\n\n【10】The patient subsequently vomited haematin several times and passed dark stools. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed slightly wider lateral ventricles and subarachnoid space; however, no specific changes were uncovered. Brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) showed no significant deviations in metabolites.\n\n【11】X-ray of the lungs and abdomen and fibrogastroscopy of the gastrointestinal tract showed no abnormal pathology.\n\n【12】Due to the low free carnitine and elevated lactate levels in his blood, treatment with L-carnitine (100 mg/kg/day) and thiamine (150 mg/day) supplementations was initiated as an empiric therapy for an undiagnosed mitochondrial disease.\n\n【13】The plasma amino acid panel showed low glutamine, glycine, serine, and citrulline levels and slightly elevated alanine and glycine levels. The organic acid spectrum in urine showed high glutaric acid, 7.13 (normal: 0–5.3). Based on the biochemical findings, a diagnosis of glutaric aciduria type 1 was suspected and, consequently, the patient’s DNA was sent for sequencing analysis using a next-generation sequencing panel of 435 genes associated with metabolic disorders. The patient’s clinical condition significantly improved, and he was discharged from the hospital. Nonetheless, genetic follow-up and maintenance therapy with L-carnitine and thiamine were recommended until a definitive diagnosis could be made.\n\n【14】After discharge, the DNA test results revealed no mutation in the gene causing glutaric aciduria type 1 and did not uncover any known disease-causing genetic pathogenic variant in the tested genes. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing was subsequently performed, but, again, no pathological variants were detected.\n\n【15】Nine months later, the patient was readmitted to our hospital due to lethargy, fatigue, and ataxia after withdrawal of his prescribed medications L-carnitine and thiamine. Brain MRI was repeated and showed progressive structural changes and lesions in the medulla oblongata and mesencephalon although MRS was not repeated.\n\n【16】A further extended genetic investigation was initiated. Specifically, whole-exome sequencing was performed to identify causative variants. Two pathogenic variants in the SURF1 gene were identified: c.845\\846del, p.(Ser282Cysfs ∗ 9) (maternal), and c.752-1G > C (paternal). Based on these findings and the clinical presentation, a diagnosis of LS was established. The L-carnitine/thiamine therapy was resumed. Furthermore, riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 were added to the treatment regimen. Neurological symptoms regressed for a short period of time. The child is currently four years old and is slowly deteriorating. He has lost the ability to walk and requires support to sit.\n\n【17】In 2020, the patient’s mother was reported to be pregnant with a gestational age of 21 weeks +5 days. Foetal ultrasound at 21 + 3 weeks revealed a cerebral periventricular cyst with dimensions of 21 mm × 11 mm. Diagnostic amniocentesis was performed, and foetal DNA sequencing results revealed two pathogenic variants in the SURF1 gene in a compound heterozygous state. Taken together, these findings were interpreted as LS and the pregnancy was terminated.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】This report details the first SURF1\\-associated LS family involving a child and a foetus in Latvia, highlighting the difficulties encountered in establishing a diagnosis in postnatal and prenatal cases.\n\n【20】Loss-of-function mutations in the SURF1 gene are associated with mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, nuclear type 1, which manifests as LS.\n\n【21】This is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterised by rapidly progressive neurodegeneration and encephalopathy with loss of motor and cognitive skills, often triggered by an infection, between about five and 18 months of age after previously normal development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Our patient was 22 months old when he was referred to our hospital. His psychomotor development was assessed as delayed at presentation; presumably, his parents had not recognised prior indications of this. For the majority of SURF1 patients, the median age for the onset of first symptoms is 9.5 months and the most frequently noted initial symptoms are poor feeding/vomiting (frequently attributed to gastro-oesophageal reflux) and poor weight gain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Mutations leading to the disruption of complex IV are the most common cause of LS in Europe 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The causative variant c.845\\846delCT in the SURF1 gene has been reported as the most common variant in European populations, and the variant c.752-1G > C has been reported in one LS family of Polish ethnicity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. However, these two mutations have never before been reported in one patient.\n\n【23】Most patients with pathogenic variants in SURF1 have bilateral brain MRI abnormalities involving the brainstem and subthalamic nuclei 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Nevertheless, there is still a degree of variability in their brain MRI findings 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The radiological features of our patient were not typical for LS. He had a normal brain MRI at 22 months of age, despite a severe clinical presentation. By contrast, most of the patients reported to date exhibited some neuroradiological changes by this age and altered clinical status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6, 13–15\\]</u>. It was only after our patient’s second hospitalisation, at 31 months of age, that the repeated brain MRI showed progressive structural changes and lesions in the medulla oblongata and mesencephalon. However, there were no alterations in subthalamic nuclei, the typical lesion localisation in patients with causative variants in SURF1.\n\n【24】Occasionally, LS-SURF1 patients may display atypical neuroimaging features such as diffuse supratentorial leukodystrophy, unifocal or multifocal infarctions, diffuse or focal cortical atrophy, or predominant cerebellar atrophy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. MRI is a key diagnostic tool in LS, but the clinical spectrum of SURF1 mutations is larger than previously thought and normal MRI findings, especially in early childhood, do not necessarily exclude SURF1 defects. The reasons for this heterogeneity in neuroimaging whilst retaining a phenotypic presentation in LS are not well understood. Having said that, considering that LS is the result of a number of different biochemical and genetic defects that affect mitochondrial function, one would expect to find some variability in the MRI findings amongst patients. In addition to MRI, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) could be performed for patients with LS. Lactate peaks in the brain (significant peak at >1.35 ppm) or the CSF is a trademark of mitochondrial disease, and MRS detection of CNS lactate sometimes may be more sensitive than serum lactate measurement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our case, lactate was not found in areas of the brain that appeared normal on MR images and the MRS investigation was not repeated.\n\n【25】The biochemical presentation of LS can include elevated lactate levels in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid and may indicate metabolic acidosis and hypoglycaemia in decompensation status. From previous reports, the increased lactate level in SURF1 patients ranges between 2.3 (reference range <2.5 mmol/L) and 7.3 mmol/L (mean 4.4 mmol/L) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Tissue hypoperfusion is the most common cause of lactate elevation; however, this is not particularly distinctive of LS as many other aetiological factors exist and many other metabolic diseases demonstrate increased lactate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Our patient showed variable results in serial lactate measurements, leading us to suspect a septic aetiology of his lactacidaemia. If lactic acidosis is present because of OXPHOS defects, parallel elevations in plasma alanine are commonly observed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 18, 19\\]</u>. Therefore, profiling of blood amino acids and urinary organic acids would be worthwhile and may provide pointers to the underlying cause.\n\n【26】In many suspected or unclear cases, the first genetic approach is next-generation sequencing—gene panels, clinical exome sequencing, whole-exome/genome sequencing. In our case, we performed next-generation sequencing with a panel consisting of 435 genes associated with metabolic disorders provided by a private commercial company. However, our approach underscores that clinicians should pay special attention to the contents of conventional next-generation sequencing panels. The SURF1 gene was not included in this analysis, and so the appropriate diagnosis of our patient was delayed for an extended period of time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In paediatric patients with progressive symptoms, achieving a correct diagnosis in a short period of time is still challenging.\n\n【27】The aim of prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic diseases is to identify causative variants, evaluate the general clinical condition of a foetus, and provide an assessment of the risk to the foetus in developing the disease antenatally or in childhood. Prenatal testing is usually necessary and requested as a consequence of having a previously affected child. The most common abnormal foetal ultrasound findings associated with mitochondrial disorders include periventricular cysts, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and skin oedema with reduced foetal movements 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 21\\]</u>. Periventricular cysts may be the initial in utero presentation in patients with mitochondrial disorders, although when a nonspecific abnormal foetal ultrasound finding is detected, it might be the only feature to suggest a mitochondrial disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. The interpretation of prenatal testing and prognostic variants with regard to whether or not the child will be affected is relatively clear in those families carrying causative variants in nuclear DNA where mostly classic Mendelian rules of inheritance apply. All families affected by a mitochondrial disease should also be made aware of all the available reproductive options and alternative options for future pregnancies. Such options include gamete (egg or sperm) donation or adoption as an alternative to pregnancy. Techniques to reduce or prevent the transmission of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA mutations, such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, are already available 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. In essence, we stress the importance of prenatal diagnostic testing of the foetus as the first step in diagnosing LS.\n\n【28】SURF1\\-deficient LS has been reported to have a more positive survival outcome compared with LS associated with complex I deficiency or LRPPRC mutations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Predictors of poorer prognosis include disease onset before six months of age, failure to thrive, brainstem lesions on neuroimaging, epileptic seizures that are difficult to treat, and a history of intensive care hospitalisation.\n\n【29】Generally, specific therapy for mitochondrial disorders is not widely available and no specific treatment for LS exists. The aim of symptomatic treatment is to manage symptoms and to improve the energy state by increasing and optimising ATP production, improving the efficiency of mitochondria and lowering lactate levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The use of coenzyme Q10, thiamine, and L-carnitine may decrease symptom severity in a small number of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Supplementation with group B vitamins, such as thiamine, which is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase, had a significant effect and led to neurological improvement in our case. However, there are only a few reported cases of thiamine-responsive pyruvate dehydrogenase complex-deficient LS in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. Thiamine responsiveness is more likely in patients presenting after 12 months of age than in those presenting with neonatal lactic acidosis and corpus callosum abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Based on our experience, it is important to start a therapeutic trial of thiamine immediately if metabolic disease is suspected since biotin-thiamine-responsive basal ganglia disease can fully imitate the clinical presentation of LS.\n\n【30】In patients suffering from LS, a few case reports have shown promising results for a treatment with EPI-743 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>. This medication is supposed to enhance the biosynthesis of glutathione and to improve oxidative stress status, whereas lactate values remain unchanged 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Enns et al. reported that patients with SURF1 defect had been demonstrating clinical improvement after starting EPI-743 treatment without side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Even though the results are promising, a single case is not sufficient for assessing the therapeutic effect of a currently unapproved drug. Drug effects need to be evaluated by randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.\n\n【31】Despite making major progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial diseases, the available therapeutic options are very limited. Thus, they remain a fundamental goal of the current research in this field. A patient’s quality of life can improve significantly if appropriate physiotherapy and pharmacotherapy for neuromuscular concerns are provided. Suitable feeding methods to prevent malnutrition and aspiration and treatment of fever and infections are further important approaches to improve the quality of life and reduce the stress of the patient and their family. Cardiology, pulmonology, and ophthalmology evaluations are valuable to identify the involvement of these organs at an early stage.\n\n【32】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【33】This report details the first LS case in Latvia with SURF1 pathogenic variants in two siblings. The difficulties encountered while establishing a diagnosis for the first proband and the effective prenatal diagnosis for the second offspring that led to termination of the pregnancy are discussed. Identifying an underlying genetic cause in LS patients can be challenging. However, it can be facilitated if clinical, biochemical, and radiological findings are carefully evaluated. LS is a rare condition, and many other conditions present with similar symptoms. Nevertheless, a diagnosis of LS should be considered for a child with delayed psychomotor development, weakness, eating difficulties, signs of gradual neurodevelopmental regression, and symptoms of brainstem and/or basal ganglia involvement, especially when the clinical deterioration and metabolic crisis coincide with intercurrent infections.\n\n【34】#### Data Availability\n\n【35】The clinical data used in this case report are presented in this article.\n\n【36】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【37】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We describe the 24th case of SCACP, the malignant counterpart of syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP). At the present, we do not know whether SCACP arises from eccrine or apocrine glands because of the contrasting opinions in the literature. Only few histochemical and ultrastructural studies have previously advised that SCACP could arise from pluripotent stem cells. Through our case, we wish to suggest the stem cell-like properties of the syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum. This rare neoplasm shows two different patterns of stem cell marker expression in the glandular and squamous components, respectively. For the double phenotype of SCACP, we propose it like an intriguing model to study histogenesis and stem cell properties for more wide-ranging epithelial tumors.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum (SCACP) is a rare malignant form of syringocystadenoma papilliferum (SCAP), cutaneous adnexal neoplasm defined by Stokes in 1917. Some authors are unsure about the malignant transformation in syringocystadenoma papilliferum but, recently, Hoekzema et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> have presented a well-documented SCACP case arising from preexisting SCAP, which appeared to be an epidermal nevus. SCAP mostly occurs in the head and neck region and is associated with a nevus sebaceous (NS) of Jadassohn in 30–40% of cases, but may also appear de novo (without NS) on other parts of the body.\n\n【4】There is an increasing evidence for an apocrine histogenesis of SCAP and SCACP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> but the possibility of an eccrine origin from sweat glands for a few cases seems likely. Another theory suggests the apoeccrine glands to be the origin of these tumors that could be skin hamartomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. Very few histochemical and ultrastructural studies propose that SCACP arises from pluripotent cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 4\\]</u>. A little map of the different theories is shown in Table 1.\n\n【5】Table 1 \n\n【6】Histogenetic theories of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.\n\n【7】Histologically, the connection to the skin surface, by typical epidermal transition, the decapitation on the luminal surface of inner layer cells, the tumor connection to folliculosebaceous structures, the layering of apocrine glands in the underlying tissues, and positive reactions to diastase-resistance periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) provide evidence of apocrine differentiation of SCACP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【8】Herein, we report a case of SCACP occurring on the left shoulder of an 88-year-old European male patient.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【10】##### 2.1. Case\n\n【11】An 88-year-old man presented with a single nodule on the left shoulder. He had had multiple lesions for 20 years of bowenoid actinic keratosis on the face, the forehead, and the left ear. In the last 13 years, the patient underwent prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma, score 8 (5+3) according to Gleason and squamous cell carcinoma on the left eyelid surgically treated. The man stated that the lesion began as a bean-sized papule and had increased gradually in size with time. It also became painful. Physical examination revealed a single, 1.5 × 1.5 cm, erythematous, dome-shaped, and firm tumor surrounded by normal skin on the left shoulder. Regional lymph nodes were not palpable, and the physical examination did not reveal any remarkable findings except for the mass. The patient had no clinical or radiographic evidence of a head and neck or lung primary tumors. He died after two years of old age.\n\n【12】##### 2.2. Histology\n\n【13】The present skin tumor was clinically analyzed and then resected tumor specimens were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 μm were subjected to conventional microscopic histochemical and immunohistochemical observations.\n\n【14】PAS reaction, with and without diastase digestion, was also carried out.\n\n【15】For the immunostaining, we used an automatic and clinically validated instrument based on Ventana Benchmark Ultra systems from Roche Tissue Diagnostics. Immunohistochemistry was performed by means of a new enhanced sensitivity biotin-free multimer technology system, based on direct linkers between peroxidase and secondary antibodies (ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit, Ventana Medical System). The following primary antibodies were used prediluted: antipancytokeratin (PCT), anticytokeratin 7 (CK7), anticytokeratin 5/6 (MES), anti-e-cadherin (epithelial) (e-cad), antiepithelial membrane antigen (EMA), anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), anti-p63, anti-S100 by Ventana; anti-CD117 (c-kit) (Cell Marque), and anti-Ki-67 antigen (MIB-1) by DAKO.\n\n【16】For immunofluorescence, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, as described above, and unmasked using a commercially available kit (Unmasker, Diapath). Slices were incubated with Immunological Sciences primary antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-CD44 1 : 50, and rabbit polyclonal anti-CD133 4 μL/mL and then incubated with Molecular Probes secondary antibodies, 1 : 100, goat anti-mouse, green fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated and goat anti-rabbit, and red fluorescent Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated and finally counterstained with 0.0001% DAPI (4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), in accordance with the preview published protocol 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【18】All the immunoprofiling data about the normal skin, the benign lesion, and the carcinomatous component are summarized in Table 2.\n\n【19】Table 2 \n\n【20】Antigen expression of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.\n\n【21】Hematoxylin and eosin staining of histological sections showed squamous cancer cells in the dermis to be gradually deepening. The squamous budding generated internal cavities giving rise to glandular papillary structures. These tumoral squamous-papillary glands were positively stained by anti-PCT antibody in the outer layer of budding; the glandular component was heterogeneously stained with accentuation of the membranes. Anti-CK5/6 strongly stained the transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplasia; the squamous solid component and the glandular structures were moderately stained. The transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplasia was strongly positive for CK7; the glandular budding and the papillary components were intensely stained by CK7 antibody; contemporaneously, the squamous solid neoplasia appeared negative. E-cad staining showed an increase of pericytoplasmic positivity in the transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplasia but completely negative was the infiltrative portion. Neoplastic areas, in contrast with normal epidermis, resulted in totally stained EMA. Syringocystadenocarcinoma was completely negative for CEA and robustly positive with patchy nuclear for p63 staining. By anti-c-kit antibody, we obtained highly positive staining of basal layer of neoplastic budding; the glandular and papillary structures were heterogeneously positive but almost negative and/or speckled positive was the squamous solid component. The evident desmoplastic stromal reaction accompanied the budding and contained numerous plasma cells and lymphocytes. The epithelial transition and the decapitated secretion provided evidence of apocrine differentiation; the cytological atypia gave a precious suggestion of the neoplasm. An invasive squamous component coexisted with glandular elements typical for adenocarcinomas. The dual p63-CK7 immunohistochemical positivity was useful in confirming the diagnosis definitive of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum.\n\n【22】Nestin, CD44, and CD133 antigens, markers of stem cell properties, were overexpressed in the neoplasm and could suggest a tumor origin by pluripotent stem cells.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【24】We report a second case of syringocystadenocarcinoma with some unique histologic features; preview described by Leeborg et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> demonstrates the p63 positive-gradual transition area from keratinizing squamous epithelium to neoplasm (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is a rare neoplasm of doubtful (apocrine versus eccrine) origin and is the malignant counterpart of the more common benign syringocystadenoma papilliferum. Histologically, syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum resembles syringocystadenoma papilliferum and solid areas of tumor may be present, in addition to the glandular, cystic, and papillary areas that deepen like dermal cleft by a squamous transition epithelium (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The glandular epithelial cells show malignant cytological features, such as high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios and nuclear irregularity, and, in particular, they are PAS diastase positive, with decapitated cytoplasm, confirming the apocrine origin. Our case is distinctive in several aspects. It is the second report, to our knowledge, to document the presence of a high-grade cell component originally considered to be a high-grade squamous cell carcinoma and then demonstrated adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. It is the first case to provide immunohistochemical evidence of stem cell features and epithelial-mesenchymal transition- (EMT-) like properties.\n\n【25】(a)\n\n【26】(b)\n\n【27】(c)\n\n【28】(d)\n\n【29】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【30】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Analysis of a skin syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum specimen.

(a) p63 antibody stains the transition area from epidermis epithelium to the squamous neoplasm and the basal layer of glandular component (original magnification ×40). (b) The papillary structures are moderately positive and/or negative for p63 (original magnification ×100). (c) Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates c-kit at the basal layer of neoplastic budding; almost negative, only with speckled positive cells, is the squamous solid component (original magnification ×20). (d) A few positive cells of the squamous neoplasia are stained by Nestin antibody, stemness marker (original magnification ×400). |\n| --- |\n\n【39】To analyze the biological and carcinogenetic property of our tumor case, we have used a series of antibodies fit for recognizing epithelial expression, proliferation index, and stem cell properties.\n\n【40】Like Leeborg et al. suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, we have found CK7 and p63 positive-cells in continuous stream from normal epithelium to neoplastic adenocarcinoma clefts, that is, the squamous-glandular transdifferentiation of the tumor (Figures 1(c), 1(d), 2(a), and 2(b)). Furthermore p63 positivity supports the primary origin of the squamous and/or cutaneous-adnexal tumor and distinguishes it from metastatic adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Simultaneously, we have demonstrated, for the first time, a possible staminal origin of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum by c-kit, nestin, CD44, and CD133 immunopositivity.\n\n【41】The transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor c-kit (CD117) is a 145–165-kD proto-oncogene, related to platelet-derived factor receptor and the colony stimulatory factor receptor. The primary ligand for c-kit is stem cell factor (SCF) or also named mast cell growth factor and steel factor. Evidence supports 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u> the existence of CD117 as putative marker of mesenchymal stem cells and/or cancer stem cells. Overexpression of c-kit has been demonstrated in several human tumors such as gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), small-cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, Ewing’s tumor, and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Other c-kit positive-normal cells include epithelial cells in skin adnexa, breast, and subsets of cerebellar neurons.\n\n【42】In our case, we observed c-kit positive-epidermal epithelium basal layer connected with neoplastic budding by c-kit positive-tumor cells that presented the same pattern of positivity for CK7 and p63, too (Figures 2(c), 1(c), and 2(a)). The positivity for c-kit was robust and more intense in the basal layer of the glandular neoplastic budding, in continuity with the c-kit positive-normal basal layer of epithelium. We observed heterogeneously intense-moderate amount of staining of glandular and papillary structures; almost negative, with limited occurrence and speckled positivity appeared the squamous solid component. Interestingly, we found some positive spindle cells in perineoplastic stroma . Recently, it has been reported that c-kit plays a critical role in the invasion and metastasis of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) and may participate in EMT of salivary ACC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Furthermore e-cad staining was interestingly expressed (data not shown). We found, as recent literature has proposed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>, a different level of this central component of cell junctions-adhesion molecule: plasmalemmal positivity in the normal tissue and in the transition area from stratified squamous epithelium to neoplastic budding with occasionally negative neoplastic cells; we observed a gradual decreasing of e-cad positivity into neoplasia, with focally negative neoplastic glands. Totally unstained appeared the invasive papillary component. All of these data together either with c-kit pattern or with the spindle cell morphology in the front of infiltration and the surrounding desmoplastic stromal reaction (Figures 2(c), S1, and 1(b)) could be convincing features of EMT-like process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25, 26\\]</u>. The EMT paradigm is a developmental pathway by which epithelial cells are transdifferentiated to mesenchymal cells during embryogenesis, tissue remodelling, and wound healing. Recently, an interesting hypothesis considers EMT as a more general event that has been implicated in all types of carcinoma and provides them with an additional survival advantage. By means of EMT, the epithelial tumor cells would transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts, losing their malignant phenotype but producing the desmoplastic stroma which is essential for tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis. In human cancer, the phenomenon is rarely demonstrated because, after the infiltrative spreading, it is fast reverted by mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) program, in cancerous epithelial phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27–29\\]</u>. It has been observed that, during the EMT process, cancer epithelial cells acquire stem cell-like traits and appear positive for putative cancer stem cell (CSC) markers, resulting in a migratory cell phenotype 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 31\\]</u>. So EMT-like properties of carcinoma are more persuasive, when they are associated with an increase of putative stemness marker expression. For this reason, we have analyzed nestin, CD44, and CD133 antigens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 24, 32–34\\]</u>.\n\n【43】Nestin, VI intermediate filament protein and marker of precursor cells, is also expressed in the stem cells of the hair follicle and in the endothelial cells; moreover, nestin is expressed in the peritumoral stroma of basal cell carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 33\\]</u>. In our case, we found in bulge squamous area of neoplasia some nests of nestin-positive stroma cells with mesenchymal phenotype  but also convincing clusters of nestin positive-cancer stem cells in the epithelial neoplasia (Figure 2(d)).\n\n【44】The CD44 antigen is a cell-surface glycoprotein involved in cell-cell interactions and cell adhesion and migration, for these properties participate in a wide variety of cellular functions including lymphocyte activation, recirculation and homing, hematopoiesis, and tumor metastasis. Recently CD44 has been recognized as a marker of putative cancer stem cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[35\\]</u>, in particular of squamous phenotype; CD44 high expression plays a crucial key role in initiation, malignant transformation, and EMT-like program 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 32, 36\\]</u>. An interesting aspect of our case consists of evident overexpression of CD44 in squamous component of neoplasia, with spreading positivity in the perineoplastic stroma cells. Almost completely negative for CD44 appeared the glandular and papillary components .\n\n【45】(a)\n\n【46】(b)\n\n【47】(c)\n\n【48】(d)\n\n【49】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【50】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| Fluorescence microscopy analysis of the staminal property of syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrates anti-CD133 (in red) and anti-CD44 (in green) antibodies; the nuclei are contrasted by DAPI (in blue).

(d) Overview of CD133 positive-cystic and papillary structures (original magnification ×100). |\n| --- |\n\n【52】CD133, prominin 1, is pentaspan 120-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein and considered to be a hematopoietic and ubiquitarian stem cell marker, although its biological function remains largely unknown. However, this protein has been identified as a potential cancer stem cell marker in the brain, colon, prostate, pancreas, and, recently, the skin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[37\\]</u>. Until now, the correlation between CD133 expression and clinicopathological features of tumors, like increased tumorigenic and patient survival, persist undemonstrated. Only few data in the literature describe the clinical significance of the expression patterns of CD133 (membranous and/or cytoplasmic) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u> but it is clear that aberrant overexpression is pathognomonic for neoplasia. In particular, we found as a strong uniform pattern of nuclear-cytoplasmic CD133 overexpression in the adenocomponent that had lost the CD44 membranous positivity during the glandular neoplastic transdifferentiation .\n\n【53】By PCT immunostaining, we demonstrated the epithelial origin of the tumor because PCT immunopositive-cells appeared in normal epithelium and in continuity with the external layer of the neoplasm. This suggests the primary epithelial budding of adenocarcinoma. (data not shown). CD133, prominin, increased in squamous carcinoma but more prominently in cystic-glandular neoplasia. This pattern, associated with specular behavior of CD44, can suggest the development and evolution of glandular part from squamous component.\n\n【54】By intense immunopositivity for CK7, p63, and c-kit and the particular neoplastic stromal reactivity, we hypothesized that this tumor could have EMT-like properties. Furthermore, the p63/CK7 staining has also highlighted the squamous transdifferentiation of this adnexal-like neoplasm. Since the normal basal layer of epithelium was c-kit positive like the neoplastic component, we suggest that this tumor could derive from pluripotent-like cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[39\\]</u>, also with the support of high positivity for nestin, CD133, and CD44. Typical PCT immunostaining demonstrated the ontogenetic behavior of epithelial-adnexal neoplastic budding. In front of these original data, we suggest to reanalyze the syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum cases in the light of new evidences regarding histogenesis and stem cell-like properties. Syringocystadenocarcinoma papilliferum is a very infrequent skin tumor but could be a good model to verify the existence of the cancer stem cells and their transdifferentiable properties in skin neoplasms.\n\n【55】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【56】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【57】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【58】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors are grateful to Professor Vincenzo Eusebi (University of Bologna) for helpful discussions.

However, whereas atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori involves the antrum, the antrum is spared in autoimmune gastritis. Here, we report the use of magnifying endoscopy to identify and distinguish atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori from autoimmune gastritis. The mucosal pattern in autoimmune gastritis is that of closely arranged small round and oval pits, thus differing from the pattern seen in atrophic mucosa due to H. pylori infection. We speculate that this reflects differences in inflammation between the two types of gastritis. In autoimmune gastritis the inflammation is directed primarily against gastric glands, whereas in H. pylori infection the inflammation is directed against the bacteria on or near the surface and the damage initially affects the surface epithelium. During repair, the normal regular round pits are destroyed, whereas they remain largely intact in mucosa with autoimmune-associated atrophy. Confirmation of the features of autoimmune gastritis revealed by magnifying endoscopy would not only make the endoscopic diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis more accurate, but also help to elucidate changes in the surface epithelial structure of gastritis due to various causes.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The two most common causes of atrophic gastritis are an autoimmune mechanism or persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori. Ultimately, persistent chronic inflammation may result in severe atrophy of the stomach’s mucosal lining. In autoimmune gastritis the antral mucosa is spared, and characteristically the atrophy is associated with a marked elevation of the serum gastrin level, which may result in type I gastric carcinoid tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. In contrast, H. pylori infection affects the gastric antrum and tends to blunt the hypergastrinemic response to hypochlorhydria, gastric carcinoids being uncommon. Although both of these two forms of atrophic gastritis are common, there have been no reports of endoscopically evident features that can reliably distinguish between autoimmune and H. pylori induced atrophic gastritis.\n\n【4】Here we used magnifying endoscopy to identify differences between the two types of atrophic gastritis. The appearance of the gastric corpus in patients with autoimmune gastritis differs from that of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, which exhibits either ridged surface structures or a villous to granular surface pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. In contrast, the magnified endoscopic appearance of the atrophic mucosa in autoimmune gastritis is similar, but not identical, to that of the corpus in the H. pylori\\-negative stomach. We report our findings obtained using magnifying endoscopy in three patients with autoimmune gastritis. We found that the atrophic mucosa of the corpus in all three patients exhibited a previously undescribed pattern of closely arranged small round and oval pits.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】A 48-year-old woman presented with epigastric discomfort. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy revealed severe mucosal atrophy in the gastric corpus. Magnifying endoscopy of the corpus revealed closely arranged small round and oval pits with a surrounding network of capillaries. In the antrum, both conventional and magnifying endoscopy demonstrated no abnormal features, and the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having autoimmune gastritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Biopsy specimens were taken from both the antrum and the corpus. The histology of the antral mucosa was normal, whereas that of the corpus exhibited severe atrophy. The serum gastrin level was 4440 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL), and the level of antiparietal cell antibody was ×160 positive. The patient was negative for anti-intrinsic factor antibody and anti-H.  pylori antibody IgG, and the urea breast test gave a result of 2.2‰  (reference range: <2.5‰). The diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis was therefore confirmed.\n\n【8】##### 2.2. Case 2\n\n【9】A 72-year-old woman presented for a routine health check. Upper GI endoscopy identified severe atrophy of the mucosa in the gastric corpus (Figure 1(a)), and magnifying endoscopy showed a pattern of closely spaced small round and oval pits (Figure 1(b)). Conventional endoscopy of the antrum demonstrated no abnormality, suggesting a diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis. As this endoscopic examination was part of a routine health check, no biopsy was performed. However, serum samples revealed a gastrin level of 1800 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL) and antiparietal cell antibody ×40 positive, with negativity for anti-intrinsic factor antibody and anti-H. pylori antibody IgG. Autoimmune gastritis was therefore confirmed.\n\n【10】(a)\n\n【11】(b)\n\n【12】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| (a) Conventional endoscopic finding in the corpus of Case 2.

Case 3\n\n【16】A 58-year-old man had been found to have gastric nodules by X-ray and endoscopic examinations at another hospital. During the endoscopic examination, three nodules were biopsied and one was suspected to be a carcinoid tumor. The other two were diagnosed as atrophic gastric mucosa. A conventional endoscopic reexamination at our hospital revealed multiple nodules on the greater curvature of the corpus (Figure 2(a)), one of which was reddish (Figure 2(a) yellow arrow). Magnifying endoscopy showed that this reddish nodule had a gyriform-like structure with an irregular vascular pattern (Figure 2(b)). Based on the magnifying endoscopy findings, the reddish nodule was diagnosed as a carcinoid tumor, and this was subsequently confirmed by histological examination of a biopsy sample. Conventional endoscopic examination of the corpus demonstrated severe atrophic gastritis (Figure 2(a)). Magnifying endoscopic examination of the other nodules revealed closely arranged small round pits (Figure 2(c)) and a pattern of closely arranged small round and oval pits was also observed in the mucosa surrounding these nodules (Figures 2(b) and 2(c)). Thus, magnifying endoscopy was able to show that this characteristic pit pattern was present even in the atrophic mucosa of the corpus, leading to a diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis associated with a carcinoid tumor. Analysis of the patient’s serum showed a gastrin level of 2700 pg/mL (reference range: <200 pg/mL), antiparietal cell antibody ×80 positive, positivity for anti-intrinsic factor antibody, and negativity for anti-H. pylori antibody IgG. The reddish nodule and some of the surrounding nodules that showed closely arranged small round pits were treated by endoscopic mucosal dissection (ESD). The reddish nodule was 3 mm in diameter and histological examination confirmed that it was a carcinoid tumor. The other small nodules showed remnants of fundic glands within the atrophic mucosa (Figure 2(d)).\n\n【17】(a)\n\n【18】(b)\n\n【19】(c)\n\n【20】(d)\n\n【21】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| (a) Conventional endoscopic findings in Case 3.

Discussion\n\n【25】Strickland and Mackay described autoimmune gastritis as Type A atrophic gastritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. One characteristic of autoimmune gastritis is hypergastrinemia, which may lead to the development of gastric carcinoids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, the histological features of autoimmune gastritis are a normal pyloric glandular mucosa and severe atrophic changes in the corpus, thus differing from those of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection, which primarily affects the antrum. The endoscopic diagnosis is based on an apparently normal antral mucosa alongside severe atrophic mucosa in the corpus. However, it difficult to reliably diagnose autoimmune gastritis on the basis of this criterion alone. Histologically, normal pyloric gland mucosa is taken from antrum, although atrophic mucosa is taken from the corpus in biopsy specimens. However, in a real clinical condition, a diagnosis is only rarely decided from biopsy specimens, and instead, is based on the results of serological examinations for gastrin, antiparietal cell antibody and anti-intrinsic factor antibody. A much more practical approach would be to diagnose autoimmune gastritis by imaging of the morphological features, that is, by using magnifying endoscopy, before serological confirmation.\n\n【26】We have previously described the characteristic features of the corpus in H. pylori infection revealed by magnifying endoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u> and classified such H. pylori induced gastritis into four types (the so-called “Z classification”) which excludes an atrophic mucosa 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. However, in order to include cases showing an atrophic mucosa, the classification was subsequently modified and renamed the A-B classification system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. The normal mucosa of the corpus without H. pylori infection, as demonstrated by magnifying endoscopy, shows a pattern of regular round pits surrounded by a network of capillaries that coalesce into collecting venules; this is classified as type B-0 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Mild gastritis due to H. pylori shows round pits surrounded by a slightly irregular network of capillaries, and this is classified as type B-1 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Active gastritis showing round pits with dividing sulci is classified as type B-2, and active gastritis with dilated pits and denser sulci is classified as type B-3 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–6\\]</u>. Atrophic mucosa with ridge surface structures is classified as type A-1 and that with villous to granular surface structures as type A-2 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Magnifying endoscopy shows that atrophic mucosa has an appearance different from that of nonatrophic mucosa. In case 1, closely arranged small round and oval pits were seen in the atrophic mucosa and, based on the above classifications, we considered that the patient had autoimmune gastritis. From this experience, we were able to diagnose cases 2 and 3 as autoimmune gastritis based on these magnifying endoscopic features, which differ from those of the atrophic mucosa in H. pylori infection and are similar but not identical to those of the corpus in the absence of H. pylori (type B-0).\n\n【28】We think that this feature of autoimmune gastritis revealed by magnifying endoscopy is very practical for diagnostic confirmation before ordering serological examination.\n\n【29】Additional cases of autoimmune gastritis studied by magnifying endoscopy are needed to confirm that the pattern described above is truly a unique feature of the corpus in this disease. It is interesting to note that the magnified view of the atrophic mucosa in the corpus of patients with autoimmune gastritis differs from that seen in H. pylori induced mucosal atrophy. We speculate that this may be related to the differences in the pattern and type of inflammation between the two types of gastritis. In autoimmune gastritis, the inflammation is largely mononuclear and directed primarily against gastric glands, whereas in H. pylori infection the inflammation shows an acute on chronic pattern and is directed against the bacteria located on the surface. In H. pylori gastritis, the mucosal damage is largely a bystander effect, and most severe at the surface epithelium. Ongoing inflammation likely influences mucosal repair and does not allow reconstruction of the normal surface epithelium (i.e. the regular round pits are destroyed). In contrast, in autoimmune gastritis, the normal surface structure may remain intact or be subjected to less damage, remaining recognizable in the atrophic mucosa as a pattern of closely arranged round and oval pits.\n\n【30】The changes of surface epithelial structure in various types of gastritis are thought to differ according to cause, and the features revealed by magnifying endoscopy may provide clues for elucidating such changes in surface epithelial structure.\n\n【31】Furthermore, a gyriform-like structure surrounded by closely arranged small round pits in the atrophic mucosa, as seen in Case 3, may be a specific magnifying endoscopic feature of carcinoid arising from autoimmune gastritis. Further accumulation of cases of autoimmune gastritis, observed by magnifying endoscopy, will be necessary.\n\n【32】In conclusion, magnifying endoscopy has shown that, in autoimmune gastritis, the atrophic mucosa in the corpus has a characteristic pattern of closely arranged small and oval pits, thus differing markedly from the appearance of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pylori infection. Magnifying endoscopic observation is thus very useful for diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis. Confirmation of the magnifying endoscopic features of autoimmune gastritis would not only make the endoscopic diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis more accurate but also help to clarify the changes in surface epithelial structure characteristic of gastritis due to various causes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is important to recognise Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in electrocardiograms (ECG), as it may mimic ischaemic heart disease, ventricular hypertrophy, and bundle branch block. Recognising WPW syndrome allows for risk stratification, the identification of associated conditions, and the institution of appropriate management. Objective. The present case showed that electrophysiological study is indicated in patients with abnormal ECG and syncope. Case Report. A 40-year-old man with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome was presented to emergency with syncope. A baseline ECG was a complete right branch block and posterior left hemiblock. He was admitted to the cardiac care unit for pacemaker implantation. The atypical figure of complete right branch block and posterior left hemiblock was thought to be a “false positive” of conduction abnormality. But the long anterograde refractory period of the both accessory pathway and atrioventricular conduction may cause difficulty in diagnosing Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Conclusion. A Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome may mimic a conduction disease. No reliable algorithm exists for making an ECG diagnosis of a preexcitation syndrome with conduction disorders. This can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in the context of syncope.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a conduction disturbance in which atrial impulses are transmitted to the ventricle by an accessory pathway besides normal atrioventricular conduction. The result of these multiple fronts of depolarization is a short PR interval, the delta wave, and a widened QRS complex. The preexcitation syndrome (PS) is diagnosed by the surface ECG in sinus rhythm with a typical pattern associating a short PR interval (<0.12 s in adults) and a widening of QRS complex with a delta wave 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Patients with WPW syndrome may usually present palpitation, syncope, and sudden death. Pattern of PS is noted among 0.1 to 0.5% of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The pattern is dependent not only on the location of accessory pathway (AP), but also on the properties of atrioventricular (AV) node and His-Purkinje system, and there is a wide spectrum of ECG types encountered. Spontaneous normalization of ECG with intermittent preexcitation is reported in 20% to 30% of WPW; dynamic QRS variations in WPW syndrome were noted several years ago 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】This case reported unexplicated syncope with unusual patterns of PS related to an atrioventricular accessory pathway (AP) was identified at electrophysiological study.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】This case is about a 40-year-old man who was presented to emergency with syncope that happened at work. He had no prior history of cardiac disease. The physical examination was normal. The ECG showed a regular sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, a complete right branch block, and posterior left hemiblock , and PR interval was 120 ms. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal echocardiographic findings with normal left ventricular systolic function.\n\n【7】(a)\n\n【8】(b)\n\n【9】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| (a) Regular sinus rhythm at 70 beats per minute, a wide QRS and PR interval was 120 ms (b) post ablation we show a normal QRS. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】Electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed by intracardiac route in this patient with unexplained syncope and atypical ECG. We recorded a regular sinus rhythm, an AH interval was 150 ms, and HV interval was −24 ms. Programmed atrial stimulation was performed in the basal state and showed an effective atrial refractory period of right atrium at 200 ms and effective refractory period of accessory tract was 300 ms . The QRS had the same morphology during atrial pacing. We found a dissociation atrioventricular conduction in retrograde. We inserted a catheter of exploration in coronary sinus; we recorded a shorter AV at the distal electrode of decapolar that confirmed the diagnosis of a left accessory bypass . The use of isoproterenol (isuprel) showed a classic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with slurred initial QRS. This ECG showed fusion of antergrade conduction from both the left sided accessory pathway (AP) and AV node . AH interval with isuprel was 100 ms and HV interval was 42 ms. This was explicated by an accelerated atrioventricular conduction with isuprel in addition to accessory pathway . The effective refractory period of accessory pathway was 210 ms with isuprel . We supposed that atrial fibrillation caused ventricular fibrillation responsible for syncope. Thus, we had decided to ablate the accessory pathway .\n\n【13】(a)\n\n【14】(b)\n\n【15】(c)\n\n【16】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| In atrial pacing, effective accessory pathway refractory period was 290 ms effective ((a) and (b)).

In Atrial pacing, an anterograde Wenckebach cycle length was 130/BAT (suprahisian AV block). The patient became asymptomatic.\n\n【42】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【43】Unapparent preexcitation syndrome was defined as a normal ECG at the time at electrophysiology which can be related to a masked preexcitation or an intermittent preexcitation. Masked preexcitation was defined as overt antegrade conduction over AP masked by the normal AV conduction. These patients have a minimal preexcitation on the ECG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【44】We reported a case of a patient with WPW and syncope. The preablation ECG showed fusion of antegrade conduction from both the left sided accessory pathway (AP) and AV node with predominance from left sided accessory pathway. Therefore, the ECG showed atypical presentation of preexcitation that is considered as rare in PS. This patient was studied because he complained of syncope. Similar findings could be expected in apparently asymptomatic subjects; systematic ECG in subjects at risk of arrhythmias as athletes is probably not sufficient to eliminate the presence of a masked electrical abnormality as a PS sometimes at risk of serious events. The most frequent unusual ECG of PS was the masked pattern of PS, associated with minor signs of preexcitation retrospectively visible when ECG became slightly different after AP ablation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Although the ECG mimics RBBB, a more careful inspection of the baseline ECG indeed reveals a small delta wave and relatively short PR interval. A differential diagnosis of AP could be made after careful analysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【45】It is important to recognize Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome in electrocardiograms (ECG), as it may mimic ischaemic heart disease, ventricular hypertrophy, and bundle branch block. In addition, ECG can aid in the localization of the accessory pathway. Recognizing WPW syndrome allows for risk stratification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>, the identification of associated conditions, and the institution of appropriate management. More than 50% of APs are located at the left free wall, 5%–10% at the anteroseptum, 20%–30% at the posteroseptum, and 10%–20% at the right free wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In patients with an antegradely conducting AP, ventricular activation during sinus rhythm occurs simultaneously via both the AP and the atrioventricular (AV) node, resulting in a fusion complex. APs may be classified into several types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Manifest APs are those that conduct more rapidly in the antegrade direction than the AV node, resulting in a discernible delta wave on the surface ECG. Concealed APs conduct only in the retrograde direction, and no delta wave is documented in the ECG. Several algorithms have been developed to localize the site of APs from the surface ECG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In our case, the anterograde conduction in accessory tract and atrioventricular node both slowly explain this ECG figure. Charron et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> reported a particular electrocardiographic pattern in four members of the same family with conduction defects (RBBB and occasionally left anterior hemiblock), short PR interval, pseudoappearance of atrial hypertrophy, and occasionally sinus dysfunction or supraventricular extrasystole. This clinical entity is related to R302Q mutation of the γ2 subunit producing AMP protein kinase, coded by the gene PRKAG2, but, in our case, there was not a similar case in his family.\n\n【46】In conclusion, a Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome may mimic a conduction disease and this can lead to diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in the context of syncope.\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Case\n\n【5】An 86-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaints of abdominal pain. The patient’s medical history included hyperlipidemia and cholecystectomy 15 years prior to presentation. The patient stated that he had eaten at a fast food restaurant one day prior to presentation. Afterwards, the patient developed mild, diffuse, constant abdominal pain with nausea that worsened on the day of presentation, prompting his ED visit.\n\n【6】In the ED, the patient had a temperature of 102.3°F, leukocytosis with left shift, and a positive urinalysis. In addition, the patient was noted to have hyperbilirubinemia to 4.5 with elevated liver enzymes (ALT 413, AST 340, and ALP 203).\n\n【7】A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast demonstrated dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts with the common bile duct measuring up to 12 mm.

The patient was asked to follow-up with his gastroenterologist as an outpatient.\n\n【18】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【19】Choledocholithiasis refers to the presence of bile duct stones. It is estimated that up to 15% of patients <60 years of age have stones in the common bile duct, whereas it can be as high as 60% in the elderly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Risk factors identified for complicated choledocholithiasis are Asian descent, increasing age, and male gender 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.

Rarely were the stones deemed to be primary as in our case.\n\n【21】Intrahepatic lithiasis can be either primary or secondary. Primary intrahepatic lithiasis is less common in the US and is usually the result of single or multiple cystic dilatations of the intrahepatic biliary tree resulting bile stasis. Secondary intrahepatic stones are the result of migration of gallbladder or CBD stones or strictures related to previous surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.

In the left lower extremity, Barré’s sign was observed, though manual muscle strength testing revealed all normal. In addition, left-sided Babinski’s reflex was detected. There were no other abnormalities on the neurological examination. Complete blood cell count and blood chemistry were within normal ranges. Electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and chest X-P findings demonstrated no abnormalities. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a localized LMI on the left side (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)).

Discussion\n\n【9】In LMI, it is well known that various neurological symptoms, such as sensory disturbance, cerebellar ataxia, dizziness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, Horner’s syndrome, skew deviation, ocular tilt reaction, nystagmus, dysarthria, dysphagia, and hiccups commonly occur 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. On the other hand, Kameda et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> reported that of the 167 patients of LMI, 11 patients (7%) were diagnosed as having Opalski’s syndrome, which is defined as LMI case with ipsilateral hemiparesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–11\\]</u>. Opalski’s syndrome may be caused by ischemia of the ipsilateral corticospinal tract caudal to the pyramidal decussation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–11\\]</u>. Dhamoon et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u> described that the regional perfusion failure of the corticospinal tract caudal to the pyramidal decussation might be the result of a hemodynamic mechanism, because this area might be a junctional zone between the anterior and posterior spinal artery and between the vertebral and spinal artery supplied. Whereas, regarding the etiology of Opalski’s syndrome, the vertebral artery occlusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u> and infarction of the medullary penetrating artery arising from the vertebral artery or anterior spinal artery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> were also speculated.\n\n【10】Although the somatotopic arrangements of the corticospinal tract in the human brain have been generally elucidated, very little is known about the somatotopy in the medulla oblongata 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. In 2011, based on the diffusion tensor tractography analysis, Kwon et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> reported that the hand somatotopy of the corticospinal tract was located at the medial portion of the medullary pyramid, in contrast, the leg somatotopy occupied its lateral portion. However, the somatotopic arrangements of the corticospinal tract in the lower medulla oblongata remain unclear.\n\n【11】To date, there was only one reported case of LMI with ipsilateral monoparesis of the leg 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated infarction of the medullary penetrating artery secondary to vertebral artery dissection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Therefore, Liu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> speculated that the corticospinal tract fibers innervating the lower and upper extremities decussate at different levels. Furthermore, vertigo, nystagmus, Horner’s syndrome, ataxia in the upper extremity, and alternating hypalgesia were observed in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Whereas, in our present patient, though cranial magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated an absence of flow of the left vertebral artery, cranial magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated that a very small infarct lesion in the lower lateral medulla oblongata on the left side. Therefore, we believed that the corticospinal tract caudal to the pyramidal decussation might be involved by atherothrombotic infarction of the medullary penetrating artery or hemodynamic mechanism due to congenital hypoplasia of the left vertebral artery. Regarding the etiology of unilateral leg weakness due to ipsilateral LMI, we agree with Liu and colleagues’ hypothesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> that the corticospinal tract fibers innervating the lower and upper extremities decussate at different levels in the lower medulla oblongata.

Introduction\n\n【3】The utilization of crack cocaine is increasing around the world because this drug is inexpensive and possible to smoke. The crack cocaine can cause serious clinical complications during intoxication.

Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 19-year-old man ingested large amount of crack cocaine in a suicide attempt. He arrived in the emergency department unconscious and was intubated. After this, he had a cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation reversed with defibrillation. Repeated seizures were observed, and benzodiazepines were administered.\n\n【8】Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, prolonged PR and QTc interval (510 ms), widening of the QRS complex (200 ms), and increase in R wave amplitude in aVR (8.0 mV) and right ward of the terminal 40 ms (T40 ms) axis deviation in the frontal plane (210°), Figure 1(a). Blood tests showed combined metabolic and respiratory acidosis (blood pH: 7.10) without other electrolytes disturbances.\n\n【9】(a)\n\n【10】(b)\n\n【11】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| The electrocardiogram (ECG) observed in a 19-year-old man that ingested large amount of crack cocaine (±40 grams) in a suicide attempt. The ECG showed sinus tachycardia with significant widening of QRS (200 ms), significant increase in R wave amplitude in aVR (8.0 mV), QTc interval prolongation (510 ms), and right-axis deviation of the terminal 40 ms vector of the QRS complex in the frontal plane (210°) during the initial evaluation (a), and gradual decrease in QRS duration (100 ms), in R wave amplitude in aVR (4.0 mV), in the QTc interval (428 ms), and in right-axis deviation of the terminal 40 ms vector of the QRS complex in the frontal plane (150°) after intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion (b). |\n| --- |\n\n【14】Gradual decreases in QRS duration (100 ms), in QTc interval (428 ms), in R wave amplitude in aVR (4.0 mV), and in the T40 ms axis deviation (150°) were observed after intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion in a dose of 250 mL × 8.4% and improved ventilation (blood pH: 7.40), Figure 1(b).\n\n【15】Toxicology screen was positive only for cocaine. Myocardial infarction and any structural cardiac involvement were ruled out because there was no electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemic injury, the dosage of troponin I was only slightly elevated, and the echocardiography was normal. He was discharged without neurological disabilities, and the electrocardiogram was normal.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】We described a case of severe crack cocaine overdose with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and repeated seizures in which an interesting electrocardiographic pattern similar to that found in tricyclic antidepressant poisoning was observed, and these alterations were completely reversed through the acidosis correction.\n\n【18】The classical electrocardiographic abnormalities observed in acute poisoning by tricyclic antidepressant are the widening of QRS; the increase in R wave amplitude in aVR, the QTc interval prolongation, the right-axis deviation of the terminal 40 ms vector of the QRS complex in the frontal plane, and the Brugada-like pattern. Many studies showed that these alterations can help identify patients with high risk of arrhythmia and seizure, mainly the prolongation of the QRS duration >100 ms. This last alteration predicts a higher risk of complications and is used as a formal indication for systemic sodium bicarbonate administration in many medical services 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【19】There are many descriptions of reversal of these electrocardiographic alterations through intravenous sodium bicarbonate infusion during tricyclic antidepressant intoxication, and it is recognized as a standard treatment in this condition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. These electrocardiographic abnormalities are caused mainly by blocking the fast sodium channels; this effect is called “quinidine-like” because it is similar to that caused by the type I antidysrhythmic drugs.\n\n【20】The crack cocaine form is manufactured by processing the cocaine with ammonia or sodium bicarbonate to remove the hydrochloride, and in this way it is heat stable which allows it to be smoked 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In our case, the patient used this drug in an unusual manner, because he ingested orally the crack cocaine in a suicide attempt.\n\n【21】Cocaine can block the fast sodium channels and theoretically trigger similar abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this case, the electrocardiographic alterations are probably due to potent sodium channel blockage slowing the cardiac conduction. Although cocaine can block other channels, like the potassium channel, this action is secondary during the clinical presentation, and this drug has a biphasic effect on cardiac repolarization causing a prolongation of the repolarization in a low concentration and a shortening of the repolarization in a high concentration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In our case, the patient ingested a large amount of cocaine, and we observed QTc interval prolongation; however, only the QRS prolongation caused by the sodium blockage was responsible for this alteration, since the JT interval was normal (280 ms) and remained unchanged after bicarbonate administration.\n\n【22】There are many descriptions of cocaine-related sudden death, but the majority of these patients die before arriving at the hospital, and the mechanisms responsible for these deaths are unclear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Ventricular arrhythmias as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation induced by the cocaine may be responsible for it; in our case ventricular fibrillation was observed which was promptly reversed by defibrillation. Wang described one case of a 25-year-old man with cardiac arrest resuscitated with epinephrine after the ingestion of crack cocaine who presented electrocardiographic alterations similar to those showed here that improved after sodium bicarbonate infusion; however, in this case arrhythmias and seizure were not described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【23】These life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias can be precipitated due to myocardial infarction or ischemia induced by the cocaine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>; but in our case, alterations compatible with acute coronary syndrome were not observed, and echocardiography was normal. Therefore, these alterations appear to be a direct local effect of the cocaine on the heart.\n\n【24】Acidosis can increase the toxic effect of the cocaine on the heart in that it increases the sodium channel blocking degree and decreases the conduction between the gap junctions, and, because of this, the acidosis correction is an important goal in the treatment of these patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Some reports have described the treatment of cocaine-induced arrhythmias with the administration of sodium bicarbonate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Jonsson et al. described an interesting case of cocaine overdose complicated by epileptics status, accelerated idioventricular rhythm associated with metabolic acidosis, and this arrhythmia was abated through the correction of the acidosis with bicarbonate infusion and ventilation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Kerns et al. reported three cases of cocaine overdose with wide complex tachycardia; in one of these cases the rhythm disturbance resolved without direct treatment, but in the other two cases this arrhythmia resolved after intravenous bicarbonate infusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【26】In our case, the cocaine-induced electrocardiographic alterations were reversed through the acidosis correction by sodium bicarbonate intravenous infusion and improved ventilation. Tricyclic antidepressant intoxication was actively ruled out in this case through the negative blood dosage.\n\n【27】There are some descriptions of transient Brugada-like pattern after cocaine and tricyclic antidepressant intoxication which is defined by right bundle branch block associated with coved ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2. In our case, we observed important alterations in cardiac conduction but not the Brugada-like pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Postresuscitative effects on the heart might have been responsible for some of these alterations, although this electrocardiographic pattern is not commonly observed in other situations of cardiac arrest, and in this case the patient was promptly resuscitated because the cardiac arrest happened during the initial medical evaluation.\n\n【29】The prevalence and prognostic of these electrocardiographic changes during cocaine overdose are unknown, but they could help identify patients at high risk of complications during this clinical setting, and the physicians need to suspect crack cocaine overdose in unconscious patients admitted to the hospital with electrocardiogram pattern compatible with sodium channel blocking.\n\n【30】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】The crack cocaine can induce an electrocardiographic pattern similar to that observed in acute poisoning by tricyclic antidepressants which is reversed by sodium bicarbonate infusion. These alterations may help identify patients at high risk of ventricular arrhythmia and seizure during crack cocaine overdose.\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no financial disclose do declare and no conflict of interests to report.

In particular, CDHs are accompanied by high mortality and marked disability later in life due to concomitant morbidity (i.e. caused by pulmonary lung hypoplasia and persisting pulmonary hypertension of neonates) and require long-lasting neonatal treatment in an intensive care unit. Late-diagnosed CDHs are extremely rare and always show small defects that justify a better prognosis than CDHs with large defects. In most cases, such CDHs go undiagnosed due to their mild, delayed symptoms. In the case described here, an 18-year-old Asian male presented with abdominal pain and a bowel contour in the epigastric region and left upper quadrant. A chest X-ray and thoracoabdominal computerized tomography scan confirmed the diagnosis of bowel obstruction due to a left diaphragmatic hernia. Moreover, a defect was revealed in the posterolateral left diaphragm, and the transverse colon, spleen, and half of the stomach had herniated through it. A segmentectomy was performed on the transverse colon, followed by an end-to-end anastomosis, a diaphragmatic plasty, and the placement of an intrapleural catheter. In conclusion, diagnosing a diaphragmatic hernia before surgery can be difficult due to its rarity and wide range of symptoms. Although prenatal diagnosis using ultrasonography is possible in up to 80% of fetuses, that method may not be available in all regions in Indonesia or in all countries, where doctors thus continue to face a diagnostic challenge when dealing with CDHs.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is defined by an abnormality in the diaphragm that causes the contents of the abdomen to protrude into the thoracic cavity, thereby impairing lung development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. CDH is one of the most serious neonatal abnormalities and has a prevalence of one in every 3000 live newborns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This type of hernia is found on the right side of the body in 15–20% of CDH cases and on the left side in 80–85% of cases. Occurrence on both sides of the diaphragm is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Approximately 55–67% of patients with CDH survive 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】CDH includes Bochdalek hernias (BHs) (70%), which are present in the posterior-lateral diaphragm, and Morgagni hernias (25–35%), which occur in the anterior or central diaphragm (2–5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Because BH is common in newborns and toddlers and not in adults, diagnosing this type of hernia is difficult, especially because most patients are unaware of it due to the mild delayed symptoms of CDH 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】We herein report an uncommon case in which an adult male was suffering from a left-sided strangulated CDH of Bochdalek’s type, presenting with intermittent abdominal pain.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【7】An 18-year-old Asian male with a two-day history of sharp and intermittent pain on the left side of his abdomen presented to the emergency department (ED). The pain decreased while lying down and increased while eating. The patient was treated in the ED for three hours. Despite being treated with a strong opioid analgesic (fentanyl), the pain worsened, so he was referred to the surgery department for a consultation. The patient had a history of recurrent pneumonia as a toddler, and he reported experiencing tightness in the chest after eating over the previous 12-month period. This patient had no prior surgeries or trauma, did not drink alcohol, and smoked one pack of cigarettes daily.\n\n【8】The patient complained of an inability to pass flatus or stool for 2 days. He was alert, and his vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg; a temperature of 36.5°C; a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute; a heart rate of 108 beats per minute; and a Karnofsky score of 80. On auscultation of the right and left hemithorax, the patient’s breath sounds were normal. The patient’s abdominal examination showed a bowel contour in the epigastric region and left upper quadrant (LUQ) , and, on auscultation, bowel sounds were increased. An empty rectal vault was found after a digital rectal examination.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】Physical examination showing bowel contour in the epigastric region and LUQ.\n\n【11】The left hemidiaphragm was elevated, and there was minimal pleural effusion evident in the posteroanterior view chest X-ray. The three-view abdominal radiograph series showed that the left hemidiaphragm was filled with gas, distended, and elevated. The thoracoabdominal computerized tomography (CT) scan without contrast showed a left-sided diaphragmatic defect with herniation of the bowel into the thoracic cavity . Laboratory findings showed slightly elevated leukocyte levels at 12.9 × 103/mL (normal values are 4.0–10.0 × 103/mL), and the results from blood gas analysis were within the normal range. Therefore, we diagnosed the patient with a bowel obstruction caused by a left diaphragmatic hernia.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【13】The thoracoabdominal CT scan without contrast showing a left-sided diaphragmatic defect (indicated by the white arrow) with herniation of the bowel into the thorax cavity (coronal view).\n\n【14】After this, we performed an exploratory laparotomy via a midline incision, wherein the colon ascendens and colon transversum appeared extremely dilated. An obstruction was observed on the colon ascendens and a small part of the colon transversum. There was an 8 cm defect in the posterolateral left diaphragm, through which the colon transversum, spleen, and half of the stomach had herniated (Figure 3(a)). The colon transversum was completely necrotic (Figure 3(b)), and 200 ml of serohemorrhagic fluid drained from the thorax cavity. A segmentectomy on the colon transversum, an end-to-end anastomosis, and diaphragmatic plasty using a non-absorbable monofilament were performed, after which we inserted an intrapleural catheter. The left lung was fully inflated in the postoperative chest X-ray. The patient made a full recovery and was discharged 6 days later.\n\n【15】(a)\n\n【16】(b)\n\n【17】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【19】(a) The 8 cm defect in the posterolateral left diaphragm (indicated by the arrow), through which the colon transversum, spleen, and half of the stomach had herniated.

A BH is a defect that occurs at the posterior aspect of the diaphragm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Adults with BH are extremely rare, accounting for approximately 0.17–6.0% of all diaphragmatic hernias diagnosed. The defect is seen on the left side in 85% of BH cases, on the right side in roughly 10% of cases, and bilaterally in approximately 5% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【22】The etiology of CDH is mostly unknown, but it is currently assumed to be multifactorial. The majority of instances demonstrate a single diaphragmatic abnormality manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia and persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns. CDH is related to genitourinary, cardiac, and gastrointestinal abnormalities as well as chromosomal aneuploidy, such as trisomies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A global collaborative effort found that a variety of possible genes and environmental factors play a role in the development of CDH in children. Despite being located on distinct chromosomes, the majority of the genes are known to be linked to the retinoic acid pathway. Interference with the enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (RALDH2) at a vital moment in retinoic acid metabolism is a crucial step in the most widely used animal model of CDH (the nitrofen rodent model), particularly experimental models 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【23】There are two common clinical presentations of adult CDH: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> incidental detection during X-rays for symptoms unrelated to the diaphragmatic hernia or 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> symptoms that arise from a visceral rupture within the chest cavity, followed by organ strangulation and incarceration. Symptoms vary depending on which organ is affected: vomiting, dysphagia, and intermittent abdominal pain are common digestive symptoms, while chest pain and dyspnea are common respiratory symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Patients with a BH experience stomach pains more frequently, and patients with a Morgagni hernia experience these symptoms less frequently. Respiratory symptoms are significantly more frequent in patients with a Morgagni hernia. The stomach, small intestine, and spleen are the most commonly displaced organs in a BH, followed by the omentum, transverse colon, and descending colon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In this case, the transverse colon, spleen, and half of the stomach had herniated, and the patient had intermittent abdominal pain.\n\n【24】A chest X-ray and barium assays were used to make the diagnosis. Organs, fluid, and air can be seen in the chest above the diaphragm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The best technique for diagnosis is a CT scan, which provides the unique ability to assess the presence, location, and size of a defect and even allows examining the contents of distinct forms of diaphragmatic hernias. MRI is also beneficial but is frequently unavailable in an emergency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Perrone et al. assert in a systematic review that surgery is the preferred treatment and that the preoperative context has a significant impact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The surgical treatment for this disease is determined by the occurrence of visceral complications. Most studies suggest using the thoracic approach in an elective setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, the abdominal approach is preferred in an emergency setting when a visceral abdominal lesion (including perforation of abdominal viscera, obstruction, malrotation, and strangulation) is difficult to identify and there are septic complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 13\\]</u>. We decided on the abdominal approach for this case because it was an emergency.\n\n【26】Due to recent advancements, minimally invasive techniques (thoracoscopy and laparoscopy) have become more feasible and safer, resulting in shorter hospital stays and decreased morbidity rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 11, 14\\]</u>. Brungardt et al. reported postoperative morbidity rates in patients undergoing CDH repair and concluded that outcomes are similar regardless of whether patients undergo an open or minimally invasive technique 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Compared to other congenital anomalies worldwide, the CDH mortality rate is high; the rates in Costa Rica and South America are 54.8% and 56.7%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. According to a recent study by the CDH Study Group, the size of the diaphragmatic defect is the most important factor impacting the prognosis of newborns with CDH, and it is also related to a greater mortality rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. The size of the defect is also the most likely predictor of the severity of the pulmonary hypoplasia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u> and the incidence of associated anomalies, such as neurodevelopmental delay 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>, cerebral palsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>, cardiovascular malformations, the number of abnormal organ systems, chromosomal aberrations, and frequent occurrence of liver in the chest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【28】In conclusion, definitive diagnosis of a diaphragmatic hernia before surgery is difficult because it is rare and has a variety of symptoms. X-rays and CT scans are helpful in detecting CDH. Prenatal diagnosis using ultrasonography is possible in up to 80% of fetuses, and that method may not be available in all regions in Indonesia or in all countries, where doctors thus continue to face a diagnostic challenge when dealing with CDHs.\n\n【29】#### Data Availability\n\n【30】The data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【31】#### Consent\n\n【32】Written informed consent for publication was obtained from the patient.\n\n【33】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【34】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this article.\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【36】通用结尾删除-1:<u>We would like to express our appreciation to Bayu Satria MD for his help in providing us with the linguistic assistance for this case report, the emergency room team (Achsan A.

Typically, these patients have evident risk factors including, but not limited to, prior abdominal surgery, personal or family history of gastrointestinal disorders, femoral and inguinal hernias, or neoplasm. In this case, we describe an SBO in a female, professional athlete whose swift, severe symptom onset, rapid resolution with conservative treatment, lack of identifiable risk factors, and prompt return to high level competition without recurrence are certainly unique. A female professional basketball player in her mid-20’s with no past medical history presented with a seven-hour history of worsening abdominal pain beginning in the epigastric region and migrating to the right lower quadrant. Physical exam did not reveal abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, or high-pitched bowel sounds. Initial differential diagnosis included appendicitis, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and other genitourinary pathology. Computed tomography with contrast revealed distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, and decompressed loops of bowel distally, consistent with an SBO. Symptoms resolved after 24 hours with conservative treatment, including decompression with a nasogastric tube. The athlete returned to full participation five days after initial presentation without recurrence of symptoms. Outpatient gastroenterology workup was negative for predisposing conditions. This presentation is rare in the absence of bowel pathology, family history, or prior abdominal surgery. Perhaps, her profession as an athlete, with frequent air travel and extensive exercise, may have contributed to this unique presentation. This case report should serve as a reminder to all providers that SBOs can occur in young, active patients devoid of risk factors. Even in the absence of typical signs on physical examination, providers should use imaging as adjuncts based on their clinical gestalt and utilize conservative management, when appropriate, to maximize chances of recovery with minimal morbidity.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Small bowel obstructions (SBO) occur when a functional or mechanical blockade impairs the transit of chyme, and later air, through the intestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. There are many known risk factors that contribute to the development of an SBO, which include, but are not limited to, prior abdominal surgery, personal or family history of inflammatory bowel disease, personal history of neoplasm, femoral and inguinal hernias, or gastrointestinal motility disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In the absence of these risk factors, idiopathic SBOs rarely occur in the young, athletic population, possibly because of regular exercise habits. Moderate exercise has been proven to accelerate transit of chyme, feces, and gas within the intestines, thereby reducing the likelihood of SBO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. This case is unique in that the patient’s presentation was more typical of appendicitis or a gynecologic pathology; thus, SBO was not suspected until computed tomography (CT) revealed a transition point and bowel wall edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Given that this diagnosis is so uncommon in this population, there is a paucity of data stating when it is safe to return to athletic competition after SBO. Therefore, the medical team used the athlete’s symptoms as the guide in return to play decisions, and she was able to return to full participation five days after presentation without recurrence of symptoms.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A female professional basketball player in her mid-20’s presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with a seven-hour history of worsening, sharp abdominal pain. Her pain, reported 7 out of 10 on the numeric rating scale (NRS) and exacerbated by movement with no alleviating factors, began in the epigastric region and migrated to the right lower quadrant. The patient experienced worsening nausea and emesis in the ED, warranting administration of 4 milligrams (mg) of intravenous (IV) ondansetron (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) and infusion of a one liter (L) lactated ringer bolus. Review of systems was negative for diarrhea, constipation, fever, chills, dysuria, or vaginal discharge. The patient had only consumed self-prepared food for the past day and had no recent changes to her diet, sick contacts, or recent illnesses. She had never experienced pain like this previously. Her housemates and close contacts had no similar symptoms. The patient reported a low likelihood of pregnancy, and her last menstrual period was within the last month. She also reported no personal or family history of gastrointestinal disorders, prior pregnancies, or abdominal surgery. At the time of presentation, she denied any prior or current use of medications, alcohol, tobacco, or recreational drugs.\n\n【6】The patient’s initial vital signs were a temperature of 36.8 degree Celsius (°C), blood pressure of 131/65 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate of 60 beats per minute (bpm), respiratory rate of 16 per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. She was in apparent discomfort, clutching her abdomen. Her physical exam revealed a nondistended abdomen with normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Tenderness to light and deep palpation in the right lower quadrant was apparent, but there was no guarding, rebound, or tympany to percussion on initial examination.\n\n【7】Initial workup included a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC), and lipase, which were all within normal limits. A serum pregnancy test was negative. Urinalysis (UA) was only significant for trace ketones. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast revealed distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, and decompressed loops of bowel distally. Fecalization of the small bowel was also apparent . The preliminary diagnosis was an acute SBO. Within the ED, conservative treatment was initiated including administration of cefazolin (GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) 1 gram (g) IV every 8 hours, maintenance of IV fluids at a rate of 125 milliliters per hour (mL/hr), placement of a nasogastric tube, and initiation of nil per os (NPO). The patient was admitted to the general surgery service. The timeline of events is illustrated in Figure 2.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast showing distended loops of small bowel with wall thickening, enhancement, decompressed loops of bowel distally, and fecalization of small bowel.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【11】Timeline of symptom onset through hospital discharge. Day 0 represents symptom onset. Each event on timeline has time of occurrence listed in military time. SBFT, small bowel follow-through; WNL, within normal limits; US, ultrasound; GI, gastrointestinal; CT, computed tomography; A/P, abdomen and pelvis; SBO, small bowel obstruction; NPO, nil per os; NGT, nasogastric tube; mIVF, maintenance intravenous fluids; LR, lactated ringers solution; CMP, comprehensive metabolic panel; CBC, complete blood count; beta-HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; ED, emergency department; CLD, clear liquid diet; CRP, C-reactive protein; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate.\n\n【12】The general surgery team was concerned for a concurrent process, specifically appendicitis, because the appendix was not well evaluated on CT. Additionally, they wanted to assess the severity of the SBO; thus, a transabdominal pelvic ultrasound (US) and a small bowel follow-through (SBFT) were ordered, respectively. The US was only significant for trace free fluid in the Pouch of Douglas, and the SBFT showed resolution of the SBO at 12 hours after admission . At this point, a clear liquid diet was added, and gastroenterology (GI) was consulted to rule out inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as the cause of the acute SBO which resolved rapidly. The GI consultants progressed the patient to a soft diet since she had a nonbloody, well-formed bowel movement and ordered a serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), both of which were within normal limits. Thus, it was decided to follow up with GI as an outpatient for further workup. At the time of discharge, the patient was pain free, tolerating regular diet, and passing stool and flatus. At four days after presentation, the athlete’s team physician allowed her to resume light jogging and shooting, followed by a full practice with her teammates later in the day. That same day, she flew with her teammates to the city of their next game. At five days after presentation, the athlete competed in a game and remained symptom-free. The patient was seen by GI seven days after presentation at which point magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) was ordered . The MRE showed no dilation, thickening, or enhancement of the bowel. These findings, coupled with her prior normal CRP and ESR, resulted in low suspicion for an underlying diagnosis of IBD, which would have been a potential predisposing condition for SBO. No other risk factors for SBO were ever identified so the patient’s etiology remains idiopathic. Now, one year later, the patient remains without recurrence.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【14】Upper gastrointestinal study with small bowel follow-through revealing no acute obstruction (radiographic images taken in series and are exhibited chronologically from 1–4.).\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【16】Chronologic depiction of return to play (RTP) and outpatient follow-up with days calculated since the time of symptom onset defined as day 0.

Discussion\n\n【18】Annually, there are 579–654 SBOs per 100,000 people, leading to over 300,000 surgeries in the United States 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, it is atypical for a young, healthy, elite female athlete without a history of abdominal surgery or IBD to present with an SBO. In this population, abdominal pain is more frequently attributed to appendicitis, ovarian torsion, acute gastroenteritis, or IBD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In the “virgin abdomen, ” defined as having no prior abdominal surgery, Beardsley et al. found adhesions to be the primary cause of SBO when diagnosed by CT and confirmed with laparoscopy; however, in this cohort, CT was only 52.9% accurate, and patients were subjected to unnecessary laparoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Furthermore, Colon et al. reported that presence of a transition zone on CT does not correlate with the need for surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Therefore, the literature supports the decision to care for this patient nonoperatively given her stable appearance, reassuring vital signs, inherent risks of surgical intervention, and high likelihood of the SBO resolving with conservative therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite the inherent limitations of imaging, CT remains the gold standard for workup of presumed SBO since definitive diagnosis with direct visualization via laparoscopy confers the common surgical risks of bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Because this patient lacked the classical findings of abdominal distension, tympany to percussion, and high-pitched bowel sounds, the diagnosis could have been missed if diagnostic imaging had not been pursued 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Despite previous reports that 13% of SBOs do not have identifiable etiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, it is important to be aware of unusual causes of SBO which may not be considered in the initial differential diagnosis and may require specific work up 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Bezoars, or concretions, are undigested material within the alimentary tract which can cause an SBO resulting in nonspecific symptoms similar to those appreciated in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. There are multiple types of bezoars, including: food bolus bezoars, phytobezoars, and trichobezoars 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Food bolus bezoars can stem from simple origins such as incomplete mastication, rapid deglutition, and consuming large nuts or pits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Perhaps, an athlete in a rush may eat quickly and inadvertently increase the risk of a food bolus bezoar. Phytobezoars are primarily composed of undigestible plant fibers and seeds, and as such, a vegetarian diet may increase the patient's risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. Trichobezoars are composed of undigested hair and are most frequently associated with trichotillomania with trichophagia. Trichobezoars can be seen in this patient’s age group and should be considered as a possible etiology of SBO 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. An extremely thorough clinician would be required to unmask these potential SBO etiologies via in-depth history and exam to uncover eating habits and areas of alopecia; however, in the ED setting, these questions are unlikely to arise. Furthermore, in a retrospective case series, CT scan was only 47% effective in identifying bezoars, so imaging alone cannot be depended upon to reach the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Thus, a high index of suspicion, coupled with history, physical, and diagnostic testing, is necessary to tailor treatment given that few bezoars will pass spontaneously and instead require endoscopic or open surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 18\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Intense physical activity can be another uncommon etiology of SBO. As aforementioned, studies suggest an inverse relationship exists between exercise and gastrointestinal disease with mild to moderate activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Despite this suggestion, de Oliveira and Burini caution that strenuous exercise coupled with dehydration exacerbates the risk of gastrointestinal symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Additionally, van Nieuwenhoven et al. hypothesized that running decreases small bowel transit time and blood flow, thereby increasing SBO risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Therefore, exercise serves both as a preventive measure for long-term GI disease, but in strenuous conditions, may potentiate acute illness.\n\n【22】The list of uncommon etiologies continues with researchers such as Massalou et al. suggesting that even recent air travel may contribute to SBO due to the threat barometric changes pose to hollow viscera. This likens the risk of SBO to the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pneumothorax associated with flight 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Although many of the aforementioned etiologies are speculative, careful consideration and awareness of the possibilities helps physicians to make sound medical decisions and tailor the treatment plan to the patient’s unique presentation and risk factors.\n\n【23】Though definitive diagnosis of an SBO necessitates direct visualization via laparoscopy, history, physical examination, and CT were sufficient to suggest the diagnosis of an SBO in this case. Conservative management was successful, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgical risks. Furthermore, the patient was able to return to play more quickly because there was no surgical intervention. Given her comprehensive outpatient workup which failed to reveal any predisposing factors for her SBO, the exact etiology of the SBO remains unknown. This case highlights the importance of clinical acumen and utilization of adjunctive tests, specifically imaging, to render diagnoses and provide treatment suited to the patient’s lifestyle. It also illustrates diagnostic challenges that may come from intrinsic difficulties of patient history taking. In order to identify a rare etiology for an SBO, a physician must be aware of the numerous possibilities and explore them thoroughly with the patient. Furthermore, this patient’s case is unique in that she experienced full resolution of the SBO within twelve hours and returned to elite competition five days after initial presentation, despite the absence of clear recommendations within the literature regarding the timing of safe to return to play after an acute SBO.\n\n【24】#### Data Availability\n\n【25】For further questions related to the content of this case report, the readers can contact the corresponding author.\n\n【26】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【27】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors are grateful to their patient for her written permission to use this case report for the advancement of science and patient care.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of bone are known for their local aggressiveness and high recurrence rate. There are rare cases of multicentric GCT and most are synchronous. We herein review metachronous multicentric GCT reported in the literature. Material and Methods. A MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Google Scholar search was done to collect all cases of multicentric metachronous GCT specifying the clinical, radiological, and histological characteristics of each location and its treatment. Results. A total of 37 multifocal giant cell tumors were found in the literature. 68% of cases of multicentric giant cell tumors occur in less than 4 years following treatment of the first lesion. Thirty-seven cases of multifocal metachronous GCT were identified in the literature until 2012. Patients with multicentric GCT tend to be younger averaging 23. There is a slight female predominance in metachronous GCT. The most common site of the primary GCT is around the knee followed by wrist and hand and feet. Recurrence rate of multicentric GCT is 28.5%. Conclusion. Multicentric giant cell tumor is rare. The correct diagnosis relies on correlation of clinical and radiographic findings with confirmation of the diagnosis by histopathologic examination.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Giant cell tumors (GCTs) of bone are known for their local aggressiveness and high recurrence rate. Patients with GCT present with nonspecific symptoms including pain, overlying soft-tissue swelling, and decreased range of motion at the adjacent joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】They rarely metastasize to distant structures such as the lung, although these metastases generally have the same benign histologic appearance as the index tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Even rarer are cases of multicentric giant cell tumor. Most multicentric giant cell tumors are synchronous, that is, occurring within a poorly defined time of the initial tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【5】In this paper, we present the case of a metachronous giant cell tumor as well as a review of the literature of metachronous multicentric giant cell tumor.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】An 18-year-old female presented to our institution with inflammatory right elbow pain and elbow stiffness. X-rays showed a lucent image on the medial aspect of the right distal humeral metaphysis with a radiologically intact cortex . Histological diagnosis of GCT was made on open biopsy. Extensive curettage was undertaken, phenol was applied on the walls of the remaining cavity as well as high-speed burring, and the cavity was filled with methyl methacrylate, with a satisfying result.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| AP view of the elbow with radiolucent lesion of the medial condyle. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】Four years later, X-rays showed involvement of the lateral condyle and MRI articular involvement. The diagnosis of recurrent GCT was confirmed on biopsy. A total marginal excision of the elbow joint was undertaken along with prosthetic elbow arthroplasty. Three years following the surgery, the patient was free of tumor and pain but had an unstable elbow due to prosthetic dislocation, but she said that she was satisfied with the result and refused revision surgery.\n\n【11】She was then lost to followup and came back only 7 years later, at the age of 32, after a fall from the stairs with pain around the left hip persisting for several weeks despite a regular use of anti-inflammatories and pain killers. Pelvic radiographs showed a lucent lesion of the left iliac bone (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)). MRI showed active lytic process occupying the left iliac wing without cortical or joint involvement. PET-CT scan showed a high uptake of left iliac wing (6.8 SUV uptake) with no other involvement sites. Parathyroid hormone levels were normal. Biopsy confirmed GCT. She was operated on with curettage, application of phenol and alcohol, and methyl methacrylate. Followup after two years was clinically and radiologically unremarkable and a chest CT scan one year later showed no lung metastases.\n\n【12】(a)\n\n【13】(b)\n\n【14】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| AP view of the pelvis showing a lucent lesion of the supra-acetabular area of the left iliac bone. |\n| --- |\n\n【17】#### 3\\.

The first distinction between synchronous and metachronous GCT was provided by Park et al. who defined a metachronous GCT as a GCT with 2 or more locations separated by more than 6 months in presentation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Clinical characteristics of each case, involvement sites, radiographic findings, treatment modalities, and recurrences were recorded .\n\n【19】Table 1 \n\n【20】Analysis of all metachronous multicentric GCT.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Results \n\n【22】A total of 37 cases of multifocal metachronous GCT were identified until 2012. There were 15 (40%) male and 22 (60%) female patients. Average age at diagnosis of the first GCT was 23 years.\n\n【23】The site of first involvement was in the upper extremity in 16 cases: 4 in the distal ulna, 4 in the distal radius, 5 in the humerus (4 proximal and 1 distal), and 3 in the hand, and in the lower extremity in 19 patients: 7 in the distal femur, 7 in the proximal tibia, 3 in the proximal fibula, and 2 in the foot. One patient had the first tumor in the pelvis and another one in the sphenoidal bone.\n\n【24】For the 2nd metachronous location of the GCT, 12 cases were in the upper limb: 7 in the humerus (4 proximal and 3 distal), 2 in the radius (1 proximal and 1 distal), 2 in the proximal ulna, and 1 in the hand. 11 cases were in the lower limb: 3 in the femur (1 proximal and 2 distal), 6 in the tibia (6 proximal and 1 distal), and 1 in the foot. In 7 metachronous tumors, the second location was in the trunk: 1 in the spine, 4 in the pelvis, and 2 in the skull. There were 7 metachronous GCTs in 2 or more locations: 1 in the proximal tibia and acetabulum, 1 in the ipsilateral proximal femur and proximal tibia, 1 in the ipsilateral proximal femur and fibula, 1 in the distal tibia and sacrum, 1 in the left proximal femur and right iliac wing, 1 in right foot, left fibula, right radius, and lung, and 1 in the pelvis, skull, and lung.\n\n【25】There was a 3rd metachronous location of the GCT in 11 patients (30%) and a 4th one in 2 patients (5%). 11 patients (28.5%) had a recurrence of their initial GCT at the same location. The mean duration separating the 2 locations of the metachronous multifocal tumors was 74.5 months.\n\n【26】The treatment used for the first location(s) of the GCT was resection of the tumor in 11 cases (29.7%), curettage with bone graft in 16 patients (43.6%), curettage alone in 1 patient (2.7%), curettage with PMMA in 2 patients (5.4%), curettage with cryotherapy in 1 patient (2.7%), amputation in 3 cases (8.1%), radiotherapy in 2 cases (5.4%), and unknown in 1 case (2.7%).\n\n【27】On an average 73-month followup, 20 patients (54%) suffering from multifocal metachronous GCT were disease-free, 8 patients (22%) still had a tumor in 1 or more locations but were asymptomatic, 2 patients (5%) died from the disease and its complications, and 7 patients (19%) were lost to followup.\n\n【28】Overall, 3 patients had metastases in the lung at the final followup: 2 as a second location and 1 as a 4th location. The 3 patients died from this complication. The mean lapse of time between the first and second locations of the GCT is 10 months.\n\n【29】#### 5\\. Discussion\n\n【30】Giant cell tumors are typically lesions of young and middle-aged adults, with 80% of tumors occurring in patients between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and a peak prevalence in the third decade of life. They account for 4% to 5% of primary bone tumors. Multifocal GCTs are rare. Approximately 1% of cases present as multiple synchronous or metachronous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Most multifocal GCTs are synchronous and 68% of cases of multicentric giant cell tumor occur in less than 4 years from the initial lesion treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. They have a more aggressive course, including an increased incidence of pathologic fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【31】There is a slight female predominance in metachronous GCT (57% versus 43%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> but not a 2 : 1 ratio as reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. We have found a 3 : 2 female : male ratio in this study. GCT occurs between the 3rd and 5th decades of life and >80% of patients are more than 25 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 23\\]</u>. However, patients with multicentric GCT tend to be younger averaging 23 with more than 70% aged 25 years old or younger at the time of initial diagnosis. The youngest patient reported with multicentric is 10 years old 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The etiology of multifocal GCT is unclear: de novo formation or a metastatic phenomenon. Solitary benign GCTs may metastasize to the lung or undergo malignant transformation (either de novo or following irradiation); however, pathologic analysis of multifocal GCT reveals findings identical to histologically benign solitary tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This suggests that the multifocality of some GCT is not a metastatic phenomenon but rather represents the separate development of the tumor at multiple sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Iatrogenic seeding may represent a cause of multicentric giant cell tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【33】The most common site of the primary GCT is around the knee (44%), followed by wrist (23%) and hand and feet (13%), and is consistent with localization of solitary GCT. Diaphyseal involvement is more found in multifocal than in solitary GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Some studies suggested that GCTs of hand and feet are more likely to have a more aggressive course (17% in multicentric GCT compared to 2% in solitary GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>). They recommended a skeletal survey for these tumors as well as multiple followups to detect metachronous GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Recurrence rate of multicentric GCT is 28.5% and is comparable to the 35% recurrence rate of solitary GCT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 23\\]</u>. Pulmonary metastasis in solitary GCT occurs in less than 2% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. In multicentric multifocal GCT, it occurs more frequently and averages around 8%.\n\n【35】In general, multicentric giant cell tumor is histologically indistinguishable from solitary giant cell tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 23\\]</u> and has the following characteristics: large vascular lacunae separated by septa in which numerous giant cells are found and filled with clotted blood (blood-filled spaces with bland fibrous connective tissue septa). These cavernous spaces vessels lack walls and normal features of blood vessels and stroma is formed of histiocytes, fibroblasts, scattered giant cells, hemosiderin, and occasional inflammatory cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Differential diagnosis for multicentric giant cell tumors includes brown tumor, Paget’s disease, osteomyelitis, fibrous dysplasia, giant cell reparative granuloma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, osteosarcoma, hematopoietic malignant tumor, and metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 23\\]</u>. Before a diagnosis of multicentric giant cell tumor can be made, it is necessary to rule out the presence of hyperparathyroidism, which can produce features of a polyostotic osteolytic lesion that are virtually identical to those of a giant cell tumor of bone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Limitations to this review are that only case reports are available and many patients were lost to subsequent followup to uniform the population.\n\n【37】#### 6\\. Conclusion\n\n【38】In summary, multicentric giant cell tumor is rare and most commonly affects long bones, particularly those around the knee. It tends to occur in younger patients and frequently manifests as synchronous lesions. In addition, lesions of multicentric giant cell tumor may have an unusual metaphysodiaphyseal location. Virtually all tumors have areas with typical histopathologic features of giant cell tumor. As in solitary giant cell tumor, the most aggressive behavior of the vast majority of multicentric giant cell tumors is local recurrence, especially in multicentric metachronous GCT of hand and feet, although there have been rare cases of metastasis to the lungs. Because a variety of other primary bone lesions may also have a polyostotic presentation, the correct diagnosis relies on correlation of clinical and radiographic findings with confirmation of the diagnosis by histopathologic examination.\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>B.

The histopathological diagnosis was made on a pulmonary wedge resection (performed during video-thoracoscopic surgery).\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH) is a rare, low- to intermediate-grade tumor of endothelial origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> with around 120 cases reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. At the onset, the patients are usually asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms (such as weight loss, fatigue, dyspnoea, cough, and chest pain). Chest imaging usually shows the presence of multiple, bilateral small pulmonary lesions. The diagnosis usually requires a lung biopsy. The treatment is still not standardized. Surgery is suggested in presence of a solitary nodule or few unilateral nodules. Instead if the lesions are unresectable or multiple and bilateral several chemotherapy protocols have been used. The prognosis is variable with a median survival of 4-5 years.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 67-year-old Caucasian man, lifelong nonsmoker, with no prior history of lung diseases, was referred to our university hospital for the presence, in the last 3 months, of exertion dyspnoea (grade 1 according to the Medical Research Council scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>) and dry cough. He had worked as an employee without occupational exposures of clinical relevance. His past medical history was characterized by an herniated lumbar disc, systemic arterial hypertension (treated with calcium blockers), diabetes mellitus (treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents), and polycythemia vera (diagnosed in 2007 and treated from 2008 with hydroxyurea).

Discussion\n\n【35】Pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (PEH) is a rare, low- to intermediate-grade tumor of endothelial origin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Epithelioid hemangioendothelioma can arise from many organs, including lungs, liver, bone, and soft tissue, simultaneously or sequentially. When this occurs, it may be difficult to determinate if the tumor is multicentric from the beginning or there is a primary lesion with metastases to the other tissues 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Around 120 cases have been reported in literature 通用删除8(英):<u>\\[2, Table 2\\]</u>, only five of them were in Italian patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 15–18\\]</u>. Mean (SD) age of patients is 40.1 (17.5) years, and 73% are females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Interestingly, our patient is instead a 67-year-old male. Most patients are asymptomatic at presentation, and some are complaining of weight loss, fatigue, dyspnoea, fever, pleuritic chest pain, mild nonproductive cough, and haemoptysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. In most cases, the physical examination is normal, but few cases of digital clubbing and pleural effusions have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【36】Table 2 \n\n【37】Review of the clinical, radiological and pathological features of the published cases of primary pulmonary epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.\n\n【38】The most characteristic feature of PEH on chest radiographs or CT is the presence of multiple perivascular nodules with well- or ill-defined margins in both lungs. The nodules may range in size up to 2 cm, but most of them are ≤1 cm in diameter; they are usually found near medium-sized vessels and bronchi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This radiological presentation is suggestive of many lung diseases .\n\n【39】Table 3 \n\n【40】Differential diagnosis of multiple pulmonary bilateral nodules.\n\n【41】Some authors consider 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography an important tool for PEH diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>; however, in our patient, the PET was negative, suggesting that a negative PET cannot exclude PEH. Unfortunately, we do not have a molecular explanation for this finding but may be related to a low proliferation rate of the neoplastic cells.\n\n【42】The diagnosis of PEH is made on the basis of the histopathological features and confirmed using immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cell markers, such as against factor VIII-related von Willebrand antigen, CD31 or CD34 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 13, 20, 21\\]</u>.\n\n【43】The prognosis is variable. The 5-year survival is around 60% (range 47–71%). In fact, there are two groups of PEH at the clinical presentation: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> one asymptomatic, with a solitary pulmonary nodule or unilateral multiple nodules. Usually they can be managed with surgery alone, and lymphatic invasion is unlikely. Their prognosis is good with a median survival of more than 10 years; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> another symptomatic group presents with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules or pleural effusion with scarce response to chemotherapy. The prognosis of this group is poor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Most patients die from pulmonary insufficiency as a result of an increasing number of tumor nodules 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Hematogeneous metastases are rare and have been described especially in the liver but also in other sites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【44】The treatment of PEH is not standardized. Surgery alone is indicated in the presence of a single pulmonary nodule or unilateral multiple nodules. Lung transplantation should be considered in patients with vascular infiltration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【45】Various chemotherapies have been reported for unresectable or metastatic PEH, with variable effectiveness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Other authors have suggested a role for the hormonal therapy (antiestrogens and progesterone) in patients with diffuse disease if the neoplastic cells express estrogen and progesterone receptors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. A slight regression of the pulmonary lesions was also obtained with interferon (IFN)-2α, probably for its antiangiogenic activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Thalidomide and IFN-α have also been proposed for unresectable cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Some beneficial results were also obtained with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks human VEGF-A 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22, 25\\]</u>. The neoplastic cells express glucocorticoid receptors and the enzyme 11β\\-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase involved in the synthesis of the steroids, suggesting a potential role for steroid modulators 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【46】In conclusion, we had the opportunity to observe an unusual primary pulmonary hemangioepithelioma in an old male patient, and interestingly, in comparison with the published literature, the neoplastic lesions were PET negative. Again, as previously suggested 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>, we stress the importance of starting an international clinical registry of this unusual neoplasm.\n\n【47】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【48】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Riccardo Cazzuffi and Gaetano Caramori have equally contributed to this work.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 77-year-old woman with a history of interstitial pneumonia and uveitis visited our institution complaining of general fatigue.

Chest CT also revealed a 5.2 cm irregular mass with cavity and speculated margin in right S3 and a 7.6 cm irregular mass with cavity and air bronchogram sign, which are adjacent to the pleural walls ((b) and (c)). |\n| --- |\n\n【12】Her blood pressure was 130/71 mmHg, heart rate was 106 beats/min, body temperature was 36.8°C, and O<sub>2</sub> saturation was 96% in room air. She had a history of smoking 15 cigarettes per day for 55 years but no history of alcohol consumption. On initial clinical examination, her weight was of 50.8 kg, height was 158 cm, body mass index was 20.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and BSA was 150 m<sup>2</sup>. Mild anemia was revealed in the palpebral conjunctiva. No abnormal murmur could be heard on auscultation although dry rales were heard in both lungs.\n\n【13】Laboratory test results demonstrated a markedly elevated white blood cell count (266 × 10<sup>2</sup>/μL; normal: 39–94 × 10<sup>2</sup>/μL) with 81% neutrophils, mild anemia (red blood cell count: 322 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; normal: 367–479 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; hemoglobin: 9.8 mg/dL; normal: 11.5–14.9 mg/dL), elevated platelet count (56.9 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL; normal: 13–33 × 10<sup>4</sup>/μL), mild renal dysfunction (serum creatinine: 0.96 mg/dL; normal: 0.47–0.79 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen: 23.4 mg/dL; normal: 7–20 mg/dL), mild hyponatremia (133 mEq/mL; normal: 137–146 mEq/mL), mild hypercalcium (11.4 mg/mL; normal: 8.4–10 mg/dL), and markedly elevated C-reactive protein level (14.0 mg/dL; normal: 0–0.3 mg/dL). The tumor marker squamous cell carcinoma antigen was also elevated (5.5 ng/mL; normal: 0–1.5 ng/mL).\n\n【14】Chest computed tomography (CT) revealed interstitial shadows in both lungs. Chest CT also showed a 5.2 cm irregular mass with cavity and speculated margin in the right S3 as well as a 7.6 cm irregular mass with cavity and air bronchogram sign, which were adjacent to the pleural walls (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)). A few nodules were found in the right lung. Left hilar and subcarinal lymph nodes were swollen. The pathological findings for an endoscopic biopsy specimen revealed squamous cell carcinoma (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).

Therefore, the cooccurrence of a respiratory tract infection was suspected. The administration of antibiotics was initiated (sulbactam/ampicillin at 3.0 g/day for 6 days, and, subsequently, pazufloxacin at 1000 mg/day for 4 days). However, the elevated inflammatory marker levels and high-grade fever were not resolved. After administering nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (loxoprofen sodium hydrate at 180 mg/day), her temperature returned to normal.\n\n【21】The cause of fever and elevated inflammatory reaction levels was suspected as cytokine production by tumor cells. Therefore, serum G-CSF and IL-6 levels were measured, which showed that both serum G-CSF (117 pg/mL; normal: <57.5 pg/mL) and IL-6 (83.5 pg/mL; normal: <2.41 pg/mL) levels were high. Immunohistochemical examination of biopsy specimens showed positive staining with anti-G-CSF monoclonal and anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)).

She was discharged 19 days after her admission, after which she visited our institution regularly. However, she was transferred by ambulance because of dyspnea, and she died of hypoxemia due to interstitial pneumonia exacerbation two months after diagnosis of lung cancer.\n\n【30】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【31】Colony-stimulating factor (CSF) is one that promotes colony formation by leukocytes and other cells. G-CSF promotes granulocyte colony formation and is produced by macrophages, fibroblastic cells, and vascular endothelial cell. G-CSF also modulates differentiation and proliferation of granulocytes. In healthy individuals, G-CSF is present at very low levels in the blood circulation, and there is no correlation between circadian changes in serum G-CSF levels or leukocyte and granulocyte counts.\n\n【32】Lung cancer is known to be accompanied paraneoplastic syndromes such as leucocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In 1966, Bardley and Metcalf 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> confirmed the concept of CSF as a humoral factor that promoted the proliferation of bone marrow stem cells. Robinson 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> provided evidence of CSF in the urine and serum of patients with malignant tumors. G-CSF is a cytokine associated with granulocytosis. In lung cancer with leukocytosis, tumor cells presumably produce G-CSF.\n\n【33】In 1977, Asano et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u> reported that tumor cells could produce G-CSF and these tumors were designated as G-CSF-producing tumors. G-CSF-producing tumors are diagnosed when 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> there is marked leukocytosis without any other known cause, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> there is elevated serum G-CSF level, 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> there is a decline in white blood cell counts after tumor resection, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> there is evidence of G-CSF production in tumor tissues.\n\n【34】In the past, evidence of G-CSF production in tumor tissues required methods showing in vitro colony formation, measuring G-CSF levels after transplanting tumor cells into nude mice 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, or detecting G-CSF mRNA in tumor cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>; therefore, their clinical application was quite complex. However, with improvements in enzyme immunoassay methods, it has become possible to measure serum G-CSF levels. Moreover, with improvements in anti-G-CSF monoclonal antibodies, it has become possible to provide evidence for G-CSF localization in tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry methods.\n\n【35】Takahashi et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> reported that, for the diagnosis of G-CSF-producing tumors, the confirmation of increased serum G-CSF levels and positive immunostaining with an anti-G-CSF antibody were sufficient. Among patients with G-CSF-producing tumors, some may present with fever or have elevated C-reactive protein levels because of other cause of leukocytosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. G-CSF itself has no effect for causing fever or increasing C-reactive protein levels; therefore, the presence of inflammatory cytokines other than G-CSF is suggested. IL-6 is a promoter of G-CSF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and IL-6 produced by tumors can cause not only G-CSF production but also fever and elevated C-reactive protein levels.\n\n【36】Currently, there is no clear definition for IL-6-producing tumors. Fujino et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> provided evidence for production of IL-6 by measuring IL-6 levels produced by cultured tumor cells. In our case, in addition to the elevated serum IL-6 level, the confirmation of IL-6 in tumor cells from a biopsy specimen by immunostaining may have provided evidence for IL-6 production by tumor cells. Our case is significant because IL-6 production was demonstrated by pathological examinations.\n\n【37】Histologically, G-CSF-producing lung cancer comprises giant cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, G-CSF-producing lung cancer has poor prognosis with low-grade tumors and has the potential to invade into vessels and metastasize to lymph nodes. Even in resected cases, two-year mortality is as high as 15% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Prognosis of G-CSF-producing tumors is poor, mortality over one year is as high as 12%, and the mean survival time is five months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. It is unclear if the reason for poor prognosis is the high malignancy potential of G-CSF-producing tumors or the G-CSF itself produced by tumors.\n\n【39】Many G-CSF-producing tumors are suggested to be biologically highly malignant, poorly differentiated, and highly invasive to local lesions and vessels for the following reasons: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> autocrine tumor growth because of the emergence of G-CSF receptors on tumor cells, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> promotion of tumor growth and spread by proliferating neutrophils because of G-CSF, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> the inhibition of cellular immunity mediated by macrophages or natural killer cells by G-CSF. These mechanisms are presumably associated with tumor growth and spread 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【40】Tumors that secrete autocrine growth factors show rapid progression. Moreover, the spread of tumor cells is closely associated with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is a known growth factor for macrophages and granulocytes. G-CSF-producing tumors probably produce cytokines other than G-CSF; thus, establishing a method to measure several cytokines simultaneously is desirable.\n\n【41】G-CSF- and IL-6-producing lung cancer is comparatively rare because we could find only 5 reports concerning G-CSF- and IL-6-producing lung cancer in PubMed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–21\\]</u>. If the serum G-CSF and IL-6 level are measured commonly in lung cancer presenting with elevated white blood cell counts and C-reactive protein level, the more G-CSF and IL-6-producing lung cancer could be found.\n\n【42】When leukocytosis without evidence of infection is found in solid cancer including lung cancer, the serum G-CSF-level should be measured to examine whether tumor cells secrete G-CSF. When G-CSF-producing tumor is diagnosed, the administration of antibiotics is unnecessary. If tumor can be resected, surgical treatment should be considered.\n\n【43】Inoue et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u> reported a case of G-CSF- and IL-6-producing lung cancer showing elevated G-CSF and IL-6 level in tumor cells; although they showed the expression of G-CSF receptors on the surface of tumor cell, they could not show the expression of IL-6. In their case, although tumor cells secrete IL-6, IL-6 did not affect the proliferation of tumor cells. As in our case, we did not examine the expression of G-CSF receptors and IL-6 receptors; therefore, it is really unknown whether G-CSF and IL-6 are associated with the proliferation of tumor cells.\n\n【44】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【45】We encountered a case of lung squamous cell carcinoma that produced both G-CSF and IL-6. When encountering patients with malignant tumors who present with elevated white blood counts and C-reactive proteins levels, serum G-CSF and IL-6 measurements and immunostaining tumor cells with anti-G-CSF and anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies should be considered for diagnosis of G-CSF- and IL-6-producing tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This study quantified with Gait Analysis (GA) the gait pattern of a 4-year-old diplegic child with calf contracture before, 5 days, and 3 months after BTA injections into gastrocnemius. Kinematic and kinetic data of main lower limb joints were investigated. After only 5 days, ankle dorsi-plantarflexion and knee flex-extension improved, but hip joint worsened, increasing its excessive flexion, to compensate the improvement in knee position of the treated limb and to obtain better stability. A worsening of hip power happened. After 3 months, all joints generally improved their position during gait cycle. Hip and knee joints increased their range of movement and improvements occurred at ankle kinematics and kinetisc, too; a better ankle position and an increase of its capacity of propulsion during terminal stance were evident.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The use of Botulinum toxin type A (BTA) has been recommended in the management of spasticity in ambulant children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) to improve function and to delay the development of fixed deformity and the need for surgical intervention. Although its immediate positive effects have been quantified using Gait Analysis (GA) in previous studies, especially for the treatment of calf contracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>, some limits emerged. First, in literature the evaluation of gait changes after BTA injections for reducing gastrocnemius contracture was focused only on joints directly connected to gastrocnemius (knee and ankle joints); concerning proximal joints (pelvis and hip joints) no analyses were found. Then, all the studies quantifying both kinematic and kinetic strategies were conducted only on patients older than 6 years; few studies, in fact, investigated gait pattern of younger children using GA, and in these analyses only kinematics was evaluated, neglecting kinetic data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>. It is important to underline that no study evaluated the effects of the treatment few days after it, too; the evaluations were generally conducted one or more months after the treatment.\n\n【4】This study quantified with GA the effects of BTA injections into gastrocnemius for the reduction of excessive knee flexion due to calf spasticity in a 4-yr-old child with CP. His gait was evaluated considering distal and proximal joints and in term of kinematics, and kinetic data, too. He was examined before, 5 days, and 3 months after BTA injections into left gastrocnemius. In this way a complete quantification of motor strategy of a very young patient was conducted.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient was a 4-yr-old male (weight: 16 Kg; height: 103 cm) affected by spastic diplegia; he was born approximately 7 weeks preterm with respiratory distress. He showed a dynamic calf contracture and a stiffness of adductor muscles; the left side was more worsened than the right one. He was an independent community ambulator without the use of assistive devices or orthoses.\n\n【7】The patient was injected 2 times, and in each inoculation BTA (Botox, Allergan, USA) was injected intramuscularly in the same muscles and with the same dosage: in the left medial gastrocnemius (20 U) and in the left lateral gastrocnemius (15 U). The temporal distance between the two inoculations was 10 months. No side effects or complications following injections were found. He was examined before (PRE session) and 5 days (POST1 session) after the first BTA injection and 3 months (POST2) after the second BTA injection.\n\n【8】The patient was evaluated with 3D GA, using a 12-camera optoelectronic system (ELITE2002, BTS S.p.A.

Some parameters were identified and calculated from kinematic and kinetic data: spatiotemporal parameters, angles joint values in specific gait cycle instant, and peak values of joint powers.

Pre Session\n\n【14】Child walked with a low velocity of progression (  m/sec; CG:  m/sec) and limited anterior step length (right:  m and left:  m; CG:  m), if compared to normative values. Pelvic tilt was closed to normality. His gait was characterised by excessive left hip flexion at initial contact, while right side was closed to normality; a reduced range of motion was evident bilaterally, due to a limited extension in midstance. Knee was characterised by abnormal flexion during stance, due to spasticity of gastrocnemius, showing a limited range of motion bilaterally. Ankle joint was dorsiflexed during all gait cycle, and the right side was the most compromised. Right foot was in a correct position in the transversal plane, while left foot was intrarotated during all gait cycle. Concern kinetic data, a limited capacity of ankle propulsion during terminal stance and a reduced peak of hip power generation during stance phase were found bilaterally.\n\n【15】##### 2.2. POST1 Session (5 Days After the First Injection)\n\n【16】Velocity of progression improved (  m/sec), while the other spatiotemporal parameters were unchanged. Pelvic tilt was in anterior position bilaterally and hip increased its flexion on right side, while left one improved its extension in midstance, remaining above normality. Right knee joint did not change significantly, while the left side improved its position in stance. The treatment reduced ankle dorsiflexion at right side while left one remained generally unchanged. There is a persistent drop foot in swing phase bilaterally, since ankle joints were not able to achieve dorsiflexion. Both feet were more intrarotated than PRE session. Concerning kinetic data, a reduction of power generation at left ankle during terminal stance occurred; hip power showed higher values of positive peak in stance phase bilaterally.\n\n【17】##### 2.3. POST2 Session (3 Months After the Second Injection)\n\n【18】hip joint reduced its excessive flexion at initial contact on right side, remaining above normality, and improved its extension in mid-stance bilaterally, with consequently a better excursion during movement. Knee showed a more physiological position during stance phase with better range of motion. Ankle reduced its excessive dorsiflexion bilaterally. The right side was closed to normality during stance phase, and the left side showed, in addiction, the worsening of ankle dorsiflexion in swing phase. Foot progression improved bilaterally. Concern kinetics, hip power improved at right side, and maximum of ankle power increased bilaterally.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】In this study the kinematic and kinetic aspects of gait in a 4-yr-old child with CP were evaluated using GA to quantify the effects of BTA injection into gastrocnemius for the reduction of excessive knee flexion due to calf spasticity. Literature investigated widely this topic but it presents some limits: only the effects on ankle and knee pattern were evaluated and those on proximal joints, as hip and pelvic joints, were neglected. Then, patients were generally more than 6-yr-old; few studies investigated gait strategy in younger children using GA, but these analyses concerned only kinematics, not kinetic data. In addition, the evaluations were conducted generally one or more months after the treatment.\n\n【21】The results of this study demonstrated that the brief term effects of BTA occurred on all joints of lower limbs, not only on joints directly connected to treated gastrocnemius, knee, and ankle joints. Concerning pelvic joint, a worsening happened in the sagittal plane, increasing the anterior tilt; hip increased its flexion and this condition was directly connected to abnormal pelvic tilt position. The higher hip flexion at initial contact and the reduction of excessive knee flexion during stance phase on the treated side induced a new biomechanical position: this condition may be directly connected to the initial reduction of gastrocnemius spasticity that allows the subject to experience greater extension of left knee. At ankle joint some significant improvements occurred in the sagittal plane, while on coronal plane, the treatment caused a worsening in foot progression bilaterally. The excessive hip flexion and foot intrarotation may be a strategy to obtain a better stability and equilibrium. As knee joint has a more physiological pattern on the treated side, while the right side maintained its excessive flexion, this strategy probably is a scheme that permits to walk the patient with safety and at higher velocity of progression. In term of kinetics, before the treatment, the spastic gastrocnemius induced a reduction of ankle power generation at terminal stance, because this muscle is not able to strongly contract in this phase; after injection no changes occurred. This result was connected to the nature of BTA that denervates and produces a temporary paralysis of the treated muscle. The worsening of positive hip power in stance may be related to the high hip flexion at initial contact and to the reduced ankle power generation at terminal stance, too: the low levels of ankle work resulted in greater amounts of work being done by muscle groups of the hip.\n\n【22】Three months after the second injection of BTA, gait pattern revealed a general improvement, both at proximal and distal joints. Hip reduced its abnormal flexion at initial contact on right side and revealed an improvement in hip extension in mid-stance bilaterally. A better position and a good excursion of knee during all gait cycle bilaterally were evident. In this way a reduction of knee asymmetry, present in POST1 session, disappeared, allowing the subject to show more physiological knee flexion during most of gait cycle: a knee flexion reduction and a better extension would facilitate a corresponding increase of hip extension, to maintain erect posture during gait. Ankle improved its position during all stance phase; in swing phase instead the range of motion remained low. Even if the treatment reduced the dominance of the ankle plantarflexors over the antagonist muscles and so tibialis anterior is not contrasted by the abnormal gastrocnemius activity any more, probably the dorsiflexor muscle is again weak avoiding the correct position of ankle joint during swing. Concern kinetic results, a better capacity of propulsion at ankle joint is evident : the improvement may be due to the conclusion of temporary paralysis of treated muscle that now can contract during terminal stance. Hip power reduced on the right side its maximum in stance phase, according to decrease of hip flexion.\n\n【23】From these results, it is evident that BTA represents an encouraging therapy for the reduction of spasticity in CP subjects. In particular this study demonstrated that the treatment performed on a very young patient has significant effects immediately few days after the treatment. These modifications, that were worsening at proximal joints and improvements at distal ones, may be due to the search of a new control strategy immediately required after the reduction of gastrocnemius spasticity: the modifications at distal joints, directly connected to treatment of gastrocnemius, probably induce postural adjustments at proximal joints. Some months after the second inoculation, gait pattern revealed a general improvement, both at proximal and distal joints, demonstrating the reaching of better stability and reorganization of motor scheme of the patient. These significant changes may be directly connected to the effects of the BTA inoculation into the spastic muscles and to the natural maturation of the gait in the patient, too: the reduction of the spasticity during the growth period may reduce muscle tone and allow normal longitudinal muscle growth and lengthening leading to a more physiological gait pattern. Future studies might be conducted to compare children with the same age treated and not treated with BTA, in order to exclude one effect (the natural maturation of gait) with respect to the other (effects of BTA).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

However, there are no reports on the complications of date seeds after oral consumption. We currently report a patient with no history of gastrointestinal disease, who has been admitted to the hospital with portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and suffered from complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The term PVT refers to the complete or partial obstruction of blood flow in the portal vein, due to the presence of thrombus in the vassal lumen, which occurs rarely in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are numerous factors that can contribute to this disorder, including chronic liver disease, malignancies, processes localized to the epigastrium and hepatobiliary system, and acquired as well as inherited thrombophilia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Acute and chronic PVT has different clinical manifestations. Acute PVT is associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fever, lactacidosis, sepsis, and intestinal congestion with ischemia. In contrast, chronic PVT can be completely asymptomatic, or characterized by splenomegaly, pancytopenia, varicose veins, and rarely ascites 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Previous studies have shown that some plant products and herbal remedies can cause serious toxic effects and drug interactions that have not been scientifically evaluated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) rich in valuable nutrients grows in arid and semiarid regions of the world, especially in most Middle-Eastern countries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Date seed is the byproduct of date stoning 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, which is a hard coated seed, usually oblong, ventrally grooved, with a small embryo and weight of 0.5 g to 4 g 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6,7\\]</u>. A study conducted in Iran has shown that the date seeds on an average contain 4.84% protein, 12.22% fat, 27.58% fiber, 80.76% carbohydrates, 1.18% ash, and 1.72% moisture. The date seeds are also a rich source of phenolics and minerals, including iron (Fe), calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), sodium (Na), zinc (Zn), and magnesium (Mg). The main fatty acids of the seed oil are oleic, lauric, palmitic, myristic, linoleic, and stearic acids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Date seeds are also used for therapeutic purposes in some places 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Date seeds are used in the caffeine-free drinks in Arab countries, where such a powder is assumed to prevent gastric upset and indigestion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In addition, date seeds have been used in Egyptian folk medicine without scientific evidence for many years to manage liver diseases, diabetes, and gastrointestinal disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In the present case study, we report an interesting case, in which PVT has developed after oral consumption of a large amount of date seeds powder. Early diagnosis, proper management, and identification of causal agents may affect the patient’s outcome and mortality.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】An 82-year-old man (height: 170 cm; weight: 62 kg; BMI: 21.4) with a history of diabetes mellitus referred to the hospital because of a generalized abdominal pain with predominance of epigastric pain radiating to the back and an intensity of 8 out of 10 began 4 days ago. He had experienced severe anorexia, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distention for 3 days before hospital admission. He was using metformin 500 mg twice a day to control his blood sugar. He had no history of cardiac and liver diseases. He had no problems until 4 days before hospital admission. He had no history of drug or alcohol use and without a thromboembolic disease history, but he had been eating date seeds powder (two tablespoons twice a day) for two weeks to relieve chronic knee joint pain without physician prescription. Absence of bowel sound and generalized tenderness with severe epigastric pain were found on the physical examination. The entire abdomen percussion showed a dull sound, and shifting dullness test was positive for ascites.\n\n【7】His body temperature, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure were 36.9°C, 93%, 102 beats a minute, and 111/61 mmHg, respectively. The complete blood count showed the following parameters: white blood cells (WBCs) count 11.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, red blood cell (RBC) count 4.25 mcL, hemoglobin concentration (Hb) 12.2 g/L, hematocrit (Hct) 34.4%, partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 35 sec, prothrombin time (PT) 13 sec, international normalized ratio (INR) 1, bleeding time (BT) 5 minutes, clotting time (CT) 11 minutes, blood urea nitrogen 95 mg/dl, and creatinine 1.5 μmol/L. In addition, the patient test results of factor V Leiden (FAK-tur five LIDE-n) and lupus anticoagulants (LA) were negative.\n\n【8】Furthermore, the patient’s liver function tests showed alanine transaminase (ALT), 26 IU/L; aspartate transaminase (AST), 17 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 175 IU/L; serum total protein, 5.3 g/dl; serum albumin, 3.1 g/dl; blood sugar, 214 mg/dl; and amylase, 33 IU/L. Ascites fluid sample analysis showed negative culture; albumin, 0.9 g/dl; protein, 1.8 g/dl; WBC, 90 (90% lymph)/mm<sup>3</sup>; RBC, 380/mm<sup>3</sup>; and sugar, 199 mg/dl.

There was edematous small bowel and dilated colon with no ischemia and pathologic finding in the abdomen and pelvis but the massive ascites. The liver was normal in appearance, and biopsies were taken. Pathological reports of omentum and peritoneum and liver biopsies were normal. Our case study did not have the PVT risk factors, including chronic liver disease, malignancies, processes localized to the epigastrium and hepatobiliary system, and acquired as well as inherited thrombophilia.\n\n【23】In the thorough retrospective survey, we found no other probable reason or specific issue except consumption of date seeds powder. He was treated with conservative management, anticoagulant drugs, and continuous unfractionated heparin 18 U/Kg/h. He got better gradually. Bowel sound was present on the third postoperative day with bisacodyl suppository and lactulose syrup. Hepatic encephalopathy occurred on the 10<sup>th</sup> postoperative day, and the patient became confused but got better after an increase in lactulose dosage and administration of rifaximin 550 mg twice a day. He felt better over time, and his confusion disappeared completely on the 20<sup>th</sup> day. He never became icteric. Finally, he was discharged from hospital 25 days later with rivaroxaban 20 mg/day and came back to his normal life within a month. Rivaroxaban treatment was ceased after 3 months. He is well and has normal function by now.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Studies have reported allergy or hypersensitivity to date palm fruit and pollen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>, and date palm fruit is considered as a strong allergen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. There are also some concerns about date varieties with high concentration of selenium, which is related to the amount of selenium in the soil 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has reported the adverse effects of date seeds 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. We report the first case of PVT after consumption of the date seeds for a long time.\n\n【26】PVT is a vascular disease of the liver that occurs when a blood clot occurs in the hepatic portal vein 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. PVT was often considered idiopathic in the past, but now PVT can be diagnosed in about 70% of the cases because of prothrombotic abnormalities and a better perception of susceptible clinical conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. PVT is commonly associated with cirrhosis, abdominal malignancies, and localized inflammation, infection, and prothrombotic disorders. Acute or chronic PVT is often difficult to diagnose. There are major challenges to PVT management strategies, including anticoagulants, thrombolytics, and surgical options. Early diagnosis and proper management have important effects on the rate of mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【27】One of the genetic factors that causes PVT is thrombophilia. The factor V G1691A mutation and the prothrombin G20210A mutation are the two most common genetic causes of thrombophilia. However, the effects of these two gene mutations along with other risk factors can increase the occurrence of venous thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. The JAK2V617F mutation has been described in 17% of the patients with portal and mesenteric venous thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. Prevalence of the JAK2V617F mutation was 1.4% in cirrhotic patients with PVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Routine screening for the JAK2V617F mutation can be recommended in nonmalignant and noncirrhotic patients with PVT, but not in cirrhotic patients with PVT. The splenomegaly might be closely associated with the JAK2V617F mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. The prevalence of calreticulin (CALR) mutations in splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) varies among studies. Li et al. have shown that the pooled proportion of CALR mutations was 1.59% in PVT patients and 1.82% in PVT patients without JAK2V617F mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Based on a meta-analysis by Qi et al. the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation is associated with an increased risk of PVT among patients with/without cirrhosis. In addition, the prothrombin G20210A mutation is associated with PVT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Examination of the case study showed that the 82-year-old patient had no history of genetic disease or even previous hospitalization. Owing to the fact that genetic diseases and alterations and their complications are appeared at an early age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>, the possibility of genetic problems in this patient is unlikely. One of our limitations was that the some of the mentioned tests were not checked in our center; however, according to the patient’s negative results of FVL and LA tests, further laboratory tests are not strongly recommended. There is also no Virchow’s triad, and examination of the patient’s CT findings showed that the patient’s splenic vein was open and there was no venous anatomical abnormality. There was no evidence of Budd–Chiari syndrome. Therefore, the specialized team did not consider necessary to perform V G1691A, G20210A, and JAK2V617F tests.\n\n【29】Review of literature did not show any side effects of date seeds. Date seeds powder was used as an herbal medicine in the past to treat diseases such as progeria, anemia, and impotency 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 24\\]</u>. Date seeds could be a promising candidate for protection against the CCl4-induced liver intoxication, and this hepatoprotective effect may be attributed to the antioxidant and free radical scavenging activities of some components 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Studies have shown that date palm seed consumption has anti-inflammatory 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> and antioxidant properties in humans 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>.\n\n【30】El et al. have shown that date seed extract is safe for the liver and kidneys 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Therefore, middle-aged women can use it regularly to maintain good health, improve the immune system, and prevent chronic diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Clinical implications obtained from the study of Isworo 通用删除7(英):<u>(2020)</u> suggest that physicians may offer palm seed powder as a functional beverage 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. Alem et al. showed that date seeds could increase the nutritional value of some foods used for human consumption and they could be used as additives in food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. Some other studies have suggested the possible applications of date seed oil for cosmetics, pharmaceutics, and related products and have less considered the date palm seed for food products 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Date seed powder was characterized by low moisture and high carbohydrate and fat contents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. Studies have shown that date seeds can be used as a probiotic and interact with the intestinal microflora, especially probiotic bacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. The results of Darwish et al. have shown that date powder caused the growth of probiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. On the other hand, the results of Zhu et al. showed an unrecognized mechanistic link between specific dietary nutrients, gut microbes, platelet function, and the risk of thrombosis. Gut microbes can directly contribute to platelet hyperactivity and enhance the thrombotic potential by producing trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【32】We hypothesize that date seed powder may interact with gut microbiota and cause various reactions producing TMAO and possibly leading to thrombosis. There are complex interactions between diet composition, the gut microbiota, and their metabolites that affect human health 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>. Well-designed clinical trials and further experimental studies are required to determine the influence of probiotics such as date powder on TMAO. Further studies are required due to the lack of evidence, as the review of literature shows insufficient scientific evidence to document and ascertain the (adverse) effects and complications of date seed accurately. Our case report has hypothesized that date seeds can have side effects; however, clinical trials are required to confirm this claim. In addition, most studies have dealt with the health benefits of date seed consumption and have not considered its possible side effects.\n\n【33】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【34】Since date seeds are used in some places for human consumption and disease treatment, it is necessary to pay attention to the side effects and problems associated with their consumption. In geographical areas where date seeds are ingested, health professionals should pay attention to the side effects of date seed, inform consumers, and prevent its complications. The present study can provide valuable and new insights for future studies to better understand and identify the adverse effects and reactions due to date seed intake.\n\n【35】#### Consent\n\n【36】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case study and accompanying images.\n\n【37】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【38】The authors report no conflicts of interest in this project.\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank the Social Determinants of Health Research Centre for its support and collaboration (ethics code: IR.RUMS.REC.1399.253) in Ali-Ibn Abi-Talib Hospital, Rafsanjan University of Medical Sciences, Rafsanjan, Iran.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It particularly affects survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma reflecting the cumulative exposure to glucocorticosteroid therapy. ON is often multiarticular and bilateral, specially affecting weight-bearing joints. A conventional approach suggests a surgical intervention even if pharmacological options have also recently been investigated. We reported two cases of long time steroid-treated patients who underwent Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT) for hematological disease. Both patients developed femoral head osteonecrosis (ON) that was diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the ON was also accompanied with pain and a limp. Despite of the conventional strategies of therapy, we successfully started a short-term treatment with bisphosphonates in order to decrease the pain and the risk of fracture.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Osteonecrosis (ON) is recognised as a complication of the treatment of hematologic malignancies in children and adolescents. The hips and the knees are the joints affected more frequently but involvement of the ankles is also described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. The majority of patients present pain, limping, articular collapse, arthritis, and limitation of movement but in some cases it is completely asymptomatic. Spontaneous resolution can occur in these patients, especially in the case of small lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> even if a majority of them have a progressive disorder, ending in the collapse of the affected joints. The Harris hip score 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, evaluating pain, functional capacity, range of motion and deformity, is very useful to asses morbidity.\n\n【4】Published reports and retrospective analysis are often limited to symptomatic patients. For these reasons, the true prevalence is probably underestimated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】In the last few years, the number of patient survivors after BMT has increased and the long follow-up period has made it possible to observe some late effects. ON is increasingly reported as a severe disabling complication, as well as osteoporosis, especially in patients receiving steroids for cancer treatment or as prophylaxis/treatment for graft-versus-hostdisease (GVHD) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. An early diagnosis of ON is essential in order to prevent its progression and MRI is considered the gold standard for early diagnosis and followup 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Several risk factors for ON have been identified in the LLA context. It seems that ON is more common in whites and in adolescents than in blacks 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8–10\\]</u> or children especially under 13 years old with a high BMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. The maturing bone of the adolescents may be more susceptible to the development of ON.\n\n【7】The pathogenesis is complex and includes suppression of bone formation, expansion of the intramedullary lipocyte compartment and a direct effect on the nutrient arteries. The Children Cancer Group (CCG) 1882 study also demonstrates that the incidence of ON correlates with the amount of dexamethasone received 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Corticosteroids are integral to the management of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Improvements in event-free survival (EFS) have been achieved with the addition of dexamethasone to standard prednisone-based therapies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This therapy has been associated with a dramatic increase in the occurrence of ON and may be directly linked with dexamethasone, which seems to be stronger than prednisone in both its antileukemic and toxic effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 13\\]</u>.\n\n【8】We described the cases of two pediatric patients who were on long-term steroid treatment before BMT for hematologic disease and for acute or chronic GVHD. They presented ON of the femoral head and osteoporosis after BMT. Bisphosphonates (Alendronate) were used to treat them for about a period of 12 months, after parental consent, and the therapy ended when the pain and limping had stopped for a significant period of time.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case  1\n\n【10】The first patient, now 20 years old, had originally been diagnosed with anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma when he was 12 and received corticosteroid therapy according to the AIEOP NHL 92 protocol, Dexamethasone (DXM) 448mg/ m 2 until relapse and DXM 420 mg/ m 2 from the first relapse to the pretransplantation conditioning regimen. After 4 relapses, he underwent matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation. The conditioning regimen was TBI (1200 cGy), Thiotepa (TT), Ciclophosphamide (CPM), and Antithymocyte globulin (ATG).\n\n【11】A six-month treatment with corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone 8975 mg/ m 2 , Prednisone 10500 mg/ m 2 , and Hydrocortisone 2710 mg/ m 2 ) was used for grade IV acute and severe chronic GVHD of gut, skin, and lungs. Eight months after BMT, while still under corticosteroid therapy, he developed a limp and severe pain in the left hip. An MRI was performed  and revealed a moderate joint effusion, as well as fat-like aspects of osteonecrosis involving the weight bearing portion of the femoral heads particularly extruded in the left hip where the articular surface was partially flattened. Bone marrow oedema was also present bilaterally around the right femoral capital necrosis . A DEXA was performed, which showed osteoporosis. The blood test indicated that related bony tissue turnover was normal.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Moderate bilateral joint effusion and fat-like aspects of osteonecrosis involving the weight bearing portion of the femoral heads. In the left hip where the articular surface is partially flattened. Bone marrow oedema is also present bilaterally, around the femoral capital necrosis. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】Orthopaedic suggestions were to limit weight bearing, functional discharge, and the rest of hip joints. Since the pain persisted, a treatment with Alendronate was added to the conventional therapy when he was 13 years old. This therapy was started 6 months after ON had been diagnosed, at the dosage of 10 mg a day, and ended 11 months later, without any side effects. One month after the beginning of bisphosphonates therapy, the patient reported improvement of the limp together with a considerable decrease of pain and a gradual recovery of normal motor activity. An MRI, performed nine months from the diagnosis of ON, showed a resolution of the bilateral joint effusion and bone marrow oedema. The right femoral head showed a regular articular surface but with aspects of midollary sclerosis. The left femoral capital necrosis presented a partial aspect of fragmentation .\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Bilateral joint effusion and bone marrow oedema are disappeared.

Case  2\n\n【19】The second patient is an 18-year-old girl who had a bone marrow relapse for ALL at 10 and had undergone an MUD BMT. Pretransplantation conditioning regimen included TBI 1200 cGy, TT, CPM, and ATG. Before BMT, corticosteroids were administered according to induction and reinduction therapy of AIEOP protocol 9502 (Methylprednisolone 211 mg/ m 2 , Prednisone 150 mg/ m 2 , and DXM 360 mg/ m 2 ). In addition, Prednisone was administered for one month (total dose 1950 mg/ m 2 ) to prevent an acute GVHD. After 6 months from the bone marrow infusion, she developed a limp and pain on the weight bearing joint in the right hip.\n\n【20】MRI examination showed a flattened right femoral head, joint effusion, enlarged physes, bone marrow oedema of the femoral neck, and minimal sclerotic changes of the articular surface.

The blood test indicated that related bony tissue turnover was normal.\n\n【24】Pressure was relived from the affected joint, and the patient underwent physiotherapy. Six months after the diagnosis of ON, when she was 11 years old, she started a therapy with Alendronate, 5 mg a day for two weeks and then we increase the dose to 10 mg a day. Two months later, the patient reported a significant decrease of pain. Bisphosphonates therapy lasted for 12 months, without any side effect. The last MRI, performed 30 months from initial symptoms, showed a better boundary line of the necrosis of the capital of the femur with a fat-like aspect, good remodelling of the femoral head, morphologic normalization of the physes, and only minimal flattening of the articular surface . Bone-density densitometry results also improved.

Discussion\n\n【28】Skeletal morbidity, characterized by bone pain, osteonecrosis, fractures, loss of mobility, bone deformation, or osteopenia, is frequently encountered in patients affected by ALL. Orthopaedic management of symptomatic ON varied. This morbidity can cause immobility and consequently a substantial reduction in the quality of life and may require surgical interventions such as core decompression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>, arthrodesis, and joint replacement. Furthermore, resurfacing hemiarthroplasties were recently performed to treat advanced osteonecrosis in young adult patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Alleviation of weight from the affected joints (employing crutches or wheelchair) for a certain period together with physical therapy is usually recommended for many patients. There are some concerns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> regarding using surgical interventions in growing open physes, although the conventional approach is still surgery. Nonsurgical intervention includes external electrical stimulation/capacitance coupling 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u> and the use of hyperbaric oxygen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【29】We still have little experience concerning the pharmacological treatment of ON but recently some studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–23\\]</u> have shown that Alendronate offers an added advantage in children and adolescents with either ALL or a malignant lymphoma with ON.\n\n【30】Bisphosphonates are very important inhibitors of osteoclastic bone resorption in vivo 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u> and are used in diseases such as osteoporosis, hypercalcemia of malignancy, Paget’s disease of bone, and osteolytic bone disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25–27\\]</u>. However, up to now there had not been any indications for the use of these drugs in the treatment of ON. They are safely used in treating childhood hypercalcemia, secondary to acute lymphocytic leukaemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28, 29\\]</u>. The administration of bisphosphonates produced normocalcemia in these patients apparently without any significant side effects. ON of the jaw or oesophageal cancer after bisphosphonates infusion represents well-known complications in adult cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 31\\]</u> but in children these complications have not been reported. Long-term potential effects from their use during the active phase of growth still remain unknown.\n\n【31】Goldbloom and collaborators have also used bisphosphonates to treat vertebral fractures of two children affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. The authors report the successful use of pamidronate on both patients who had originally had pain and low bone mineral density. In addition to standard chemotherapy, pamidronate (1 mg/kg, IV) was given bimonthly. Initial rapid symptom relief and gradual improvement of bone mineral density were demonstrated in both patients. It remains to be demonstrated whether osteonecrotic collapse can also be prevented with the use of these medicaments. In fact, the inhibition of osteoclast activity by the use of bisphosphonates could possibly lead to an increase in bone mass and strength in these sites. Moreover, in orthopedic conditions it is often possible to apply the drug locally. This will give a much higher local oncentration because of the pharmacokinetics effects of the bisphosphonates which remain in the site for a long time. When we had originally decided to treat our patients with Alendronate, there was no information on this drug concerning its use in relation to ON. Therefore, in our patients the lack of symptoms and the absence of fractures after 7 years seem to be encouraging.\n\n【32】These promising approaches including the use of these antiresorptive drugs as well as strategies such as the employment of lipid lowering agents are being currently explored 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. It is very difficult to prevent ON in children but high-risk groups of patients are identifiable and have to be monitored; clinical and radiological examinations have to be conducted as well as measures of functional assessment which would all help the patient attain a better quality of life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Pulmonary hypertension secondary to scurvy is a rare manifestation that historically has not been well studied and is only described in a handful of case reports. Case. Our case is about a 35-year-old female with a history significant for drug and tobacco abuse, obesity, poor diet, anxiety, and major depressive disorder who was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension in the setting of vitamin C deficiency (<0.01 mg/L). Conclusion. We present a case that shows pulmonary hypertension can be associated with scurvy and reversed rapidly with adequate vitamin C supplementation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】In the United States and other developed countries, it is often assumed the incidence of vitamin C deficiency or scurvy is negligible due to widespread accessibility to fortified foods and vitamins. However, individuals who live alone and have a history of substance abuse, restrictive diet, or mental illness are much more likely to develop scurvy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Common early manifestations of scurvy include anemia, bone pain, easy bruisability, petechiae, gum disease, perifollicular hemorrhages on lower extremities, and mood alterations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. A rare manifestation is pulmonary hypertension. A literature review from January 2020 found 10 cases written about pulmonary hypertension due to vitamin C deficiency. In all these cases, there was rapid resolution of the patient’s pulmonary hypertension after supplementation with vitamin C 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, there are not any current guidelines or long-term follow-ups (maximum 1 year) to treatments documented. It is thought that vitamin C deficiency leads to pulmonary hypertension secondary to decreased degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and decreased activity of nitrous oxide synthase (NOS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. Our case is about a 35-year-old female who was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension in the setting of scurvy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】Our patient was a 35-year-old female with a past medical history significant for obesity, substance abuse, tobacco abuse (22-pack-year history), major depressive disorder, anxiety, and poor diet (primarily cheese steaks, chicken, and pork chops) who was admitted to our hospital with painful lower extremity swelling, shortness of breath, gingival bleeding, decreased oral intake, and ecchymosis which had been progressively getting worse over the past 6 months. The patient’s course prior to admission included failed treatment with corticosteroids for suspected vasculitis/undifferentiated connective tissue disease and multiple transfusions in the setting of persistent anemia. The patient presented with a heart rate at 105 beats per minute, blood pressure of 115/59, respiratory rate at 24 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 99% on room air. Physical exam revealed an extremely pale-appearing individual who had poor dental hygiene with mild pooling of blood in the oral cavity, diffuse joint swelling with ecchymosis , perifollicular petechiae with some corkscrew hairs , tenderness in the lower extremities, and decreased breath sounds with mild crackles.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【7】Peripheral ecchymosis which is commonly found as a cutaneous manifestation of scurvy.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【9】Corkscrew hair and perifollicular petechiae which are commonly seen in scurvy.\n\n【10】The patient’s labs were significant for hemoglobin: 6.6 g/dl (ref: 12.0–15.3 g/dl), prothrombin time/internalized normalized ratio (PT-INR): 1.50 (ref: 0.87–1.17), platelets: 152 K/uL (ref: 140–400 K/uL), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP): 2714 pg/ml (ref: 0–299 pg/ml), folate <2.0 ng/ml (ref: >4.5 ng/ml), and thiamine <7 nmol/L (ref: 8–30 nmol/L). Blood cultures came back positive for Streptococcus anginosus in 2/4 bottles, for which she was initially treated with amoxicillin/sulbactam and later transitioned to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for a total of 14 days. In the setting of persistent anemia and acute worsening thrombocytopenia, a bone marrow biopsy was done and showed dyserythropoiesis, nuclear cytoplasmic asynchrony, and erythroid hyperplasia. A peripheral blood smear described increased anisocytosis of the red blood cells, left-shifted neutrophils with immature forms present, and small-to-medium platelets with normal morphology. A ventilation/perfusion scan was done which ruled out pulmonary embolism. Full vasculitis and viral workup was negative. Urine toxicology screen was positive for benzodiazepines and morphine/codeine.\n\n【11】Given her constellation of symptoms and poor nutrition, scurvy was on the differential and was started on daily vitamin C supplementation. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was ordered in the setting of bacteremia, which was negative to vegetation but was found to have severe pulmonary hypertension with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 86 mmHg, dilated inferior vena cava with a right atrial pressure of 15 mmHg, and severely enlarged right ventricle with flattening of the interventricular septum positive for D-sign . The left ventricle was concentrically hypertrophic with an ejection fraction of 70% and had a left ventricular outflow tract septal obstruction from an enlarged right ventricle. These findings further decreased suspicion for septic cardiomyopathy as TTE findings did not correlate and the patient continued to have symptoms despite antibiotic treatment. Although rare, thoracic medicine suspected the pulmonary hypertension was secondary to scurvy, and it would resolve with vitamin C supplementation as had been described in a few case reports. The decision was made to defer starting diuretic therapy or vasodilators. Ascorbic acid levels returned severely deficient two days after initiation of supplements at <0.1 mg/L, ref: 0.3–2.7 mg/dl. Within a week, the patient reported improvement in her shortness of breath, lower extremity tenderness, and gingival bleeding. She was discharged with vitamin C 500 mg twice daily and a follow-up right heart catheterization with TTE two weeks after initial initiation of supplementation.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【13】This image was obtained by the transthoracic echocardiogram using a parasternal short-axis view. There is increased pressure/volume in the right ventricle and flattening of the interventricular septum creating a D-shaped right ventricle (known as a D-sign). In our case, this right ventricular strain is secondary to increased pressure in the pulmonary vasculature.\n\n【14】Repeat TTE was negative for any indications of pulmonary hypertension: the right ventricle size and right atrial pressure (3 mmHg) were normal. Right heart catheterization had a baseline mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 19, wedge pressure of 10, and pulmonary vasculature resistance (PVR) of 1 WU. Postsaline mPAP was 29, wedge pressure was 15, and PVR was 1.7 WU. Findings did not meet criteria for pulmonary hypertension, however did suggest mild noncompliance of the pulmonary vasculature that can be explained by mild left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【15】The patient was assessed by cardiology two years later with resolution of her shortness of breath and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension noted on examination.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Pulmonary hypertension is a rare symptom of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) that has not been thoroughly investigated with documentation only in a handful of case reports. In our case, the patient’s severe pulmonary hypertension resolved after 2 weeks of vitamin C supplementation. When comparing our patient’s presentation with previous cases, there were similarities such as dilation of the right ventricle, elevated BNP, and rapid resolution of pulmonary hypertension with vitamin C supplementation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Unlike other cases documented in the past, our case can confirm continued resolution of pulmonary hypertension at least two years after initiation of supplementation.\n\n【18】The exact mechanism of how scurvy leads to pulmonary hypertension is still unclear. One theory is that vitamin C acts as a reducing agent to activate EGLN prolyl hydroxylase which in turn hydroxylates HIFa. Hydroxylated HIFa is then targeted by von Hippel–Lindau protein for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. When vitamin C is low, there are increased levels of HIFa which binds with transcription factor HIFb to upregulate transcription of vasoconstrictive genes such as vasoconstrictor endothelin (EDN1) that increase pulmonary vasoconstriction and smooth muscle proliferation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>. This mechanism is similar to vitamin C’s role as a cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases for collagen synthesis, where a lack of it is attributable to many of scurvy’s common manifestations such as poor wound healing, gingival bleeding, and arthralgia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Vitamin C has also been shown to increase nitrous oxide synthase (NOS) activity by degrading asymmetric dimethyl L-arginine (NOS inhibitor), inhibiting arginase (increased L-arginine to be used to make NO), and increasing the availability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH<sub>4</sub>) (essential cofactor of NOS). Therefore, vitamin C deficiency leads to decreased availability of NO and consequently pulmonary vasoconstriction and increased vascular tone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In developed countries, smoking history, long-term alcoholism, low income, obesity, psychiatric illness, old age, and voluntarily restrictive diets are risk factors for scurvy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 10\\]</u>. In particular, smokers have increased risk of attaining pulmonary hypertension secondary to scurvy as they have three times less vitamin C than nonsmokers and have higher incidences of hypoxia which also increase the levels of HIF 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 11\\]</u>. Our patient had a long-term history of smoking, psychiatric illness, poor diet, and poor oral intake which all contributed to her vitamin C deficiency. The presumed rarity of the disease may also be inaccurate as some studies have shown the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency can be as high as 25% in low-income families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. It is therefore important to keep in mind these risk factors so that diagnosis and treatment can occur early before irreversible damage occurs.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】In conclusion, we present a case of pulmonary hypertension secondary to vitamin C deficiency that rapidly resolved and continued to be resolved two years later with supplementation. As there are no current guidelines recommending looking for vitamin C deficiency as a culprit for pulmonary hypertension, it is likely that many cases are missed. We believe that all individuals with the risk factors outlined above who are found to have pulmonary hypertension should be screened for vitamin C deficiency.\n\n【22】#### Data Availability\n\n【23】The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.\n\n【24】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【25】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It is well recognized that squamous cell carcinomas of the lung and esophagus can cause humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy secondary to paraneoplastic secretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide. However, it is extremely rare for a squamous cell carcinoma developing in a sacral decubitus ulcer to cause humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. We describe the first case of a patient found to have elevated serum levels of parathyroid hormone related peptide related to his Marjolin’s ulcer. A 45-year-old African American man with T6 paraplegia and a sacral decubitus ulcer present for 20 years was admitted for hypercalcemia of unclear etiology. He was subsequently found to have elevated parathyroid hormone related peptide and an excisional biopsy from the ulcer showed invasive squamous cell carcinoma suggestive of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. The patient ultimately succumbed to sepsis while receiving chemotherapy for his metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy is a rare and likely underrecognized complication that can occur in a Marjolin’s ulcer.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】A Marjolin’s ulcer is defined as malignant transformation occurring in long-standing burns, fissures, and ulcers. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) is an important paraneoplastic syndrome occurring in humans with a wide variety of cancers. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was originally isolated from specific tumors as the primary cause of HHM and is overexpressed by many types of neoplasms. While it has been well recognized that SCC of the lung and esophagus can secrete PTHrP causing HHM, it is rare for a cutaneous SCC to result in HHM with only six reported cases in the literature. We report the first case of a patient with a long-standing sacral decubitus ulcer found to have humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy secondary to the ulcer’s transformation to an SCC. This report underscores the importance of maintaining a high level of clinical suspicion for the possibility of a Marjolin’s ulcer in a patient who presents with elevated PTHrP and no other evidence of malignancy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Laboratory Measurements\n\n【6】All laboratory serum specimens were evaluated either at New York Presbyterian-Columbia Hospital (calcium and PTH) (New York, NY) or ARUP laboratories (PTHrP) (Salt Lake City, UT).\n\n【7】##### 2.2. Histology\n\n【8】The skin specimen was routinely processed after fixation with formaldehyde and stained with hematoxylin and eosin at the Dermatopathology Laboratory at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia.\n\n【9】#### 3\\. Results and Discussion\n\n【10】A 45-year-old African-American man with T6 paraplegia was admitted for malaise, weight loss, and a sacral decubitus ulcer for 20 years duration. The sacral decubitus ulcer had failed topical wound care and 6 split thickness skin grafts. On admission, he had hypercalcemia (15.4 mg/dL, normal range 8.7–10.2) with low vitamin D 25-OH (18 ng/mL, normal range 30–80), undetectable parathyroid hormone (PTH), and elevated parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) to 40 pg/mL (normal range 14–27). Cutaneous examination demonstrated a 16 × 27.5 cm friable ulcer with fibrinopurulent exudate covering the sacrum and buttocks with exposure of muscle and bone .\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| 16 × 27.5 cm friable ulcer with fibrinopurulent exudate and exophytic, granulation tissue centrally and peripherally. |\n| --- |\n\n【13】A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated soft tissue masses with bony destruction of the iliac spines and the L4 vertebral body . An excisional biopsy of the sacral ulcer was performed which showed epidermal erosion and irregular nests and cords of dysplastic keratinocytes infiltrating the dermis . Fine needle aspiration of the inguinal node showed malignant cells. The neoplastic cells were positive for pancytokeratin, CK5/6, and p63. They were negative for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, CDX-2, PSA, and HPV. The morphology and immunostaining patterns were compatible with squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated soft tissue masses with bony destruction of the iliac spines (green lines demarcate bony metastases). |\n| --- |\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| Histopathologic examination with hematoxylin-eosin staining showed epidermal erosion and irregular nests and cords of dysplastic keratinocytes infiltrating the dermis. |\n| --- |\n\n【18】The patient refused surgical management and radiation therapy. He was started on cetuximab. Following the third dose, he developed sepsis, was readmitted, and ultimately succumbed to septic shock 1.5 months after the initial dermatology consult. Autopsy showed extensive involvement of the superficial and deep tissues of the lower back, sacrum, buttocks, lower abdomen, groin, upper thighs, and perineum by a high grade SCC with direct extension into the abdominal cavity and marked destruction of the bony pelvis and femoral heads. Lymph node and pulmonary metastases were also identified.\n\n【19】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【20】Marjolin’s ulcer, first described by the late French surgeon Jean-Nicolas Marjolin in 1828, is the malignant transformation of long-standing burns, fissures, and ulcers, including leprous neurotrophic ulcers, and other chronically inflamed tissue processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most commonly associated malignancy is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) but other neoplasms including basal cell carcinoma and sarcomas have been described. The time necessary for malignant transformation of a sacral decubitus ulcer ranged from 20 to 70 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Abnormalities of calcium homeostasis are an uncommon complication of Marjolin’s ulcer. The amino terminus of parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) has significant homology to human parathyroid hormone (PTH) which allows it to bind to PTH/PTHrP kidney and bone receptors resulting in humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Hypercalcemia occurs because tumor-produced PTHrP interacts with the renal and bone PTH/PTHrP receptor. In the kidney, PTHrP stimulates phosphate excretion and reabsorption of calcium in the distal collecting ducts. In the skeleton, PTHrP induces osteoclastic bone resorption, resulting in elevation of the serum calcium concentration. All normal squamous cells can secrete PTHrP but only certain squamous cell tumors result in hypercalcemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is surprising that despite the high incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, hypercalcemia is an extremely rare complication of this neoplasm. Indeed, hypercalcemia associated with cutaneous SCC has been reported in fifteen cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6\\]</u>. Of those fifteen patients, six were found to have increased PTHrP levels strongly supporting the diagnosis of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, there have been only three published case reports of Marjolin’s ulcer associated with hypercalcemia. In one Marjolin’s ulcer case, serum levels of PTHrP were normal 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 8, 9\\]</u>. We describe the first case of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy secondary to a Marjolin’s ulcer. While the bony destruction from the SCC in our case may have contributed to the patient’s hypercalcemia, the finding of concomitantly elevated PTHrP strongly supports the paraneoplastic production of PTHrP as the primary cause of his hypercalcemia. Based on these findings, we recommend surveillance biopsies of long-standing sacral decubitus ulcers in patients found to have hypercalcemia and elevated PTHrP with no known malignancy.\n\n【22】#### 5\\. Conclusions\n\n【23】HHM is a rare and likely underrecognized complication that can occur in a Marjolin’s ulcer. Based on this case report and past literature, we recommend surveillance biopsies of long-standing decubitus ulcers to look for malignant transformation to SCC in patients who are found to be hypercalcemic with elevated PTHrP and no other evidence of malignancy.\n\n【24】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Michelle Levender, MD, for her clinical care of the patient and help with the interpretation of data.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

SOTI using IFN-gamma was successfully tried for FDEIA by wheat in this report.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Reports\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case 1\n\n【7】The patient was a 24-year-old woman weighing 44 kg. There was nothing notable in her family history. In 2008 (when she was 18 years old), she developed generalized urticaria, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, pale complexion, and loss of consciousness with running after intake of pork cutlet for the first time. She visited the emergency room and was treated with emergency care for anaphylaxis. Thereafter, she showed several history of severe generalized urticaria after intake of foods which contain wheat such as pork cutlet, pizza, spaghetti, and noodle. However, she did not show anaphylactic reactions including systemic urticaria every time when she took food containing wheat. She had to visit the emergency room because of anaphylaxis two times in the similar situation. After that, wheat was eliminated in her food living and there have been no symptoms and signs.\n\n【8】She visited the Republic of International Allergy Center, Pyeongtaek International Hospital (Pyeongtaek, Korea), for the tolerance induction for wheat from June 2012. It is recognized that anaphylaxis occurred with running until out of breath just after intake of food-containing foods in the past history.\n\n【9】###### 2.1.1. Laboratory Tests\n\n【10】Blood eosinophil % was 0.3%. Serum total IgE level was 90.8 KU/L. Specific IgE levels were 1.13 KU/L for wheat and not detected for eggs, milk, and soybeans. However, specific IgE was 0.55 KU/L for Dp and 0.40 KU/L for Df. The results of skin prick test for wheat are +++ (wheal size were 4 mm for eggs, 4 mm for histamine, and 0 mm for normal saline). Skin prick test for eggs, milk, soybeans, Dp, and Df is negative.\n\n【11】###### 2.1.2. OFC\n\n【12】Exercise provocation without intake of wheat was performed by running until out of breath for 10 minutes. Patients did not show any symptoms and signs by exercise provocation test. Food challenge tests were conducted according to the protocol for IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy as described in the previous report 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Wheat was given 6 times for three days with amount of 120 g as breakfast and dinner. Also, patients did not show any symptoms and signs by oral challenge test. However, allergy provocation occurred with exercise just after exercise by running until out of breath for 10 minutes. The severity scores were 0 before and 2000 after oral food challenge with exercise at the dose of 10 g of noodle . The symptoms and signs were generalized urticaria with rash, respiratory difficulty with choking sensation, hypotension, and palpitation. The food-dependent, exercise-induced food allergy (FDEIA) for wheat was made.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Diagnosis of food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (FDEIA) and the changes of clinical severity by oral challenge test and exercise provocation test (Case 1).

Case 2\n\n【22】The patient was a 36-year-old woman weighing 52 kg. There was nothing notable in her family history. In 2001 (when she was 27 years old), she developed generalized urticaria, dyspnea with chocking sensation of throat, vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of consciousness with running after intake of noodle for the first time. She also received emergency care for anaphylaxis. She showed frequent history of emergency care due to loss of consciousness as a symptom of anaphylaxis with running just after intake of wheat. Anaphylactic reactions never occurred only by wheat intake or only by exercise. She has kept restriction diet for wheat in her food living for the prevention of anaphylaxis.\n\n【23】She visited the Republic of Allergy Center, Department of Paediatrics, Chungnam National University Hospital (Daejeon, Korea), for the tolerance induction for wheat in 2010.\n\n【24】###### 2.2.1. Laboratory Tests\n\n【25】Blood eosinophil % was 5.1%. Serum total IgE level was 250.2 KU/L. Specific IgE levels were 4.1 KU/L for wheat and not detected for eggs, milk, and soybeans. However, specific IgE was 2.32 KU/L for Dp and 2.25 KU/L for Df. The results of skin prick test for wheat are +++ (wheal sizes were 3 mm for eggs, 3 mm for histamine and 0 mm for normal saline). Skin prick test for eggs, milk, soybeans, Dp, and Df is negative.\n\n【26】###### 2.2.2. OFC\n\n【27】She was negative in exercise provocation test without intake of wheat by running until out of breath for 10 minutes and in oral food challenge for wheat which was performed as described previously. Allergy provocation occurred at the dose of 30 g with exercise just after exercise by running until out of breath for 10 minutes with the severity scores of 2500. The symptoms and signs were generalized urticaria with rash, respiratory difficulty with choking sensation, hypotension, and palpitation. The food-dependent, exercise-induced food allergy (FDEIA) for wheat was made.\n\n【28】###### 2.2.3. Treatment\n\n【29】SOTI using IFN-gamma was performed. Noodle was used for wheat allergen. Scheduled dose of wheat was tried 10 minutes after receiving IFN-gamma 2,000,000 units within 10 minutes. After the intake of wheat, she ran for 10 minutes until out of breath. The initial dose is 0.01 g, and the dose of wheat was increased according to the protocol. The treatment followed the protocol for specific oral tolerance induction for IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy with just addition of exercise just after the intake of allergenic food.\n\n【30】The patient also showed allergy provocation many times during the treatment at the variable doses. Emergency care was done when she showed anaphylactic reactions. Treatment was restarted after a week. The treatment was repeated for the same dose until allergy provocation was not occurred at the same dose according to the principle of overcome of the dose of allergy provocation. The treatment was finished after 12 months days with 310 times of treatment.\n\n【31】After treatment, patient received oral food challenge with 120 g of wheat for the confirmation of tolerance acquisition. The patient show any symptoms and signs even with running just after intake of wheat no more for more than 2 years.\n\n【32】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【33】Specific oral tolerance induction using IFN-gamma was effective for the causative treatment of FDEIA. FDEIA is a form of IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy (IFA) caused by exercise after the intake of certain foods. The only difference between IFA and FDEIA is that FDEIA was provoked by exercise after intake of allergenic foods. Its major symptoms are also similar to IFA including generalized urticaria, angioedema (including facial swelling), respiratory impairment, hypotension, and disturbance of consciousness. Allergenic food in this report was wheat in both cases. The most common causative food was wheat, and it was reported that 60% of FDEIA was wheat dependent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Elimination diet for the allergenic foods in FDEIA is a way of prevention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. For prevention of FDEIA, it is important to avoid exercise after causative food intake; see also 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, patients possibly take foods containing allergenic foods without recognition because of many reasons. Preventive medication was also tried using oral sodium cromoglycate (SCG) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> and oral combined cetirizine-montelukast 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. When SCG was administered orally to food allergy patients before food intake, it reduced the symptoms. SOTI using IFN-gamma was completely successful in the treatment of IgE-mediated anaphylactic food allergy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. SOTI using IFN-gamma was applied to FDEIA and as we expected, SOTI using IFN-gamma was successful as a causative treatment with modified protocol in which exercise provocation should be included just after the intake of allergenic food. Both patients did not show any symptoms and signs with any exercise after intake of wheat for more than 2 years, and they got the tolerance for the allergenic foods. There has been no causative treatment for FDEIA except temporary preventive symptomatic treatment as described previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. However, the severity of disease is fatal, although the patients are always exposed to the causative allergens in their daily living. This treatment is recommended for all FDEIA patients.\n\n【35】Allergy provocation and achievement of tolerance occurred in the low-dose zone for anaphylactic IgE-mediated food allergy and in the high-dose zone for non-IgE-mediated food allergy. Interestingly, the tolerance acquisition of tolerance occurred in the high-dose zone in FDEIA, even though the characteristics of FDEIA are IgE-mediated food allergy. IgE-mediated food allergy seems to be consisted of heterogeneous diseases.\n\n【36】Anaphylaxis is not the disease and rather a group of symptoms and signs which may be provoked by multiple causes. Moreover, exercise seems to be aggravation factor rather than the cause. So, exercise-induced food allergy (EIFA) may be a more precise terminology than food-dependent exercise-induced food allergy (FDEIA). Further clinical trial and basic studies may be needed. Conclusively, SOTI using IFN-gamma was effective as the causative treatment for allergenic foods in FDEIA or EIFA.\n\n【37】#### Abbreviations\n\n| FDEIA: | Food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis |\n| --- | --- |\n| SOTI: | Specific oral tolerance induction. |\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【40】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The autyors would like to express there gratitude to Yea Hee Yoo (N), Geunwoong Noh’s wife, for her excellent help to finish this work.

The laboratory analysis showed moderate hypoosmolar hyponatremia (Na: 132 mmol/L, osmolality: 239 mOsm/L), normal sodium excretion (<20 mmol/L), and a high urinary osmolality (415 mOsm/L). Later, she deteriorated with seizures and deeper hyponatremia (Na: 113 mmol/L) and so was moved to the critical care unit. At first, no obvious aetiology was found, the patient was euvolemic, as she was well hydrated and lacked concerning findings of heart failure, renal disease, or liver cirrhosis. A syndrome of inappropriate diuresis (SIAD) was proposed, and corrective measures were started immediately to reduce her hyponatremia, including restriction of fluid intake. The administration of intravenous hypertonic saline solution permitted normal neurological status to be restored and corrected the sodium concentration but induced reversible acute renal failure. Further investigation revealed that the patient had ingested 8 g ibuprofen two days before admission. After other aetiologies were ruled out, drug-induced SIAD due to ibuprofen was the most likely diagnosis for this patient. SIAD-associated hyponatremia and acute renal failure are rare side effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, particularly in young people. Therefore, this case may represent a unique case of NSAID-induced SIAD and highlight the need to obtain thorough medication histories and exclude all other potential causes in hyponatremic patients.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The syndrome of inappropriate diuresis (SIAD) is the most common disorder of sodium and water balance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be distinguished from several other types of hyponatremia because each requires different management. The most common causes are increased hypothalamic production of ADH, due to neuropsychiatric disorders, drugs, pulmonary diseases, HIV infection, or ectopic production of ADH which occurs in carcinoma, lymphosarcoma, or leukaemia.\n\n【4】Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) drug used to treat moderate pain and/or fever. The recommended dose varies with body mass and indication. A dose of 400 mg to 1200 mg per day (i.e. 17 to 36 mg/kg) is considered the maximum amount for over-the-counter use 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Despite a very wide use, ibuprofen is rarely associated with severe toxicity. Drugs as NSAIDs cause SIAD by enhancing the action of ADH at the renal tubule level. However, the proportion of drug-induced SIAD resulting from NSAID is less than 0.5% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. An idiopathic form of the syndrome has been reported, but poorly documented. Also, 5% of SIAD is thought to be idiopathic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and is a discrete category of SIAD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Maybe a proportion of these are actually ibuprofen induced. In the USA, from 1988 to 1990, 50 614 intoxications with NSAIDs were described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, predominantly with ibuprofen. 131 patients (0.26%) had major outcomes with 10 deaths (drug overdose). In Great Britain in 2003, enquiries about the management of patients possibly suffering from ibuprofen overdose account for over 5% of the total enquiries received by the London Centre of the UK National Poisons Information Service. In each of the 1033 cases, there were complicating factors related to other drugs and/or other diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Regarding the cases described in the literature, elderly and comorbid patients develop drug-induced SIAD more than young people. We report a rare case of a 30-year-old healthy and euvolemic woman who developed severe hyponatremia and acute renal failure after absorption of 152 mg/kg ibuprofen. After a thorough investigation and exclusion of more common causes, SAID was thought to be drug induced.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 30-year-old woman was admitted to the infectious diseases unit for fever and nausea (without vomiting) evolving over 5 days and resistant to analgesic and antipyretic drugs (acetaminophen). She was not anorexic, had no significant past medical history, under no medication, and she denied any medical or toxic ingestions. Temperature was 37°C, pulse rate was 100 b/min, and blood pressure was 150/70 mmHg. Physical examination did not reveal any abnormality, and EKG and chest X-ray were normal. Laboratory analysis only showed a mild biological inflammation (c-reactive protein: 8 mg/L) and a moderate hyponatremia (132 mmol/L). The results for the remaining biological tests were in the normal range (potassium: 3.8 mmol/L, chlorine: 96 mmol/L, urea: 2.8 mmol/L, and creatinine: 55 mmol/L). Urinalysis showed no abnormality and additional urine toxicological testing exclude drugs abuse. The next day, she complained of nausea, headache, and diffuse pain evocative of meningism.\n\n【7】The cerebrospinal fluid was acellular without biochemical abnormality. A brain MRI excluded an intracranial bleed or other focal abnormality, whereas an EEG showed signs of encephalopathy. Biochemistry tests were within normal limits, except serum sodium levels (113 mmol/L) and osmolality (239 mOsm/L). Natriuresis and urinary osmolality were preserved (137 mmol/L and 415 mOsm/L, resp.). On day 2, despite normal saline perfusion (2 litres in 24 hours) and presumptive antiinfective treatments (amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, and aciclovir), the patient convulsed and was transferred to intensive care unit. Her natremia fell to 105 mmol/L on day 3 (osmolality: 231 mOsml/L). Cortisol and adrenocorticotrophic hormone levels were normal (random cortisol and ACTH stimulation test); aldosterone levels were 3 times higher than normal and vasopressin (ADH) was within normal limits (2.39 pg/mL). Fluid restriction was undertaken and sodium levels reached 124 mmol/L in 24 hours. While neurological disorders were improving, acute renal failure occurred (creatinine levels rose from 36 to 259 μmol/L, BUN rose to 6.9 mmol/L), so fluid restriction was stopped. On day 6, the patient was apyretic and renal function was restored with natremia reaching 132 mmol/L. Several aetiologies were ruled out (viral, bacterial, and toxic, including heavy metals), and there was no evidence of psychogenic polydypsia (nursing staff did not report any excessive drinking). She had no known cause of antidiuresis. There was no argument for hypervolemia (congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, or nephrosis), hypovolemia (haemorrhage, gastroenteritis, or diuretic abuse), renal failure, or adrenal failure. Thyroid function tests and chest radiography gave normal results. Neuropsychiatry disorders were excluded, as well as pulmonary diseases (tuberculosis or lung abscess), HIV infection, meningitis, encephalitis, and ectopic production of ADH (carcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease …). Further investigations led to the discovery that the patient had ingested more than 20 tablets of ibuprofen 400 mg (representing 152 mg/kg) for back pain in the two days before admission to hospital. The outcome was favourable and the patient left hospital 12 days later.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Hyponatremia is a common disorder, usually more prevalent in older adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. SIAD is the most common form of normovolaemic or dilutional hyponatremia. The diagnosis of SIAD is based on five criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>: hypotonic hyponatremia (natremia < 135 mmol/L), persistent urinary sodium excretion (>30 mmol/L), plasmatic osmolality < 280 mOsmol/L, urine osmolality in excess of plasma osmolality, absence of oedema, or volume depletion, and normal renal, adrenal, or thyroid function 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Clinical features are nonspecific, mainly neurological, and can threaten life. The severity of symptoms is related to both the absolute serum sodium concentration and its rapid decrease, particularly if greater than 0.5 mmol/L/h, which most likely explains the seizure activity in our patient. The management of SIAD patients may include efficient treatment of the primitive disease and removal of excess total body water. Fluid restriction remains the safe mainstay of hyponatremia management, as applied to our patient. Unfortunately, a convulsive episode associated with severe hyponatremia (113 mmol/L) occurred, requiring its rapid correction, as recommended by most guidelines 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Inappropriate antidiuresis is usually due to the administration or endogeneous production of ADH, causing renal water reabsorption and resulting in hyponatremia with increasing extracellular fluid volume. Endogenous production can be either eutopic or ectopic, induced by a wide variety of diseases (cancers, neurological disorders, and lung diseases), drugs, or injuries . Whereas some drugs are implied in ADH stimulation (carbamazepine and vincristine), other drugs (NSAIDs and chlorpropamide) enhance its action at the renal tubule level 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> or play a role in prostaglandin inhibition (such as ibuprofen). For the reported patient, we ruled out many causes of SIAD after analysis of her history, physical examination, and initial medical record. Ibuprofen-induced SIAD was the most likely diagnosis despite her young age. NSAIDs can adversely affect the kidney because they can induce sodium retention and antagonize the action of diuretics, impair free-water clearance, and cause hyponatremia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Similar cases have been described in the past, but the patients suffered from chronic diseases such as advanced chronic renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, von Willebrand’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>, or were extremely old (>80 y) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【11】Table 1 \n\n【12】Most common causes of SIADH.\n\n【13】Whereas over-the-counter antipyretics and/or analgesics are relatively safe for adults, cyclooxygenase inhibitors may induce a wide variety of side effects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, which usually concern elderly patients or are found in critical situations such as hypovolemia or anesthesia. Except for newborns 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>, acute renal failure is rarely described in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18, 19\\]</u>, but the low report of cases is probably underestimated since renal failure is often moderate and diuresis preserved. The Naranjo criteria classify the probability that an adverse event is related to drug therapy based on a list of weighted questions, which examine factors such as the temporal association of drug administration and event occurrence, alternative causes for the event, drug levels, dose-response relationships, and previous patient experience with the medication. In our case report, the score was five, so the adverse drug reaction was classified as probable. But the Naranjo criteria do not take into account drug-drug interactions. Moreover, other causes as back pain, an undiagnosed viral infection, are also plausible explanations of what happened.\n\n【14】This case stresses the importance in asking about history specifically pertaining to analgesics as commonly patients may not be open about the use of these medications because they are over-the-counter, easily accessible and viewed to be benign ingestions by the general public.\n\n【15】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【16】This clinical case stresses the importance that clinicians should give to recognising NSAIDs as a potential cause for patients who present with SIAD, even where there are no risk factors such as extreme age or renal failure.\n\n【17】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【18】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors report no conflict of interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Traumatic and iatrogenic disruption of the limited blood flow to the distal end of the humerus resulting in avascular necrosis of capitellum or trochlea is a major pitfall of the this technically challenging procedure. Two cases are presented which illustrate the potential problems of intra-articular osteotomy for malunion of the distal humerus.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Distal humerus fractures are uncommon, accounting for only 2 percent of all fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Open reduction and internal fixation to restore articular anatomy and allow early motion to prevent stiffness 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> is the preferred treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Despite rapid improvements in operative management, fractures of the distal end of the humerus are still among the most difficult fractures to treat.

Although challenging, in young active patients early fixation is recommended, despite the complexity of the fracture. An unsatisfactory outcome is common for this patient population when minimal treatment is used to treat the initial fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In the rare case of malunion, intra-articular or supracondylar osteotomy to restore humeral alignment and provide a more useful arc of motion is legitimate. In the case of an extra-articular osteotomy to correct flexion or extension alignment, treatment can be indicated despite the presence of posttraumatic arthrosis of an incongruent elbow joint.

Case Report\n\n【7】Our patient was a 48-year-old dentist who was seen 10 months after a high energy fall that resulted in a complex type C3 intra-articular fracture of her left nondominant distal humerus (Figure 1(a)). Initial treatment performed at an outside institution consisted of static external fixation with the arm in flexion and the forearm in neutral rotation (Figure 1(b)). The external fixator was removed after 8 weeks and the follow-up radiographs revealed delayed union which resulted in intra-articular malunion of the distal humerus. The patient was referred to the senior author (RKM) with substantial overlength of the capitellum resulting in 25 degrees cubitus varus deformity. Flexion extension arc was 95 degrees with a 35-degree flexion contracture. Her forearm rotation was normal. She did not have pain and did not opt for surgery at this point. Four months later, she reported substantial pain and lost all her active motion. The patient opted for surgery mainly to regain extension in order to return to work. Neurological examination was unremarkable. She had no signs of ulnar neuropathy.\n\n【8】(a)\n\n【9】(b)\n\n【10】(c)\n\n【11】(d)\n\n【12】(e)\n\n【13】(f)\n\n【14】(a) (b) (c) (d) (e)   \n(f)\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| (a) Our patient was a 48-year-old dentist who was seen 10 months after a high energy fall that resulted in a complex intra-articular fracture of her left nondominant distal humerus. (b) Initial treatment performed at an outside institution consisted of static external fixation with the arm in 90° flexion and the forearm in neutral rotation. (c) The external fixator was removed after 8 weeks and follow-up the radiographs revealed distal humerus intra-articular malunion. (d) An oscillating saw was used to create a trapezoid wedge to correct overlength varus of the lateral column and flexion of the capitellum in order to realign capitellum and trochlea. Extreme caution was taken no to disrupt blood supply of the capitellum. (e) The patient had loss of anterior translation of the distal end of the humerus resulting in loss of flexion of 35 degrees, with 10 degrees of hyperextension of the left elbow. (f) Patient opted for removal of hardware and extra-articular excavation of the prominent ventral distal humerus creating a new fossa coronoidea in order to gain flexion. |\n| --- |\n\n【17】She underwent corrective a transverse osteotomy 18 months after her initial injury. A midline posterior incision, with medial and lateral skin flaps elevated, was used. The olecranon osteotomy provided a complete overview of the dorsal distal humerus, including the radiohumeral joint and the ulnar nerve. An oscillating saw was used to create a trapezoid wedge to correct overlength varus of the lateral column and flexion of the capitellum in order to realign capitellum and trochlea. Extreme caution was taken no to disrupt the anterior blood supply of the capitellum. A second supracondylar wedge was resected to correct cubitus varus and 20 degrees of internal rotation. The capitellum radii was fixed to the ulnar condyle using an isolated lag screw (Figure 1(c)). Iliac crest bone graft was used to improve bone healing and fixation was achieved with a lateral 7hour-LCDC plate and screws. The olecranon osteotomy was fixed with screw-tension band technique (Figure 1(d)). Intraoperative ulnohumeral motion was 90 degrees of flexion with full extension after debridement of the olecranon fossa. The elbow was placed in a cast in full extension for 24 hours.\n\n【18】She had loss of anterior translation of the distal end of the humerus resulting in 90 degrees of flexion and 5 degrees of hyperextension of the left elbow (Figure 1(e)). The patient was satisfied initially with her stable function elbow and 95 degrees of ulnohumeral motion. However, 18 months postoperatively she decided to have removal of hardware and an extra-articular excavation of the prominent ventral distal humerus creating a new fossa coronoidea in order to gain flexion. Her final flexion improved to 110 degrees with 5 degrees of hyperextension (Figure 1(f)). She had a functional outcome, quantified as 95 points by the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Elbow Evaluation Instrument and the Mayo Elbow Performance Index. Continuous passive motion was initiated 24 hours after surgery and therapy was started.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to specifically address intra-articular osteotomy to treat distal humerus malunion. However, small series have been published as part of surgical technique and clinical outcome papers on intra- and extra-articualar malunion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. McKee and Jupiter reported on two malunited fractures of the distal humerus that underwent intra-articular osteotomy in a series of distal humerus malunion and nonunion with good results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The cornerstone of treatment of fractures of the distal humerus is operative reduction and internal fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–13\\]</u>. Pessimism regarding these fractures is not justified with contemporary methods of internal fixation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. However, routine in treatment does not exist due to the rarity of these fractures. In addition, the complex articular surface and meager amount of cancellous bone still makes operative treatment a substantial challenge.\n\n【22】Nonunion and malunion of distal humerus fractures treated operatively is rare. Only 2% of all fractures involve the distal humerus, and 2% of these result in malunion. Intra-articular osteotomy for malunion to achieve a functional arc of motion and to prevent subsequent posttraumatic arthritis in the elbow joint is rarely indicated in the young demanding patient. Therefore, experience with treatment of intra-articular malunited fractures is very limited and reports seldom appear in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–9\\]</u>. We feel that total elbow arthroplasty for malunion of the distal humerus is a treatment option reserved for low-demand elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【23】If the patient present at an early stage, an intra-articular osteotomy is considered if original fracture lines can be osteotomized and posttraumatic arthrosis is limited. Extra-articular osteotomy is indicated when intra-articular congruency of the elbow joint cannot be restored and secondary posttraumatic arthrosis is too advanced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. Preoperative planning is paramount to assess if it is technically feasible to restore ulnohumeral congruency (Figure 1(c)).\n\n【24】Stability of the elbow joint and a functional arc of motion were achieved in this case. After intra-articular osteotomy, the patient had only 90 degrees of flexion due to loss of anterior translation of the distal humerus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Initial loss of flexion was accepted by patient and surgeon to avoid devascularization of the distal end of the humerus. After avoiding too much dissection during the index procedure in case one, the patient opted for a successful subsequent procedure to gain flexion. Satisfactory functional outcome was quantified by the Mayo Elbow Performance Index and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Evaluation Instrument.\n\n【25】Surgical reconstruction of the intra-articular malunited distal humerus is technically challenging but can improve function in the young active adult by restoring intrinsic anatomy of the elbow.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Diagnosis based on bronchial washing cytology is rarely reported because this tumor is usually lined by normal mucosa. A 35-year-old woman was referred to our center as a case of unresponsive asthma and hemoptysis for the past year. CT scan showed tracheal mass. Bronchoscopy was done followed by bronchial washing cytology and biopsy. Cytology smears revealed sheets and three-dimensional clusters of small cells, and some of them arranged around hyaline mucoid globules. Cell block and biopsy showed classic pathological findings of adenoid cystic carcinoma. Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the airways can be manifested with nonspecific symptoms and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of airway diseases and asthma. This tumor is rarely seen in the bronchial washing specimen. Characteristic cytological findings and using cell block preparation differentiate adenoid cystic carcinoma from other tumors.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The incidence of primary tracheal tumors is infrequent. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a malignant tumor that mainly arises from major and minor salivary glands 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】ACC of the lung arises from bronchial glands and mostly appears in the trachea and main bronchi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. It is a rare disease and constitutes about 0.04–0.2% of the primary lung tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In the past, this tumor was called bronchial adenoma, which is a wrong terminology because ACC is not a benign tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【5】There is limited epidemiologic data about ACC of the lung. Based on few studies, the mean age is 46 years (range of 22–73 years) and male to female incidence ratio is different in various studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Symptoms are nonspecific, including cough, shortness of breath, and occasionally hemoptysis. Some patients might be misdiagnosed as asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Characteristic findings for ACC are not reported in CT scan or bronchoscopy, and thus the diagnosis is based on pathology.\n\n【6】Fine needle aspiration cytology is a routine method for sampling of ACC of salivary glands, but it is used rarely in airways. Bronchial washing and brushing is the popular cytology method in airways and the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【7】In the trachea and bronchi, ACC is usually covered by intact mucosa, and tumor cells are not found in bronchial cytology specimens. In rare cases, tumor invades to overlying mucosa, and tumor cells can be seen in bronchial washing or bronchial brushing specimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【9】A 35-year-old female presented with cough and shortness of breath for the past year. She was treated as asthma but did not respond, and hemoptysis appeared. CT scan was performed, and soft tissue mass arising from the posterior and lateral wall of the trachea with mediastinum extension was reported. The patient was undergoing bronchoscopy, and tracheal mass 3 cm above carina with invasion to the lateral wall of trachea was detected. Bronchial washing and biopsy were performed.\n\n【10】Alcohol-fixed smears from the bronchial washing specimen were prepared.\n\n【11】Smears were stained with the modified Papanicolaou method. Cytology showed hypercellular smears composed of loosely cohesive sheets, three-dimensional clusters, and dispersed cells. Cells were relatively small and uniform with round nuclei, small nucleoli, and scant cytoplasm. Throughout the smears, acellular hyaline materials with globule formation in different sizes were seen, and some of them were enveloped by tumor cells .\n\n【12】(a)\n\n【13】(b)\n\n【14】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【16】Cytology smears.

The patient was undergoing resection surgery, but unfortunately, complete resection was not possible, and then she was referred for radiotherapy.\n\n【30】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【31】Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the lung is a rare disease and presents with nonspecific symptoms. It can be misdiagnosed as asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Imaging and bronchoscopy cannot differentiate ACC from other tumors such as carcinoid tumor or squamous cell carcinoma, and final diagnosis was based on pathology. In most cases, bronchial cytology is negative because the tumor is covered by intact mucosa. Sometimes overlying mucosa is ulcerated and makes the diagnosis based on bronchial washing cytology possible 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>. Cytology smears show monolayer sheets, three-dimensional clusters, and many isolated cells. Tumor cells are small and uniform with round nuclei, small nucleoli, and minimal cytoplasm. In the background, acellular hyaline materials and spherical globules are seen. Some of these hyaline globules are surrounded by tumor cells; this finding is a significant diagnostic feature of ACC. Using the cell block shows characteristic features of ACC, including tubular structures and a cribriform pattern with acidophilic materials and facilitates the diagnosis of ACC.\n\n【32】Carcinoid tumor and small cell carcinoma are made of small cells; therefore, they are in differential diagnosis with ACC in cytology. Characteristic granular chromatin and absence of hyaline globules favor carcinoid tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Features of small cell carcinoma, including granular chromatin, crush artifact, necrosis, and apoptotic bodies, are absent in ACC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【33】Tumor cells surrounding hyaline materials may be misdiagnosed as true glands, so well-differentiated adenocarcinoma enters in the differential diagnosis. Cytonuclear atypia of adenocarcinoma and absence of hyaline globules differentiates it from ACC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【34】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【35】The incidence of ACC in the trachea is infrequent, but it is crucial to consider this tumor if a patient does not respond to antiasthmatic therapy. In these cases, proper imaging with careful attention to cytologic criteria and preparing the cell block makes the accurate diagnosis possible.\n\n【36】#### Consent\n\n【37】A formal written consent was obtained from the patient.\n\n【38】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【39】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This condition poses a latent risk of bed sores. To prevent those complications, we used electroacupuncutre for decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. A 51-year-old man complained of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Prior to electroacupuncture, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium and baclofen. However, his rigidity had not improved. This patient received total 41 sessions of electroacupuncture. The patient’s Modified Ashworth’s Scale changed from 4 at baseline to 2 after the treatment, indicating an improvement in the rigidity of the upper limbs. Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale and passive ROM of the elbow joints also improved. We report the observed effects of electroacupuncture for decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in a patient with anoxic brain damage. Further controlled studies are needed to determine whether electroacupuncture is a useful alternative treatment for decorticate rigidity in patients with anoxic brain damage.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】We report a case of decorticated rigidity due to anoxic brain damage that was successfully treated with electro-acupuncture combined with conventional therapeutic options such as muscle relaxants and physical manual therapy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case History\n\n【5】##### 2.1. Patient Characteristics and Diagnosis\n\n【6】A 51-year-old man complaining of rigidity of both of the upper and lower extremities due to anoxic brain damage was admitted to the Department of Cardiovascular and Neurological Diseases of Kyung Hee University Oriental Medicine Hospital. This patient had collapsed during a marathon and had received cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The doctors recognized acute myocardial infarction (MI) and provided conventional therapies for this condition. However, anoxic brain damage was caused by insufficient blood supply to the brain. He manifested rigidity, dyspnea, and dysphagia. His rigidity was exhibited as flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticate rigidity. Although this patient had underlying hypertension and diabetes mellitus, he and his family had not recognized these conditions until onset of MI. At admission, he revealed GCS score 7 (E4 V0 M3) and used tracheostomy tube, nasogastric tube. The brain computed tomography (CT) image taken at admission  revealed severe cerebral cortical atrophy. Laboratory data did not reveal abnormal values for all items. He was admitted to Kyung Hee University Oriental Medicine Hospital 3 months after onset. Prior to his admission, his decorticate rigidity was treated with dantrolene sodium (25 mg) and baclofen (5 mg). However, his rigidity had not improved, and his condition had remained the same since onset.\n\n【7】(a)\n\n【8】(b)\n\n【9】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| The brain computed tomography (CT) image at onset and admission time.

Treatment\n\n【13】Electro-acupuncture was performed as a therapy for symptoms of decorticated rigidity of the upper limbs. Daily electro-acupuncture treatment was performed between 14:00 and 15:00 for 41 consecutive days (PG-306, Japan). The acupoints used in this case were LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4, bilaterally. The following conditions were used: stimulation wave, biphasic (60 Hz); pulse duration, 0.4 ms; and stimulation strength, low. The electrical stimulation power was the same for each treatment (Pulse Generator PG-306, Suzuki Inc. Japan). The patient’s elbow joints and wrists showed mild movement during electro-acupuncture therapy. Each treatment procedure lasted 20 min and was performed by skilled specialists (Korean Medicine Doctor (KMD)) by using stainless steel acupuncture needles (Dongbang Acupuncture Inc. Korea; 40 mm (length) × 0.25 mm (diameter)). Furthermore, Bojungikgitang, a Korean herbal medicine decoction, is administered to control general condition of this patient. There was no change in total daily dose of dantrolene sodium and baclofen before and after electro-acupuncture treatment.\n\n【14】##### 2.3. Evaluation Methods\n\n【15】We used 3 methods to evaluate the effect of electro-acupuncture on the patient’s rigidity: the Modified Ashworth’s Scale (MAS)  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, and the measurement of the passive range of motion (ROM) of the elbow joints.\n\n【16】Table 1 \n\n【17】The Modified Ashworth’s Scale for grading spasticity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Table 2 \n\n【19】Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【20】##### 2.4. Course of Symptoms\n\n【21】The patient was treated for 41 days, and the results are presented graphically in Figures 1, 2, and 3. The initial MAS score of 4 improved slightly during the procedure: the first improvement in this score (3 points) was observed after the 6th treatment, and a further improvement to 2 points was noted by the time of the 24th treatment. The MAS score remained at 2 points at the last session . The initial Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale score of 3 fell to 2 points after the 6th treatment. Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale score of 1 was noted at the time of the 24th treatment, and this value remained unchanged until the last treatment .\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| MAS score changes.

With continuous electro-acupuncture therapy, the passive ROM of both elbow joints improved. Approximately 24 days after initiating treatment, the passive ROM of left elbow joint increased to 180° and the passive ROM of the right elbow joint increased to 90°. The passive ROMs of the left elbow joint and the right elbow joint remained constant at 180° and 90°, respectively, until the last treatment .\n\n【27】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| Passive ROM changes of both elbow joints.

Abnormal posturing is an involuntary flexion or extension of the arms and legs, indicating severe brain injury. Decorticate rigidity exhibited as flexion of the upper limbs and extension of the lower limbs indicates damage in the cerebral hemispheres, the internal capsule, and the thalamus. Our patient’s rigidity was a result of anoxic brain damage due to myocardial infarction.\n\n【31】This patient exhibited flexed arms and extended legs, which are the typical positions in decorticated rigidity. This patient was diagnosed with anoxic brain damage on the basis of his medical history, symptoms, and brain imaging. Although he had been treated with conventional therapies for rigidity (muscle relaxants and physical therapy) after diagnosis, his symptoms did not improve before he was admitted to KyungHee University Oriental Medicine Hospital. The patient’s family and caregiver had trouble in moving the patient owing to his severe rigidity. Furthermore, his rigidity made it difficult to change his position for preventing the formation of decubitus ulcers, and this patient was at latent risk of bedsores.\n\n【32】Several studies have shown that electro-acupuncture can treat rigidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. One of these studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> has suggested that high-frequency and low-strength electro-acupuncture on LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 can reduce rigidity of the upper limbs in stroke patients. Because the rigidity of the upper limbs of stroke patients exhibits a flexion, the authors of this study used acupoints LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 to stimulate the arm extensor muscle group, which is an antagonist of the arm flexor muscle group. Although the diagnosis of the present case was anoxic brain damage, we observed a form of rigidity in this patient that was similar to that in stroke patients, namely, flexion of the upper limbs. As mentioned above, conventional therapy did not improve his rigidity. Thus, we used electro-acupuncture therapy based on the previous study in stroke patients (acupoints LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 and a high-frequency/low strength stimulation method (60 Hz, 0.4 ms pulse duration, and low strength)) to relieve our patient’s arm rigidity symptoms.\n\n【33】In the present study, the patient’s upper limb rigidity gradually improved during the follow-up period. The MAS score and Preston’s Hypertonicity Scale improved at both the 6th and 24th sessions. The passive ROM of both elbow joints also improved during the 41 sessions, and notably, the passive ROM of the left elbow joint showed a normal value at the endpoint. Therefore, we believe that electro-acupuncture was effective for treating this patient’s upper limb rigidity.\n\n【34】In general, anoxic brain damage which results in coma causes a vegetative state, and these patients will remain in a vegetative state until death. Therefore, prognosis of anoxic brain damage is very poor. And patients who reveal decorticate rigidity are in a coma or vegetative state and have poor prognoses, with risks for cardiac or respiratory arrest 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, in this case, there were improvements in upper limbs rigidity due to anoxic brain damage. Thus, we could make it easy to move a patient and to change the patient’s position to prevent a decubitus ulcer and related complications such as pneumonia. We think that the use of electro-acupuncture for decorticate rigidity not only decreased tone of muscle of upper limbs but also prevented complications.\n\n【35】Baclofen is used to treat rigidity in conventional drug treatments 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. However, patients who have nephropathy cannot use baclofen owing to its toxicity; moreover, a previous study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> has suggested that patients on dialysis are exposed to nephrotoxicity during baclofen intake. Therefore, baclofen cannot be used to treat rigidity in patients who have nephropathy. We believe that electro-acupuncture may be an alternative for treating decorticate rigidity in elderly people undergoing dialysis. In our case, treatment with conventional therapy (drugs and physical therapy) for decorticate rigidity did not result in improvement, but improvement was noted in the rigidity of the upper limbs after treatment with electro-acupuncture. Therefore, we propose that electro-acupuncture is a therapeutic option in patients who show no improvement despite therapy.\n\n【36】A limitation of the present case study is that we could not treat the rigidity of the lower limbs. The patient’s lower limbs exhibited extension, but we could not find any studies in the literature that provided therapeutic methods for lower-limb rigidity. In addition, because the symptoms of the lower limbs were less severe than those of the upper limbs at the time of admission, we concentrated our efforts on treating the rigidity of the upper limbs. Studies that provide data about treating lower-limb rigidity are required in the future. Furthermore, additional research is needed to determine the efficacy of electro-acupuncture on decorticate rigidity.\n\n【37】In summary, 41 days of electro-acupuncture treatment of LI11, LI10, TE5, and LI4 improved the rigidity of the upper limbs in patients with anoxic brain damage. Although it is difficult to draw conclusions based on a case study of only 1 patient, we propose that further studies would help determine whether electro-acupuncture is a plausible alternative in the treatment of decorticate rigidity of the upper limbs in patients with anoxic brain damage.\n\n【38】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【39】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We report a young woman with a history of several spontaneous miscarriages who presented with menorrhagia and hemoptysis. The patient developed respiratory failure due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. Laboratory tests demonstrated severe hemolytic anemia, profound thrombocytopenia, markedly elevated fibrin degradation products, and renal failure. Blood films revealed numerous schistocytes. Serologic tests disclosed hypocomplementemia and autoantibodies directed against several nuclear antigens. Coagulation studies revealed lupus anticoagulant. Echocardiography demonstrated reduced ejection fraction and moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. The patient was diagnosed with CAPS with hemorrhagic manifestations in the setting of new-onset SLE. The patient was treated with hemodialysis, high-dose glucocorticoids, plasma exchange, intravenous cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Over the ensuing four weeks, the combination therapy led to hematological, cardiopulmonary, and renal recovery. This exceedingly rare case emphasizes that hemorrhagic manifestations, severe microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and profound thrombocytopenia can dominate the clinical picture in CAPS.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by vascular thrombosis, pregnancy complications, or both due to antiphospholipid antibodies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. APS is due to pathogenic autoantibodies directed against proteins that interact with phospholipids. The disorder is referred to as primary when it occurs in the absence of another autoimmune disease. Secondary APS occurs in the setting of an autoimmune disorder such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a rare life-threatening form of APS in which disseminated vascular thrombosis results in multiorgan failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u>. On a rare occasion, CAPS is associated with hemorrhagic manifestations such as diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We report an exceedingly rare case of CAPS in the setting of new-onset SLE, in which the clinical picture was dominated by hemorrhagic manifestations including DAH and menorrhagia as well as severe microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and profound thrombocytopenia.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 32-year-old woman was transferred to our hospital for the management of severe acute thrombotic microangiopathy resulting in multiorgan failure.\n\n【7】The patient was in her usual state of health until she experienced heavy menstrual bleeding. Two days later, she developed fatigue and dyspnea on exertion while at work. She returned home and went to bed early to rest. Overnight, she developed cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was transported to a local hospital for evaluation. Her past medical history was notable for several spontaneous miscarriages and recent hair loss. She was a native of Haiti and worked in a local restaurant in Miami. She denied use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. On physical examination, the patient was a well-developed young woman in respiratory distress. The temperature was 37.0°C, the blood pressure 121/66 mm Hg, the pulse 106 beats/minute, the respiratory rate 42 breaths/minute, and the oxygen saturation 79% while breathing ambient air. Auscultation of the lungs demonstrated diffuse crackles. Chest radiograph revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Supplemental oxygen was administered. However, the patient developed hemoptysis and was immediately intubated.\n\n【8】Laboratory data are summarized under “Day 1” in Table 1. There were severe hemolytic anemia, profound thrombocytopenia, and severe renal disease leading to azotemia, hyperkalemia, anion-gap metabolic acidosis, proteinuria, and hematuria. Blood films revealed numerous schistocytes. In addition, there were leukocytosis, neutrophilia, monocytosis, and hypoalbuminemia. Coagulation studies demonstrated markedly elevated D-Dimer. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated. Serologic tests disclosed antibodies against nuclear antigens including double-stranded DNA, chromatin, Smith antigen, ribonucleoproteins, SSA/Ro, and SSB/La. Complement C3 level was reduced and C4 was low-normal. Antibodies against glomerular basement membrane were not detected. Indirect immunofluorescence staining for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies demonstrated a weak cytoplasmic pattern (c-ANCA). Plasma ADAMTS-13 activity (a disintegrin and metalloprotease, with thrombospondin-1—like domains) was normal. Serologic tests for hepatitis B and C and HIV were negative. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed reduced ejection fraction (45–50%) without regional wall motion abnormality as well as moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n【9】Table 1 \n\n【10】Laboratory data.\n\n【11】The patient was diagnosed with severe acute thrombotic microangiopathy, DAH, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease in the setting of new-onset SLE. Over the ensuing two weeks, she was treated with high-dose glucocorticoids including intravenous methylprednisolone 1 g/day for three days, plasma exchange (a total of eight daily treatments), intravenous cyclophosphamide 1 g, and multiple blood transfusions . Hemodialysis was initiated for worsening renal function. Since no tangible recovery could be appreciated, intravenous rituximab (0.5 g) was administered.

Bloody secretions were noted in the endotracheal tube. There were alopecia and hyperpigmented areas on the scalp. There were punctuate subconjunctival hemorrhage bilaterally and scattered petechiae on the lower extremities. Pitting edema was present over shins. Chest radiography revealed extensive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Renal ultrasonography revealed enlarged kidneys (13.2 cm in length) with increased echogenicity. There was no hydronephrosis, masses, or stones. Laboratory data are summarized under “Day 17” in Table 1. There were neutrophilia, lymphopenia, hemolytic anemia, profound thrombocytopenia, hypoalbuminemia, and renal insufficiency. Blood films revealed numerous schistocytes. Urinalysis revealed proteinuria and hematuria. Urinary protein excretion was estimated at 14.6 g/day based on a random urine protein to creatinine ratio. Urine sediment revealed numerous white blood cells and dysmorphic red blood cells. Several red blood cell casts and muddy brown casts were also observed. Serologic tests confirmed antinuclear antibodies of the same specificities previously reported. Complement C3 level remained low and C4 was normal. C-reactive protein was elevated. Plasma activity of ADAMTS-13 was normal. Antibodies against platelet factor-4, myeloperoxidase, proteinase-3, and glomerular basement membrane were not detected. Coagulation studies demonstrated markedly elevated D-Dimer. Elevated dilute Russell viper venom time (DRVVT) ratio and positive hexagonal phospholipid (Staclot LA) test indicated the presence of lupus anticoagulant.\n\n【15】The patient was diagnosed with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome with concurrent hemorrhagic manifestations in the setting of new-onset SLE. Plasma exchange therapy was continued with one plasma volume exchanged with fresh frozen plasma every day for three consecutive days. Intermittent hemodialysis was continued. Medications included prednisone 60 mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day. Platelets were infused as needed. On the 5th hospital day, the patient was extubated. In the meantime, urine output increased. On the 6th hospital day, the last hemodialysis treatment was given. On the 8th hospital day, intravenous rituximab 1 g was administered for persistent thrombocytopenia. A 24 hour urine collection demonstrated protein excretion of 12.7 g/day. On the 15th hospital day, the patient was ambulating requiring no supplemental oxygen. Laboratory tests revealed serum creatinine concentration of 0.8 mg/dL, hemoglobin concentration of 8.5 g/dL (no blood transfusion for 16 days), and platelet count 33,000/mm<sup>3</sup> (no platelet transfusion for 7 days). She was discharged home on prednisone 60 mg/day and hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day, dapsone for PCP prophylaxis, esomeprazole, and calcium/vitamin D supplements. She missed her follow-up appointments after discharge.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】We presented a young woman with a history of several spontaneous miscarriages who developed acute thrombotic microangiopathy associated with DAH, menorrhagia, renal failure, cardiomyopathy, and valvular heart disease. Laboratory tests revealed antinuclear antibodies and lupus anticoagulant. She was diagnosed with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome in the setting of new-onset SLE.\n\n【18】The catastrophic APS (CAPS) is a rare life-threatening form of APS in which disseminated vascular thrombosis results in multiorgan failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The diagnosis of CAPS requires fulfillment of the following four criteria: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> involvement of three or more organs/tissues; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> development of manifestations in one week; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> histological evidence of vascular thrombosis; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> presence of antiphospholipid antibodies on two occasions at least twelve weeks apart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Our patient developed a catastrophic disease involving the lungs, kidneys, and heart in less than a week. Although we could not establish a histological diagnosis of vascular thrombosis due to severe thrombocytopenia, the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and markedly elevated fibrin degradation products including D-Dimer indicated vascular thrombosis.\n\n【19】In approximately one half of cases, CAPS is superimposed on APS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Although our patient had not been diagnosed with APS prior to her current presentation, a history of several spontaneous miscarriages could have been due to preceding APS. A concurrent autoimmune disorder is present in approximately one half of patients with CAPS. These include SLE (40%), lupus-like syndromes (5%), and other types of autoimmune diseases (9%). Although our patient did not have a diagnosis of an autoimmune disease, serologic studies at the time of current presentation revealed antibodies directed against several nuclear antigens. Antibodies against double-stranded DNA and Smith antigen are considered to be specific for SLE. CAPS affects predominantly women of childbearing age. A precipitating factor can be identified in the majority of patients. These include infection (22%), surgery (10%), discontinuation of anticoagulation (8%), medication (7%), obstetric complication (7%), and a neoplastic process (5%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We were unable to identify a precipitating factor in our patient.\n\n【20】The kidneys, lungs, central nervous system, heart, skin, liver, and gastrointestinal tract are most commonly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Pulmonary disease occurs in 24% of patients upon presentation and in 64% of patients during the course of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary embolism are the most common pulmonary manifestations. Thrombosis of pulmonary arteries and arterioles sometimes occurs. DAH occurs in 6% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6, 7\\]</u>. The pathogenesis of DAH in CAPS is poorly understood. The histological examination of the lung in APS patients with DAH revealed microvascular thrombosis and, in some patients, capillaritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In our patient, hemoptysis and a characteristic chest radiograph suggested a diagnosis of hemorrhagic alveolitis in the context of CAPS. However, it is conceivable that severe thrombocytopenia accounted for or contributed to DAH. The absence of antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies at the time of presentation excluded Goodpasture’s syndrome. Although indirect immunofluorescence staining for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies demonstrated a weak cytoplasmic pattern, ELISA for antimyeloperoxidase and antiproteinase-3 antibodies was negative.\n\n【21】Present in only 18% of patients upon presentation, renal disease ultimately occurs in 71% of patients with CAPS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The most frequent renal manifestations in CAPS are hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, and acute renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4, 7–9\\]</u>. Proteinuria averaged 2.8 g/day (0.6–6.1 g/day) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Histologically, the most common finding is acute thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by deposition of fibrin thrombi in glomeruli, arterioles, or both. Interstitial inflammation is reported in one third of the patients. On a rare occasion, interstitial hemorrhage accompanies microvascular thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 9\\]</u>. Immune-complex deposition is rarely observed. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are indicative of chronic kidney injury. Concentric laminations of fibrotic intima of arteries and arterioles (onion skin pattern) indicate chronic vascular damage. In line with these observations, our patient presented with acute renal failure, nephrotic-range proteinuria, hematuria, and leukocyturia. Because of severe thrombocytopenia, renal biopsy was not performed. Nonetheless, heavy proteinuria in conjunction with dysmorphic red blood cells and red blood cell casts in the urine indicated severe glomerular injury.\n\n【22】Cardiac disease is present in 10% and 51% of CAPS patients upon presentation and during the course of the disease, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Myocardial infarction, valvular heart disease, and arrhythmias are the most frequent cardiac manifestations and can result in heart failure and cardiac arrest. The following types of valvular heart disease were encountered in one third of the patients: mitral regurgitation (10%), tricuspid regurgitation (8%), Libman-Sacks endocarditis (6%), aortic regurgitation (4%), and combined mitral and aortic regurgitation (4%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Upon presentation, our patient was found to have moderate to severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as reduced ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities. At the time of discharge, a follow-up echocardiogram revealed improved valvular function with only mild mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n【23】The clinical manifestations of CAPS are usually a consequence of acute thrombotic microangiopathy resulting in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. In approximately one half of CAPS patients, the platelet count is less than 100,000/mm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Thrombocytopenia in APS is believed to be due to antibodies against \\-glycoprotein-I causing platelet activation and aggregation as well as antibodies against platelet glycoproteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. The etiology of severe thrombocytopenia in our patient was likely multifactorial and included platelet aggregation and consumption due to severe vascular thrombosis and platelet loss due to DAH and vaginal bleeding. Because of the presence of several autoantibodies, it is conceivable that our patient could have had antibodies against platelet glycoproteins as well.\n\n【24】Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thromocytopenia can also be secondary to other types of acute thrombotic microangiopathies such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The differentiation between HUS/TTP and CAPS is sometimes difficult. As a general rule, schistocytosis are marked in HUS/TTP and mild in CAPS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Fever and neurologic manifestations frequently dominate the clinical picture in patients with TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In addition, plasma ADAMTS-13 activity is less than 5% of normal in most patients with TTP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Our patient developed neither a fever nor neurologic manifestations upon presentation. In addition, her plasma ADAMTS-13 activity was normal. In the majority of patients with HUS, an infection with toxicogenic bacteria precedes the onset of the disease. No bacterial infection could be documented in our patient upon presentation. Furthermore, the presence of lupus anticoagulant and other autoantibodies was in favor of the diagnosis of CAPS in the setting of SLE.\n\n【25】Most CAPS patients are treated with anticoagulation and high-dose glucocorticoids 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, additional therapeutic interventions such as plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide, intravenous immunoglobulins, and antiplatelet agents are often used in various combinations. Early diagnosis and treatment have reduced the mortality rate from 53% to 33% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Considering severe thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic manifestations, anticoagulation was not an option in our patient. However, a combination therapy consisting of high-dose glucocorticoids, plasma exchange, cyclophosphamide and rituximab resulted in hematological, cardiopulmonary, and renal recovery. In conclusion, this exceedingly rare case emphasizes that hemorrhagic manifestations, severe microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and severe thrombocytopenia can dominate the clinical picture in CAPS.\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The following clinical case was accompanied by renal insufficiency, which was associated with the obstruction of the right ureter in the hernial sac and the stenosis of the left renal artery. The differential diagnosis between nephroptosis and dystopic kidney was based on MDCT scan images, which demonstrated the length of the right renal artery to be more than 20 cm. The patient underwent percutaneous nephrostomy through the right inguinal area and was successfully followed up for two years. We also analyzed six similar clinical cases described in the literature. This disease has, thus far, been observed exclusively in elderly men with long-standing and large inguinal hernias. The most frequent complications in these patients include ureteral strangulation in the area of the hernial gate and renal failure.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Renal ptosis (floating kidney) is an uncommon urological disease that continues to cause controversies among clinicians, despite more than a century long history of research on this pathology. The disease has many unique peculiarities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. At the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, nephropexy was used to be one of the most widespread surgeries, as floating kidneys were considered to be the most frequent cause of abdominal pains, as well as certain neurological and psychiatric diseases. This explains the largest number of surgical techniques that were proposed for the correction of this particular surgical disease.\n\n【4】Another important feature is the fact that the degree of nephroptosis often does not correlate with the symptoms, with some patients experiencing severe pain despite minor renal displacement, while others with an expressed floating kidney showing no symptoms at all. In the management of patients with nephroptosis, one more point must be taken into account; despite significant progress in the field of visual and laboratory diagnostics, the differential diagnosis of pain associated with nephroptosis remains challenging in certain cases. Therefore, predicting the outcomes of surgical intervention in patients with nephroptosis is extremely difficult, as symptoms may persist despite the fixation of the kidney in its normal position.\n\n【5】The pathophysiological aspects of nephroptosis include the possible development of hydronephrosis due to ureteral obstruction and significant elongation of the renal vessels, leading to ischemic disorders or venous congestion in the kidney.\n\n【6】The most severe degree of renal ptosis is characterized by the kidney displacement of over three vertebral lengths and its localization in the pelvic cavity. The literature describes singular clinical observations of “extreme nephroptosis” when the floating kidney is located in the cavity of the inguinal-scrotal hernia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>. In general, the inclusion of a parenchymal organ into an inguinal hernia is very rare. Such cases include the involvement of an ectopic testicle, ovary, uterus, accessory ectopic kidney, or transplanted kidney into the hernial sac 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【7】We present a rare clinical case of significant renal ptosis with the kidney located in the cavity of the inguinal-scrotal hernia, which caused significant ureteral obstruction and required drainage of the pyelocaliceal system by percutaneous nephrostomy passed through the scrotum.\n\n【8】This case report has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 93-year-old patient was admitted by the ambulance to the Regional Urological Clinical Center with complaints of a decrease in the urine output to 200 ml per day during the last three days, fever up to 38°С, mild pain in the right half of the scrotum area, and the general condition deterioration. There were no delays prior to the patient’s assessment and subsequent treatment. The anamnesis revealed, that two months ago, he had a permanent urethral Foley catheter installed due to chronic urinary retention caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). His past medical history included ischemic heart disease (with a myocardial infarction seven years ago), hypertension, and urolithiasis. In addition, five years ago, he experienced an ischemic cerebral stroke resulting in persistent left-side paraparesis.\n\n【11】The patient’s general condition was assessed as severe. The patient was confused. The physical examination revealed large bilateral inguinal-scrotal hernias that he had been suffering from for the past 20 years. The abdomen was soft on palpation, moderately painful in the right iliac and suprapubic areas. There was mild tenderness during the palpation of the right half of the scrotum.\n\n【12】The patient’s general blood count revealed leukocytosis (12 х 10<sup>9</sup>/L) with a shift in the leucocyte formula towards young forms and moderate anemia (Hb: 104 g/L; erythrocytes: 3.6 х 10<sup>12</sup> g/L). The levels of creatinine and blood urea reached 240 µmol/L and 14.8 mmol/L, respectively.\n\n【13】Ultrasonography revealed that the right kidney was located in the right half of the scrotum, with dimensions measuring 138 × 65 mm and a renal parenchyma thickness of 18–20 mm. There was significant extension of the pelvicalyceal system up to the level of the upper third of the ureter. The left kidney was situated in its typical position and measured 86 х 40 mm, with a parenchyma thickness not exceeding 10–12 mm. Calculi up to 12 mm were detected in the renal calyces. The renal collecting system of the left kidney was not dilated. There was suspicion on the pelvic dystopia of the right kidney, which was complicated by the displacement of the kidney with the hernial sac into the cavity of the right half of the scrotum. Considering the complexity of the given clinical presentation, the patient underwent a multidetector CT scan with contrast enhancement. The results of the CT scan confirmed the location of the right kidney in the right half of the scrotum .\n\n【14】(a)\n\n【15】(b)\n\n【16】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【18】Multidetector-computed tomography (MDCT) demonstrates the location of the right kidney in the right-sided inguinal hernia. (a) Frontal reconstruction. (b) Sagittal reconstruction.\n\n【19】However, the scrotal localization of the right kidney was a consequence of the nephroptosis rather than dystopia. This was objectively confirmed by the arterial phase of the investigation, which demonstrated that the ostium of the right renal artery was situated in the typical location (at the level L1-L2) and that the renal artery length had a length of over 20 cm .\n\n【20】(a)\n\n【21】(b)\n\n【22】(c)\n\n【23】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【24】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【25】Multidetector-computed tomography. Frontal views present a severely elongated right renal artery and stenosis of the left renal artery (a–c).\n\n【26】Only the adipose tissue and the lower half of the right kidney were located within the hernial sac on the right side. The left-sided hernia contained loops of the small intestine and the omentum. The collecting system of the right kidney was dilated due to ureteral angulation. CT images demonstrated the small left kidney with significant stenosis of the left renal artery. Calyceal renal stones were also found in the left kidney without signs of obstruction.\n\n【27】The CT scan also revealed an enlarged prostate measuring 90 × 65 × 60 mm with an intravesical component, as well as bladder stones .\n\n【28】(a)\n\n【29】(b)\n\n【30】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【31】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【32】MDCT. Axial (a) and sagittal (b) views of an enlarged prostate gland and the right kidney located in the right half of the scrotum.\n\n【33】Obstruction of the right kidney due to ureteral strangulation in the hernia gate and stenosis of the left renal artery with the left kidney atrophy were the causes of oligoanuria in this patient. Considering the signs of acute right-sided pyelonephritis, signs of ureteral obstruction, serious overall condition, and the absence of intestinal loops in the hernial sac, it was decided to perform a minimally invasive treatment—percutaneous nephrostomy through the upper part of the right half of the scrotum . The nephrostomy was performed by the highest category urologist with over 20-year experience, without any difficulties or complications.\n\n【34】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【35】Percutaneous nephrostomy via the right inguinal area.\n\n【36】Over the next week, antibacterial and detoxication therapy showed favorable results. Diuresis through the percutaneous nephrostomy was approximately 2000–2500 ml/day and through the urethral catheter was approximately 200–300 ml/day. Given the patient’s age, serious overall condition, and high risk of fatal complications during any surgical treatment, as well as the patient’s will, it was decided to provide conservative treatment only. The patient was discharged with significant improvement. Over the next two years, he underwent periodic replacements of nephrostomy and urethral catheters performed by the same specialist as initial treatment.\n\n【37】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【38】Inguinal hernia is one of the most common surgical diseases, which occur in about 3-4% of the people in the general population. This condition can lead to intestinal obstruction since the hernial sac typically contains the small intestine or omentum. While urological organs are less commonly involved in inguinal hernias, the bladder and ureter may also be affected. According to Oruç et al. 11.2% of hernias are associated with urological tumors and 23.5% are accompanied by complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Currently, only a few cases of “extreme nephroptosis” (the displacement of the kidney into the cavity of the inguinal hernia) have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>.\n\n【39】We analyzed data from seven patients reported in the literature, including one of our own patients . In all the cases, the patients were males. Their ages ranged from 62 to 93 years and averaged 79.8 ± 11.2 years. In six out of the seven observations, right-sided hernias occurred. Symptoms of a strangulated inguinal-scrotal hernia were found in only two patients. Interestingly, in most cases, no intestinal loops were found in the hernia cavity. The most common clinical sign was ureteral obstruction due to its strangulation in the hernia, which occurred in six patients. Examination revealed severe renal failure in three patients as follows: in two cases, it was associated with the obstruction of the ureter in a hernia and with a wrinkled contralateral kidney, while in one case, it was associated with the obstruction of the ureter in a hernia and with crush syndrome after a traumatic brain injury. Urolithiasis was present in two patients, while stenosis of the renal artery of the contralateral kidney was present in one.\n\n【40】Table 1 \n\n【41】Clinical features of patients with “extreme nephroptosis.”\n\n【42】It is worth noting that the treatment of patients with “extreme nephroptosis” in most cases is a difficult task. This is due to the massive size of the hernia, the poor general status, and the age of the patients. All seven men in our study had large or “giant” irreducible hernias, including the monstrous hernia described by Wendler et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In addition, all patients had hernias for an extended period. Six out of seven patients had a poor general condition upon admission to the hospital.\n\n【43】Surgical hernia repair has been described in two reports, with nephropexy being performed in only one of those cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. In our patient, due to his advanced age and poor general condition, we opted for percutaneous nephrostomy. The nephrostomy tube was inserted into the scrotum through the right inguinal region under ultrasonographic guidance. Such treatment approach was chosen based on the CT image data, indicating the absence of intestinal loops in the hernial sac and was not associated with any complications.\n\n【44】In six patients, CT images showed the kidney displacement into the scrotum from an orthotopic position. This conclusion was based on the significant elongation of the renal vessels. In our patient, the length of the right renal artery was over 20 cm. At the same time, there were no signs of wrinkling of this kidney. In the report by Osmani et al. the displacement of a pelvic dystopic kidney into the hernial sac was demonstrated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【45】Most probably, the mechanism behind the “extreme displacement” of the kidney into the inguinal hernia cavity is associated with the presence of wide hernial orifices and weak fixation of the perinephric fatty tissue to the sheets of Gerota’s fascia.\n\n【46】Long-standing hernias can lead to highly unusual life-threatening complications. It is advisable to provide patients with education materials regarding possible hernia complications. The similar cases should be managed in specialized centers since they require regular follow-ups and repeated procedures by qualified surgeons.\n\n【47】#### 4\\. Informed Consent\n\n【48】The patient provided a written consent for the medical intervention, as well as his permission for publication of all the clinical details and any materials associated with this procedure.\n\n【49】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【50】“Extreme nephroptosis” or the displacement of the kidney from its normal orthotopic position into the inguinal-scrotal hernia cavity is a very uncommon phenomenon that requires further investigation. This disease has, thus far, been observed exclusively in elderly men with long-standing and large inguinal hernias. The most frequent complications in these patients include ureteral strangulation in the area of the hernial gate and renal failure.\n\n【51】#### Data Availability\n\n【52】The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the paper.\n\n【53】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【54】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【55】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【56】D.Sh. prepared the original draft; V.D. and D.Sh. conceptualized the study and were responsible for project administration; A.A.

Acupuncture is a form of complementary medicine and has gained popularity worldwide in the last few decades. It is mainly used for the treatment of chronic pain. Acupuncture is usually considered a safe procedure but has been reported to cause serious complications including death. It has been associated with transmission of many viruses and bacteria. Two cases of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus have been reported recently following acupuncture therapy. We are reporting a case of a 57-year-old Korean female who developed vertebral osteomyelitis and intraspinal and paraspinal abscesses as a complication of acupuncture. Blood cultures, skin lesion culture, and body fluid culture yielded Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Good anatomical and medical knowledge, good hygiene standards, and proper acupuncture techniques should be followed to prevent the complications. Acupuncturists should consistently review the infection control guidelines to acupuncture. This case should raise awareness of such condition and hazards of presumably benign procedures such as acupuncture.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Acupuncture in Latin words means “acus” (needle) and “puncture” (penetration). Acupuncture is one of the oldest medical procedures in the world and originated in China about 2,000 years ago. In United States it appeared in the early 18th century but gained popularity after 1971 when New York Times journalist, James Reston, reported his experience with acupuncture. He was visiting China for President Nixon’s visit. He had an emergency appendectomy in China and was given acupuncture for postoperative analgesia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Acupuncture is mainly used for the treatment of chronic pain such as back pain, neck pain, and joint pain and for conditions like fatigue, insomnia, and depression. However, acupuncture, presumably a benign procedure, is related to the transmission of infectious agents and can cause devastating complications. We are reporting a first case of community acquired Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acute osteomyelitis with intraspinal and multiple paraspinal abscesses related to acupuncture.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 57-year-old Korean female presented with complaints of two-day history of nausea, vomiting, and generalized weakness along with subjective fever and night sweats. The patient also complained of intermittent chronic back pain for years that worsened over last week and made her go to have acupuncture therapy for the first time two days priorly for her chronic back pain but unfortunately pain got worse. Her physical examination revealed tenderness in the lumbosacral region without any redness or erythema. Laboratory tests showed normal white count with bands of 34% (normal range: 0–5%). Chest X-ray showed patchy opacities in the bilateral lower lung fields. Blood cultures were drawn and the patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n【6】The next day after admission the patient developed urinary retention. Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the lumbar spine was done to rule out disc herniation, which instead showed enlargement of the right psoas and quadratus lumborum muscles with induration of paraspinal soft tissue. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine showed fluid in the soft tissues posteriorly, which was reported as nonspecific but could be related to acupuncture.\n\n【7】Blood cultures came back positive for MRSA and only Vancomycin was continued. The patient developed multiple 2 mm new skin pustules over her legs and cultures from the skin lesions were also positive for MRSA. Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiogram failed to show any vegetation. A chest CT and abdominal MRI were done to discover the occult source of infection. The chest CT showed multiple necrotizing nodules suggestive of septic emboli. The abdomen MRI showed fluid collection posterolateral to the right psoas muscle, which was likely due to abscess formation. Multiple new small microabscesses in the paraspinal muscles and early osteomyelitis of the L2 vertebral body were also reported (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). A new small (0.6 × 0.5 cm) intraspinal fluid collection was also seen at the L2 vertebral body. CT-guided aspiration of the right paraspinal abscess was done and cultures were sent, which came back positive for MRSA as well. The patient was continued on Vancomycin.\n\n【8】(a)\n\n【9】(b)\n\n【10】(c)\n\n【11】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【13】MRI lumbar spine. (a) MRI of the lumbar spine with contrast showing L2 vertebral osteomyelitis. (b) MRI of the lumbar spine showing paraspinal abscess. (c) Follow-up MRI of the lumbar spine showing resolution of the osteomyelitis and the paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【14】MRI and CT of the lumbar spine after four weeks of antibiotic therapy again demonstrated osteomyelitis of the L2 vertebra. The paraspinal fluid collections demonstrated interval decrease in size and resolution of the intraspinal fluid collection. The patient reported improvement of back pain and was discharged on a 12-week course of intravenous Vancomycin. An MRI of the lumbar spine (Figure 1(c)) eight weeks following antibiotic therapy showed significant improvement of osteomyelitis and almost complete resolution of abscesses. The delayed CT scan showed complete resolution of abscesses. During a follow-up visit the patient stated that her back pain had resolved.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Acupuncture is gaining popularity as a common therapeutic procedure for chronic pain control in the United States. However, due to failure to follow infection control guidelines for acupuncture therapy (Australian Acupuncture Association Limited, 1997) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, there has been transmission of various infectious agents . A review of the literature revealed that infectious agents such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus in 1988 and 1993 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>, Human Immunodeficiency Virus in 1989 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, Mycobacteria in 2001 and 2002 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>, Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) in 1997, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2006 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–7\\]</u>, and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in 2008 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u> were reported to have been transmitted by acupuncture. Now in 2015 we are reporting a first case of acupuncture associated MRSA acute vertebral osteomyelitis with intraspinal and multiple paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【17】Table 1 \n\n【18】Infectious complications related to acupuncture (MSSA and MRSA).\n\n【19】Along with infectious complications, acupuncture is also known to be associated with mechanical organ injuries. Three deaths have been reported in which acupuncture was claimed as the cause, with one patient who died from endocarditis, another from bilateral pneumothorax, and a third due to severe asthma during acupuncture therapy. The adverse effects of acupuncture can be prevented with sound anatomical and medical knowledge, proper hygiene practices, and adequate acupuncture education 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Vertebral osteomyelitis is classified as being acute, subacute, or chronic. Acute osteomyelitis develops in a few days or weeks while subacute or chronic occurs over weeks to months before treatment is initiated. Vertebral osteomyelitis occurs via hematogenous, direct inoculation, or contagious transmission. The lumbar spine is most commonly involved (58%), followed by the thoracic spine (30%) and the cervical spine (11%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Patients with vertebral osteomyelitis usually present with back pain and fever and may have some form of neurologic deficit. MRI has a high sensitivity (96%) and specificity (92%) for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, response to treatment is determined by clinical assessment and inflammatory markers since radiologic improvement by MRI is delayed and always follows clinical improvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Follow-up MRI is only indicated when there are no signs of clinical improvement after four weeks of therapy or an abscess is suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【22】A high index of clinical suspicion is required for vertebral osteomyelitis since the presentation can be very vague. Early imaging studies and empiric antibiotic therapy covering MRSA should be initiated to prevent serious complications, since Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism causing vertebral osteomyelitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. Treatment duration for osteomyelitis is generally recommended for six weeks but a longer course should be considered in complicated infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. In the present case, the patient received parenteral Vancomycin for three months and CT-guided aspiration of paraspinal abscess which resulted in a favorable outcome.\n\n【23】In the present case, back pain worsened over weeks which is the natural course of mechanical low back pain but having acute worsening after acupuncture directly suggests that bacterial inoculation at the time of procedure which was further complicated by bacteremia although there was no local skin abscess at the site of acupuncture temporal correlation is evident. The patient had been in the United States for years and this was her first hospitalization and she did not have any other medical problem suggesting that she could be carrier for MRSA so it was assumed that this infection was acquired from acupuncture as reported from previous literature.\n\n【24】To best of our knowledge, only two cases of MRSA associated with acupuncture have been reported in the literature to date. Lee et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported acupuncture associated MRSA necrotizing aortitis in April 2008 and Woo et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> reported MRSA causing septic arthritis following acupuncture in August 2008. We are reporting a third case of MRSA associated with acupuncture. However, this is the first case of MRSA associated vertebral osteomyelitis with spinal and paraspinal abscesses.\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】Vertebral osteomyelitis and/or abscess should be considered in the differential diagnosis in a patient presenting with worsening back pain following acupuncture therapy. Diagnoses of vertebral osteomyelitis can easily be missed or delayed due to its vague presentation. Careful history taking and early initiation of therapy is of paramount importance for a favorable outcome. Acupuncturists should possess sound anatomical and medical knowledge and adhere to proper hygiene standards and techniques with consistent review of the infection control guidelines pertaining to acupuncture to prevent the devastating complications and significant financial expenditure due to prolonged hospitalization. This case raises awareness of the possible hazards of presumably benign procedures such as acupuncture.\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>There is no conflict of interests for the authors of this paper.</u>\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>Deborah Goss, MLS (Director, Health Sciences Library, Queens Hospital Center), reviewed and edited the paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Intestinal metastases disseminate from gastrocolic and mesenteric ligaments but they are seen very rarely and in most cases detected in postmortem studies. Case Report. A 74-year-old female patient with no known history of disease. Her complaints on application were epigastric pain, burning, and constipation. Gastroscopy showed a submucosal mass in the greater curvature of fundus and in colonoscopy, a mass with polypoid appearance that narrows the lumen at the rectum was detected. No far metastases or pathology were detected. Pathology report from gastric biopsy material demonstrated well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Cytokeratin 7 (CK7) was found to be extensively strongly positive, Cytokeratin 20 (CK20) was negative in the immunohistochemical staining of the biopsy obtained from rectosigmoid area. Conclusion. Gastric cancer is among the frequent cancers today, most of which are adenocarcinomas. Although most of the metastases are observed in the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and peritoneum, it should be remembered that intestinal metastases may be seen without the presence of any other metastatic focus. Our case is the first in literature reporting a rectum metastasis without any other organ metastasis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hepatic metastases of gastric adenocarcinomas are frequently observed due to the drainage into portal vein. In addition to peritoneal metastases while it is an intraperitoneal organ, other frequent areas of dissemination include lungs due to lymphatic drainage for the tumors adjacent to esophagocardiac junction and intra-abdominal lymph nodes. Intestinal metastases disseminate from gastrocolic and mesenteric ligaments but they are seen very rarely and in most cases detected in postmortem studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In our case, a rectal metastasis of an intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma was detected without any hepatic or lymph node metastases, the first of such case in literature. We aimed in our paper to present this case of rectal metastasis from primary gastric adenocarcinoma without any other metastatic foci by assessment from clinical, radiological, pathological, and genetic perspectives in light of up-to-date literature evidence.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Material and Method\n\n【6】The patient, who had epigastric pain and constipation was examined with endoscopy and colonoscopy. In pathological evaluation there was carcinoma both in stomach and rectum. Primary diagnosis was based on two different primary tumors and metachronous metastases. Thorax and abdominal computerized tomography (CT) was performed for other organ metastases. Differential diagnosis was made by the evaluation of the morphology and immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma in stomach and rectum.\n\n【7】#### 3\\. Case\n\n【8】A 74-year-old female patient with no known history of disease. Her complaints on application were epigastric pain, burning, and constipation. Gastroscopy showed a 2-cm submucosal mass in the greater curvature of fundus and in colonoscopy, a 2-3-cm mass with polypoid appearance that narrows the lumen at 10 cm in the rectum was detected. No far metastases or pathology were detected in the computer tomography of thorax/abdomen/pelvis, except thickening in the distal rectum wall and gastric wall. Biopsies were taken from the masses in the gastric and rectal areas. Pathology report from gastric biopsy material demonstrated well-differentiated adenocarcinoma .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Microscopic image of the biopsy, stained with H&E, taken from fundus greater curvature by the use of gastroscopy.

Chemotherapy was initiated at TCF protocol (cisplatin 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, and 5-fluorouracil 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> from day 1 to 5; each cycle performed every 21 days), which is administered to patients with metastatic gastric cancer in accordance with NCCN 2012 guideline. Total neutrophil count was 398 following the 1st chemotherapy. This was considered as neutropenia grade 4 as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0, and therapy was resumed decreasing the chemotherapy doses by 25%. No metastatic findings were present and there was regression in constipation in the interim assessment after 3 cycles, and CA 19-9 marker level was decreased to 380 ng/dL. Followup and treatment of the patient is still continuing.\n\n【22】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【23】While the frequency of gastric cancers is gradually increased, the estimated incidence of gastric cancer in America was reported to be 21,260, and the number of deaths due to this cause was 11,210 in 2007 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In 2000, it was estimated that there were 876,340 cases of gastric cancer worldwide, resulting in approximately 650,000 deaths 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Gastric malignancies are most frequently observed in the distal stomach (40%) and in particular in the antrum, followed by fundus and esophagogastric junction (35%) and corpus (25%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, for which adenocarcinomas again account for 90–95% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Hepatic metastases of gastric adenocarcinomas are frequently observed due to the drainage into portal vein. In addition to peritoneal metastases while it is an intraperitoneal organ, other frequent areas of dissemination include lungs due to lymphatic drainage for the tumors adjacent to esophagocardiac junction and intra-abdominal lymph nodes. Intestinal metastases disseminate from gastrocolic and mesenteric ligaments but they are seen very rarely and in most cases detected in postmortem studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Rectal metastases of gastric adenocarcinomas are reported in the literature. In these cases, intestinal metastases of poorly differentiated diffuse signet ring cell-type gastric adenocarcinomas was identified and surgical therapy and/or chemotherapy was administered 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. In our case, rectum metastasis of a moderately differentiated intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma without hepatic or lymph node metastases was detected.\n\n【25】Gastroscopy is the most effective method for establishing the diagnosis of gastric cancer. It is highly valuable in diagnosis because it allows direct visualization of the tumor, cytological tests and histological biopsy. In a study issued in 1998, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative prognostic value of gastroscopy was found to be 82%, 100%, 99.1%, and 99.6%, respectively. Taking into consideration all the data, it was found to be 99.6% diagnostic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Endoscopic ultrasound is a valuable diagnostic tool in determining the invasion depth of tumor, despite being poorly successful in detecting regional lymph node metastases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. In a study comparing imaging methods in detecting hepatic metastases of gastrointestinal cancers in 2002, sensitivity rates at equivalent specificity for MRI, CT, and US were found to be 76%, 72%, and 55%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. No findings were observed except a 1-cm cystic lesion and ascites in the abdominal US of our case. No findings in favor of metastasis were found in dynamic abdominal MRI and thoracic and abdominal CT scans. Immunohistochemical staining may be a lodestar in hepatic metastases with unknown primary focus. In a study issued in 1999, CK20 positivity was detected in 78% (94%, when adenocarcinoma metastases of gastric origin are excluded) of hepatic metastases from the malignancies originating from colon and rectum. Positive staining with CK20 was 65% extensive and 6% focal and CK7 staining was 6% positive in metastases with primary tumor in the liver. For those with primary tumor in the rectum, extensive CK20-positive staining was 83% where none was stained with CK7. Although positivity of CK20 and CK7 was detected in 74% (92%, when adenocarcinoma metastases of gastric origin are excluded) of hepatic metastases of the malignancies of pancreaticobiliary origin, variable staining patterns were seen in metastatic gastric adenocarcinomas. Gastric adenocarcinomas with hepatic metastases were stained 30% extensively and 20% focally with CK20, and 60% extensively with CK7, while 40% negatively with CK20 and CK7. Therefore, CK7 and CK20 stains do not seem to have a guidance attribution in determining the primary focus. In conclusion, a significant association was found with only CK20-positive staining between tumors originating from colon, rectum, pancreas, and biliary ducts with hepatic metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In the immunohistochemical staining of gastric biopsy preparations from our case, CK20 staining in tumor cells was negative and CK7 staining was extensively strongly positive. On the other hand, mucin-positive staining indicates poorer prognosis in gastric adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In a study published in 2001, mucin-positive adenocarcinoma cases, compared with mucin-negative ones, were seen in younger patients at lower localization in the stomach, with increased cancer depth, with larger tumor diameters and higher incidences of lymph node metastasis. Also lymphatic and venous permeation were more frequent in mucin-positive staining adenocarcinomas. Comparison of lymph node metastasis in MUC-negative and -positive staining carcinomas, as the cancer invaded the submucosa, the frequency of lymph node metastasis was increased in MUC-positive staining carcinomas. In our case, in spite of MUC1-positive staining and submucosal invasion, no lymph node metastasis was detected. Another important consideration in gastric adenocarcinomas is the amplification in C-erb B2 gene (HER2/neu gene, 17q12-q21.32). Proteins that form as a result of the amplification of this gene impact cell growth, migration, and differentiation by binding to HER2/neu receptors on the cellular membrane. Trastuzumab that binds these defective proteins is included in the management of gastric cancer today 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In a study published in 2002, overexpression of the protein C-erb B2 was detected rather in well- and moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas and was not found in signet cell-type gastric cancers or linitis plastic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In our case, C-erb B2 gene amplification was not observed in moderately differentiated gastric adenocarcinomas. Surgery is the only curative method in the treatment of localized gastric adenocarcinomas. However, chemotherapy + radiation therapy is the recognized method for advanced stage and metastatic gastric adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Cisplatin+5-FU ± Docetaxel (CF-DCF) combination is among the most favored chemotherapy modalities. In a study comparing these dual and triple regimens, addition of docetaxel to the dual CF chemotherapy is found to significantly increase the time to progression, survival, and response rates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, in an article issued in 2007, dual and triple regimens involving docetaxel are referred to produce neutropenia more frequently compared to other regimens 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Thus, neutropenia developed in our case following the second cure of triple DCF chemotherapy, and the treatment was resumed after decreasing the dose. In conclusion, gastric cancer is among the frequent cancers today, most of which are adenocarcinomas. Gastroscopy is the most valuable diagnostic method. Although most of the metastases are observed in the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and peritoneum, it should be remembered that intestinal metastases may be seen without the presence of any other metastatic focus. In our case, a rectal metastasis of an intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinoma was detected without any hepatic or lymph node metastases, the first of such case in literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Further, myalgia often occurs in patients with AOSD; however, AOSD patients complicated with myositis are rare. We report a 43-year-old Japanese man with AOSD who developed myositis and hepatic dysfunction which were deteriorated by multiple nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and were dramatically ameliorated by a low-dose steroid therapy. A skin biopsy of salmon pink rash which is characteristic for AOSD showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and the markers for vasculitis, plasma von Willebrand factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor levels were elevated in this patient, suggesting an association between AOSD and systemic vasculitis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology. Hepatic dysfunction is common in AOSD, and more than 70% of these patients show elevated liver enzymes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Evanescent salmon-pink rash is characteristic for AOSD; however, the histopathology of this rash has not been cleared. Although myalgia often occurs in AOSD, myositis complicated with AOSD is rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Here, we describe a patient with AOSD who developed myositis and hepatic dysfunction which were deteriorated by multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and were dramatically ameliorated by a low-dose steroid therapy. Further, we also show the association between AOSD and vasculitis by presenting the pathologic findings of salmon-pink rash and elevated markers for vasculitis in AOSD.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 43-year old Japanese man was referred and admitted with a continuous spiking fever, myalgia, and arthralgia. Physical examination revealed fever, muscle weakness, and salmon-pink rash . Laboratory examination was notable for a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 1.1 mg/dL (normal range, 0.0–0.3), a fibrinogen level of 504 mg/dL (normal range, 150–400), a creatin kinase (CK) level of 1.114 IU/L (normal range, 55–200), and a ferritin level of 2.892 ng/mL (normal range, 40–350). Serum rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antigen, proteinase 3 (PR3)- and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), and anti-Jo-1 antibody were negative.

Markers for vasculitis, plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) (235% (normal range, 60–170)), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (1.050 pg per milliliter (normal range 115)) were elevated.\n\n【9】(a)\n\n【10】(b)\n\n【11】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Histopathological findings from a salmon-pink rash showed perivascular lymphocytes infiltration and fragmentation of blood cells, which was compatible with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Discussion\n\n【23】To our knowledge, the histopathology of evanescent salmon-pink rash has not been cleared. A skin biopsy revealed that rash was due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is characterized by angiocentric segmental inflammation, fibrinoid necrosis, and a neutrophilic infiltrate around the vessel walls with erythrocyte extravasation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis has been observed in Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and microscopic polyangiitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>; however, it has not been reported in AOSD. Negative PR3- and MPO-ANCA denied complication with Wegener’s granulomatosis or microscopic polyangiitis in our patient.\n\n【24】vWF is produced by blood vessel endothelial cells in response to injury, and high vWF level has been observed in systemic vasculitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. VEGF is a cytokine participating in inflammation with potent endothelial effect and is produced by macrophages, neutrophils, and vascular endothelial cells and can alter vascular permeability. VEGF has also been suggested to be associated with vasculitis, and elevated serum VEGF levels have been observed in Behçet's disease, microscopic polyangiitis, polyarteritis nodosa, and giant cell arteritis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–12\\]</u>. Elevated blood vWF and VEGF levels in our AOSD patient suggest a significant association between AOSD and vasculitis. We have to mention that VEGF immunostaining on the cutaneous lesion would be more relevant than serum VEGF measurement, and that we did not study serum vWF and VEGF levels after the therapy; however, investigation of changes in their levels after the corticosteroid therapy would be helpful to show their role in the pathogenesis of vasculitis in this patient.\n\n【25】Liver dysfunction in AOSD has been ever described in some case reports. Andrès et al. retrospectively reviewed data of 17 patients with AOSD and found abnormalities in liver biochemistry in 76% of subjects with AOSD, suggesting the high frequency of liver dysfunction in AOSD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, it is difficult to differentiate liver dysfunction due to AOSD itself from drug-induced liver dysfunction. Recently, Chen et al. determined soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) in patients with active untreated AOSD and identified serum sICAM-1 level as a predictor of liver dysfunction in AOSD, and serum sICAM-1 levels were significantly correlated with disease activity and serum ferritin levels which have been also reported to be suitable for monitoring AOSD disease activity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. In our subject, in spite of decrease in serum CRP and ferritin levels, serum AST and ALT levels were increased by NSAIDs and were promptly decreased by corticosteroid, suggesting the presence of drug-induced liver dysfunction. In this case, NSAIDs also elevated serum CK levels, and a 20 mg corticosteroid therapy promptly decreased serum CK levels, suggesting NSAIDs-induced myositis. To our knowledge, drug-induced myositis in AOSD has not been previously reported. Schwarz-Eywill et al. have also observed that aspirin improved symptoms and CRP but increased serum AST and ALT levels in AOSD patients, and a corticosteroid treatment decreased serum AST and ALT levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. AOSD may have a potential mechanism for enhancing drug toxicity. If we find deterioration in liver function and myositis during treatment, in spite of decrease in CRP and ferritin, we should be aware of drug-induced hepatitis and myositis in AOSD.\n\n【26】In conclusion, our observation indicates that AOSD may be associated with systemic vasculitis and also suggests that we should be aware of the presence of drug-induced hepatitis and myositis in AOSD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is rarely complicated by amyloidosis. Case. A 66-year-old white male presented to the emergency room (ER) after an unwitnessed fall and change in mental status. Patient was awake and alert but not oriented. There was no focal deficit on neurological exam. Past medical history (PMH) included hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic valve replacement (nonmetallic), incomplete heart block controlled by a pacemaker and IgG- IgA type Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance. The MGUS was diagnosed 9 months ago on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) as patient was referred to the outpatient clinic for hyperglobulinemia on routine blood work. In ER, a head-computed tomography (CT) revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions suspicious for metastases. A CT chest, abdomen and pelvis revealed numerous ground-glass and solid nodules in the lungs. Lower extremity duplex and transesophageal echocardiogram were negative. Serial blood cultures and serologies for cryptococcus and histoplasmosis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), cryoglobulin, and antiglomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies were all negative. CT guided lung biopsy was positive for Thioflavin T amyloid deposits. Brain biopsy was positive for eosinophilic material (similar to the lungs) but negative for Thioflavin T stain. The patient's clinical status continued to deteriorate with cold cyanotic fingers developing on day 12 and a health care acquired pneumonia, respiratory failure, and fungemia on day 18. On day 29, family withdrew life support and denied any autopsies. Conclusion. Described is an atypical course of MGUS complicated by amyloidosis of the lung and nonamyloid eosinophilic deposition in the brain. As MGUS might be complicated by diseases such as amyloidosis and multiple myeloma, a scheduled follow-up of these patients is always necessary. Further research is needed in order to better define the optimal treatment and management strategies of MGUS and its complications.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】B cell dyscrasias are characterized by a clonal proliferation of B cells (benign or malignant). The spectrum of B cell dyscrasia is broad and includes the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. MGUS is found in more than 1% of persons who are 50 years or older and is defined by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein concentration less than 3 g/dL, with absence of lytic bone lesions, of M proteins in urine, of hypercalcemia and of renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Amyloidosis is a rare complication of MGUS which is secondary to excessive production of a monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) and deposition of the single Ig isotype or subunits in various tissues. Aggregomas, on the other hand, are tumoral non-amyloidotic monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain deposits 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In this paper, we describe an unusual presentation of MGUS combining amyloid deposition in the lung and non-amyloid eosinophilic deposition in the Brain.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case\n\n【5】A-66-year-old male, who was exsmoker, presented to the ER for a change in mental status. As per the family, the patient who had a normal mental status in the past was noticed to be progressively worsening for the last couple of months, with disorientation mainly found over phone discussions. At the time of presentation he was awake and alert, but disoriented to time and place. He denied any pain and was unable to provide any history. Physical exam was normal except for the presence of facial ecchymosis. The neurological part showed a normal motor, sensory, and cranial nerve exam. Also, his gait was stable.\n\n【6】Past medical history was significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, aortic valve replacement (nonmetallic), atrial fibrillation (on warfarin), incomplete heart block, pacemaker, and IgG- IgA, kappa type Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS). Family history was not relevant.\n\n【7】MGUS was diagnosed 9 months ago on serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) as patient was referred to our institution’s center for cancer and blood related diseases for hyperglobulinemia on routine blood work. At that time the patient underwent extensive work up to rule out any plasma cell dyscrasias. The Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) was negative for M spike. Immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry from peripheral smear as well as from bone marrow biopsy were negative for a clonal plasma cell or malignant B-cell. Chromosomal analysis and cytogenetics were also normal.\n\n【8】In the ER, a head CT scan revealed multiple parenchymal hemorrhagic lesions suspicious for metastases mainly in the frontal part bilaterally and in the left parieto-temporal region, with edema and compression mainly on the left lateral ventricle. Also, an interventricular lesion at the foramen of Monro causing mild hydrocephalus was seen. CT chest, abdomen and pelvis was done to find a possible primary malignancy and revealed numerous ground-glass and solid nodules in the lungs. Warfarin was discontinued and the international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.2 was reversed with fresh frozen plasma. Patient was started on steroids and phenytoin. Lower extremity duplex was negative.\n\n【9】The clinical status continued to deteriorate with cold, cyanotic fingers developing on day twelve of hospitalization. At this point he was seen by a vascular surgeon in order to rule out arterial emboli. A transesophageal echocardiogram was done for possible vegetations causing infectious emboli. All results were negative, and no infiltrative cardiomyopathy was found. Bronchoscopy and broncho-alveolar lavage with cultures (including nocardia) was also negative. CT guided lung biopsy showed H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and PAS (periodic acid-schiff) positive amorphous eosinophilic material suspicious for amyloid . Initial staining with congo red was negative. However, it stained positively with Thioflavin T stain and had weak green birefringence under polarized light. Immunostains for kappa and lambda chains showed stronger staining for kappa subtype. Brain biopsy was positive for eosinophilic material (similar to the lungs) but negative for congo red and thioflavin T stain . Later, the patient had a respiratory failure secondary to health care acquired pneumonia (HCAP) and was intubated. Serial blood cultures and serologies for Cryptococcus and histoplasmosis, serology for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), antinuclear antibody (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF), cryoglobulin, and Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies (antiGBM) were all negative. Only seen was a positive blood culture for candida on day eighteen.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| CT guided lung biopsy showed H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and PAS (periodic acid-schiff) positive amorphous eosinophilic material suspicious for amyloid.

Later, he was switched to vancomycin, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin for possible health care acquired pneumonia. Also, he was started on amphotericin B after blood cultures revealed candida. Whether a more diffuse disease such as systemic amyloidosis is present was not confirmed, as the family refused any further diagnostic procedures that are not relevant to the acute care of the patient in a context of a deteriorating clinical picture. Despite all antifungals and supportive measures, he failed weaning trials and remained on ventilator support. A tracheostomy was suggested. However, after extensive discussions, the family refused. On day 29, health care proxy decided to withdraw all life support measures based on the patient’s previous wishes who did not want to be kept alive on a ventilator. Finally, the patient had a terminal wean after these events, and the family refused any autopsies.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】As we discussed above, MGUS is found in around 1% of persons who are 50 years or older and is defined by the presence of a serum monoclonal protein concentration less than 3 g/dL. MGUS of IgM class can progress to lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia; whereas IgA and IgG can progress to primary amyloidosis or multiple myeloma. B cell lymphoproliferative disorders can cause AL (light chain) amyloidosis, which is very rarely reported in MGUS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. Depending on the type of antibodies secreted, immunoglobulin deposition diseases can be divided into light chain amyloidosis (AL), heavy chain amyloidosis (AH), non-amyloid forms of light chain deposition diseases (LCDD), and heavy chain deposition diseases (HCDD). Coexistence of the amyloid and non-amyloid deposits is very rare, and was first described by Gallo et al. as “monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Biclonal gammopathy was described in less than 3 percent of the Mayo clinic MGUS series 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The clinical course and behavior were not significantly different. Our patient had high levels of IgG 3730 mg/dL (range: 751–1560 mg/dL) and IgA 619 (range: 82–453 mg/dL). Immunofixation was positive for kappa chains which was consistent with the amyloid deposits in the lungs. These were highly positive for the kappa immunostaining. Therefore, we can suggest that one of the contributing causes for the respiratory failure in our case might have been the amyloidosis itself.\n\n【18】Also, found in our patient was multiple organizing hemorrhagic brain lesions suspicious for metastasis. However, no primary tumor was found and there was no evidence of lymphoproliferative diseases in the brain or lung biopsies. Hemorrhage in patients with MGUS can be secondary to amyloidosis or cryoglobulinemia. However, finding of eosinophilic non-amyloid material possibly suggests “Aggregoma” which is a very rare entity, only described once previously in the literature, as per our knowledge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Amyloid depositions seen in plasma cell dyscrasias can lead to amyloid angiopathy and secondary hemorrhagic lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Light chain deposition diseases might mimic amyloidosis, leading also to bleeding susceptibilities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Our patient might have light chain deposition disease in the brain that did not lead to amyloidosis itself. However, this disease might have been the cause of significant parenchymal hemorrhages.\n\n【19】Further workup in order to define the exact nature of these depositions, like immunohistochemistries, ultra-structural analysis, and mass spectrometry, was not done, mainly due to technical and technological limitations in our institution. Also, we cannot rule out a possible systemic amyloidosis as no further diagnostic testing such as a fat pad biopsy was done. The family refused any workup that is not relevant to the acute care of the patient who was in a critical condition. Also, the final diagnosis was not ascertained as the autopsy was refused.\n\n【20】Although there were some indicators predicting the risk of progression to Multiple Myeloma (serum protein M ≥ 1.5, non-IgG MGUS), till now, there is no known indicators predicting the odds of amyloidosis formation. Periodic monitoring of MGUS is advised, but there is currently no recommended optimal intervals. Many experts recommend routine follow-up between 6 and 12 months. This is based mainly on the potential risk for multiple myeloma progression.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】This case describes two organ specific presentations related to the MGUS disease: amyloid deposition in the lung and non-amyloid eosinophilic deposition in the brain. The possibility of a presence of systemic amyloidosis and the final confirmation of the nature of the non-amyloid depositions in our case were not ascertained, mainly due to the refusal by the family for any autopsies or any further diagnostic procedures, but also view the lack of technological availabilities, mainly staining subtypes in our institution.\n\n【23】Knowing that the course of MGUS can be potentially complicated by amyloidosis, peripheral neuropathies, and multiple myeloma transformations, a scheduled follow-up of these patients is always necessary. Further research is needed in order to establish the optimal treatment guidelines for the complications and diseases related to MGUS.\n\n【24】#### Consent\n\n【25】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s next of kin for publication of this case report and accompanying images.

The oral cavity is rarely affected by this infestation and the circumstances which can lead to oral myiasis include persistent mouth opening together with poor hygiene, or facial traumatism. We present a case of oral myiasis by larvae of Lucilia sericata, a species present in the Iberian Peninsula, in a hospitalized patient with surgical problems.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case History\n\n【3】A male aged 32 years was admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from General Surgery in a tertiary hospital (Hospital Virgen del Puerto, Plasencia, Extremadura, Spain). Case history revealed intestinal pathology with peritonitis, and laparotomy with intestinal resection, approximately a year previously. Two months before, the patient presented a new subocclusive condition, with gastroparesis, esophageal motor disorder, and intestinal myopathy. The patient was admitted to surgery with pain in the left iliac fossa compatible with acute peritonitis and perforation of the hollow viscus. An exploratory laparotomy was performed and the affected intestinal loops were resected. Two days later a further surgical intervention was necessary because of feverish syndrome and abdominal distension. During this period the patient remained under the effects of sedation. Abscesses and peritonitis with intestinal block were found, which prompted the patient’s transfer to ICU. After 12 h in ICU a further intervention due to biliary peritonitis was required; the omentum was seen to be invaded by abscesses, requiring it to resected, a jejunostomy was performed, and the abdomen was left open. Antibiotherapy was administered contributing to improve the patient’s evolution, with diminished fever and signs of inflammation. In the evolutionary period of 15 days following admission, the nurse reported mobile “maggots” in the patient’s oral cavity, nasopharynx and oropharynx, and the presence of perilarval reaction. Treatment consisted of total mechanical removal of the larvae by combining manual extraction with tweezers and aspiration after having washed the infected area with water and povidone iodine. The patient’s clinical condition was controlled without the appearance of further signs of infestation.\n\n【4】Several fly larvae were sent to the laboratory, white in color, without legs, and with a smooth surface . The larvae presented 12 segments: the first of which had a pair of lateral papillae (anterior spiracles) with digitiform prolongations; the last segment having D-shaped posterior spiracles with 3 straight perimetral slots, not sinuous, and dark in color. The perimetral membrane is closed with a button which is especially evident when observed with low microscopic magnification (10x). These structures led us to identify this larva as part of the Calliphoridae family, belonging to the genus Lucilia.\n\n【5】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Aspect and evolution of the larvae of Lucilia sericata in our laboratory.

The larva moved freely in the agar, and after about 10 days a dark brown structure appeared stuck on the edge of the plaque. This pupa was placed on a clean petri plate at room temperature. After a few days, the adult insect or imago appeared. Based on its subcostal sclerite, which was yellow in color, its meron structure, and the analysis of its wing venation, it was identified as Lucilia sericata, a species present in the Iberian Peninsula.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Insects such as dipterans may infest animals and humans, causing myiasis infection by fly larvae with multiple localizations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. The larvae need to feed on live or dead tissues in order to grow and mutate. Although it is a well-known illness in the veterinary field, it is infrequent in man, being more frequent in the Tropics, with rare occurrences in warm zones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Oral myiasis is a rare process in developed countries, but can occur anywhere 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It has been associated with poor oral hygiene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>, open bite 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, neurological deficit or psychiatric disturbances 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7\\]</u>, alcoholism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, and other disorders. In the episode described here the species involved was L. sericata which is distributed worldwide; this species is also known as the green bottle fly and sheep blowfly strike. Nosocomial myiasis, which occurs in a patient following hospitalization, is a very infrequent phenomenon 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Most reports of nosocomial myiasis have been of sporadic infestations, particularly in debilitated patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Factors contributing to nosocomial myasis include hypoesthesia or disturbed consciousness, which prevents the patient’s sensation of fly contact 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, or paralysis that can prevent a patient from fending off a fly 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【11】In this case, we believe that a sedated patient lying with his mouth half-open, in a rural hospital surrounded by pasturelands, could explain the entrance of flies into his oral cavity and the laying of eggs which hatched when the patient was in Intensive Care.\n\n【12】Myasis generates great anxiety, in both the patient and custodial personnel. The disease should be prevented by adequate control of insects, in addition to maintaining good oral and personal care of the patient, whatever their state of consciousness.\n\n【13】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare no conflict of interests related to this study.</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【16】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors are grateful to J.

Introduction\n\n【3】A 59-year-old male patient was referred to the breast clinic with a breast lump underneath the right nipple. The lump was painless with no other associated complaints. On clinical assessment it was a firm, discrete benign feeling lesion, about 15 mm in diameter. There were no palpable axillary lymph nodes. On radiological assessment, both Ultrasound scan and Mammography showed a benign looking mass just lateral to the right nipple, with discrete well-defined edges .

On Immunohistochemistry, the lesion was positive for Desmin and Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) while it was negative for S100. All these were in keeping with primary leiomyosarcoma. The nearest margin was the superficial which was 4 mm from the tumour. Staging investigations were normal. Simple mastectomy without axillary dissection was performed and a residual disease was confirmed. The cavity wall confirmed the presence of a further 5 mm of similar tumour. A multidisciplinary team decision postoperatively was to keep the patient under regular followup with no need of any further adjuvant therapy.

Discussion\n\n【16】Sarcomas comprise less than 1% of all primary breast neoplasms and only a minority of these are leiomyosarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Sarcomas in the breast have been described since the early 20th century but most probably the first confirmed case of leiomyosarcoma on IHC was reported in the late 1960s 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Though it was described as fibrosarcoma in the report, Munitiz et al. commented in 2004 that the pathological features on optical and electronic microscopy were in keeping with Leiomyosarcoma. It has been reported that only 25 cases in the literature are confirmed primary leiomyosarcomas of the breast proven on IHC or electron microscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Confirming the diagnosis on either IHC or electron microscopy is important as it is sometimes difficult to differentiate these pathologically from poorly differentiated sarcomatoid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Diagnosis can be challenging because of the nonspecific clinical and radiological findings. Clinically they present with a progressively enlarging tumour. The presence of enlarged axillary nodes is rare making axillary node staging unnecessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>. Radiological findings are also non specific. While some have reported a welldefined lesion that can be mistaken for benign pathology as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, others have reported malignant looking lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Fine needle aspiration cytology can be challenging as these tumours can be mistaken for poorly differentiated carcinoma, metaplastic carcinoma, or other sarcomas such as malignant phylloides 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6\\]</u>. On histopathological assessment, Immunohistochemical staining is essential as adjuncts to differentiate leiomyosarcomas from other tumours and soft tissue sarcomas. These tumours are usually positive for desmin, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin and negative for S100 (neural tumour marker), cytokeratins, and epithelial markers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3, 7, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【18】The cornerstone of treatment is surgical excision. Most authors advice either radical or simple mastectomy arguing that wide excision is associated with higher rate of recurrence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7, 9\\]</u>. Conservative surgery with wide local excision and clear margins has been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 10, 11\\]</u>. Though axillary node dissection is not necessary, it has been performed in many of the reported cases because of uncertain preoperative diagnosis or if there were clinically palpable nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 10, 12\\]</u>. Long-term followup is important as some of these tumours have been reported to recur more than 10 years posttreatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【19】In summary, this tumour is a rare tumour that can be a diagnostic challenge to clinicians as it has no specific clinical or radiological features. This emphasizes the importance of triple assessment in all breast lumps, even if clinically and radiologically they are benign. The mainstay of treatment is surgical excision with clear margins and longterm followup is essential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Maluf and Koerner first reported this disease entity as a special type of ductal carcinoma in situ with several characteristic histopathological features, including low-grade cellular atypia, intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, and solid papillary growth pattern, as well as neuroendocrine differentiation. The present paper describes a case of SPC with bcl-2 expression, which is known as a marker for malignancy of neuroendocrine tumors. Interestingly, despite bcl-2 expression being a poor prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors, the patient with this tumor has achieved long-term survival (approximately 6 years) at the time of writing this report. Because previous investigators reported that bcl-2 expression might play a role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer, we suggest that bcl-2 expression might reflect a good prognosis in patients with SPC, rather than being a poor prognostic indicator, as it is in several types of neuroendocrine tumor. However, to confirm this hypothesis, further investigation is required.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Solid papillary carcinoma (SPC) is considered a rare malignant breast tumor, with an incidence ranging from 1.1% to 1.7% of all malignant breast tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–10\\]</u>. Maluf and Koerner first reported this disease entity as a special type of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with several characteristic histopathological features, including low-grade cellular atypia, intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, and solid papillary growth pattern, as well as neuroendocrine differentiation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Furthermore, the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) classification categorized this tumor as a solid papillary carcinoma (ICD-O codes: 8509/2 or 8509/3, with and without invasion) and indicated that solid neuroendocrine carcinoma originated from SPC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.

Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 62-year-old Japanese woman presenting with a mass in the left breast was admitted to Japanese hospital for evaluation of this lesion. Mammography showed a high-density mass, and breast ultrasonography showed well-demarcated, highly abundant blood flow and a cystic lesion . Because these results indicated the presence of a malignant tumor, fine-needle aspiration cytology and needle biopsy were performed. Aspiration cytology indicated a lesion suspicious for carcinoma . If tumor cells show ill-defined rosette formation, these findings indicate solid papillary carcinoma. But actually this is not 100% proven. We therefore conducted needle biopsy that suggested ductal carcinoma. Consequently, the patient underwent partial mastectomy of the left breast with lymph node dissection. Our patient’s surgical intervention had a successful outcome—neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis occurred, and she maintains a high quality of life 70 months after the operation.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【7】A breast ultrasonography image shows well-demarcated, highly abundant blood flow and a cystic lesion.

A solid tumor 25 × 30 × 25 mm in size and sharply demarcated from the surrounding tissue was visible at the cut surface of the breast tissue . Both necrosis and hemorrhage were present. Sections of paraffin-embedded tissue were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain for light microscopic observation. Histological examination revealed intraductal carcinoma showing a solid papillary growth pattern and nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores . The neoplastic lesion was encapsulated by bands of dense fibrosis. The tumor cells had a round to elongated and hyperchromatic nucleus plus finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm.

Discussion\n\n【29】Although SPC was first reported by Maluf and Koerner in 1995 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, this disease entity remains underrecognized by clinicians, cytotechnologists, and pathologists 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. As previously mentioned, the 2010 WHO classification categorized this tumor as a solid papillary carcinoma. It is well known that SPC usually arises in the seventh or eighth decade and has a better prognosis than other breast cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Histopathologically, the tumor cells show a solid papillary growth pattern, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, and a round to elongated nucleus plus finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells usually show positive reactivity for neuroendocrine markers, including synaptophysin and chromogranin A. In addition, these tumors generally show positive reactivity for ER and PgR 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Several types of low-grade ductal carcinomas should be considered as differential diagnoses for SPC. In particular, papillary carcinoma is similar to SPC in many respects. Namely, it arises in elderly patients, grows in large well-circumscribed ducts, and is characterized by a good prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, this tumor differs from SPC by the presence of delicate papillae, a branching pattern, a cuboidal to columnar appearance of the tumor cells, and the lack of a solid growth pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 11\\]</u>. Certain benign intraductal tumors should be considered because of their solid or papillary intraductal epithelial growth pattern 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 11\\]</u>. However, a uniform cell population, increased mitotic activity, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, and intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition are not usually seen in benign intraductal tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 7, 11\\]</u>. Furthermore, the importance of the confirmation of neuroendocrine differentiation has often been described 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In the present paper, the tumor cells followed the characteristic features of SPC, including a solid papillary growth pattern, nuclear palisading around fibrovascular cores, a round to elongated and hyperchromatic nucleus, finely granular eosinophilic cytoplasm, and intracellular or extracellular mucin deposition, as well as positive reactivity for synaptophysin, but without positive reactivity for chromogranin A.\n\n【30】The immunohistochemical examination findings of this tumor are worthy further discussion. Ki-67 is known as a prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 17, 21, 22\\]</u>. Kawasaki et al. reported that the Ki-67 labeling index of nonneuroendocrine DCIS (8.1%) was significantly higher than that of neuroendocrine DCIS (4.3%), and they concluded that a low Ki-67 labeling index is correlated with a good prognosis in patients with neuroendocrine DCIS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In fact, our patient showed an exceptionally low Ki-67 labeling index (3.7%). In addition, several studies on neuroendocrine tumors have reported that bcl-2 or p53 expression might be correlated with malignant behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–17, 19, 23–27\\]</u>. However, no studies were found in which investigation was limited to SPC. Therefore, we tried to establish the immunohistochemical prognostic indicators of SPC by using bcl-2 and p53, which are acceptable prognostic indicators in several types of neuroendocrine tumor. As a result, the tumor cells showed negative reactivity for p53, which may reflect a good prognosis in patients with SPC. However, the tumor cells showed positive reactivity for bcl-2, which is a poor prognostic indicator of neuroendocrine tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>.\n\n【31】To explain this paradoxical result, we considered the meaning of bcl-2 expression in breast cancer. Won et al. reported that beclin-1 and bcl-2 expression might play a role in the inhibition of the development of breast cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. Therefore, we suggested that bcl-2 expression also reflexes the good prognosis of the patients with SPC rather than prognostic indicators in several kinds of neuroendocrine tumor. Unfortunately, our immunohistochemical examinations are based on only one patient with SPC. To confirm this hypothesis, further investigation is required.\n\n【32】#### Competing Interests\n\n【33】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgments</u>\n\n【35】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research to Yoichiro Okubo (no. 26860774) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan and a research grant to Yoichiro Okubo from the Kanagawa Cancer Center (no. 28-27).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a bony avulsion injury, which was presumed to have arisen from the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament but turned out instead to be an osteochondral avulsion fracture of the femoral origin. This unexpected finding that was not detected during preoperative workup resulted in the first attempt at surgical fixation being aborted. The need for a second planned definitive fixation procedure emphasises the importance of combining a thorough history and examination in association with appropriate imaging in the patient workup. The patient’s definitive operative treatment and outcome are described. Although rare, surgeons (and emergency room doctors) treating such patients should include femoral end avulsion injuries of the anterior cruciate ligament in the differential diagnosis of a child presenting with an acute haemarthrosis of the knee. Furthermore, once diagnosed, early onward referral to an experienced knee surgeon is advocated.\n\n【2】#### 1\\.

By comparison, avulsions of the ACL from the femoral origin are rare, and to date only nine other cases of femoral end avulsion injuries of the ACL have been reported in the English-speaking literature.

Despite their rare occurrence, femoral end avulsions of the ACL should be included in the differential diagnosis of a child with an acute haemarthrosis of the knee.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 11-year-old male patient presented to our institution after sustaining trauma to his left lower extremity. On the day of presentation, there had been high winds in the vicinity resulting in the corrugated iron roof of a garage he had been walking nearby blowing off and landing on his left leg. The patient was trapped under the sheet of metal until freed by attending paramedics. In the emergency department, primary and secondary survey assessments of the patient revealed injuries to the knee and distal fibula only. A full formal examination of the knee was not possible due to pain and a tense haemarthrosis. Subsequent plain radiographs revealed an intra-articular avulsion fracture , as well as fracture of the distal fibular diaphysis. A working diagnosis of displaced tibial spine avulsion fracture was made, and the patient was scheduled for surgery the following day to assess and fix the injury. Examination under anaesthesia revealed a ten-degree block to neutral extension of the knee and a positive Lachmann test with a soft end point. Arthroscopic examination of the knee revealed a lesion at odds with the preoperative diagnosis of tibial spine avulsion. A femoral end osteo-chondral avulsion fracture of the ACL was revealed . Due to the unexpected findings and uncertainty about the optimal method of fixation in a skeletally immature patient, the fragment was reduced back into its normal position, the arthroscopic portals were closed, and the knee was splinted in extension in a plaster of Paris splint. With the benefit of hindsight, the treating team acknowledged that if a bone fragment this large had been avulsed from the tibial insertion of the ACL, this should have been reflected in the architecture of the tibial spine footprint on the preoperative X-ray. But as the appearances of this region appeared normal, this avulsion was unlikely to have occurred from the tibial end of the ACL, rather occurring from the less common femoral origin. A CT scan was subsequently obtained , and the literature was scrutinised to aid preoperative planning of definitive fixation. Subsequent definitive fixation was perfomed nine days following the index procedure using a part arthroscopic and part open approach. Initial arthroscopic manoeuvres (including the use of a direct anterior portal in addition to the two standard portals) involved gentle curettage of the residual crater over the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle from where the ACL had been avulsed. Then two 2.4 mm Beath pins were passed in transosseous manner from the lateral supracondylar ridge into the centre of the defect (crossing the physis) using a posterior cruciate ligament targeting guide. 2 loops of 1 PDS suture were passed via these tunnels from the outside of the knee to the centre of the defect. Then a medial parapatellar approach to the knee joint was performed to formally expose the knee, two No. 2 Vicryl Bunnell sutures were passed across the femoral end of the ACL, and these sutures were placed into the PDS loops that had previously been passed into the knee. Pulling on the PDS sutures allowed the No. 2 Vicryl sutures to be passed through the tunnels previously drilled with the Beath pins and to be delivered to the lateral supracondylar ridge of the femur. The sutures were then tied to one another over a bone bridge thereby reducing the avulsed fragment back into its normal anatomical position . Postoperatively, the patient was splinted in extension for the first four weeks. At this stage, the patient was placed into a range of motion knee brace (allowing up to sixty degrees of flexion) and allowed to partially weight bear with crutches. At six weeks following surgery, the patient’s brace was slackened to allow a full range of motion. Radiographs performed nine weeks following definitive fixation showed union of his fracture . He was allowed to ambulate free of his brace at this stage. At six-month follow up, the patient was able to ambulate without walking aids with a normal gait pattern and had a negative anterior drawer and Lachmann test and full restoration of knee flexion. No deformity or leg length discrepancy was noted at this follow up interval.\n\n【6】(a)\n\n【7】(b)\n\n【8】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| (a) Anteroposterior and (b) lateral views of the patient’s knee depicting an intra-articular fracture fragment. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】(a)\n\n【12】(b)\n\n【13】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Intraoperative arthroscopic images depicting (a) an empty lateral wall of the intercondylar notch resulting from an osteochondral avulsion fracture of the femoral end of the ACL and (b) an arthroscopic hook reducing the fragment (outlined by black dots) to its normal position. |\n| --- |\n\n【16】(a)\n\n【17】(b)\n\n【18】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【19】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| CT scan depicting (a) sagittal and (b) axial views of the patients knee depicting the avulsed osteochondral fragment. |\n| --- |\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| Schematic diagram depicting the method of repair. |\n| --- |\n\n【23】(a)\n\n【24】(b)\n\n【25】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n| (a) Anteroposterior and (b) lateral views of the patients knee at three-month follow up. |\n| --- |\n\n【28】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【29】Epidemiologically femoral end avulsions of the ACL may be subdivided into either purely cartilaginous avulsions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3–5\\]</u> or osteochondral avulsion injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–11\\]</u>, the latter being found in our patient whose case we have presented in this article. Furthermore, femoral end avulsion injuries may occur in isolation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4, 7, 9–11\\]</u> (as seen with the child we treated), simultaneously with a tibial end avulsion as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>, and also in tandem with a tibial end avulsion with a significant gap of time between the two injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The youngest patient to have sustained such an injury was three years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. The last two of these reports differed in their length of follow up with the latter reporting good outcome at 13-year follow up (as opposed to 10 weeks in the former report) with only slight laxity of the ACL. Almost universally these injuries occur as a result of relatively high-energy mechanisms as was the case with our patient.\n\n【30】Robinson and Driscoll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> were the first group to report such an injury where it was seen in conjunction with a simultaneous avulsion of the tibial end of the ligament as well. The first report of an isolated avulsion of the femoral origin of the ACL was reported by Eady et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Tohyama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a case of consecutive avulsion fractures involving the ACL in which a tibial-sided avulsion fracture was successfully treated and was followed 35 months later by a second injury in which the femoral attachment of the ACL was avulsed.\n\n【31】Our technique of repair was in essence similar to that described by Robinson and Driscoll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> with our transosseous tunnels for passage of the sutures attached to the femoral end of the ACL crossing the physis. As noted in the article by Corso and Whipple 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, concerns have been raised in treating such injuries using transosseous tunnels which cross the physis. In the report by Robinson and Driscoll 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u> whose tunnel configuration we also utilised, the authors, however, reported no resulting distal femoral deformity. To counteract possible iatrogenic growth disturbance from transphyseal methods of ACL fixation, transepiphyseal methods of fixation have been advocated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The technically demanding nature of this method of fixation mandates that surgery be performed by soft tissue knee surgeons with expertise in the treatment of ACL injuries in the skeletally immature.\n\n【32】In summary, the case presented in this paper illustrates the pitfalls that may be encountered when treating children presenting with acute injuries to the knee.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, with 1–7% prevalence in the female population. It is observed in various locations of the human body, and large bowel endometriosis is the most common extrapelvic site, affecting about 5 to 12% of all women who present endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The clinical manifestations include a broad spectrum of symptoms, from the most classic ones such as dyspareunia, infertility, and dysmenorrhea to the less frequent symptoms such as urinary or intestinal complaints. Thus, nonspecific signs or symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract-abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, palpable abdominal mass, diarrhea, or constipation may represent difficulties in the differential diagnosis of a benign disease that eventually has malignant behavior 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Except in cases of rectal nodules, intestinal endometriosis cannot be diagnosed only by physical examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Description\n\n【6】A 51-year-old female, from Guaíba, South of Brazil, was referred to a gastroenterology outpatient clinic at the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. She had noticed a decrease in her bowel habits (evacuations every three days), as well as sharp and long stools, with progressive worsening during one year period. She also had intermittent episodes of elimination of red blood mixed with feces, every 3–4 weeks; she denied associated abdominal pain, weight loss, or night sweats. On physical examination, blood pressure was 124 × 78 mmHg, heart rate 80bpm, and respiratory rate 14 and normal pulmonary and cardiac auscultations were performed. The abdomen was painless, without palpable masses or visceromegaly, and normal bowel sounds were present. The rectal examination showed no nodules, bleeding, or masses, and there was no palpable enlargement of the lymph nodes.\n\n【7】Personal and family history: symptomatic cholelithiasis (awaiting surgery), two previous cesarean sections (G2P2), and hysterectomy in 2011 (fibroids). She denied continued use of medications, alcoholism, smoking, or drug use. She had no family history of gastrointestinal tract disease or any type of cancer.\n\n【8】Investigations were performed initially with laboratory tests (blood count, renal function, electrolytes, liver function tests were normal). Afterwards, she underwent tomography of the abdomen (CT), showing two areas of irregular parietal thickening, one in the upper rectum with approximately 3.0 cm extension and the other in the middle segment of the sigmoid colon, measuring about 2.5 cm in length, presenting impregnation with contrast . These lesions were stenosing but did not determine significant upstream intestinal obstruction. Among the diagnostic possibilities, a synchronic colorectal neoplasia was highlighted. An opaque enema was performed before performing a colonoscopy that confirmed the findings of the CT scan. During rectosigmoidoscopy, the device was inserted up to 30 cm from the anal margin, where a concentric stenosis was observed, covered by macroscopically normal mucosa, preventing the progression of the device. At 15 cm from the anal margin, a caliber reduction area covered by irregular and friable mucosa was observed. A biopsy specimen was performed and the anatomopathological study resulted in colonic mucosa without relevant alterations.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】Abdomen tomography with stenosing lesions in the upper rectum and sigmoid presenting impregnation with contrast, as shown by the pointing arrow.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【12】Coronal image of abdomen tomography with stenosing lesions in sigmoid presenting impregnation with contrast, as shown by the pointing arrow.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【14】Sagital image of abdomen tomography with stenosing lesions in the upper rectum presenting impregnation with contrast, as shown by the pointing arrow.\n\n【15】The surgical team evaluated the patient and decided to perform a rectosigmoidectomy with cholecystectomy, which had no complications and evidenced the two stenoses mentioned in the tomography with surrounding fibrotic adhesions. The anatomopathological study of the surgical specimen evidenced intestinal wall endometriosis, compromising submucosa and internal and external muscular layers, with fibrosis. The patient subsequently evolved with complete improvement of the referred symptoms.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【17】Low intestinal bleeding, represented in the case reported as hematochezia, is a sign of different pathologies, from benign to malignant. What is noticeable in this case are the intestinal cycling changes that the patient presented, rectal bleeding every 3–4 weeks, which should alert to the diagnosis of endometriosis. Inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, neoplastic diseases, diverticular disease, and hemorrhoidal disease are part of the differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【18】Some patients have multiple lesions of endometriosis involving more than one intestinal segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, two areas of irregular parietal thickening were found, one in the upper rectum and the other in the middle segment of the sigmoid colon, which were initially interpreted as suspect of synchronic neoplasia but which, in fact, were found to be compatible with endometriosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【19】It is known that the extension of the disease is not necessarily related to the intensity of the symptoms; many women are asymptomatic with extensive disease by incidental finding, as some women with mild illness have disabling symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In addition, deep infiltrative endometriosis (DIE) of the intestine invades at least at the level of the serosa and the muscular layer itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The patient in the case had no symptoms until a year ago, including most of her reproductive life without the classics symptoms of endometriosis (dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and infertility) and the anatomopathological study indicated as intestinal wall DIE, compromising submucosa and internal and external muscular layers, with fibrosis, and therefore, evidenced extensive disease by the pathology classification.\n\n【20】In addition, endometrial tissue outside the uterus is probably an underdiagnosed disease according to some reports, presumably some patients with functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome may actually have intestinal endometriosis, since the symptoms of both pathologies are nonspecific.Thus, the diagnosis of endometriosis is relevant because it offers a simple treatment in menacme, for example, using hormone therapy.\n\n【21】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【22】Large bowel endometriosis is a diagnostic challenge and should be remembered between differential diagnoses of nonspecific or even alarming symptoms of the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【23】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【24】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The imaging studies revealed a huge renal vein aneurysm. The patient refused any interventional management, despite the risk of possible rupture, and after a week of mild pain therapy, she was discharged. She was followed up closely, and after one year, she remains asymptomatic. Conservative management of such patients has been described before with success.

Introduction\n\n【3】The most common location for visceral venous aneurysms remains the portal system 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Venous aneurysms of the portal system are often associated with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. However, renal veins consist of an unusual location for visceral venous aneurysms (incidence < 3%), with only a small number of case reports in literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Therefore, there are insufficient data regarding optimal treatment.\n\n【4】The aim of this report is to present an unusual case of a patient with portal hypertension presenting with a large-sized renal vein aneurysm. Proper diagnostic and therapeutic management is discussed.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】Α 40-year-old female patient with history of liver cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B infection presented complaining of diffuse abdominal pain. Her medical history revealed portal hypertension without ascites or encephalopathy. No acute or distended abdomen was found during physical examination. Moreover, her laboratory investigations were unremarkable. Duplex ultrasonography revealed portal vein thrombosis as well as a left renal vein aneurysm showing increased turbulent venous flow (30 cm/sec). A computed angiography followed that showed an enlarged tortuous left renal vein forming a giant saccular aneurysm (7.8 cm × 6.0 cm) .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】Computed angiography showing a large-sized renal vein aneurysm (white arrow) arising from the left renal vein (black arrow).\n\n【9】A vein aneurysm resection or endovascular aneurysm embolization was recommended due to the risk of possible rupture. The patient, however, refused any intervention and decided to be followed up closely. After receiving mild pain therapy for a week, she was discharged, and after one year, she remains asymptomatic.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【11】Although a functional hemodynamic intrarenal disorder is observed in patients with liver cirrhosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, there is still no direct association confirmed between portal hypertension and aneurysm formation in renal veins. Portal hypertension remains the main cause for acquired cases of portal vein aneurysm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> although cases of renal vein aneurysms are rare and discovered incidentally most of the times 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. However, our patient had a history of portal vein thrombosis. This type of aneurysms may be asymptomatic or present with abdominal pain and other atypical symptoms when reaching a respectful size as in our case. Regarding the location, renal vein aneurysms are more common on the left side than on the right side due to hemodynamic (“nutcracker phenomenon”) and embryologic factors (formation of left renal vein due to anastomosis of the subcardinal veins) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【12】As far as proper management is concerned, computed tomography imaging using intravenous contrast media remains a useful tool for identifying such aneurysms and designing possible therapeutic strategies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. However, Doppler ultrasonography still remains a useful noninvasive imaging modality to easily identify and describe their basic features (size, flow, and location) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Watchful waiting has been recommended with satisfying results although this should be preferably applied in aneurysms of smaller size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. When the risk of rupture is high as in our case or when aneurysms are symptomatic, repair of the aneurysms should be scheduled promptly. In these cases, first therapeutic choice remains the use of interventional percutaneous techniques aiming at aneurysm thrombosis, whereas open vascular reconstructions remain the alternative choice, when vein patency is an issue for target organ viability or the aneurysm itself causes compression to adjacent structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, as underlined by many authors, durability of endovascular techniques needs to be confirmed in long-term follow-up of such patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【13】#### Consent\n\n【14】A written consent has been obtained from the patient in order to present his case.\n\n【15】#### Competing Interests\n\n【16】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

This second necrotic area was not initially suspected because there were no ECG changes in the anterior leads and the left descending coronary artery did not present any significant stenoses on emergency coronary angiography. Unrecognised myocardial infarction may carry important prognostic implications. CMR is currently the best imaging technique to detect unexpected infarcts.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Myocardial infarcts are routinely detected by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion or CMR imaging. Rioufol et al. showed with intravascular coronary ultrasound (IVUS) that although only one lesion is clinically responsible during an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), ACS seems to be associated with pan-coronary destabilisation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. CMR is the gold standard technique to visualise myocardial necrosis and evaluate myocardial viability after an acute coronary syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Moreover, Wagner et al. demonstrated that although SPECT and CMR detect transmural myocardial infarcts at similar rates in animals, CMR systematically detects subendocardial infarcts that are missed by SPECT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. We present a case of an unexpected coexisting myocardial infarction (absence of significative stenosis on coronary angiography) detected by delayed enhancement MRI, which was unseen by SPECT.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 41-year-old man was referred to our department with an inferior acute myocardial infarction. He was smoker with hyperlipidaemia (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 169 mg/dL). The time symptom onset to admission to the intensive care unit was ten hours. His 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed a normal sinus rhythm at 60 beats/min with persisting ST elevation and Q waves in the inferior leads. Emergency coronary angiography revealed an acute thrombotic occlusion of the second segment of the right coronary artery, a severe stenosis of a non-dominant and small circumflex coronary artery and diffuse plaques in all segments of the left anterior descending coronary artery (Figure 1, Panel (c) and (d)); the patient underwent angioplasty and (bare metal) stenting with a good final result (Figure 1, Panel (a) and (b)). Initial CMR was performed five days after the acute event. Steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine sequences showed normal wall motion in the anterior area and severe myocardial hypokinesia in the inferior wall. Black blood T2 images (T2 weighted short inversion-time, inversion-recovery (STIR) breath hold pulse sequences) suggested myocardial oedema in the inferior wall (Figure 2, Panel (e)). CMR detected transmural delayed enhancement in the inferior wall associated with late microvascular obstruction 10 minutes after gadolinium injection (Figure 2, Panel (f) and (g)). Surprisingly, another area of hyperenhancement which was subendocardial was found in the mid anterior wall of the left ventricle within the distribution of the left anterior descending coronary artery territory.\n\n【6】(a)\n\n【7】(b)\n\n【8】(c)\n\n【9】(d)\n\n【10】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Initially, the coronary angiography showed an acute thrombotic occlusion on the second segment of the right coronary artery (Panel (a)). The patient underwent angioplasty and stenting with a final good result (Panel (b)). Coronary angiography revealed a severe stenosis on a minor circumflex coronary artery (Panel (c)). There were many diffuse lesions on the left anterior descending coronary artery and his branches without significant stenosis (Panel (d)). |\n| --- |\n\n【13】(a)\n\n【14】(b)\n\n【15】(c)\n\n【16】(d)\n\n【17】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Black blood T2 images (T2 weighted short inversion-time, inversion-recovery (STIR) breath hold pulse sequences) suggested myocardial oedema (arrowheads) strictly in the inferior wall (Figure 2, Panel (e)). Gadolinium-enhanced images 通用删除1(英):<u>(Inversion Recovery turboFLASH 3D short axis and long axis sequences)</u> demonstrated transmural late enhancement of the inferior wall (arrowheads) associated with late microvascular obstruction (Panel (f) and (g)). Furthermore, these sequences showed a subendocardial delayed enhancement area  which was located in the anterior wall at mid-ventricular level in favour of a limited necrosis (Panel (f) and (g)). Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with thallium-201 suggested hypoperfusion in the inferior and lateral walls during stress but did not detect at rest any hypouptake in the anterior wall (Panel (h)). |\n| --- |\n\n【20】The patient remained well and asymptomatic during follow-up. CMR and myocardial scintigraphy were also performed in this patient 3 months later. CMR again showed persistent areas of delayed enhancement in the inferior wall transmurally and subendocardial enhancement in the anterior wall at the mid-ventricular level. Myocardial scintigraphy suggested myocardial ischaemia in the inferior, lateral and basal walls in favour of a restenosis, but this study did not detect any myocardial necrosis in the anterior wall (Figure 2, Panel (h)). Restenosis on the right coronary artery was confirmed by coronary angiography. The left anterior descending artery remained unchanged with diffuse nonobstructive plaques.\n\n【21】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【22】In a patient with acute inferior myocardial infarction, CMR was able to detect an unexpected coexisting area of necrosis in a different vascular territory. CMR findings in animals confirm that the subendocardial infarcts detected by CMR correspond to histologically defined myocardial infarcts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. In our case, despite absence of significative stenoses in the left descending coronary artery, CMR found an area of necrosis in the anterior wall. We cannot affirm that this anterior subendocardial infarction was not caused by coronary angiography. However, we hypothesise that the 2 myocardial infarctions seen on delayed enhanced MRI are the consequence of pan-coronary destabilisation, although the anterior infarct could very well be an old infarction that was so far not recognised. The lack of T2 hypersignal and the lack of microvascular obstruction in the anterior wall are in favour of a chronic myocardial infarction in this segment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. We can suppose that this area of limited necrosis is a consequence of a spontaneous atherosclerotic plaque rupture on the left descending coronary artery. These nonrecognised infarcts may be quite frequent and carry important prognostic implications, as it is known that spontaneous coronary atheromatous plaque rupture, without significant underlying stenosis during first acute coronary syndrome, healed without significant plaque modification in 50% of cases with medical therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. CMR is currently the best imaging technique to detect unexpected infarcts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Thus, detecting these infarcts enables important additional information regarding to the risk stratification, eventually targeted therapy and carefully surveillance in these patients with high risk of cardiovascular events.\n\n【23】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】To conclude, the incidence of unrecognised coexistent myocardial infarcts may be underestimated and not infrequent. Of particular interest, this case highlights the possibility to detect these coexisting subendocardial infarcts using CMR. We believe that CMR has advantages, at least in patients with discrepancies between therapeutic success and missing clinical improvement.\n\n【25】Consent  \nWritten informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.

COVID-19 was reported to the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 31<sup>st</sup> December 2019 and declared as a global pandemic on 11<sup>th</sup> March 2020 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

Pneumothorax can be categorised by aetiology into spontaneous and traumatic, and spontaneous pneumothorax can be further characterised into primary or secondary. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with no background of respiratory disease, and the pathophysiology is thought to be from asymptomatic blebs and bullae which disrupt due to shear force 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Secondary pneumothorax occurs in patients with underlying lung abnormality and diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, sarcoidosis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and connective tissue disorders. Many cases of traumatic pneumothorax are iatrogenic, and this complication has been reported in central vein cannulation, pleural tap or biopsy, transbronchial biopsy, fine needle aspiration, and acupuncture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Pulmonary barotrauma is another cause of iatrogenic pneumothorax occurring in patients being mechanically ventilated due to high inspiratory inflation pressures.\n\n【5】Tension pneumothorax develops when damaged tissue forms a one-way valve leading into the accumulation of air in the pleural space with inhalation. This results in rising volume of air and pressure in the affected hemithorax, leading to collapse of the affected lung and displacement of the mediastinum towards the contralateral side. This is a medical emergency, as the mediastinal shift exerts pressure on the contralateral lung and the vena cava, resulting in respiratory insufficiency, cardiovascular compromise, and death if untreated.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】We present the case of a 62-year-old gentleman, who was brought into the emergency department (ED) by ambulance with a history of dry cough, low grade fever, worsening shortness of breath for 4 days, and pleuritic sounding chest pain, which was different to when he had a pulmonary embolism approximately ten months ago. His past medical history included type II diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, treated malignant neoplasm of the base of tongue, diverticular disease, essential hypertension, and previous provoked pulmonary embolism. Before admission, he was living independently with his wife. His exercise tolerance was restricted to 10 yards with the assistance of a walking stick. He was an exsmoker and used to smoke 5 cigarettes a day but stopped smoking a few years previously.\n\n【8】On admission, he was pyrexial with a temperature of 38.2°C, oxygen saturations 98% on 28% FiO<sub>2</sub>, blood pressure 73/35 mmHg, and pulse rate 92 bpm. Initial treatment included oxygen 28% FiO<sub>2</sub> via a venturi mask and fluid resuscitation for hypotension. Physical examination revealed bibasal crepitations on auscultation of chest and a swollen and tender right leg. Initial investigations revealed deranged biochemical markers  and opacification affecting the right midzone of the lung .\n\n【9】Table 1 \n\n【10】Blood results.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【12】Chest radiograph on admission demonstrating right midzone consolidation.\n\n【13】Initial laboratory workup summarised in Table 1.\n\n【14】In view of the clinical presentation and raised d-dimer, a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) was performed which reported right upper lobe consolidation with subtle peripheral ground glass opacification in the left upper lobe and both lower lobes, suggestive of early COVID-19 infection . Moreover, his troponin I levels were markedly elevated and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST segment depression and T-wave inversion in the anterolateral chest leads. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderately impaired left ventricular systolic function with an akinetic and rounded apical septal wall.\n\n【15】(a)\n\n【16】(b)\n\n【17】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【19】CT pulmonary angiogram report: there are no pulmonary emboli and pleural or pericardial effusions. There is consolidation within the right upper lobe with subtle peripheral ground glass opacification noted in the left upper lobe and in both lower lobes. Appearances are indeterminate but could represent early COVID-19 disease. The central and peripheral airways are patent with no lower cervical, axillary, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung mass. Other viscera are unremarkable.\n\n【20】On account of the history, examination, and investigations, he was treated as suspected COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia (CURB-65 score = 2, moderate severity), COVID-19 myocarditis, and sepsis, leading to multiorgan failure. In view of poor physiological reserve and comorbidities, the ceiling of care was decided to be ward level care and noninvasive ventilation if needed. However, he began to improve clinically, became normotensive, and was able to be weaned off oxygen day 3 after admission. By that time, his swab detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA which confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\n【21】Following initial improvement, he suddenly developed a new, increased oxygen demand, requiring titration of humidified oxygen up to 10 litres. Chest physiotherapy helped him bring up copious volumes of thick sputum, and he was stable for most of the day with oxygen saturations of 93%. Later that day, he suddenly deteriorated and becoming cyanotic and critically unwell. Oxygen saturations were 80% on 15 litres nonrebreathe mask, and he was significantly tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 40/minute. An urgent portable chest X-ray revealed a large right-sided pneumothorax causing mediastinal shift .\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【23】Portable chest radiograph following acute deterioration, demonstrating a right-sided tension pneumothorax.\n\n【24】An intercostal drain was inserted on an emergency basis and the patient improved slightly over the next 24 hours though he still required oxygen via a high flow nasal cannula system to maintain oxygen saturations of 92% or more. Despite the chest drain and the addition of thoracic suction, the lung did not reexpand. He continued to deteriorate rapidly, was unable to tolerate further pleural procedures, and died.\n\n【25】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【26】Here, we present a case of spontaneous tension pneumothorax in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia and myocarditis. Although our patient did not have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease before the admission, review of his CTPA images revealed minimal emphysematous changes in the right lung which could have ruptured by the added insult of COVID-19 pneumonia. This could have led to an air leak into the hemithorax, resulting in a spontaneous tension pneumothorax.\n\n【27】COVID-19 is a newly described disease with limited and ever-expanding knowledge of its clinical manifestations. Multiple causes of acute clinical deterioration have been already described, including ARDS and pulmonary embolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. This case report aims to highlight the importance of urgent chest X-ray and prompt clinical examination in patients with COVID-19 that develop a sudden increase in oxygen requirements and become acutely tachypnoeic in order to rule out the possibility of pneumothorax. In view of the lack of a formal diagnosis of previous lung disease, this situation could have been misinterpreted as progression of ARDS in the current climate. This could have resulted in further deterioration of the patient if CPAP had been introduced 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Furthermore, chest physiotherapy is contraindicated in untreated tension pneumothorax, and depending on the time frame of pneumothorax development, may have had a negative effect on the clinical course of this patient.\n\n【28】Two recent case reports have been published regarding the link between COVID-19 and spontaneous pneumothorax; however, the absence of published literature of such cases could result in clinicians missing these diagnoses; hence, we present this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【29】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【30】In summary, our case demonstrates spontaneous tension pneumothorax as a rare but serious complication of COVID-19. Meticulous physical examination and repeat sequential chest X-rays can be useful tools in the diagnosis of complications and management of disease.\n\n【31】#### Consent\n\n【32】No written consent has been obtained from the patient as there is no patient identifiable data included in this case report.\n\n【33】#### Disclosure\n\n【34】Muhammad Shahzad and Jennie Han are co-first authors.\n\n【35】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【36】All authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": "9bc31175-16a6-49f8-98c1-d9ab5a698d4b", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Pseudothrombocytopenia (PTCP) is an in vitro phenomenon of low platelet count caused by the agglutination of platelets, leading to false low platelet counts in automated cell counting. Typically, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) mediates this platelet clumping. PTCP has little clinical significance, but misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary diagnostic tests and treatment. In this case report, we present a 65-year-old Caucasian female suffering from multiple complications during and after cardiac surgery. During her postoperative stay at the ICU, she was diagnosed with thrombocytopenia and an inadequate response to platelet supplementation.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 65-year-old Caucasian female was admitted to the General Hospital of Vienna with the diagnosis of a combined high-grade mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency, persisting atrial fibrillation, and a hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Surgical reconstruction of the mitral and tricuspid valve, as well as a left atrial appendage (LAA) resection, was indicated and performed. An intraoperative rupture of the left atrium led to two periods of cardiopulmonary bypass and the consecutive implantation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to impaired right ventricular function. After the surgical procedure, the patient was transferred to the ICU, where she required high doses of catecholamine support and continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) due to acute renal failure. On postoperative day (POD) 7, ECMO weaning was successful, and the therapy was finally stopped. Initially, anticoagulation therapy consisted of unfractionated heparin and was switched to low-molecular-weight heparin after ECMO explantation. On POD 8, a complete blood count (CBC) showed a reduced platelet count of 39 G/L . 4Ts score for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was 5, which represented an intermediate probability of HIT. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIT was negative (Zymutest HIA IgG, Hyphen Biomed, Neuville sur Oise, France), and a viscoelastic test of a whole blood sample (rotational thromboelastometry, ROTEM) showed no abnormalities, moreover, a procoagulant state despite the low numeric platelet count . Physical examination did not reveal any signs of hemorrhagic diathesis. Platelet count could not be significantly increased by the transfusion of two units of platelet concentrates. The platelet count after the first transfusion was 28 G/L, and the platelet count after the second transfusion on the following day was 24 G/L. On POD 10, CBC was reevaluated by using sodium citrate tubes instead of EDTA tubes, revealing a platelet count of 216 G/L . Since PTCP was diagnosed two days after the first low platelet count and the patient was critically ill and on continuous ECMO therapy, other causes of thrombocytopenia such as immune thrombocytopenia were not evaluated further. During the patient’s stay at our ICU, platelet count was also checked with a specific blood collection tube (ThromboExact, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) confirming the results collected with the citrated blood tubes.\n\n【4】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【5】Postoperative platelet count with different blood collection tubes (EDTA, Sodium Citrate, Magensium sulfate) as shown.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【7】Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) showing a procoagulant state despite the low numeric platelet count.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Discussion\n\n【9】Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count lower than 150 G/L. A platelet count lower than 100 G/L is considered to imply medium to high bleeding risk, depending on the particular platelet count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The diagnosis of thrombocytopenia usually includes a repetition of the complete blood count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>, the white blood cell differential 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, a peripheral blood smear, and the evaluation of possible hematological abnormalities. If none of these tests are indicative for a genuine thrombocytopenia or a malignant hematological disease, PTCP can be the cause for low platelet count 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【10】PTCP is an analytical error in automated blood cell counting. Blood samples which contain autoantibodies against thrombocytes and are collected in EDTA-containing tubes can lead to platelet clumping. Agglutinated platelets are detected as larger cells by using automated counters and lead to false low results. This phenomenon was discovered early after the invention of laboratory medicine automation and was described precisely soon after 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The incidence of severe thrombocytopenia (<100 G/L) among the population of critically ill patients is 7.8% and therefore a very likely diagnosis. This could mislead clinicians in cases of PTCP and result in overtreatment with the administration of platelet concentrates or even more invasive procedures such as splenectomy. Other rare causes of thrombocytopenia such as HIT were found to be 0.3% in this population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, whereas the incidence of PTCP is suggested to range from 0.09 to 0.15% in routine clinical blood samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Unfortunately, data of PTCP in a critically ill population are lacking, but given the data, one can assume that the likelihood of other more clinically relevant causes of thrombocytopenia, even if it is still very small (HIT 0.3%), is higher than to suffer from PTCP. Therefore, clinicians are concerned with the diagnostics of the more severe forms of thrombocytopenia and are not aware about analytical errors since the repetition of the specimen often confirms the result.\n\n【12】As mentioned above, PTCP is induced by the cross-reaction of EDTA and platelet autoantibodies which cause the agglutination of platelets in the sample 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. This phenomenon is not only restricted to EDTA but also present with other anticoagulants such as sodium oxalate, sodium citrate, and heparin, making it more difficult to diagnose PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Recently, there are increasing numbers of reports portraying this multi-anticoagulant PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. Additives mixed with EDTA specimens, i.e. aminoglycosides such as kanamycin and amikacin, can prevent the agglutination of platelets and dissociate platelet clumps if added after blood withdrawal and could therefore be a helping agent in diagnostics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16, 17\\]</u>. Unfortunately, there have been reports on the unreliability of these effects in certain cases of PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Another possible solution of the problem could be the utilization of magnesium sulfate (MgSO<sub>4</sub>) as an anticoagulant. Before laboratory medicine automation, MgSO<sub>4</sub> was widely used to prevent blood cell agglutination but was replaced by EDTA after the invention of automated cell counting because of the more convenient use as spray-dried coat in blood collection tubes. It is now suggested to reconsider MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an anticoagulant in diagnostics of multiple-anticoagulant PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. By now, blood collection tubes containing MgSO<sub>4</sub> as an anticoagulant additive are available commercially (ThromboExact, Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany) and were used in this presented case to confirm the results, which were collected in citrated blood tubes.\n\n【13】The induction of autoantibodies reacting with EDTA and platelets is not resolved but very likely induced over a period of medical treatment. An early work on the patient population (18 patients) presenting with PTCP found that, at hospital admission, 61% of all patients had a platelet count over 100 G/L, which then deteriorated over their hospital stay. Furthermore, they found that 55% of the study population were treated at an intensive care unit, 22% suffered from neoplastic diseases, and another 22% suffered from atherosclerosis-related conditions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. However, newer investigations could not reveal a correlation between these clinical characteristics and the development of PTCP, except for receiving medical treatment within a short period of time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The assumption of antibodies being the cause of this phenomenon was communicated early after the introduction of PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The detection of specific antibodies took place in the mid-90s. Platelet agglutination is induced by a variety of immunoglobulins including IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies, which bind to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors on the platelet surface 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>.\n\n【15】There are growing numbers of reported PTCP caused by a variety of therapies and diseases. In some cases, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors seems to be responsible for PTCP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>, as well as direct glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists such as abciximab 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Furthermore, there have been reports on PTCP in COVID-19 patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. It seems that multiple medical treatments, diseases, and infections can induce PTCP.\n\n【16】It is therefore important to raise awareness throughout the clinical and scientific societies to consider PTCP as differential diagnosis early after the onset of low platelet counts without clinical symptoms of hemorrhagic diathesis. With cases of multi-anticoagulant PTCP, it is getting more difficult to detect false low platelet counts, and appropriate diagnostic facilities (peripheral blood smear, ThromboExact blood tubes) need to be available for correct diagnosis. Considering these challenges, it can be difficult in clinical settings to thoroughly evaluate causes of thrombocytopenia, but one should consequently pursue the process of finding the right diagnosis since the clinical consequences of overtreatment can be dramatic, i.e. splenectomy. In this case report, the challenge of finding the right diagnosis was the complexity of the case. Thrombocytopenia is not uncommon after cardiac surgery and on ECMO therapy. A bleeding tendency is often present because of deranged coagulation factors and mass transfusions. Since our department is very skilled and trained in the management and diagnosis of bleeding disorders, our patient was diagnosed with PTCP shortly after the onset of severe thrombocytopenia (two days after first severe low platelet counts). Further invasive treatment could be averted from the patient.\n\n【17】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【18】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The latest coronavirus infection due to SARS-CoV-2, which started in China in December 2019, was announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. All epidemiological data so far show us that SARS-CoV-2 infection is less serious in children than in adults. Allergic asthma, the most common chronic disease in children, is usually not to be related to greater risk or severity for COVID-19 in pediatric populations. Although reports/research on asthma and COVID-19 in children have thus far been comforting, when coming across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case Report. Here, we report a rare adolescent case of COVID-19-related pneumonia development with underlying asthma. A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. He was thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Pulmonary CT showed findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. He was discharged after 1 week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day favipiravir treatment was completed. Conclusion. When a physician comes across an asthma patient with any lower airway infection, attention should be given to evaluate their asthma control level and possibility of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Coronavirus pandemic, owing to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, which started in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was later announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is the third highest known pathogen coronavirus, whose mortality rates range from 6 to 10.5%, depending on the comorbidity of the infected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. At least, a quarter of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are reported to have one of the chronic diseases as a comorbidity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Some of the comorbidities, especially chronic respiratory tract diseases (such as asthma and COPD) with long-standing drug treatments, may influence the development, therapy, and prognosis of COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Here, a rarely seen case of a 16-year-old adolescent male patient is discussed under the light of the current literature, since he developed severe COVID-19-related pneumonia with the preexisting diagnosis of asthma.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 16-year-old male patient has been followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic with the diagnosis of asthma for the last 5 years. The patient was regularly using daily montelukast 10 mg tablet and budesonide + formoterol 80/4.5 mcg 2x1 puffs in the maintenance treatment of asthma. His persistent asthma has been under control, and its severity is mild. His pulmonary function test (spirometry) was found to be within normal limits (predicted FEV1: 131%, FVC: 136%, FEV1/FVC: 92, and PEF: 90%) several times for the last 3 years. He was detected to be allergic to molds and wild grasses. A skin prick test showed indurations as negative control: 0 × 0 mm, positive control: 6 × 6 mm, Chenopodium album: 3 × 3 mm, and Cladosporium: 3 × 3 mm.\n\n【7】He had symptoms of persisting fever up to 39°C degrees in the morning and night for 5 days and cough with green sputum and described a very severe headache for 3-4 days in the last week. He assessed the severity of headache as 10/10 with a visual analog scale. Also, the patient was experiencing orthopneic dyspnea while coughing. It was learned that he had previous contact with a SARS-CoV-2-positive individual.\n\n【8】In the initial physical examination, he seemed to have mild dyspnea and tachypnea, body temperature was 39.5°C, heart rate: 110/min, respiratory rate: 38/min, and oxygen saturation: 88% (without oxygen support). Pulmonary auscultation revealed diffuse sibilant and subcrepitant rales on the anterior and posterior parts of both the lungs and on the left basal region at the end of inspiration and beginning of expiration. Rest of the physical examination was within the normal limit. According to the laboratory results, initial leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet counts were decreased. In his routine biochemistry, AST and ALT levels were increased . Prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19 such as CRP, LDH, ferritin, D-dimer, and fibrinogen levels were mildly elevated. PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 were detected by nasopharyngeal swabs as positive twice. Serum immunoglobulins were within ±2 standard deviations of normal values. Pulmonary CT showed findings consistent with COVID-19-related pneumonia. Diffuse ground glass-like consolidated nodular lesions in the left hemithorax of the patient continued to the lower lobes. Ground glass-like nodular lesions were also observed in the peripheral areas in the upper lobe and in the superior segment of the lower lobe of the right lung (Figure 1(a)).\n\n【9】Table 1 \n\n【10】Laboratory results of the patient are shown.\n\n【11】(a)\n\n【12】(b)\n\n【13】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【15】The patient’s thorax CT images show radiologic findings consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. Diffuse ground glass-like consolidated nodular lesions in the left hemithorax continue to the lower lobes.\n\n【16】He was thought to have typical clinical and laboratory findings for SARS-CoV-2 infection combined with underlying pediatric (allergic) asthma. Final diagnosis is confirmed as COVID-19-related pneumonia with preexisting asthma. After diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia, he was admitted to the pediatric COVID-19 inpatient service. In addition to maintenance fluid, favipiravir (2x8 tablets on the first day and 2x3 tablets for the rest of 4 days, po) and methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg/day, iv route) were given for COVID-19. Also, for pneumonia, ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day, 3 gr/day, iv), clarithromycin (15–20 mg/kg/day, 1 gr/day, po), and paracetamol (3-4x15 mg/kg/dose, po) were administered. Since the patient sometimes had up to 39.5°C fever and described an increase in cough and dyspnea during the admission, inhaled corticosteroid 80 mcg 4x1 puffs was added to his treatment on the 4<sup>th</sup> day of admission. Without oxygen support, oxygen saturation (SpO2) level was usually observed at >95%. He was discharged after 1 week when all his complaints regressed, his examination became normal, and 5-day favipiravir treatment was completed. He was later followed up by the pediatric allergy outpatient clinic. During follow-ups, his repeated spirometry values were within normal limits and he did not need any physical therapy (we have obtained an informed consent form from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report).\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】We are reporting a rare case of suffering from COVID-19-related pneumonia with preexisting pediatric allergic asthma. As described above in our case with asthma, SARS-CoV-2 positivity in PCR testing and findings of typical ground glass-like opacity in chest CT were consistent with COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Because COVID-19 primarily affects the lungs, certain diseases (such as congenital heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and some primary immune deficiency diseases) have been identified as a potential risk factor for COVID-19 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. However, asthma has not been generally thought as a specific risk factor for severe COVID-19 development 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>. While some meta-analyses reported almost no data related to asthma patients, some others reported that asthma was thought to be associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality in hospitals. Where do asthmatic patients stand in this pandemic? Are asthmatic patients more inclined to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection? When afflicted, are asthmatic children at greater risk of developing severe COVID-19? Another issue is if the association between asthma and COVID-19 progress differs according to the age of the patient (adults vs. children) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>.\n\n【20】According to his initial laboratory results, leukocyte, lymphocyte, eosinophil, and platelet counts decreased, which were related to myelosuppression of SARS-CoV-2 infection . According to the laboratory results, all his immunoglobulin levels were found to be normal except for total IgE. Overall, although these clinical and laboratory findings demonstrated the severity of the disease, the patient overcame the disease without need of oxygen support and intensive care unit treatment. This course was also consistent with a report of Turkish pediatric patients by Karbuz et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Similar to our case, this report describes that pediatric asthma patients may have a symptomatic course but do not require mostly intensive care admission. In this report, cough was the key symptom in asthmatic cases (80.0%), and 87.6% of children with asthma were symptomatic (: 0.016). Nevertheless, being asthmatic was not always associated with disease gravity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. After 5 days of favipiravir treatment, liver function test (AST and ALT) levels of our patient were found to be doubled. This may be due to the use of the hepatotoxic effect of paracetamol and/or favipiravir 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In many nations, such as China, Brazil, India, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and Italy, the asthma prevalence in COVID-19 cases was lesser than that detected in the overall population, while the contradictory findings were demonstrated in the USA, Australia, UK, and Ireland 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. In a Chinese study, only one of the 182 pediatric cases with COVID-19 was admitted in Wuhan had asthma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. On the other hand, in Brazil and New York, it was demonstrated that asthma was a common comorbidity, but was not linked with more severe COVID-19 leading to hospitalization or the need for intensive care therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In an online survey of 91 asthma specialists, caring for more than 133,000 pediatric asthma cases in 5 continents, only 14% of the responders described assumed COVID-19 patients among their cases; asthmatic children had mild symptoms in 73% of them, and only 1 patient needed hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Respiratory viruses are one of the recognized triggers of asthma attacks. Conventional coronaviruses are respiratory viruses and have been accused of both upper airway infections and asthma attacks upon infection. Reported entry receptors for most conventional coronaviruses do not include ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Even for asthma patients, it is difficult to distinguish respiratory COVID-19 symptoms such as chest tightness, coughing, and shortness of breath from an asthma exacerbation by other triggers. Consequently, it is crucial to draw attention to the surveillance and active management of chronic preexisting diseases in COVID-19 cases. In a study, mild bronchospasm was noticed in 24% of the cases, and oral steroids were used in only 1 case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. In reality, COVID-19 has not been held responsible as an essential driver of viral wheezing or asthma attacks in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>.\n\n【23】Favipiravir as an antiviral agent and anti-inflammatory methylprednisolone were used in his treatment. Corticosteroid therapy is the main treatment for asthma, but its use in viral pneumonia is debatable. Steroids are supposed to be able to antagonize some pathophysiological developments of acute respiratory distress syndrome, comprising extreme inflammatory response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. According to an assessment of the Cochrane system, glucocorticoids can lessen the fatality of cases with severe community-acquired pneumonia as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. There is a complex relationship among asthma, inhaled corticosteroid use, and ACE2 expression. According to Severe Asthma Research Program-3 (SARP-3), the use of inhaled corticosteroids is linked with a decreased level of ACE2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) gene expressions in asthmatic patients which are the key entrance receptors for SARS-CoV-2 infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Also, all guidelines and experts suggest that asthma patients continue taking their inhaled corticosteroids using a metered-dose-inhaler (MDI) during this pandemic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24, 25\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Some of the potential mechanisms suggested in the relevant literature for a milder COVID-19 course in asthmatic children are as follows. Seriousness and complications of any SARS-CoV-2 infection are linked with the production of hyperinflammation. In asthmatics, such hyperinflammation could be decreased by several factors including the hindered and ineffective antiviral reaction because of lessened IFN-α production by dendritic and epithelial cells. Nevertheless, the defensive role of eosinophilic inflammation, Th2 type inflammatory mediator (e.g. IL-4/-5/-13) predominance in the respiratory system, and antiviral and immunomodulatory properties of inhaled corticosteroids are also thought to play a strong role.

This clinical entity is often underdiagnosed as it may be mistaken for other differential diagnoses, such as pedunculated myoma or adnexal lesions. Imaging modalities, including ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), accompanied with relevant and suspicious clinical findings are important tools in making acorrect diagnosis. To date, surgical excision of the mass remains the mainstay of treatment,which provides significant symptom relief. In this study, we present a female adolescent with chronic pelvic pain since menarche who underwent laparotomy with the presumed diagnosis of a left-sided ovarian mass. Retrospective evaluation of pelvic MR images demonstrated that the lesion was in fact an ACUM, which was further confirmed by histopathological examination.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Accessory and cavitated uterine mass (ACUM) is a rare newly described Mullerian anomaly, which generally presents with chronic recurrent pelvic pain and/or severe dysmenorrhea in women younger than 30 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is an accessory mass at the insertion of the round ligament that is lined by normal endometrium and has a dark-brown-colored fluid content 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. ACUMs are difficult to diagnose because of their broad differential diagnosis, which includes rudimentary and cavitated uterine horns such as those found in other uterine malformations (e.g. bicornuate uterus), adenomyosis with cystic or degenerated areas, degenerated leiomyomas, and essential and primary dysmenorrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. To the best of our knowledge, fewer than 60 cases of ACUM are reported in the literature at the time of writing this paper. In this case report, we describe a 14-year-old girl presenting with severe pelvic pain since her menarche. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an apparent adnexal mass, but final histopathological examination was in favor of ACUM.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 14-year-old girl presented with chronic recurrent pelvic pain since her menarche. Her pain aggravated monthly during her menstruation; however, she had a regular and normal menstrual flow. Her personal history and family history were not significant, and she had no previous sexual history. Different kinds of anti-inflammatory medications had been prescribed for her during the past two years. The patient had also received oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for two months, but none of the medications had been significantly effective. On physical examination, she was a well-developed girl with normal vital signs. She showed normal pubertal development with a height of 160 centimeters (percentile: 47%) and weight of 48 kilograms (percentile: 43%), and normal adrenarche and thelarche (stage 4). Pelvic examination of the external genitalia was normal with no evidence of imperforated hymen. No definite palpable mass was detected during abdominal examination. Ultrasonography was requested, which showed normal size and myometrial echogenicity of the uterus with normal endometrial thickness. There was evidence of a left-sided heterogeneous and mostly hyperechoic 35 × 30 mm adnexal mass with close contact to the left ovary . Color Doppler showed some internal vascularity. A small right-sided simple ovarian cyst was also seen on ultrasound. The cervix and vaginal canal were unremarkable on imaging. For further characterization of the mentioned lesion, pelvic MRI was performed, which revealed a well-defined heterogeneous mass with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and low-to-intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images with significant enhancement after administration of gadolinium. The mass was located on the left side of the pelvic cavity, close to the left ovary and uterus; however, no connection to the uterus or ovary was detected. There was no pelvic lymphadenopathy or ascites. Based on the imaging findings, a paraovarian mass or a myoma was suspected. Subsequently, the patient underwent laparotomy, and a well-defined fleshy mass was seen on the left side of the pelvic cavity. The mass was located just under the round ligament, close to but separated from the left ovary with no adhesion to the surrounding structures. Both ovaries and uterus were normal except for a simple right-sided ovarian cyst with no endometrial implants. The uterus had two normally developed fallopian tubes with no fundal impression or contour abnormality and two normal cornua. On close observation, the uterus was completely separated from the mentioned mass. Several collateral vessels arising from the left uterine artery, which provided arterial supply to the mass, were ligated during surgery to obtain hemostasis. Frozen section revealed normal myometrial muscle with reactive endometrium. Finally, the mass was successfully resected by enucleation and incision through the serosa. While performing complete excision, a chocolate-colored fluid flowed out from the mass. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery and was discharged one day after surgery. She continued to be asymptomatic with complete resolution of the cyclic pelvic pain after one year of follow-up. Gross evaluation of the pelvic mass revealed a cavitated mass with a thick muscular wall, and pathological examination showed normal irregular myometrium lined by functional endometrium . Thus, a final diagnosis of accessory and cavitated uterine mass was made. Retrospective re-evaluation of pelvic MRI demonstrated a well-defined mass with signal intensity similar to the uterus on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences with central hypersignal endometrium and normal endometrial-myometrial interface .\n\n【6】(a)\n\n【7】(b)\n\n【8】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】(a) On ultrasound, sagittal view of the pelvis shows the uterus with a normal uterine contour and normal echogenic endometrial line (arrow).

Discussion\n\n【28】Genitourinary development results from a complex interaction between the Wolffian ducts and the Mullerian ducts. Mullerian ducts are formed through invagination of the dorsal coelomic epithelium at about gestational week 6. At around 10 to 12 weeks of gestation, the two Mullerian ducts, fused with each other in a craniocaudal direction,finally fuse with the urogenital sinus, forming the uterus, bilateral fallopian tubes and the upper one-third of the vagina consequently 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Mullerian anomalies are deviations from normal anatomy resulting from distortion of the complex embryogenesis. Although these anomalies are usually benign conditions, they may lead to significant reproductive problems based on the degree as well as the type of maldevelopment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. These commonly occurring anomalies can be found in about 4–7% of the population; so, an effective and reliable classification of Mullerian anomalies can contribute to proper diagnosis and management of affected individuals 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Mullerian anomalies were classified by Acien and colleagues in 1992 for the first time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>; however, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology and the European Society for Gynecological Endoscopy (ESHRE/ESGE) recently updated the classification system of female genital anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In this categorization, the main classes are designed on the basis of deviations from normal uterine anatomy deriving from the same embryological origin, while the clinical significance and degree of deformity are the basis for subclasses classification 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【31】Uterine-like mass (ULM) is a distinct clinical entity defined as a cavitated mass lined with functional endometrium that is composed of sex hormone-sensitive smooth muscle cells, which are arranged irregularly at the periphery of the mass. These masses can be located within the uterus or anywhere else outside the uterus. ACUM, a subtype of non communicating ULM, is a rare newly described anomaly that, unlike other Mullerian anomalies, is associated with an otherwise normal uterus; hence, it should be classified as a separate entity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Persistence or duplication of Mullerian duct due to a gubernaculum dysfunction at the site of round ligament attachment has been postulated as the pathogenesis of ACUM 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【32】The same appearing masses have been described in the literature by different names, including cavitated adenomyoma, accessory cavitated mass, and juvenile cystic adenomyoma. However, ACUM is different from cystic adenomyosis, which usually occurs in middle-aged women, and is characterized by diffusely distributed adenomyotic foci within the uterus. Also, cystic adenomyosis lacks the normal endometrium and myometrium organization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>.\n\n【33】The current criteria used for the diagnosis of ACUM includes: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> an isolated accessory cavitated mass; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> normal uterus (endometrial cavity), tubes, and ovaries; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> surgical case with excised mass and with pathological examination; 通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u> accessory cavity lined by endometrial epithelium with glands and stroma; 通用删除7(英):<u>(5)</u> chocolate-brown-colored fluid content; and 通用删除7(英):<u>(6)</u> no adenomyosis (if uterus removed), but there could be small foci of adenomyosis in the myometrium adjacent to the accessory cavity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. The present case fulfilled all of the diagnostic criteria for ACUM; in addition, since the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries were normal in this patient, other Mullerian anomalies were ruled out. ACUM has multiple challenging differential diagnoses, such as cavitated uterine horn with degenerated area or rudimentary uterine horn; however, imaging modalities such as hysterosalpingography, ultrasound, and especially MRI can aid in making a proper diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 12, 13\\]</u>. Although most of the reported ACUM cases are located on the right lateral wall of the uterus near the round ligament, about one-third of cases are adjacent to the left round ligament, as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Table 1 presents a summary of the main findings of patients with ACUM that have been reported in previous studies. The most common symptoms in patients with ACUM are severe dysmenorrhea and recurrent pelvic pain that may occur before, during, or after menstruation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Affected individuals usually experience severe cyclic pelvic pain and dysmenorrhea due to the presence of functional accessory endometrium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Table 1 \n\n【36】Summary of previously reported cases of ACUM regarding their clinical features and management.\n\n【37】Patients usually undergo surgical excision of the mass, and most of them have a presumed diagnosis of adnexal mass or pedunculated myoma preoperatively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. However, ACUM is diagnosed when an isolated cavitated mass is resected via surgery in patients with otherwise normal uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【38】Conclusively, ACUM is a rare Mullerian anomaly and treatable cause of severe dysmenorrhea in young females. To the best of our knowledge, most cases, as ours, are misdiagnosed before surgery, and diagnosis can only be confirmed after histopathological examination; hence, we recommend imaging modalities such as MRI for better evaluation. Pelvic MRI is highly accurate in making a diagnosis of ACUM in young women who present with early-onset dysmenorrhea and recurrent periodic pelvic pain, especially with otherwise normal uterus and ovaries. Although the true prevalence of ACUMs is not known yet, we believe that this clinical entity is in fact more common than currently thought. Thus, ACUM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with clinically relevant symptoms.\n\n【39】#### Abbreviations:\n\n| ACUM: | Accessory and cavitated uterine mass |\n| --- | --- |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| OCP: | Oral contraceptive pill |\n| ULM: | Uterine-like mass. |\n\n【41】#### Data Availability\n\n【42】The data and material used in this study will be available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n【43】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【44】All procedures followed the ethical standards of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2000.

Maternal antibodies of IgG class can cross the placenta to result in alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. Antibodies to human neutrophil antigens anti-HNA-1a, HNA-1b, and HNA-2a have been most commonly reported to cause alloimmune neonatal neutropenia. Isoantibodies to Fc gamma RIIIb (CD16) if mother is a HNA-null phenotype are rarely involved in neonatal neutropenia. We report on a case of severe neutropenia (440 neutrophils/ L) due to anti-Fc gamma RIIIb (CD16) isoimmunization. On day 14 severe omphalitis developed, which was treated for 7 days by an antibiotic (ceftriaxone in a dose of 80 mg/kg/d) according to umbilical swab finding. Omphalitis persisted for 10 days in spite of antibiotic therapy and only resolved upon the introduction of rhG-CSF therapy. Therapy with rh-GCSF proved efficient and led to neutrophil count increase to 1970/ L and cure of omphalitis. However, therapeutic effect on granulocyte count was of transient nature, as granulocyte count fell to 760 n/ L on day 4 of therapy discontinuation. Neutropenia persisted for 2 months.

They can result in significant mortality (7%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, amputation (1.6%), and persistent ischemia (7.3%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. These complications can include thromboembolism, direct vessel laceration, pseudoaneurysm, and arteriovenous fistula formation.

Öztürk et al. reported a pseudoaneurysm of the PFA after bipolar hemiarthroplasty, caused by the sharp edge of a fractured lesser trochanter 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【7】In light of this, a risk factor for redo procedures is the presence of vascular damage due to THA, an uncommon complication for these injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Because of its location deep in the thigh, pseudoaneurysm of the PFA often presents late with persistent pain and swelling. Patients may not present with the usual sign of a pulsatile mass 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm is especially dependent upon suspicion because the symptoms and signs are nonspecific which makes it a challenging process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. As a result, if there is persistent pain and swelling in the thigh after THA, additional vascular investigations should be performed. Noting that, it can be diagnosed by Doppler ultrasonography or computed tomography. Angiography, however, is needed for definitive diagnosis and for endovascular repair if needed.\n\n【8】In this article, the authors present a case of a pseudoaneurysm of a perforating branch of the PFA following revision THA treated successfully by selective coil embolization.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【10】This article presents a case study of a 50-year-old lady with no significant medical history who underwent a right THA for congenital hip dysplasia. Recurrent dislocations were the indication for revision THA after 6 years.\n\n【11】Two weeks postoperatively, during her stay at the rehabilitation center, she started complaining of severe, worsening pain localized to the right groin. Clinical neurologic and vascular examinations were normal. Radiographs showed satisfactory positioning of the hip prosthesis. The orthopedic consultation revealed no orthopedic origin of her complaints. Duplex ultrasound showed a small pseudoaneurysm arising from the profunda femoris (ying-yang pattern on the color flow and to-and-fro waveform on the spectral doppler); no signs of venous thromboembolism were noted. A trial of ultrasound-guided compression was done without success. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a 14 × 22 mm pseudoaneurysm originating from a distal perforating branch of the right PFA . Considering that no thrombin was available for an ultrasound-guided injection of the pseudoaneurysm, the endovascular repair was our treatment of choice. Arteriography was done via left femoral artery retrograde access confirming the presence of the pseudoaneurysm (Figure 2(a)). Subsequently, selective catheterization of the distal perforating branch of the right PFA was performed using Progreat™ microcatheter (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and successful embolization was achieved using 2 and 3 mm platinum coils (Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France), placed distal and proximal to the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. Subsequent injection of the contrast medium demonstrated no flow into the pseudoaneurysm (Figure 2(b)). Following embolization, the patient had a gradual improvement of her symptoms. The patient revealed that she had no pain, claudication, or swelling at follow-up 6 weeks later, and the control CT scan showed no recurrent vascular lesion over a 6-month period .\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【13】CT with contrast showing the right deep femoral artery pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【14】(a)\n\n【15】(b)\n\n【16】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【18】(a) Arteriography showing the pseudoaneurysm pre-embolization.

Results and Discussion\n\n【22】In our case, the pseudoaneurysm originated from a distal perforating branch of the PFA. There was no evidence of direct trauma from surgical instruments because it was far from the operation site; also, the injured artery was not in contact with a protrusion of cement, bone edge, or screws. During the operation on a redo case, the hip was moved out of place, which could have torn the blood vessel.\n\n【23】Moreover, the presentation was a nonspecific groin pain 15 days postoperatively, which raised the suspicion of vascular complications and indicated a diagnostic procedure.\n\n【24】Doppler ultrasonography and a CT scan can be used to diagnose pseudoaneurysms in these cases. Angiography, however, was needed for a definitive diagnosis and transcatheter treatment.\n\n【25】Open surgical repair of a pseudoaneurysm of the PFA can be difficult because of the location of the PFA, deep in the muscle compartment of the thigh. Transcatheter or ultrasound-guided percutaneous injection of thrombin, coil, or fibrin adhesive has been reported to occlude a similar pseudoaneurysm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20–22\\]</u>. Transcatheter embolization with a coil provided an easier and less invasive technique than open surgical repair in this case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Nozawa et al. reported a case of pseudoaneurysm of the PFA after THA was treated by transcatheter embolization of the PFA 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Lund et al. described the treatment of pseudoaneurysm of the median circumflex artery following THA by coil embolization using selective catheterization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Zhang et al. described 4 cases of successful embolization procedures done to deep femoral artery pseudoaneurysms after hip fracture surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>.\n\n【27】Successful embolization in our case was achieved using selective catheterization of the perforating branch of the PFA and coil embolization distal and proximal to the neck of the pseudoaneurysm to insure complete exclusion. Some opted for endovascular repair using a covered stent. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u> However, covered stent placement to seal the pseudoaneurysm was not feasible in our case, as it originated from a distal branch. A US-guided thrombin injection was not available at the time of intervention, although it could also have been considered a treatment option.\n\n【28】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】Following THA, pseudoaneurysm of the PFA is quite rare. Early identification and treatment are made possible by knowledge of this consequence and a high degree of suspicion, particularly in redo surgeries. Since it is simpler to reach the deep femoral artery branches and less intrusive than open surgical repair, the endovascular repair was the authors’ method of choice in this situation. This article presented a successful instance of selective coil embolization for the treatment of a pseudoaneurysm of a perforating branch of the PFA after revision THA. This technique was effective and will be useful in future situations similar to this.\n\n【30】#### Data Availability\n\n【31】All references are provided in the submitted document.\n\n【32】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【33】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【34】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【35】Conception and design were performed by GB and EC; analysis and interpretation by GB, EC, and SN; data collection by GB and SN; writing the article by GB and SN; critical revision of the article by GB, EC, SN, and PS; final approval of the article by GB, EC, SN, and PS; statistical analysis and obtained funding were not applicable; overall responsibility by GB and EC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

He developed progressive lower limbs swelling and his left elbow skeletal malformation following a fall. To protect the privacy of our patients, their full transcripts are not openly available. The radionuclide bone scan with 185 MBq (5 mCi) Tc-99m MDP was performed for an evaluation of suspicious malunion fracture, bone infection, or preexisting medical conditions because metabolic disorders and bone diseases may make a child’s bones more vulnerable to fracture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Multiple increased radioactive foci throughout the whole body  were unexpectedly found. There was a strong probability of child abuse. A series of plain film radiographs demonstrated calvarial fracture lines at left temporoparietal region, bony anomaly of the spine, multiple old fractures with callus formation involving posterior aspect of left 10th, 11th ribs, right proximal humerus, bilateral proximal femurs, and metaphyses of tibias .

Discussion\n\n【16】The estimated incidence of reported child abuse has increased from 3% in 1985 to 4.5% in 1992 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The incidence of skeletal injury in these children is approximately 20% and is more common among those under 1 year of age. Children older than 3 years of age tend to have predominantly soft tissue injury. Cerebral injury is common at any age. The fractures are usually multiple, involving the long bones, skull, vertebrae, ribs, and facial bones in addition to frequently showing different stages of healing.\n\n【17】Bone scintigraphy is a valuable imaging modality in the examination of these young children, especially in detecting injury in ribs, costovertebral junctions, hands, feet, spine, and diaphyses of long bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 9\\]</u>. Child abuse should be considered when diagnosing increased lone bone uptake on bone scintigraphy, which may indicate nonaccidental trauma.\n\n【18】The combination of bone scan and X-ray with experienced hands can reduce the false-negative rate from 12.3% to 0.8%. Although the bone scan may be positive as early as 7 hours after injury, the child is usually brought to a hospital so late that the bone healing has begun 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【19】The image modalities play a key role in the investigation and documentation of the battered child syndrome. The primary diagnostic imaging study in suspected child abuse is either a bone scan and X-ray series or a complete radiographic skeletal survey by X-ray series in babies and infants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Skeletal survey and bone scintigraphy are complementary studies in the evaluation of nonaccidental injury and should both be performed in cases of suspected child abuse 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 12, 13\\]</u>. Further studies should be undertaken in this circumstance to search for coexisting injuries, especially as the history and mechanism of injury may often be unclear. Bone scan may require sedation, and this modality is now less commonly used, especially in the emergent setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.

{"seq_id": "82670374-d213-4ddd-9075-bfa84856b53b", "title": null, "text": "【0】#### Abstract\n\n【1】Basilar predominant emphysema, or disproportionate emphysematous involvement of the lung bases compared to the apices, is an uncommon radiographic pattern of emphysema traditionally associated with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). We present a case of a 59-year-old female with 41 pack-year tobacco use, Stage IV COPD with supplemental oxygen, and bibasilar predominant emphysema who successfully underwent bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. She presented with recurrent hospitalizations for frequent exacerbations. After lung reduction, the patient displayed improvement in functional status without hospitalizations at the 15-month follow-up. Careful history taking is essential for any patients diagnosed with lower lobe emphysema to elucidate the underlying etiology. This case challenges the notion that basilar emphysema is sensitive or specific for AATD and emphasizes that this pattern of emphysema has a broad differential diagnosis and alternative etiologies should be considered. Our patient was ultimately diagnosed with smoking-related emphysema, with atypical bibasilar involvement. Furthermore, basilar predominant emphysema should be considered a separate entity from its apical predominant counterpart.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and severe disease involving airflow obstruction, of which one manifestation is emphysema. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is an underrecognized genetic disorder involving the SERPINA1 gene, which causes Z-type alpha-1 antitrypsin molecules to form polymers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Polymerization prevents secretion of the alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) molecules into the bloodstream, leading to the destruction of the lung parenchyma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. This destruction predominantly affects the lower lobes, causing a bibasilar pattern of emphysema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However, not all lower lobe emphysematous disease is due to AATD, and it is important to recognize that this pattern of emphysema can be seen in other etiologies including Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome, occupational exposures, intravenous injection of crushed methylphenidate tablets, and tobacco use.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 59-year-old female with a history of cigarette smoking, obstructive sleep apnea, and Stage IV COPD on supplemental oxygen presented for evaluation of surgical management of her lung disease. Within the past year, she had five hospitalizations or emergency room visits for COPD exacerbations. She experienced increasing difficulty with physical activities despite using portable oxygen. She endorsed compliance with her medications, which include an albuterol inhaler and nebulized solution, fluticasone-umeclidinium-vilanter, omeprazole, and roflumilast. She previously worked at a chocolate factory but denied known exposure to fumes or chemicals. She was born and raised in the United States and denied any recent travel. Additionally, she denied any history of childhood pneumonia or respiratory problems. Family history was unremarkable. She quit smoking 15 months prior to the presentation but had a total 41 pack-year history. She denied using vaporized tobacco. She endorsed occasional drinking and denied any illicit drug use, including injection drug use. AAT level was 169 mg/dL and genotype PI  MM, which were inconsistent with a diagnosis of AATD. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) demonstrated an obstructive pattern with FEV1 0.71L (28%), FVC 1.36L (38%), FEV1/FVC ratio 0.56, TLC 7.9L (150% of predicted), and DLCO 26%. Right heart catheterization showed mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 25 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance 3.76 Woods units. Chest X-rays showed bilateral lung hyperinflation, diaphragm flattening, and hyperlucency , and CT chest showed panlobular emphysema with predominantly lower lobe involvement . A 3D reconstruction of the CT showed decreased lung fields on bilaterally lower lobes and the left upper lobe . Due to her progressive symptoms, she underwent bronchoscopic lung volume reduction of the lower lobes. The left lower lobe was intervened first, with the placement of 8 Zephyr valves, followed by her right lower lobe two months later with 6 Zephyr valves placed. She tolerated both procedures well, without complication, and was promptly discharged home. In the 15 months following her BLVR, she has not had any urgent care visits or hospitalizations, requires no supplemental oxygen, and reports increased exercise tolerance. Repeat PFT showed improvements including FEV1 1.07L (40%), FVC 1.77L (60%), FEV1/FVC ratio 0.56, TLC 6.1L (115% of predicted), and DLCO 30%.\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【7】Chest X-rays of posterioanterior and lateral view showing bilateral lung hyperinflation, diaphragm flattening, and hyperlucency.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【9】CT chest of upper and lower lobes showing panlobular emphysema with predominantly lower lobe involvement.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【11】CT chest 3D reconstruction showing decreased lung field on bilaterally lower lobes and the left upper lobe.\n\n【12】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【13】The distribution of emphysema in a patient can be helpful in determining the underlying cause of the emphysema and has their own distinct differential diagnoses. Lower lobe disease is distinct from its upper lobe counterpart in severity of impairment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, physiology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, and increased mortality with LVRS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this patient, the differential diagnosis for lower lobe emphysema is broad and can be distinguished by careful history-taking, including smoking/drug use, occupational exposure, family history, and childhood infections. Here, we discuss each diagnosis considered.\n\n【14】AATD is an underrecognized disease with pulmonary and hepatic manifestations. The proposed mechanism for emphysema is the imbalance between a serine protease and its inhibitor leading to parenchymal destruction. Cigarette smoking and recurrent infections often accelerate AATD progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. AATD should be suspected in patients with emphysema diagnosed at a young age (<45 years old), nonsmokers, a family history of early lung disease, or basilar predominant distribution. Diagnosis is confirmed by low AATs followed by genotyping showing homozygous Z alleles 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. One rare genotype of AATD is the FF genotype. The F allele produces a normal quantity yet dysfunctional AAT, and thus, the risk of pulmonary manifestation is similar to that of ZZ AATD. Simultaneous testing of both the AAT level and genotype is preferred. The patient’s AAT level and genotype were determined to be inconsistent with AATD.\n\n【15】Intravenous drug use of crushed talc- or magnesium silicate-containing tablets such as methylphenidate causes perivascular deposition leading to chronic inflammation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. It is linked to pulmonary hypertension and emphysema, particularly in the lower lobes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, our patient displayed no drug use behaviors.\n\n【16】Occupational exposure to fumes and chemicals is well known to cause a large spectrum of lung disease. Chronic exposure to diacetyl, a volatile organic compound that is used as flavoring chemical, causes airway epithelial injury which leads to bronchiolitis obliterans, called “popcorn lung” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Bronchiolitis obliterans causes fibrosis due to excessive granulation tissue affecting the small conducting airways and can mimic COPD on imaging but often results in a restrictive or mixed restrictive/obstructive pattern on pulmonary function testing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. “Popcorn lung” was considered given her occupational history; however, her PFTs were not consistent with the restrictive disease.\n\n【17】Swyer-James-MacLeod syndrome is a rare entity associated with postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans, typically during childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The characteristic radiological pattern is hypoplasia/hypogenesis of the pulmonary arteries with hypoperfusion, giving a translucency to unilateral lung. It is associated with recurrent pulmonary infections during childhood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. The patient in our case underwent CTA of the chest which did not reveal any hypogenesis of the pulmonary arteries. Furthermore, she denied recurrent childhood respiratory infections.\n\n【18】Cigarette smoking remains the most important risk factor for developing emphysema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Smoking-related emphysema is typically upper lobe predominant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>, although lower lobe predominant emphysema can be seen 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. This patient’s significant smoking history and negative workup for other causes made smoking-related emphysema most likely.\n\n【19】This patient had Stage IV COPD with frequent exacerbations despite maximum medical therapy. The bibasilar manifestation of emphysema is most likely smoking-related. Smoking-related emphysema is typically upper lobe predominant, and bibasilar manifestation is relatively uncommon. She was offered lung volume reduction at our lung center, with clinical improvement in her symptoms and functional status. Although LVRS is the current gold standard treatment of hyperinflation in COPD with mortality and symptomatic benefits, it also confers an increased risk of perioperative morbidity. These benefits are most obvious in patients with upper lobe predominant disease and poor functional status 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. On the contrary, patients with nonupper lobe predominant emphysema are likely poor candidates for LVRS. BLVR is a minimally invasive technique for lung volume reduction using either endobronchial valves or coils. It has been shown to offer improvement in exercise tolerance and lung function for patients who do not qualify for LVRS or are poor surgical candidates. Similar to LVRS, greater benefits are seen in patients with upper lobe predominant emphysema. To date, no large studies have shown improved survival with BLVR, but it still remains an option for patients with severe COPD for symptomatic management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>.\n\n【20】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【21】While lower lobe emphysema is commonly attributed to AATD, the differential diagnosis is broad and often distinct from its upper lobe counterpart. Careful history taking is essential for any patients diagnosed with lower lobe emphysema to elucidate the underlying etiology.\n\n【22】#### Abbreviations\n\n| COPD: | Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease |\n| --- | --- |\n| AATD: | Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency |\n| AAT: | Alpha-1-antitrypsin |\n| OSA: | Obstructive sleep apnea |\n| FEV1: | Forced expiratory volume per 1 second |\n| FCV: | Forced vital capacity |\n| TLC: | Total lung capacity |\n| RV: | Residual volume |\n| DLCO: | Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide |\n| LVRS: | Lung volume reduction surgery |\n| BLVR: | Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. |\n\n【24】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【25】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【26】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【27】LG and HY drafted and edited the manuscript and approved the final submitted version.

After evaluating the first radiograph (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)), closed reduction and long leg splint were done, and control X-ray was taken (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)).

After a full anatomic reduction was achieved in our operation, the metaphyseal fragment was fixed to physis by two transverse cannulated screws. Fixation was also applied to the medial condyle with one cannulated screw (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). Since the patient’s growth continues, we ensured that no screw passes through the physis. The patient was followed up for three weeks with long leg splint in the postoperative period. At the end of the three weeks, the splint was removed, a knee exercise program was implemented, and the patient was asked to walk on tiptoes for three weeks. At the end of the six weeks, knee extension was full, flexion was 150°, and the patient started to walk with full weight.

Distal femoral epiphyseal fractures are uncommon but have a high incidence rate of complications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> and are responsible for 1–6% of all physeal injuries and less than 1% of fractures in children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Motor vehicle accidents and sports-related injuries are reported as the most common causes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The Salter-Harris classification continues to be the most widely used classification system for physeal fractures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It helps in understanding the mechanism of injury and in predicting the likelihood of complications. Salter-Harris type II fractures are the most common fracture type of the distal femoral physis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 6, 10\\]</u>. Poor results correlated with severely displaced fractures, nonanatomic reduction, associated injuries, and open fractures. Complications included growth arrest, resulting in leg length discrepancy, permanent decreased range of motion, and angular deformity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. Salter-Harris type I fractures had the lowest incidence of growth disturbance (36%), whereas Salter-Harris type IV fractures had the highest rate of growth disturbance at 64% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. In our case, it was a Salter-Harris type III and type IV combination, and there was a high complication risk due to the existence of displacement, and relatives of the patient were throughly informed about this.\n\n【23】The peroneal nerve is reported to be involved in about 3% of cases of distal femoral epiphyseal injuries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The direction of displacement has been associated with the development of neurovascular injuries, where anterior displacement puts the popliteal artery at risk, and varus displacement places the peroneal nerve at risk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In our case, no deficit existed in neurovascular structures.\n\n【24】Our case is a previously unpublished, Salter-Harris type III and type IV combination. We consider that high complication risks of distal femoral physeal fractures should be told to relatives of the patient. In order to decrease this high risk of complication, we consider that full anatomic reduction should be achieved by a sufficiently stabile fixation, and joint movement should be gained in early period.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declare that they have no conflict of interests to the publication of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

One of these adverse events is agranulocytosis, which, although rare, can be life-threatening if left untreated. The majority of agranulocytosis cases are caused by drugs, including antibiotics. Here, we report a case of severe agranulocytosis in a 96-year-old woman following antibiotic therapy which was successfully managed using recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and the appropriate choice of antibiotics to treat her concomitant infection.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】Agranulocytosis is a rare and life-threatening condition, with an annual incidence of 1.1 to 4.9 cases per million population per year 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Up to 50% of agranulocytosis may be induced by nonchemotherapy drugs, such as antithyroid agents and antimicrobial medications 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The risk for developing this adverse event may be higher among elderly patients in Japan, who are often prescribed many types of medication, a phenomenon called polypharmacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The problem of polypharmacy is of particular concern in an aging society like Japan because elderly patients tend to have many underlying diseases as well as conditions that require various medications. We herein present a case of severe agranulocytosis following antibiotic treatment with garenoxacin and ceftriaxone. The patient was also prescribed 10 different kinds of medication regularly, making this a case that emphasizes the importance of recognizing severe drug-related adverse events and the potential danger of polypharmacy or unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 96-year-old woman was prescribed garenoxacin for 8 days after complaining of a bad cough, dyspnea, and anorexia at a nearby clinic. This was despite a simple laboratory blood test revealing a white blood cell (WBC) count of 7920/μL (55% neutrophils) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 0.33 mg/dL, findings that were unremarkable. However, she developed high-grade fever on the following day, and intravenous ceftriaxone (1 g daily for 6 days) was added to her treatment regime two days after prescribing garenoxacin. After 5 days of therapy with ceftriaxone, a follow-up laboratory blood test performed showed a WBC count of 1050/μL (0% neutrophils) and a CRP level of 6.67 mg/dL. Severe leucopenia was suspected, and she was referred to our hospital for evaluation.\n\n【7】During presentation, her blood pressure was 136/99 mmHg, her pulse rate was 87 beats per minute, and her body temperature was 37.4°C. Her respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute and peripheral oxygen saturation 97%. Chest sounds were normal, and other findings of physical examination were unremarkable. She was 150 cm in height with mild kyphosis and weighed 40 kg. She had a medical history of atrial fibrillation, stroke, hypertension, hypotonic urinary bladder, lower back pain, and gastritis. Her daily medications included candesartan, lansoprazole, amlodipine, carbocysteine, zaltoprofen, tranexamic acid, rivaroxaban, bisoprolol, brotizolam, and celecoxib.\n\n【8】Full blood count performed at our hospital revealed severe leucopenia with a WBC count of 830/µL (neutrophils 7/µL, eosinophils 8/μL, basophils 18/μL, monocytes 378/μL, and lymphocytes 415/μL). Other laboratory data are shown in Table 1. A chest radiograph and computed tomography showed mild infiltrative shadow on her left lung. However, both blood and sputum culture results were negative.\n\n【9】Table 1 \n\n【10】Laboratory data on admission.\n\n【11】She was diagnosed with drug-induced agranulocytosis (presumably from antibiotics used) with mild pneumonia and admitted to an isolated room. Candesartan, lansoprazole, amlodipine, and celecoxib were discontinued because they are also known to cause agranulocytosis. She was given meropenem hydrate intravenously (2 g/day) and levofloxacin hydrate orally (500 mg/day) for 10 days, after which a short course of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (4 g/day) was administered. Subcutaneous injection of filgrastim (recombinant human G-CSF, 75 µg/day) was also given to treat her neutropenia.\n\n【12】Filgrastim was administered for 6 days before the neutrophil count normalized to 2539/µL on day 6. Although her neutrophil count increased to 12,940/µL on day 9, it eventually stabilized around 3000 to 4000/µL after day 13. Table 2 summarizes the changes in WBC count, neutrophil count, and CRP levels during her hospitalization. Her fever receded after day 10, and she was discharged on day 18 without further complications.\n\n【13】Table 2 \n\n【14】Change in laboratory data after admission.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【16】Although there is no clear consensus, polypharmacy may be defined as the concomitant use of five or more medications per day 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Polypharmacy is a major concern in Japan as older patients such as ours are often given many different medications (10 in our patient) on a regular basis. The fact that patients have easy access to different specialists in Japan also increases the probability of polypharmacy as they often see many physicians without a primary care doctor carefully monitoring their medications. Furthermore, our patient was prescribed antibiotics, which may be due to her old age and the risk of developing pneumonia, after presenting with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The questionable practice of treating acute respiratory infections with antibiotics is still common in Japan. Lack of proper patient education has resulted in increased patient satisfaction when they are prescribed antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Studies have also demonstrated that the use of antibiotics for acute respiratory infections does not result in increased adverse events and may even be slightly beneficial in preventing pneumonia hospitalization 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Nevertheless, a recent study showed that older female patients as well as those with multiple comorbidities and medications (which fit our patient’s profile) have the highest risk of adverse drug reactions in the acute care setting 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This includes life-threatening conditions such as agranulocytosis. Agranulocytosis, although rare, can be caused by many different drugs, including antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8\\]</u>. Without early detection, this condition may result in serious infections and subsequently sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our patient’s case, due to the timing and development of her agranulocytosis, we believe that it was most probably caused by garenoxacin or ceftriaxone, either directly or through interactions with her other drugs.\n\n【18】Currently, the standard treatment for drug-induced agranulocytosis is discontinuation of the responsible agent(s), antibiotic treatment if the presence of infection is suspected, and proper use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Although their efficacy is not conclusively proven, G-CSF has minimal toxicity and may be beneficial in the management of drug-induced agranulocytosis in elderly patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Minor complications include bone pain and leukocytosis, which occurred in our patient but normalized after discontinuing therapy. As for antibiotic treatment, cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) is often employed as a first-line therapy for agranulocytosis with infection. Meropenem can be used as an alternative when cefepime is not tolerated well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. A recent study also demonstrated that, for severe cases (neutrophil count < 100/µL), meropenem may be the superior choice for monotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Meropenem was used due to the severely low neutrophil count and also because our patient’s agranulocytosis may have been caused by ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin).\n\n【19】In conclusion, we reported a case of severe agranulocytosis in an elderly patient which was managed successfully using rhG-CSF and proper choice of antibiotics. Elderly patients who are being prescribed many different medications need to be carefully managed and monitored for various adverse drug events.\n\n【20】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【21】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) also known as Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, which results in vascular dysplasia affecting mainly visceral and mucocutaneous organs. Case Presentation. A 65-year-old woman with a 12-year history of recurrent spontaneous epistaxis presented with shortness of breath, easy fatigability, and bilateral lower limb edema. Her family history was significant for definite hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in first-degree relatives. During the previous 15 days, she has experienced three episodes of recurrent nasal bleeding. She has a background of chronic mitral regurgitation. Physical examination revealed telangiectases in her tongue, lower lip, and hand in addition to signs of congestive heart failure. The patient met 3\\\\4 Curacao criteria and had a definite HHT. Her laboratory workup revealed a hemoglobin count of 5.4 g/dl. Echocardiography revealed a left systolic ejection fraction of 51% with left atrial dilatation and severe mitral regurgitation. Chest X-ray showed features of cardiomegaly and pulmonary edema. The abdominal ultrasonography showed enlarged liver size with homogenous texture and congested hepatic veins without features of hepatic AVMs. She was treated with intravenous frusemide, iron supplement, tranexamic acid, blood transfusion, and nasal packing. Conclusions. HTT usually passes unnoticed in Sudan. The rarity of HHT, difficulties in affording diagnostic imaging studies, and low clinical suspicion among doctors are important contributing factors. Anemia resulting from recurrent epistaxis might have an influential role in precipitating acute heart failure in those with chronic rheumatic valvular disease.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare genetic disorder, which has an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The estimated prevalence is 1/5000–1/8000 of population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is characterized by diffuse telangiectases (e.g. ruby-coloured papules that blanch with pressure), recurrent epistaxis, and widespread arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). Males and females are equally affected.\n\n【4】The diagnosis is based on the presence of three out of four criteria, called Curaçao criteria, which include recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, small systemic telangiectasia (due to AVMs), visceral involvement, and a strong family history of HHT .\n\n【5】Table 1 \n\n【6】The Curacao diagnostic criteria for HHT.\n\n【7】Although the symptoms usually vary according to age, epistaxis is usually the commonest clinical feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【8】To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of HHT in Sudan. The rarity of the disease, difficulties in affording the diagnostic imagining and genetic testing, and low clinical suspicion among doctors, all of which pose a challenge in the diagnosis and management of HHT, particularly in resources- limited hospitals.\n\n【9】#### 2\\. Case presentation\n\n【10】A 65-year-old Sudanese woman came to a university hospital, Sudan, complaining of shortness of breath (New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3), easy fatigability, and bilateral lower limb edema. The patient had no history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension. During the previous 15 days, she has experienced three episodes of recurrent nasal bleeding, which were not related to any particular activity, posture, or seasonal variation. There was no bleeding from other orifices. For many years, episodes of nasal bleeding occurred frequently, and the patient received medical advice at their rural hospital. During those episodes, the patient underwent anterior nasal packing, transfused, and then discharged on iron supplements. The patient then came to a university hospital for more advanced evaluation. During the patient workup, the patient experienced an episode of epistaxis for which she underwent anterior nasal packing to control the epistaxis and received tranexamic acid 500 mg tabs TDS, topical tranexamic acid, and packed cells for transfusion. The workup revealed that the patient is a known case of chronic mitral regurgitation, and she was planned for mitral valve replacement, which was not performed due to financial challenges.\n\n【11】The family history was significant for definite HHT in the form of recurrent spontaneous nose bleeding and the same small erythematous lesions (telangiectases) in her grandmother, her son, and her daughter.\n\n【12】Physical examination revealed that the patient looked ill, pale, and not jaundiced. JVP was raised. Her BP was 110/60, pulse rate was 88 BPM, and it was not collapsing. The oxygen saturation was 90% on room air. Mouth examination revealed multiple small erythematous lesions, which blanch on pressure (telangiectases) on her tongue  and one lesion on her lower lip . Hand examination revealed one telangiectasia at the palmar aspect of her right hand . Her cardiovascular examination revealed a pan systolic murmur at the apical area, which radiated to the axilla, and bilateral fine basal crepitations. The liver was tender and palpable 8 cm below the right costal margin without audible bruit, and there is bilateral lower limb edema.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【14】The tongue showing multiple small telangiectasias.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【16】Small telangiectasia at the left border of the lower lip.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【18】Telangiectasias at the palmar aspect of the distal phalanx of the middle finger and the distal phalanx of the little finger.\n\n【19】The laboratory investigations at admission revealed hypochromic microcytic anemia (hemoglobin 5.4 g/dl). Other laboratory investigations are described in Table 2.\n\n【20】Table 2 \n\n【21】It describes the results of the blood investigations obtained for the patient.\n\n【22】ECG was noncontributory apart from sinus tachycardia. Chest X-ray revealed upper lobe diversion, congested hilar shadows and patchy consolidation in lower lobes (features of pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly) . Echocardiography showed a left systolic ejection fraction of 51% with left atrial dilatation and severe mitral regurgitation. The abdominal ultrasonography (US) displayed enlarged liver size (19 cm) with homogenous texture and congested hepatic veins. Hepatic arteriovenous malformations were not detected on ultrasonography .\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【24】Chest X-ray posterior/anterior view revealed upper lobe diversion and congested hilar shadows and patchy consolidation in lower lobes (features of pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly).\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n【26】Abdominal US showing the liver enlarged in size (19 cm) with homogenous texture and congested hepatic veins.\n\n【27】Diagnostic challenges: CT pulmonary angiography was not done due to financial challenges. Contrast echocardiography is an alternative. It was intended to screen the patient for the presence of pulmonary AVMs. Screening can be performed with contrast echocardiography and then a CT-scan in case of a right-to-left shunt. The most feared complication of a pulmonary AVM, cq a right-to-left shunt, is brain abscess, due to paradoxical septical emboli, which are normally trapped in the pulmonary capillaries, but can pass through the pulmonary AVM. As long as the presence of a right-to-left shunt is not excluded in HHT patients, prophylactic antibiotics should be prescribed before any nonsterile procedures, to prevent brain abscess.\n\n【28】Contrast-enhanced CT abdomen was also not done due to financial challenges. It was meant to detect hepatic AVMs and to exclude high-output heart failure. However, clinically, there were no features of hyperdynamic circulation in the patient (e.g. collapsing pulse).\n\n【29】The diagnosis was definite HHT as she fulfilled three items of the Curacao criteria (spontaneous, recurrent nose bleeding, family history in a first-degree relative, and multiple telangiectases at characteristic sites such as tongue, lips, and hands). Anemia, which was attributed to recurrent epistaxis and nutritional factors, is thought to play an influential role in precipitating the heart failure in this patient with chronic rheumatic mitral regurgitation.\n\n【30】The patient was treated with intravenous frusemide, iron supplement, tranexamic acid, blood transfusion, and nasal packing. She was discharged on day 7 on lisinopril tablets and iron supplements in addition to counselling about home-preventive measures of epistaxis.\n\n【31】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【32】Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVM) of the internal organs and mucocutaneous telangiectasias. These AVMs lack the intervening capillaries resulting in direct connections between arteries and veins. They can involve the skin, mucous membranes, brain, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and/or liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The most common clinical features are recurrent spontaneous nosebleeds which present in 50% of patients with HHT at the age of ten, with incidence increasing with age.\n\n【33】HHT was first described in 1864 in a man with a vascular malformation and recurrent epistaxis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In 1996, Rendu first noticed the correlation between hereditary epistaxis and telangiectasia in a 52-year-old man 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Osler in 1901 and Weber in 1907 then identified the association between hemorrhagic lesions in the skin and mucous membranes and its familial inheritance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. The name ‘hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia’ described by Hanes in 1909 defines the characteristics of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【34】Mutation in genes, including ACVRL1, ENG, and SMAD4 genes, are responsible for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. The ENG mutation can lead to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1, while type 2 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is caused by mutations in the ACVRL1 gene. Juvenile polyposis/hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome is caused by a mutation in the SMAD4 gene. It has been proposed that certain mutated HHT genes are associated with specific clinical features, for example, ACVRL1 mutation was found to be associated more with liver AVMs, spinal AVMs, epistaxis, and pulmonary hypertension. ENG mutations were seen to be associated more with pulmonary and brain AVMs, and MADH4 mutations were observed to be associated with juvenile colonic polyposis.\n\n【35】The diagnosis of HHT depends on diagnostic criteria called Curacao criteria . Our patient was diagnosed as definite HHT as she fulfilled three items of the Curacao criteria (spontaneous, recurrent nose bleeding, family history in a first-degree relative, and multiple telangiectasias at characteristic sites such as tongue, lips, and hands).\n\n【36】In patients with HHT, heart failure usually occurs due to hepatic arterial-venous malformation, which causes high-output heart failure. In our patient, anemia, which was attributed to recurrent epistaxis and nutritional factors, is thought to play an influential role in precipitating the heart failure in this patient with chronic rheumatic mitral regurgitation. Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of HHT; chronic blood loss from nasal mucosa or intestinal tract can result in depletion of iron storage, which in turn can lead to microcytic or normocytic anemia.\n\n【37】As per ESC Guidelines HF 2016, in the initial assessment of a patient with newly diagnosed heart failure, ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) are the recommended diagnostic tests. The treatment is recommended when ferritin is <100 µg/L, or ferritin is between 100 and 299 µg/L and TSAT <20%.\n\n【38】There is no curative treatment for HHT; treatment is symptomatic which focuses on the predominant clinical feature and its severity. The first step in the management of epistaxis is patient counselling about the use of home-preventive measures such as nasal humidification, saline sprays, or ointment to avoid dryness of nasal mucosa and to decrease the risk of nasal trauma in the form of nasal picking and nasal blowing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Other options included nasal packing, photocoagulation, intravascular embolization, and surgery. These methods have a high rate of recurrence with limited efficacy, and they are not available in many resources- limited hospitals. Drugs such as bevacizumab (an antivascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) are widely used in the treatment of high-output heart cardiac failure in HHT with adequate safety and efficacy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Tamoxifen (antiestrogen medication) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> and thalidomide (an antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory agent) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u> had been also investigated in the treatment of HHT.\n\n【39】According to ESC, treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the treatment of the underlying cause such as anemia; diuretics are recommended in congested patients with HFpEF to alleviate symptoms and signs.\n\n【40】Patients with HHT have a lower life expectancy than the general population; the prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms. The most common cause of death in HHT is heart failure and sepsis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【41】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【42】In conclusion, cases of HHT may have been passed unnoticed due to rarity of the disease that leads to low clinical suspicion among doctors. Other contributing factors include variation in clinical presentations of the disease, difficulties in affording the diagnostic imaging studies, and the imaging studies might not be available in many resourses-limited hospitals. Anemia resulting from the recurrent epistaxis might have an influential role in precipitating acute heart failure in those with chronic rheumatic valvular disease.\n\n【43】#### Abbreviations\n\n| HHT: | Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia |\n| --- | --- |\n| OWRD: | Osler-Weber-Rendu disease |\n| AVMs: | Arteriovenous malformations |\n| NYHA: | New York Heart Association |\n| BNP: | Brain natriuretic peptide |\n| HFpEF: | Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction |\n| ACVRL1: | Activin A receptor-like type 1 |\n| ENG: | Endoglin |\n| TSAT: | Transferrin saturation. |\n\n【45】#### Data Availability\n\n【46】The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.\n\n【47】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【48】The article was approved by the Research Ethics Committee, University of Gezira, Faculty of medicine, Sudan.\n\n【49】#### Consent\n\n【50】A written consent for publication has been obtained from the patient.\n\n【51】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【52】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n【53】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【54】OE, the main writer of the article, participated in preparing the patient and responsible for the follow-up.

To date, fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the literature. We herein present a case of 59-year-old female with primary multifocal recurrent urinary bladder amyloidosis. The patient was treated with a new method (laser therapy) mentioned for the first time in the literature. After 18 months of treatment, the patient has no complaints. Our case illustrates a new procedure in the treatment of primary multifocal bladder amyloidosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous group disorder characterized by the extracellular deposition of eosinophilic fibrillar protein (amyloid protein) in various tissues and organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Historically, the term amyloid was coined for the first time by Virchow in 1854. In 1897, Solomin described the first clinical case of bladder amyloidosis (BA) at autopsy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. BA is most frequent in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> decade with equal gender preponderance 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】There are two forms of BA: primary urinary bladder amyloidosis (PUBA) and secondary (commonly associated with chronic inflammatory conditions) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Gross hematuria with irritative lower urinary tract symptoms is the most prominent in PUBA. It may be easily confused with bladder cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. There are no standard management protocols of PUBA due to its rarity. Herein we present the first rare case in Syria of recurrent multifocal PUBA treated with laser therapy for the first time in the medical literature.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 59-year-old Syrian female was admitted with a 2-month history of gross hematuria associated with lower urinary tract symptoms. There were no systemic symptoms (fever, joint pain, or rash). The hematuria was red in color, fresh, and intermittent with no clotting. She was diagnosed with PUBA 18 years ago treated by transurethral resection without follow-up.\n\n【7】The physical examinations were unremarkable. Complete blood counts (CBCs) and routine biochemical tests (renal, liver, and bone parameters) were normal. Urinary microscopic examination showed normal pH and specific gravity, with uncountable RBCs, few WBCs, granules casts, and presence of hemoglobin. Culture and sensitivity were normal.\n\n【8】Ultrasound of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder showed thickening and irregularity of the bladder wall with 9 mm as the maximum thickness . Intravenous urography was normal. Cystoscopy showed multifocal yellowish bladder lesions . The pathologic examination demonstrated extensive deposits of a cellular amorphous compatible with amyloidosis. No other abnormality was detected.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】Ultrasound scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder showed thickening and irregularity of the bladder wall.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【12】Cystoscopy showed multifocal yellowish bladder lesions.\n\n【13】To exclude systemic amyloidosis, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest X-ray were conducted which revealed no pathologic findings. Tuberculin reaction and tuberculosis screening in 24 hours urine were normal. There was no increased lymphocyte count and protein gap. Bone marrow examination and CT scan of abdomen were both normal.\n\n【14】After the exclusion of systemic amyloidosis, recurrent multifocal PUBA diagnosis was confirmed.\n\n【15】A new method in the treatment of PUBA with neodymium: yttrium-aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG) laser therapy had been performed. The laser intensity used was 25 Watt with pulse duration less than 3 seconds. The fibreoptic tip was placed 1–3 mm from the bladder wall using a spot size of 2 mm. The total energy was 23500 Joules.\n\n【16】After 18 months from treatment, the patient was normal without symptoms. She has since remained asymptomatic without progression of systemic amyloidosis. Follow-up cystoscopies performed at present have been normal.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】The underlying mechanism of the PUBA is still controversial. Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation results in infiltration of lymphoplasmacytic cells with subsequent amyloid fibril deposition 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not always useful in differentiating amyloidosis from other pathological conditions.

Its etiology is unknown. It has been rarely linked with schizophrenia and head injury. Case Presentation. We describe an unusual case of a 44-year-old female with schizophrenia and hyperostosis frontalis interna having a history of head trauma. At the age of 3 years, she had a head injury that could be classified as mild traumatic brain injury. She presents a family history of schizophrenia. She was admitted for resistant schizophrenic disorder. The cranial computed tomography showed bilateral and asymmetrical hyperostosis of the frontal bone that was more pronounced on the right side. This corresponds to the impact of the trauma with frontal atrophy without any metabolic or endocrinal abnormalities. Conclusion. We surmise that the long-term pathological effects of traumatic brain injury, including hyperostosis frontalis interna, are likely to interact with genetic vulnerability and may lead to schizophrenic disorder.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Hyperostosis frontalis interna (HFI) is an irregular thickening of the frontal bone that is generally presented as single or multiple bilateral nodules on the inner lamina, while diploe and external lamina of the bone remain unaffected. Its mode of formation and growth is unknown. It has been linked with many symptoms. Two syndromes have been described in association with it. Morgagni’s syndrome consists of HFI and both obesity and hirsutism and the Stewart-Morel syndrome comprises neuropsychiatric symptoms and headache.\n\n【4】Here, we describe an unusual and interesting case of schizophrenia and hyperostosis frontalis interna (HFI) having a history of head injury without metabolic or endocrine dysfunctions.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】In this report, we describe an unusual case of a 44-year- old female with hyperostosis of the frontal bone. The patient is a single Moroccan female with a university degree and living with her parents. She showed normal psychomotor development during early childhood.\n\n【7】At the age of 3 years, she had a head injury. She fell on a sharp object that caused frontal head impact . The bleeding was stopped at home with traditional first aid. She was somnolent on the day of trauma.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】Scar of head injury.\n\n【10】Prior to this incident, she had never been examined nor had she undergone any neurological tests, despite the persistence of moderate headaches.\n\n【11】She was a sociable child and had no issues in her adolescence. Family history revealed that her sister was diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n\n【12】The schizophrenic symptoms of our patient began when she was 22 years old. She was hospitalized and received antipsychotic treatment.\n\n【13】The evolution was marked by very short remissions and numerous relapses due to treatment discontinuation.\n\n【14】With time, the symptoms appeared resistant and severe. She had major anxiety, depersonalization, derealization, and obsessive symptoms. She presented audiovisual hallucinations with mental automatism, persecution delusion, reasoning difficulties, impaired judgment, sexual disinhibition, and emotional impulses. These were associated with several suicide attempts that did not involve sadness in her mood.\n\n【15】Psychometric evaluations revealed scores of 102 on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia  and 9/10 on the clock drawing test (CDT) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. A neurological examination showed normal findings.\n\n【16】Table 1 \n\n【17】Patient’s PANSS subscale score.\n\n【18】In the context of therapeutic resistance, cranial computed tomography was carried out. The results showed bilateral and asymmetrical hyperostosis of the frontal bone that was more pronounced on the right side. This corresponds to the impact of the trauma with frontal atrophy .\n\n【19】(a)\n\n【20】(b)\n\n【21】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【23】(a) Axial cranial computed tomography scan illustrating the bilateral and asymmetrical thickening of the inner table of the frontal bone. (b) Axial cranial computed tomography scan illustrating the frontal atrophy.\n\n【24】Although she was an obese and premenopausal woman, she showed no signs of hirsutism. Laboratory tests did not show metabolic or endocrinal abnormalities like imbalanced sexual hormones and thyroid function. She had no history of epilepsy and the electroencephalography did not show any abnormal activity.\n\n【25】We could not carry out further treatments, including administering clozapine and electroconvulsive therapy. During a 10-day treatment with clozapine, she developed severe diarrhea without fever or any infective cause. Moreover, her family refused electroconvulsive therapy.\n\n【26】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【27】HFI has been identified in antiquity and has increased during the last century, especially among young individuals. It has been shown to be more common and more severe in females. It is usually an incidental finding on imaging, for example, in X-ray, cranial computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【28】It is considered an independent condition that is benign and incidental, although in some reports it has been associated with many conditions, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, headaches, epilepsy, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric or behavioral disorders. The etiology of HFI remains unknown, but it is generally related to an endocrine imbalance, especially in pituitary function. However, to our knowledge, only one report attributed HFI to head trauma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Our patient presented with an unusual association of resistant psychotic symptoms, head injury, family history of schizophrenia, and HFI. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether there is a relationship between schizophrenia, head injury, and HFI.\n\n【30】We assume that the head injury of our patient might be one of the reported risk factors of HFI, especially because this is more developed on the side of the trauma. Moreover, our patient did not present any metabolic or endocrinal abnormalities. The head injury in the other reported case was more severe than in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【31】The literature has reported traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a source of neuroendocrine disturbances. Patients can develop hypopituitarism in the postacute phase of a TBI and it may normalize later; however, it may recur after the postacute phase 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This suggests that TBI could contribute to the formation of HFI through hypopituitarism. However, in our case, we do not have enough evidence to confirm that the traumatic event can be defined as TBI. Children may be unable to report some symptoms immediately after traumatic events, such as sensory problems, confusion, or headaches. Somnolence could indicate cerebral damage, while headache is a common and persistent symptom following mild TBI. The trauma in our case could be classified as mild TBI.\n\n【32】Several papers have noted an association between severity of HFI and the cortical atrophy with severity of psychotic symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Some authors have observed that prognosis did not seem to be affected by HFI, and the clinical outcome was in accordance with the psychiatric diagnosis.\n\n【33】The problem regarding our patient lies is in distinguishing whether the onset of schizophrenic disorder was a consequence of HFI; is related to childhood TBI; or that the co-occurrence of schizophrenic disorders, head injury in childhood and later development of HFI is just a coincidence, especially that the available literature has suggested that there is an increased risk of schizophrenia following TBI, with a larger effect in individuals from families with an elevated genetic predisposition to psychosis. Furthermore, some studies have supported that childhood trauma may have a causative role in some presentations of psychosis. The explanation for this long latency from injury to onset of illness may be related to the neurodevelopmental theory of schizophrenia.\n\n【34】Head injury, HFI, and schizophrenia are important factors that must be considered when interpreting frontal atrophy in the case of our patient. The longest follow-up TBI studies have supported that there is a brain volume loss in a patient with chronic brain injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The neuroinﬂammatory reactions following TBI may play a role in the progression of degenerative brain changes for months to years after injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【35】Similarly, May et al. noted that the presence of HFI suggests a decrease in brain volume and has major clinical signiﬁcance as it may indicate the beginning of degenerative processes of the brain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, in our case, it is difficult to ascertain the direction of this relationship because the patient underwent a scan only once, without being examined by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, which limited the possibility of drawing conclusions about causal relationships.\n\n【36】On the other hand, patients with untreated schizophrenia lasting 5 to 47 years had less cortical thickness relative to healthy people 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【37】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【38】Finally, we suggest that all these factors (head injury, HFI, and schizophrenia) contribute to cerebral atrophy, severity, and resistant psychotic symptoms in our case.\n\n【39】This observation indicates that even mild head injuries have the potential to initiate a cascade of neuropathological events that reduce brain reserve capacity and increase vulnerability for neuropsychiatric disorders.\n\n【40】In conclusion, we surmise that the long-term pathological effects of TBI including HFI may represent an additional causal factor that can interact with genetic vulnerability and may lead to schizophrenic disorder.\n\n【41】#### Abbreviations\n\n| HFI: | Hyperostosis frontalis interna |\n| --- | --- |\n| TBI: | Traumatic brain injury |\n| PANSS: | Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale |\n| CDT: | Clock drawing test. |\n\n【43】#### Data Availability\n\n【44】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【45】#### Consent\n\n【46】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient’s parents for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【47】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【48】The author declares that there are no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In the usual setting, patients with FAP are identified based on their germline mutations and the diagnosis of thyroid neoplasm is made after the FAP diagnosis. We herein report a case in which the recognition of a CMVPTC led to the initial diagnosis of FAP. The histological and clinical features of CMVPTC are reviewed with emphasis on its relationship to FAP.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Thyroid neoplasms occur in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) with a frequency reported to be increased to as much as 100–160 times the rate seen in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, in a report of 28 tumors in 4 patients with FAP, were the first to recognize and describe in detail the unusual morphology of these tumors. They suggested that FAP-associated thyroid tumors have similarities to typical papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), but are sufficiently unique that they should be considered a tumor distinct from both follicular and papillary carcinoma. There are two reported cases in the literature of recognition of this unusual thyroid neoplasm leading to the diagnosis of familial polyposis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; sporadic counterparts, non FAP associated, have been described as well 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. We herein describe a case of diagnosis of FAP in an individual without a family history of colonic disease based on recognition of a thyroid neoplasm of unusual morphology.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 23-year-old Chinese woman underwent total thyroidectomy for a painless enlargement of the thyroid gland. The enlargement had first been noted 10 years prior to admission, and there had been a gradual increase in size during the intervening period. The patient had no family history of colorectal cancer and both parents were in good health. She did not have any gastrointestinal symptoms and was otherwise well. A total thyroidectomy was performed for a clinical diagnosis of nodular goitre.\n\n【6】On the basis of the thyroid pathology, a flexible sigmoidoscopy was performed. This revealed numerous small (<5 mm) polyps scattered in clusters from rectum to descending colon. Biopsies of these polyps showed that they were all tubular adenomas. At colonoscopy there were more than 100 small polyps throughout the colon but predominantly left-sided. There were no polyps found on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. DNA extracted from blood lymphocytes showed a truncating mutation in segment 1 of the APC gene by protein truncation analysis, confirming the diagnosis of FAP. A total colectomy was performed.\n\n【7】One year following colectomy, two firm, immobile intraabdominal masses were noted on physical examination. An ultrasound directed biopsy of the masses revealed fibromatosis.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【9】The thyroidectomy specimen was fixed in formalin, and representative paraffin-embedded sections were routinely stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Immunohistochemical staining was performed with the labelled streptovidin-biotin-peroxidase detection system using a panel of antibodies .\n\n【10】Table 1 \n\n【11】Antibody information.\n\n【12】##### 3.1. Pathology\n\n【13】The excised thyroid weighed 72 g and contained one nodule (5 × 4 × 4 cm) in the right lobe and three nodules in the left lobe ranging in size from 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.5 to 3 × 2.5 × 2.0 cm.\n\n【14】Light microscopic examination revealed that the three nodules in the left lobe were surrounded by fibrous capsules of varying thickness. The architectural patterns within the nodules were variable, but papillae were present at least focally in each tumor. The papillae were generally short and blunt with edematous cores. A prominent finding within all of the nodules were cribriform structures composed of follicles deficient in colloid and lined by flattened to low cuboidal epithelial cells with scant intervening fibrous tissue . Other portions of the tumor nodules had a trabecular arrangement of tall columnar cells. Frequently within these trabecular areas and to a lesser extent elsewhere, there were small whorls of cells (Figure 1(c)). The tumor cell nuclei were oval and overlapping with irregular outlines. Nuclear grooves were readily identified and occasional typical intranuclear cytoplasmic pseudoinclusions were present. Many of the cells within the whorls had nuclei with a pale eosinophilic to clear appearance (Figure 1(c)). There was no necrosis or mitotic activity present.\n\n【15】(a)\n\n【16】(b)\n\n【17】(c)\n\n【18】(d)\n\n【19】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Histological features of CMV variant of PTC.

The tumor cells were weakly positive by immunohistochemistry for thyroglobulin ((a)-inset), but showed nuclear localization with immunostaining for beta-catenin ((b)-inset). Other portions of the tumor nodules had a trabecular arrangement (b, c) of tall columnar cells with small whorls of cells (arrowheads).

Beta-catenin immunostaining demonstrated nuclear localization within the tumor cells (Figure 1(b) inset). There was no cytoplasmic reactivity for CK20, chromogranin, or S100. In all of the immunostained sections, including the negative controls, there was strong positivity within the tumor cell nuclei with the peculiar nuclear clearing described above.\n\n【23】Microscopic examination showed that the mass in the right lobe was a follicular adenoma.\n\n【24】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【25】The extraintestinal associations of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are wellknown and include osteomas, epidermoid cysts, fibromatosis, adrenal, biliary, liver, and brain neoplasms (some kindreds with Turcot's syndrome) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> as well as thyroid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>. The risk of development of thyroid carcinoma in FAP is not known with certainty. A report from a large FAP registry indicated that 1.2% of affected individuals develop thyroid carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Two large studies of FAP patients found a relative risk of developing thyroid carcinoma of 7.6 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> and 23 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> compared to the general population. However, amongst females with polyposis, the risk has been estimated at 100–160 times greater than expected in the general population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Some authors have recommended that FAP patients be screened for the development of thyroid carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>, but this is controversial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The FAP-associated thyroid tumors reported in the literature have been variably diagnosed as papillary, follicular, or mixed papillary and follicular carcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> reported four cases of thyroid carcinoma in FAP patients with a review of the literature and noted the following unusual features: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>female : male ratio of 8 : 1 (2 : 1 to 4 : 1 in sporadic PTC); other studies have found an even more striking female predominance (f : m—17 : 1) for this particular subtye 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>,通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u>majority under age 30 ( most in 30–50 age group in sporadic PTC),通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u>multifocality (differing from sporadic PTC multifocality-tumors encapsulated, circumscribed, differing architectural patterns), and通用删除7(英):<u>(4)</u>unusual histologic patterns: cribriform, solid, spindling, and whorls.\n\n【27】The authors concluded that FAP-associated thyroid carcinomas were likely related to PTC, but were sufficiently different to warrant status as a distinct entity.\n\n【28】Based on the distinct and unusual morphology of the thyroid tumors occurring in FAP patients, Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> suggested that the recognition of such a tumor should prompt investigation for FAP. The investigation in the case reported herein led to a diagnosis of FAP, supporting their recommendation.\n\n【29】However, Cameselle-Teijeiro and Chan 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> described 4 cases with similar or identical morphology apparently occurring in patients without FAP. Others 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 12\\]</u> have also described similar tumors, again in patients without evidence of FAP. These tumors have been termed the “cribriform-morular” variant of PTC (CMV PTC) by Cameselle-Teijeiro and Chan in recognition of their two most prominent and unusual patterns. The cribriform areas are composed of anastomosing bars and arches of cells without intervening stroma with the follicular spaces devoid of colloid. The morulas are composed of spindled cells with “peculiar nuclear clearing.” These clear nuclei differ from both the optically clear nuclei and intranuclear pseudoinclusions more typically seen in PTC and consist of accumulations of biotin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>.\n\n【30】Harach et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> speculated that the morphology of this apparently distinctive tumor might be related to the involvement of the APC gene in the pathogenesis. Several groups have analyzed APC gene mutations. Cetta et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u> analyzed four tumors from patients with known germline APC mutations. They found no examples of biallelic inactivation. Soravia et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> studied 9 samples from 4 tumors and found somatic APC mutation in 1 sample. However, Iwama et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u> found germline and somatic mutation of APC gene in 2 cases of FAP-associated thyroid carcinomas. These findings suggest that, although somatic mutation of APC gene may be seen in some cases of FAP-associated thyroid carcinoma, it is not a required step in the pathogenesis of these neoplasms. However, a number of studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14, 16\\]</u> have shown evidence of ret/PTC-1 oncogene activation, which is known to be an early molecular event in papillary thyroid carcinoma oncogenesis. This finding would support the concept that FAP-associated thyroid tumors are variants of PTC.\n\n【31】More recently Xu et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u> have demonstrated that aberrant nuclear accumulation of mutant beta-catenin may substitute for APC mutations in a subset of CMV of PTC . It is thought that these sporadic cases are due to a somatic mutation in exon 3 of the beta-catenin gene (CTNNB1), further highlighting the analogous role to the APC-beta-catenin pathway. Although only a small number of cases have been studied, the most common carcinogenic genetic abnormality in papillary thyroid carcinoma—BRAF mutation—appears to be absent in FAP-associated thyroid cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【32】Thyroid carcinomas occurring in FAP patients have unusual clinical and pathological features, but morphologic and molecular evidence supports the concept that these are variants of PTC. Although the morphologic features are unusual and rarely seen in sporadic PTC, recent reports have emphasized that they are not specific for FAP. Nevertheless, they are sufficiently uncommon that their presence in a thyroid tumor should prompt investigation for FAP. This may be particularly important in the 20% of patients with FAP who have no family history 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【33】#### Authors Contributions\n\n【34】D. F.

No other clinical symptoms or physical findings were observed at admission. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and a small calcified nodule in chest CT were the only abnormal findings. Pus samples from sinuses were examined and confirmed tuberculosis which was in agreement with surgical pathology of lymph nodes. A four- 通用删除7(英):<u>(4-)</u> drug antituberculous regimen was administered. After an initial remission of his symptoms, the patient presented an exacerbation of the cervical swelling with draining sinuses necessitating addition of oral steroids. TL can be symptomless presenting a paradoxical reaction during treatment. The uniqueness of our case lies in the patient’s advanced age, which is uncommon with cervical lymphadenopathy as a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, as well as in the administration of oral steroids to resolve the neck’s clinical deterioration. The patient had a complete recovery and was free of disease after completion of his six-month antituberculous chemotherapy.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Tuberculous lymphadenitis (TL) or scrofula was firstly described by Hippocrates 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. During the 18<sup>th</sup> century, tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis was known as the “king’s evil” which was believed to be cured by the royal touch 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. TL seems to be more common in females than in males with the Asian and black women showing an increased risk for this type of infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Cervical lymphadenopathy, which is the most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, is estimated to mainly appear between the ages of 20 and 40 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Other studies also report that peripheral TL is usually presented in young adults 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Particularly, for the USA and the UK, TL is frequently diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 50 years 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>.\n\n【4】We present the case of a left lateral cervical lymphadenopathy with draining sinuses, resulting from tuberculous infection. Its uniqueness lies in the complete absence of any constitutional symptom of tuberculous disease except the cervical swelling with draining sinuses, in the patient’s advanced age being uncommon for this particular condition, and in the use of oral steroids when a paradoxical deterioration, after an initial remission, of the patient’s neck condition during antituberculous treatment, was observed. The age and the robust response of the patient to steroid therapy, while under antituberculous treatment, despite the conflicting opinions in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>, are underlined for management of similar conditions.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】An 89-year-old male smoker patient presented at the emergency department of our hospital with left, deep purplish cervical swelling with draining sinuses. The patient reported that three months ago, painless erythematous nodular swellings appeared in the left lateral neck area. No respiratory symptoms, fever, or weight loss were reported except for occasional dry cough and mucous expectoration since he had been a lifelong smoker of 70 pack-years. The patient was a taxi and bus driver. His past medical history included surgery for benign prostate hypertrophy 15 years ago, as well as an unscheduled visit to the emergency department of our hospital, 6 months ago, due to an acute hypertensive episode associated with pulmonary edema, being treated by intravenous diuretics. Since then, he had been on valsartan-hydrochlorothiazide therapy (16 mg + 12.5 mg), once daily. On examination, the patient, a tall and thin man, (BMI = 19.6 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>), with normal skin color, had a normal physical appearance except for his left lateral neck lesion including draining tract sinuses with purulent material  and scarce low-pitched expiratory wheezes. The cardiovascular examination showed a mild systolic murmur in the right second intercostal space compatible with moderate aortic valve regurgitation. On admission, the blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were 145/70 mmHg and 86 beats per minute, respectively, while blood and biochemistry tests were as follows: Hct = 37.3%; Hb = 13.8 g/dL; MCV = 81.7 fL; MCH = 29.6 pg; PLT = 214 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL; WBC = 6.3 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL (leukocyte type: NEU% = 70%, LYM% = 20%, MON% = 7%, and EOS = 3%); INR = 1.22; serum glucose = 101 mg/dL; urea = 39 mg/dL; creatinine = 1.02 mg/dL; Na<sup>+</sup> = 139 mmol/L; K<sup>+</sup> = 4.2 mmol/L; and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) = 52 mm/1st hour. The Mantoux test showed 10 mm induration, and his chest X-ray had no significant findings. The computed tomography (CT scan) showed minimal fibrous bands in the upper zone area of the right upper lobe, while a small calcified nodule (3 mm diameter) was also found in the periphery of the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe . Fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed a diffusely red and hyperemic bronchial mucosa, particularly intense in the segments of the right upper lobe, with the presence of some small anthracotic areas . Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) obtained from the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe showed increased (>70%) lymphocytes, 15% neutrophils, few (<8%) macrophages, and scarcity of bronchial epithelial cells with no evidence of malignancy. Direct smear for acid-fast bacilli was also negative. The surgical biopsy and the microscopic examination of the cervical lymph node showed epithelial granuloma with central coagulative (caseous) necrosis and the presence of M. tuberculosis complex, respectively. In addition, the microscopic examination of the purulent content of draining sinuses in the patient’s neck also revealed the presence of M. tuberculosis complex. Final diagnosis for TL was established by histopathologic examination (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)).\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】Lateral cervical area of patient with swollen and draining lymph nodes.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【10】Chest CT image showing small (3 mm) nodules (black arrow) in the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【12】Small area with anthracotic discoloration (black arrow) in the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.\n\n【13】(a)\n\n【14】(b)\n\n【15】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【17】(a) Tuberculous granuloma with collections of epithelioid macrophages (thin two-direction black arrow) and Langhans giant cells (simple thick black arrow) H-EX400.

One month after the initiation of the antituberculous regimen, and after an initial remission regarding the magnitude of the patient’s neck growth, he experienced an enlargement of his lymph nodes with reappearance of draining sinuses. It was then decided to add oral steroids (20 mg prednisolone daily). Four weeks after steroid administration, there was a spectacular, almost complete remission, of his neck growth. The antituberculous treatment was continued for 6 months, and the patient was free of disease after its completion.\n\n【19】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【20】Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is most commonly diagnosed in peripheral lymph nodes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. In our case, the occasional cough and mucous expectoration were nonspecific symptoms for tuberculous disease (TB). Due to lateral neck mass appearance, the differential diagnosis may include neoplastic, infectious or immunologic diseases, sarcoidosis, abscess, tuberculosis, brucellosis, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, cat-scratch disease, and fungal infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The presence of draining sinuses with purulent material was suggestive of infectious, suppurative conditions such as pyogenic abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u> or other infective processes. In our patient, diagnosis of TL was based either on the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the pus of the draining sinuses of the lymph node or on the histopathologic examination of the lymph node showing a typical pathology of tuberculosis. For the accurate diagnosis of cervical TL, the contribution of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), while avoiding any complication associated with the open biopsy, is reported in the relevant literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. The use of fine-needle aspiration cytology in diagnosis of extrapulmonary tuberculous lymphadenitis was also reported by previous studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 17–19\\]</u>, with granulomatous inflammation on fine-needle aspiration cytology to be strongly indicative for tuberculosis infection 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>. However, excisional biopsy compared to the fine-needle aspiration technique seems to be more sensitive and safer in diagnosis of peripheral TL 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>, particularly when multiple lymph nodes should be examined 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. Another issue to be discussed is the exacerbation of our patient’s neck growth one month after induction of anti-TB treatment, something which is not an unusual event during therapy of TL, characterized as a paradoxical reaction (PR). Paradoxical reaction is a transitory deterioration of the clinical and/or radiological condition although the patient is under appropriate anti-TB therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21–23\\]</u>, and it is interpreted by two different proposed theories: the first lies in a delayed immune activation and the second one in a hypersensitivity reaction to the antigen released from dying mycobacteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. Predictive risk factors for paradoxical reaction during treatment for cervical lymph node TB are lymph node size ≥ 3 cm and extralymph node TB (multivariate and univariate analyses), as well as sweating (univariate analysis) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. Age, antigenic load, lymphocyte count, inflammatory status, and vitamin D status are also independent risk factors for paradoxical reaction, when under treatment for extrapulmonary TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>. Moreover, baseline anemia, hypoalbuminemia, lymphopenia, and a greater change in lymphocyte count are independent risk factors for PR during therapy for pulmonary TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>. The incidence of paradoxical reaction, during anti-TB curative treatment, ranges from 6% to 30% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27–29\\]</u> with the respiratory system, central nervous system, and lymph nodes to be mainly affected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23, 30\\]</u>. In TL, paradoxical reaction usually occurs within two months, ranging from 14 to 270 days, following administration of anti-TB medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Immunotherapy with steroids or an antitumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-a) inhibitor may help to resolve the paradoxical reaction of lymph nodes during treatment by inhibiting granuloma formation interfering with the penetration of anti-TB chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31–33\\]</u>. According to the relevant literature, when diagnosis of TL is established and adequate anti-TB regimen is administered, a relapse in adenitis or appearance of draining sinuses could be expected and managed by adding oral steroids along with the anti-TB medication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>, despite steroids not being prescribed for TL treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>, except for local discomfort 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. The use of corticosteroids while receiving therapy for TL seems to resolve paradoxical reaction and improves the clinical outcome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30, 35–39\\]</u>. Although steroids seem to be particularly effective against paradoxical reaction during appropriate treatment for intracranial tuberculomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21, 32\\]</u>, TB meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[40\\]</u>, and pleural TB 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[41\\]</u>, another study showed no significant clinical response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[42\\]</u>. The rationale for the use of corticosteroids is based on the reduction of the inflammation process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Specifically, for neuro-TB, the administration of corticosteroids reduces cerebral edema by also influencing cerebral vasculature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[43\\]</u>, while for peripheral lymph node TB, the benefit of corticosteroid therapy seems to be less clear 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[44\\]</u>. Nonetheless, a more recent comparative study showed that the routine addition of corticosteroids for the first 3-4 months in tapering dosage, even without appearance of paradoxical reaction, in patients receiving standard medication for cervical lymph node tuberculosis, is safe with better clinical outcome and complete relief of symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[38\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Also, surgical therapy is the method of choice to manage cervical TL attributed in nontuberculous mycobacteria, specifically in children, due to better response compared to three months of two-drug antituberculous chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[45–47\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The learning points, useful in clinical practice, from our case, can be presented as follows: (i) the patient belonged to an age group where cervical TL is particularly uncommon as a form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, (ii) the exacerbation of the patient’s neck lymphadenitis was resolved by oral steroids, and (iii) the patient was in complete recovery and free of disease after accomplishment of his 6 month antituberculous chemotherapy.\n\n【24】In conclusion, TL should always be among the differential diagnoses of lymph node enlargement even when no constitutional symptoms exist, as in the presented case. When diagnosis is established and the indicated antituberculous treatment is administered, a relapse in adenitis or draining sinuses presentation is not considered as treatment failure but this effect could be expected and can be managed by adding oral steroids along with the antituberculous medication.\n\n【25】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【26】The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n【27】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【28】Stylianos A.

Leiomyosarcomas of vascular origin are particularly rare tumors occurring mainly in the inferior vena cava (IVC). They are malignant, slow-growing tumors with a poor prognosis. This paper reports on a rare case of surgical resection of an IVC leiomyosarcoma mimicking a hepatic tumor. Case Presentation. A 65-year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images, with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the Spiegel lobe or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma and performed a laparotomy. On the basis of surgical findings, we extirpated the tumor by performing a wedge resection of the wall of the IVC and suturing the primary IVC wall. Pathological findings led to a further diagnosis of the tumor as a leiomyosarcoma originating in the IVC. Thirty-seven months after the operation, multiple liver and lung metastases were detected, and the patient died from multiple organic failures. Conclusion. We experienced a rare case of a leiomyosarcoma of IVC mimicking hepatic tumor.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Leiomyosarcomas are malignant tumors of smooth muscle cells that can originate in any location but occur most often in the uterus, retroperitoneum, or intraabdominal region 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Leiomyosarcomas of vascular origin are particularly rare tumors occurring mainly in the inferior vena cava (IVC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The International Registry of Inferior Vena Cava Leiomyosarcomas revealed that most tumors occur in the lower (44.2%) or middle (50.8%) region of the IVC, while only a small number of tumors occur in the upper third or suprahepatic region (4.2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Leiomyosarcoma of IVC was first described by Dzsinich et al. in 1992 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. There are no definitive symptoms, but typical symptoms include dyspnea and a general feeling of being unwell accompanied by weight loss and abdominal and/or back pain 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. A correct diagnosis is difficult, and, in up to one-third of cases, it is not made until after a postmortem examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Diagnosis is made using modern imaging techniques such as ultrasound, echocardiography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In spite of the advancement of modern imaging techniques, it is difficult to diagnose a leiomyosarcoma preoperatively, and in some cases it is also difficult to distinguish it from a hepatic tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. This paper reports on a rare case of surgical resection of an IVC leiomyosarcoma mimicking a hepatic tumor.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 65-year-old Japanese male was admitted for evaluation of an abdominal tumor. The tumor was detected by chance during a chest CT performed for a lung examination. The patient had no past history of any abdominal surgery, and his vital signs were stable. There is nothing particularly significant in the findings of the laboratory examination. Tumor markers are negative.\n\n【6】Enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images (Figure 1(a)), with no enhancement or washout in late-phase images (Figure 1(b)). Magnetic resonance imaging of this tumor revealed a contrasting low intensity on the T1-weighted image (Figure 2(a)) and high intensity on the T2-weighted image (Figure 2(b)). Upper-gastrointestinal endoscopy and colonoscopy revealed no evidence of a malignant tumor in the gastrointestinal tract. We diagnosed this tumor as either a hepatic tumor in the Spiegel lobe or a retroperitoneal tumor such as leiomyosarcoma or liposarcoma.\n\n【7】(a)\n\n【8】(b)\n\n【9】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a slightly enhanced heterogeneous tumor, 18 mm in diameter, between the Spiegel lobe of the liver and the IVC in early-phase images ((a) arrow), with no enhancement and washout in late-phase images ((b) arrow). |\n| --- |\n\n【12】(a)\n\n【13】(b)\n\n【14】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen.

To expose the affected IVC lesion, we need to mobilize some parts of the right lobe of the liver. This tumor was not located in the liver but originated in the IVC. We extirpated the tumor by performing a wedged resection of the wall of the IVC and sutured primary IVC wall. We controlled the bleeding from the IVC using the hemostatic forceps. The resected specimen was solid with a smooth surface . Microscopic examination revealed that the tumor consisted of uniform and spindle cells and had a fascicular growth pattern. This pathological feature was compatible with a mesenchymal tumor (Figure 4(a)). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that α\\-SMA and HHF35 were expressed in this tumor (Figures 4(b) and 4(c)), and c-kit and CD34 were negative. The MIB-1 index was about 60% (Figure 4(d)). The tumor was diagnosed as a leiomyosarcoma originating in the IVC. The patient’s recovery was uneventful, and he was discharged on postoperative day 10. After 12 months, the tumor was detected in the Spiegel of the liver on enhanced CT of the abdomen . We diagnosed it as a recurrence of the leiomyosarcoma. We suggested to the patient and his family that he should undergo additional treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, or surgical resection, but they declined this. Thirty-seven months after the operation, multiple liver and lung metastases were detected on CT (Figures 6(a) and 6(b)), and the patient died of multiple organic failures.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| The resected specimen was solid with a smooth surface. |\n| --- |\n\n【20】(a)\n\n【21】(b)\n\n【22】(c)\n\n【23】(d)\n\n【24】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| Histopathological findings.

Discussion\n\n【35】Leiomyosarcomas originating in the IVC are rare, malignant, slow-growing tumors with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Tumor metastases of this slow-growing malignant tumor to other organs are relatively infrequent, but can be detected in the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, or bones 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7, 8\\]</u>. In this case, there were no symptoms, and the tumor was detected by chance in a chest CT. Present day imaging techniques such as abdominal ultrasonography, echocardiography, CT, and MRI are commonly employed to make a rapid and precise diagnosis of a suspected leiomyosarcoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. In this case we could not preoperatively diagnose the tumor as leiomyosarcoma of the IVC and also could not rule out a potential liver tumor. A final conclusive diagnosis is of course made by means of histopathological and immunohistochemical methods. The pathognomonic findings of leiomyosarcoma are spindle-shaped tumor cells with positive markers for smooth muscle cells, vimentin, muscle actin, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and desmin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【36】The recommended therapy for treating leiomyosarcoma is aggressive surgical removal of the tumor by means of modern vascular surgery, in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8, 10\\]</u>. In surgery, a complete resection of the tumor was possible, and the IVC was repaired primarily via surgical means without too high a risk of postoperative edema. For leiomyosarcomas, there is a perioperative mortality of 4%, and 42% of the patients died of the disease itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. To reduce the tumor size and increase the resection rate, a preoperative neoadjuvant therapy can be implemented. If, however, a complete tumor resection is not possible, tumor reduction followed by radiation therapy provides a good palliative treatment option 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【37】Postoperative therapy and the management of recurrence are difficult because of the absence of evidence for their effectiveness in patients. Radiation has been used in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings, and some authors believe that it may help with the local control of disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. For localized, resectable, soft-tissue sarcomas, adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin or a combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide has been shown to prolong the time before recurrence and the overall rate of survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. This therapy may thus also be effective in the treatment of IVC leiomyosarcoma. A case has been previously reported in which an IVC leiomyosarcoma with liver metastasis was positive for steroid receptors, including the estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The patient received combined multimodal therapy, including resection of the tumor, intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy, and hormonal manipulation. Thus hormonal manipulation using medroxyprogesterone and/or tamoxifen should be tried in ER/PR-positive cases. Although there is no established treatment for patients with IVC leiomyosarcoma, we hope that thorough investigation of this condition will help establish a standard treatment yielding satisfactory results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In a series of case studies of 14 patients with a leiomyosarcoma of the IVC who underwent generous resection followed by radiation, it was established that radiotherapy reduced local recurrence and increased the median survival time. In addition, a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has been reported as being superior to radiotherapy alone with respect to an increase in the survival rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The long-term outcome of surgery for leiomyosarcoma of the IVC has been disappointing. Some reports with sufficient case numbers and followup revealed that a 5-year survival rate was achieved 33%–53% after radical resection followed by a curative approach using adjuvant therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8, 13\\]</u>. We should diagnose this tumor in early stage, and aggressive surgical management using modern vascular surgical and oncology techniques.\n\n【38】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【39】We encountered a rare case of leiomyosarcoma of the IVC mimicking a liver tumor. We must always consider leiomyosarcoma when treating a tumor between the liver and the IVC and be prepared to perform a complete surgical resection in the event of leiomyosarcoma and follow up carefully. We must also consider adjuvant therapy for a recurrent leiomyosarcoma.\n\n【40】#### Authors’ Contribution\n\n【41】J. Ueda, H. Yoshida, and E. Uchida contributed equally to this work; Y. Mamada, N.

The management for subcapsular splenic hematoma remains controversial. We herein report a case of a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with a large pancreatic pseudocyst, which was successfully treated with splenic arterial embolization and ultrasound- (US-) guided percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst, for the first time. A 44-year-old male suffered from recurrent abdominal pain for more than two years. He had previous 3 episodes of pancreatitis. A subcapsular splenic hematoma (16.0 × 16.0 × 7.6 cm) with pancreatic pseudocyst (13.5 × 10.0 × 8.0 cm) was shown on abdominal computed tomography (CT). He underwent splenic arterial embolization to decrease the blood supply of the spleen and then ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage of the large pancreatic pseudocyst. After 2 weeks, the repeated CT-Abdomen showed the disappearance of pancreatic pseudocyst and multiple areas of infarction on the spleen, while the splenic subcapsular hematoma had also significantly reduced. The patient was discharged after almost a month of his hospital admission with the drainage tube attached, and about 2 weeks later the drainage tube was removed upon CT scan confirmation of decrease in the volume of the subcapsular hematoma.

Introduction\n\n【3】A subcapsular splenic hematoma is a very rare hemorrhagic complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis. The prevalence of subcapsular hematoma of the spleen was estimated to be 0.4% in a recent study of 500 patients with chronic pancreatitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The management of this complication remains controversial. Thompson Jr. and Ashley 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> advocated early splenectomy to prevent rupture of the splenic hematoma and its associated morbidity. Rypens et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u> suggested that most of these complications could potentially regress and be managed conservatively. In addition, percutaneous drainage of the subcapsular splenic hematoma has been demonstrated in 4 case reports in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>. We herein present a case of a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with a large pancreatic pseudocyst successfully treated with splenic arterial embolization and US-guided percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst, for the first time.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 44-year-old male was admitted to our hospital because of recurrent abdominal pain for more than two years that worsened over the past two weeks. He was a heavy drinker, with alcohol consumption of 250 g/day for 15 years. He had no history of trauma but previous 3 episodes of pancreatitis. He had the first episode of acute pancreatitis two years ago and received conservative treatment for it. The second episode of acute pancreatitis, about one and a half years ago, was accompanied by retroperitoneal cyst and splenomegaly along with dilation of the pancreatic duct. During the second episode, he underwent pancreatic duct dilation with a stent implanted into the pancreatic duct that was removed after 4 months. During the third episode of acute pancreatitis, about six months ago, a large pseudocyst was seen in the body and tail of the pancreas. Patient’s symptoms were relieved after symptomatic treatment, but pseudocyst had not been treated. Nearly two weeks ago, the patient had recurrent upper abdominal pain, which was persistent and radiating to the left shoulder and back. He was admitted to local hospital. The routine blood test showed hemoglobin 102 g/L and serum amylase 139 U/L. Abdominal CT showed a large pseudocyst in the body and tail of the pancreas with signs of bleeding, a large subcapsular hematoma of the spleen, and cholecystitis with gallstones. Despite the conservative treatment consisting of pain control, bowel rest, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics, the pain was not relieved, so he visited our hospital.\n\n【6】After admission, his blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature were 117/69 mmHg, 58 beats per minute, and 36.5°C, respectively. The abdominal examination revealed a palpable mass in the left upper quadrant with mild tenderness. The spleen was palpable under the left costal arch. Murphy’s sign was negative. The laboratory findings showed that the liver function tests, renal function tests, and electrolytes were within normal limit. However, there was a leukocytosis (12500/mm<sup>3</sup>), increased C-reactive protein (10.1 mg/dL), and decreased hemoglobin (9.1 g/dL) and hematocrit (26.9%). The serum amylase was 117 U/L, which were slightly above the normal range. The endoscopic ultrasonography revealed gastric vein varicosis in the fundus, pancreatic pseudocyst, cholecystitis with accumulation of biliary sludge, splenomegaly with subcapsular hematoma, and splenic vein varicosis. The CT-Abdomen revealed a huge low-density mass (16.0 × 16.0 × 7.6 cm) with some separations and loss of normal pancreatic morphology in the body and tail, splenomegaly with subcapsular hematoma (13.5 × 10.0 × 8.0 cm) that possibly pressurizes the left kidney, multiple cysts seen in the liver, gallstones, abdominal and pelvic effusion, bilateral pleural effusion with lungs atelectasis, splenic vein dilation, and expansion of portal vein branches .\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】CT scan showing a large subcapsular splenic hematoma (16.0 × 16.0 × 7.6 cm) with a large pancreatic pseudocyst (13.5 × 10.0 × 8.0 cm).\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【10】CT scan showing a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with a large pancreatic pseudocyst.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【12】Vascular restructure with CT showing splenic vein dilation and expansion of portal vein branches.\n\n【13】During hospitalization, EUS-guided pseudocyst puncture and drainage were done, where small amount of dark brown liquid was collected. The following day CT-Abdomen showed no changes in the pancreatic pseudocyst and splenic subcapsular hematoma, while the NG tube was still in place . Splenic artery embolization  was done on the next day, with no significant changes on the follow-up CT-Abdomen result. About 4 days later, ultrasound-guided percutaneous puncture drainage of pancreatic pseudocyst was done . Postoperative fluid collection was about 5000 ml of dark brown liquid with amylase 21577 U/L, lipase 56704 U/L, red blood cell count 0.45 × 10<sup>12</sup>/L, and hemoglobin 29 g/L. The follow-up CT-Abdomen (plain + contrast), about 2 weeks later, showed the disappearance of pancreatic pseudocyst and multiple areas of infarction on the spleen, while the splenic subcapsular hematoma had significantly reduced . Abdominal ultrasound was done to obtain detailed status of the subcapsular hematoma. During hospitalization, the patient was also supplemented by antibiotics, nutritional support, acid suppression, and inhibition of pancreatic secretion. The patient was discharged after almost a month of his hospital admission with the drainage tube attached, and about 2 weeks later the drainage tube was removed upon CT scan confirmation of decrease in the volume of the subcapsular hematoma .

Discussion\n\n【25】In the present case, a large subcapsular splenic hematoma complicating large pancreatic pseudocyst gradually disappears after splenic arterial embolization and US-guided percutaneous drainage of a large pancreatic pseudocyst, and drainage of a subcapsular splenic hematoma and surgical procedures such as a splenectomy and distal pancreatectomy were avoided.\n\n【26】Splenic hematoma is a rare complication of acute or chronic pancreatitis when compared with traumatic origin of subcapsular hematoma. The tail of the pancreas is in close proximity to the splenic hilum, whereas the peritoneum encases the anterior pancreatic surface along with the splenic vessels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. This anatomy provides a potential for splenic involvement in pancreatitis. There are several possible theories which might explain the mechanisms that how pancreatitis leads to subcapsular splenic hematoma: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> erosion of splenic parenchyma after pancreatic enzyme leakage, resulting in either a splenic hematoma or intrasplenic bleeding, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> disruption of splenic hilar vessels leading to subcapsular splenic hematoma, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> expansion of intrasplenic pseudocysts resulting in splenic rupture and bleeding 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In our case report, patient has a history of three episodes of pancreatitis. During the third episode, the CT scan showed pseudocysts with variable sizes at the body and tail of the pancreas, which were compressing the splenic vein and parenchyma. Therefore, according to the results of CT scan and enhancement imaging, we assume that direct erosion into the splenic parenchyma or disruption of the splenic vein might have led to a subcapsular splenic hematoma in this case.\n\n【27】Because splenic involvement in patients with pancreatitis is uncommon, the diagnosis of subcapsular hematoma of the spleen needs the alertness of physicians and imaging studies. Patients with pancreatitis exhibiting a mass in the left upper quadrant, pain radiating to the left shoulder, elevation of the left diaphragm, and a moderate fall in hematocrit should be suspected to have splenic complications. Imaging studies that are used to monitor the pancreatitis, such as CT and MRI, are regarded as reliable diagnostic tools and should be performed early in questionable patients. A splenic hematoma can be distinguished from simple fluid collection based on density (Hounsfield units > 30). Angiography is not essential for the diagnosis but would be indicated if splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, splenic vein thrombosis, or active bleeding was suspected 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【28】The management of subcapsular splenic hematoma in pancreatitis remains controversial, maybe due to its rareness. Some reports have advocated aggressive management with early splenectomy to avoid splenic rupture 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 10\\]</u>. Thompson Jr. and Ashley 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> described 3 cases with acute pancreatitis accompanied by large subcapsular hematoma of the spleen. Two patients recovered after splenectomy, but 1 patient died due to continuing blood loss. They suggested that the treatment of subcapsular splenic hematoma should be a splenectomy in the vast majority of patients to prevent continuing blood loss and potential rupture. However, some authors advocate a conservative approach, which is based on the experience with traumatic lesions that can resolve spontaneously. Patel et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u> reported a case of subcapsular splenic hematoma managed conservatively with a favorable outcome, in which the CT scan showed the marked resolution of the hematoma after 4 months. This approach was considered as a safe management in hemodynamically stable patients. As a part of conservative approaches, percutaneous drainage of the hematoma, which showed good prognosis, may be increasingly used in recent years. Four cases of a subcapsular splenic hematoma have been reported which were successfully treated by percutaneous drainage of the hematoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–7\\]</u>. Prompt relief of symptoms, a short recovery time, avoidance of rupture, and spleen preservation are the benefits of percutaneous drainage. In addition, Purushothaman and Borowski 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u> also demonstrated the satisfying effect of splenic artery embolization for subcapsular splenic hematoma. However, it was just one particular case, which was reported.\n\n【29】In this special case, the patient suffered from a large subcapsular splenic hematoma with a large pancreatic pseudocyst. After repeatedly discussing about patient history and imaging studies in the multidisciplinary team (MDT), we considered that the only drainage of large pancreatic pseudocyst or spleen subcapsular hematoma will destroy the balance of the existing abdominal pressure, which may worsen subcapsular splenic hematoma, and the rupture of splenic hematoma and other unpredictable life-threatening consequences might even occur. Therefore, we made splenic artery embolization to decrease the blood supply of the spleen. Following, we made the US-guided percutaneous drainage of the large pancreatic pseudocysts. The postoperative abdomen CT scan demonstrated the significant resolution of pancreatic pseudocyst and subcapsular splenic hematoma, with relief of symptoms. There are several possibilities which might explain that subcapsular splenic hematoma gradually disappeared after splenic artery embolization and percutaneous drainage of the large pancreatic pseudocysts: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> splenic artery embolism reduces the blood supply of spleen, and spleen subcapsular bleeding stopped; 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> after adequate percutaneous drainage of the large pancreatic pseudocyst, the pressure of splenic hilum decreased and the return of splenic vein increased which accelerated the absorption of hematoma; 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> there was the common channel between subcapsular splenic hematoma and pancreatic pseudocyst, so subcapsular splenic hematoma was also being drained while draining the pancreatic pseudocyst.\n\n【30】In conclusion, the definitive management of a subcapsular splenic hematoma complicating pancreatic pseudocyst is not yet established. Surgical intervention may be one of the therapeutic options for hemodynamically unstable patients, but with high mortality rate. Imaging-guided percutaneous drainage and splenic artery embolization appeared to be another feasible option for subcapsular splenic hematomas to prevent splenic rupture and obviate splenectomy. For the case of subcapsular splenic hematoma with a large pancreatic pseudocyst, the splenic artery embolization and US-guided percutaneous drainage of large pancreatic pseudocyst may be a safe and effective management.\n\n【31】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【32】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【33】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【34】Song Zhang and Fei Liu contributed equally to this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

It was subsequently found that the SFT had metastasized to the brain by additional pathology, and not the predicted adenocarcinoma. SFTs are a rare mesenchymal neoplasm that accounts for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors. SFTs most commonly arise in the thoracic cavity, but are frequently found in various locations throughout the body, and rarely metastasize to the brain. This case highlights that rare neoplasms, such as SFT, should not be ruled out as a potential cause of metastasis. Due to the rarity of this clinical situation, we also provide a review and discussion of previously reported SFT cases and the use of postoperative radiation therapy. The optimal treatment for individual patients remains unclear in this unique situation. Surgical resection followed by adjuvant Gamma Knife radiation therapy to the surgical bed appears to be a safe option for local treatment of SFT in select patients. Further studies are needed of this rare clinical situation in order to better understand and optimize future treatments for patients with SFT and metastasis to the brain.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】We present a unique case of a patient with simultaneously diagnosed solitary fibrous tumor of the lung and adenocarcinoma of the lung, and who was later found to have a single solitary fibrous tumor metastasis to the brain.

Case Report\n\n【6】The patient is a 70-year-old male Navy veteran who served on the Mekong in Vietnam for 14 months, during which time he reports that he was exposed to Agent Orange. He has a previous history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease with coronary artery bypass grafting in 2015, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease from tobacco.\n\n【7】He presented with progressive shortness of breath and underwent a workup with CT scan of the chest without contrast, which revealed two distinct appearing tumors, one in the right upper lobe with a tumor size of 1.5 cm and another in the right lower lung with a tumor size of 13 cm . He underwent a right upper lobe wedge resection and a right lower lobectomy for these tumors. Pathology revealed two distinct neoplasms. The right upper lobe tumor was a moderately differentiated lung adenocarcinoma, stage pT2a . Pathology revealed focal invasion of the visceral pleura, confirmed by elastic stain.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】Noncontrast CT chest, coronal view.

The mitotic rate was significantly elevated at 13 mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields . Multiple fields of necrosis were also identified. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, which revealed reactivity for CD34 and Bcl-2. The tumor was negative for pancytokeratin. This tumor did not extend beyond the lung parenchyma. A routine sampling of the right lower paratracheal (4R), subcarinal 通用删除7(英):<u>(7)</u>, paraesophageal 通用删除7(英):<u>(8)</u>, and right hilar (10R) lymph nodes was negative for metastatic disease from either tumor. The surgical margins were negative for tumor in both cases. Thus, no additional therapy was recommended at that time. He was followed with clinical visits and imaging studies.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【16】Hematoxylin and Eosin, low-power 100x view of solitary fibrous tumor.

However, a restaging CT chest with contrast showed multiple new pulmonary tumors. Shortly after this CT scan was performed, he presented with mild right leg weakness. MRI of the brain showed a solitary 2.5 cm enhancing mass of the left posterior frontal lobe, just anterior to the motor cortex, with extensive surrounding edema . The timing of his new symptoms and the imaging findings were consistent with a metastatic brain lesion.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 </u>\n\n【21】T1 postgadolinium MRI brain with axial view.

The brain resection pathology revealed a malignant solitary fibrous tumor. It appeared similar to the SFT resected from the lung. It was comprised of spindled cells with storiform and haphazard arrangement. The tumor matrix was predominantly myxoid, and the cells were fed by a rich vascular network of small slit-like vessels and large ectatic branching vessels . The tumor showed immunoreactivity for CD34, Bcl-2, and STAT-6. The Ki-67 proliferation index approached 30%. His case was discussed at the regional multidisciplinary brain tumor board where the consensus recommends radiosurgery. He underwent single fraction Gamma Knife radiosurgery to the tumor cavity with a prescription dose of 22 Gy to the 50% isodose line .

He was prescribed systemic treatment with pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and Alimta and tolerated systemic therapy well but does continue to have generalized weakness, generalized dyspnea on exertion, and a chronic dry cough. At the time of this report, it has been 16 months since the Gamma Knife treatment and he has not developed subsequent recurrence of brain metastasis. He continues to receive treatment with pembrolizumab.\n\n【34】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【35】This is an unusual case of routine adenocarcinoma of the lung, but also SFT of the lung. Furthermore, the patient developed a symptomatic solitary brain metastasis from the SFT, not the lung adenocarcinoma, even more unusual and unexpected.\n\n【36】SFTs are rare mesenchymal neoplasms that account for less than 2% of all reported soft tissue tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, first reported in the literature by Wagner in 1870 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. SFTs were originally thought to only arise in the thoracic cavity, but it is now known that while most SFTs are intrathoracic and usually from the pleura, these tumors are frequently found in various locations throughout the body 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6, 7\\]</u>. Peritoneal cavities, usually the retroperitoneum or pelvic soft tissue, are the primary site of origin in 30% of SFTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. 20% occur in the head and neck, the meninges, or extracranial locations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–12\\]</u>. These can include the sinonasal tract, oral cavity, and orbit 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13–15\\]</u>. There have also been cases of SFT arising from the extremities and bone as well as very few reported from the abdominal wall 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>. SFTs are most commonly benign, but 10–20% of cases have been reported to be malignant. SFTs usually occur in middle-aged patients and equally in men and women 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The most common sites for metastasis are the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. SFT has a low reported incidence of metastasis to the brain, especially low when compared to lung adenocarcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【37】SFTs are usually considered chemoresistant; therefore, localized treatments with surgery or radiation therapy are the most common modalities used. Initially, surgery is most effective, and tumor removal with negative margins of 1 to 2 cm, if possible, is recommended. Complete surgical resection of localized lesions is thought to be important for optimal outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Though the literature is inconclusive about the most effective use, radiotherapy is a good adjuvant treatment before or after surgery in more complex conditions, such as in the case of an incomplete resection or if the tumor is inoperable. We have previously published clinical outcomes after radiosurgery or whole brain radiation for brain metastasis of various histologic types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>. Radiation therapy is especially utilized in cases with malignant SFT, narrow margins, tumor size greater than 10 cm, and fast-growing tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. For example, in an analysis of 102 SFT cases, Krengli et al. reported that local control was higher in patients who were treated with surgery plus postoperative radiation therapy when compared to surgery alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[21\\]</u>. If the tumor has metastasized, adjuvant radiation therapy and sometimes chemotherapy are also used. However, Duranti et al. summarized their treatment of 337 patients with localized thoracic soft tissue sarcoma, where 51% received adjuvant radiotherapy and 41% received postoperative chemotherapy, and concluded the patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy presented with better local control than those who received adjuvant chemotherapy alone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[22\\]</u>.\n\n【38】When compared to brain metastasis from adenocarcinoma, brain metastasis from SFT is significantly less common. In a study of 16,210 patients with brain metastasis, the authors reported that brain metastasis from lung cancers (19.9%) occurs more frequently when compared to other types of cancer, such as melanoma (6.9%), renal (6.5%), breast (5.1%), and colorectal (1.8%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Another study reported similar outcomes with a higher incidence of brain metastasis in lung cancer (16.3%) when compared to renal carcinoma (9.8%), melanoma (7.4%), breast carcinoma (5.0%), and colorectal carcinoma (1.2%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[23\\]</u>. Of lung cancers, a study of 485 cases of patients with lung cancer by Villano et al. reported that the highest occurrence of brain metastasis was from adenocarcinomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[24\\]</u>. In addition, in a 2018 study of 373 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung, brain metastasis was reported to be one of the most common sites of distant metastasis and have a significantly higher rate of brain metastasis than other types of non-small-cell lung cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[25\\]</u>. The relatively high metastatic rate to the brain from adenocarcinoma of the lung is historically documented in that a study published in 1988 reported brain metastasis in 28% of their 259 patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[26\\]</u>.\n\n【39】SFT has a much lower incidence of brain metastasis than adenocarcinoma. In a study of 139 patients with SFT (49 of which had metastases), O’Neill et al. reported that the most common sites of metastasis were the lungs (61%), pleura (49%), liver (41%), bones (41%), and peritoneum (41%). Only 8 of their 49 patients with metastases had brain metastases. The authors report that 5 patients had multiple brain metastases while 3 patients had single brain metastases. Six of the patients with brain metastases had tumors located extraaxially, 1 had extraaxially, and 1 had both extraaxially and intraaxially. The metastases were hypervascular in half of the patients, and the largest diameter was 1.4 cm (range, 0.5–2.8 cm). O’Neill et al. stated that brain metastases were most commonly from head and neck primary SFT, as seen in 5 patients, but also arose from 2 patients with thoracic SFT and 1 with abdominal SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Very few brain metastases from SFT have been reported in the literature.\n\n【40】Surgical excision generally yields a good prognosis for most SFT patients, as seen in a study by Gold et al. of 75 patients with SFTs in a wide range of anatomic sites. The authors reported that the factors predicting worse prognosis include positive surgical margins, large tumor size greater than 10 cm, and the presence of a histologically malignant component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Another study by van Houdt et al. similarly found that the variables most correlated with local recurrence and worse prognosis overall included positive resection margin, tumor size greater than 10 cm, and high mitosis rate. Five years after surgical resection of the 81 patients they followed, overall survival was 84%, local recurrence rate was 29%, and metastasis rate was 34% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Franzen et al. also emphasized the importance of a high mitotic index in recurrence and worse prognosis after following 42 SFT patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>. A study by Tapias et al. reviews 59 patients with surgical treatment of SFT of the pleura (SFTP), one of the most common anatomical locations of SFT, to propose a score that can help predict recurrence of SFTP and guide postoperative surveillance. They report that their scoring system was better at predicting malignant behavior and recurrence than some other scores, such as England’s criteria or de Perrot staging. Their predictive score focuses on factors including mitotic activity, necrosis, sessile morphology, presence of hypercellularity, and size 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[29\\]</u>. However, Franzen et al. in their study found the factors of tumor necrosis and sessile morphology to be statistically insignificant 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[28\\]</u>.\n\n【41】Localized treatment for primary tumor typically consists of surgery with or without radiotherapy for SFT. SFT can be chemoresistant, or chemotherapy may have inconsistent effects in some patients, but a study at MD Anderson concludes that conventional chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin-based therapy, gemcitabine-based therapy, and paclitaxel, can be helpful in controlling or stabilizing locally advanced and metastatic SFT 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[30\\]</u>. Another study at MD Anderson reported that combination therapy with temozolomide and bevacizumab was well tolerated and almost as beneficial as surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[31\\]</u>. However, surgical excision still remains the treatment of choice. van Houdt et al. reported the factor most significantly correlated with local recurrence is the positive resection margin with a hazard ratio of 4.8 (confidence interval 95%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[27\\]</u>. Compared to patients with a negative margin, patients with a positive resection margin have a statistically significant higher risk of local recurrence. In a study of 220 cases reported of intracranial and intraspinal SFT, Bisceglia et al. recommends surgery as the main treatment as well as stereotactic and external beam radiotherapy for unresectable tumors and some cases of postsurgical tumor remnants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[32\\]</u>. Adjuvant radiotherapy is also often used for cases with extensive external invasion. In a very recent study, Bishop et al. reviewed 31 patients treated for SFT in multiple anatomic sites using both surgery and radiation therapy and reported 5-year rates of local control, overall survival, and distant metastatic-free survival as 100%, 95%, and 92%, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[33\\]</u>. In another very recent study including 14 SFT patients treated with postoperative radiation therapy, Jia et al. also recommends adjuvant radiotherapy to lower recurrence rate 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[34\\]</u>.\n\n【42】#### 4\\.

This diagnosis is difficult due to challenging radiographic interpretations of multiple imaging modalities. We present a case of a 60-year-old male, who presented to his pulmonologist and underwent a CT chest with IV contrast that initially suggested primary lung carcinoma. CT angiogram showed significant vascular filling defects suspicious of an intravascular mass, rather than vascular invasion by lung lesions. The PET/CT scans further suggested a malignant process, but indistinguishable between an extravascular or intravascular etiology. Taking these results together, they suggested an intravascular malignancy, prompting a tissue biopsy, which ultimately led to a diagnosis of PAIS with metastases. Establishing a definitive diagnosis is essential as treatment and prognosis are different for sarcoma compared to carcinoma. There is no standard treatment to date, and management often includes a multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. PAIS is a rare entity that cannot be diagnosed clinically and needs a multimodality approach for its diagnosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma (PAIS) is a rare tumor with poor prognosis that mimics conditions such as pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm, extravascular tumor invasion, and thromboembolism. Often, there are diagnostic delays as symptoms are nonspecific and diagnostic investigations can be time consuming. PAIS is a rare entity, and our case demonstrates the extensive clinical and radiographical investigations necessary to establish this diagnosis.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 60-year-old African American male presented to his pulmonologist with a one-month history of persistent productive cough. He has been producing clear mucous, without any blood. His cough has been progressively worse throughout the past month. His cough was worse during the day and exacerbated by cold beverages and cold air. The patient denied other symptoms including shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, hemoptysis, subjective fevers, chills, or night sweats. He denied typical symptoms for seasonal allergies and gastroesophageal reflux. The patient has a past medical history of sickle cell trait and atrial fibrillation. His past surgical history is notable for a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy resulting in a 150-pound weight loss five years ago. He has a family history of sickle cell disease, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, without any cancer. He also denied any weight loss, changes in appetite, dysphagia, or odynophagia. He denies any history of tobacco use or other recreational drugs but has a previous history of alcohol use. The patient has no occupational exposure to hazardous material and is a bus operator for the past several years. He denied any recent travel. He lives alone and is functional and independent at home without any need for supplemental oxygen. The patient had experienced a similar cough approximately one year prior with associated fevers, otalgia, and chest congestion. At that time, he was treated with a course of antibiotics resulting in complete resolution of his symptoms.\n\n【6】His vital signs on presentation were within normal limits, and he was saturating well above 95% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appeared comfortable and was in no respiratory distress. He was well developed and well nourished. He was alert and oriented to person, place, time, and events. Cardiovascular exam was unremarkable. Pulmonary exam revealed normal respiratory effort and normal breath sounds, with no stridor, wheezes, rhonchi, or rales. The patient also did not exhibit any palpable cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Laboratory testing, including complete blood count and basic metabolic panel, did not reveal any abnormalities. A chest X-ray , in comparison to one year prior, revealed multiple new lung nodules. A chest CT with contrast demonstrated mediastinal adenopathy and multiple, large, round lung nodules with sharp borders predominantly in the right lung (a 3.3 cm nodule in the medial right upper lobe and two nodules in the right lower lobe, 4.8 cm and 3 cm, respectively) with mass effect on the right pulmonary artery and encasement of the right pulmonary artery, in addition to a left lower lobe nodule (2.2 cm) (Figure 2(a)).\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】Initial chest X-ray showing multiple new pulmonary nodules.\n\n【9】(a)\n\n【10】(b)\n\n【11】(c)\n\n【12】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【14】(a) Initial CT of the chest showing large intravascular mass encasing the right main pulmonary artery.

Tumor markers (alpha fetoprotein, B-HCG/LDH, CEA, and CA 19-9) at this time were all within the normal range. To further evaluate the patency of the pulmonary arteries, a chest CT angiogram was performed, which revealed a soft-tissue density mass in the right pulmonary artery with scattered bilateral lung parenchymal lesions concerning for metastatic pulmonary angiosarcoma with known osseous metastatic lesion involving T3 vertebrae. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the right lower lung mass was nondiagnostic with some atypical spindle cells in a background of necrosis. Given the concern for spinal cord compression, an MRI of the thoracic spine was performed which revealed enhancing lesions at the T3 posterior elements with epidural involvement and compression, as well as posterior T4 vertebral body. MRI of the cervical spine was without evidence of disease. Ultimately, the patient underwent a T3 laminectomy with a T2 and T4 partial laminectomy and a posterior thoracic spine fusion of T2-T5 with screws, rods, and allograft along with resection of a spinal epidural mass. Pathologic review of the biopsied epidural mass revealed an intimal sarcoma, with epithelioid and pleomorphic features, of high grade involving bone. There were 19 mitoses per 10 high-power field. Focal tumor necrosis was present (<50%). Immunohistochemistry noted rare scattered tumor cells positive for SMA, CMA , and AE , but was negative for S100, CK 7, HMB45, CK19, CK , EMA, CD31, and CD34. GMS and AFB special stains were negative for microorganisms. Additional immunostaining performed showed that the tumor cells were positive for SMA and desmin and negative for STAT-6 and SAT2B. BCL-1 stain revealed nuclear reactivity and few scattered tumor cells. INI-1 was retained. FISH was performed and demonstrated amplification of MDM2. Furthermore, CT abdomen/pelvis was negative for any metastatic disease. The patient was discharged home with pain control and instructions to follow-up outpatient with pulmonology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and neurosurgery.\n\n【16】#### 3\\. Follow-Up\n\n【17】The patient completed ten cycles of palliative radiation therapy to the T2-T5 region for a total dose of 3000 cGy. Following completion, he developed pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. He presented to a different hospital and underwent CT chest angiogram and was diagnosed with large right proximal pulmonary embolism and he was started on apixaban. He subsequently reported several episodes of blood-streaked sputum after initiation of anticoagulation. PET/CT was performed showcasing extensive hypermetabolic pulmonary nodules/masses, right much greater than left, and hypermetabolic poorly characterized right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy along with concern for right pulmonary artery invasion. The patient was followed up with medical oncology and was recommended palliative chemotherapy with doxorubicin for his diagnosis of intimal sarcoma. His transthoracic echo demonstrated a normal ejection fracture of 60–65%. His treatment course was complicated by nausea, vomiting, oral mucositis, fatigue, weight loss, and insomnia. Additionally, he developed anemia and neutropenia requiring pegfilgrastim. He later developed fever and was treated with antibiotics for pneumonia. The patient completed six cycles of doxorubicin therapy. Posttreatment CT with contrast demonstrated reduction in size of pulmonary metastases and stable-appearing nonocclusive thrombus within the right main pulmonary artery (Figure 2(b)). Repeat molecular testing revealed CDK4 amplification, and he is currently receiving palbociclib. He was later admitted for shortness of breath and was newly diagnosed with systolic heart failure, likely due to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. He received three cycles of palbociclib. Repeat CT chest with contrast showed stable disease (Figure 2(c)).\n\n【18】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【19】In this case, the patient presented with vague symptoms of cough, dyspnea, and weight loss. Initial imaging modalities, including chest X-ray and CT chest with contrast, were concerning for extravascular tumor compression from primary lung carcinoma. CT angiogram revealed a filling defect suspicious of an intravascular mass, rather than extravascular tumor invasion. PET/CT scan identified pulmonary artery involvement but was unable to differentiate between intravascular or extravascular etiologies. To arrive at the final diagnosis of PAIS with metastases, several different imaging modalities, in addition to a tissue biopsy, were employed.\n\n【20】A multimodal approach, utilizing several imaging modalities to visualize the thorax and vasculatures via CT, PET/CT, and MRI, is the best way to rapidly diagnose PAIS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1,2\\]</u>. The diagnostic challenge lies in the complexity of distinguishing: 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> whether the mass is intravascular versus extravascular, 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> whether this mass is malignant or benign, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> if the mass is intravascular, whether it is a tumor thrombus, tumor mass, or pseudoaneurysm. Other reported cases suggest that the diagnostic process is often convoluted with difficulties in establishing a diagnosis and subsequent delay in initiating appropriate therapy. To differentiate an intravascular mass from extravascular mass, a CT angiogram would be necessary to directly visualize the pulmonary vasculatures compared to a CT chest with contrast. On CT chest, PAIS is characterized by multiple pulmonary nodules and hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, in comparison to pulmonary thromboembolisms, which often have associated wedge-shaped infarcts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. The “wall eclipsing sign,” where the tumor eclipses one or both walls of the main pulmonary artery or its branches, is pathognomonic for PAIS on CT angiography 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. In contrast, pulmonary thromboembolism is in the shape of a saddle 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Furthermore, high uptake on PET would suggest a malignancy, whereas low uptake would suggest a nonmalignant etiology such as pulmonary thomboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>. Prior case reports utilized and integrated the findings of all three modalities in order to rapidly diagnose PAIS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>. Cardiac MRI can be utilized to discern neoplastic from thrombotic components by allowing proper visualization of the vasculature and tissue edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. In addition, PAIS demonstrates diffusion restriction and heterogeneous enhancement, in comparison to pulmonary thromboembolism 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Tissue biopsy by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration followed by immunohistochemistry remains gold standard for diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. In this case, the endobronchial biopsy was unrevealing, but a biopsy of the metastatic mass confirmed the diagnosis. Establishing a definitive diagnosis is essential as treatment and prognosis vary drastically for PAIS, pulmonary thromboembolism, and other mimics such as lung carcinoma. It is interesting as this patient was diagnosed with both PAIS and later pulmonary embolism.\n\n【22】There is no standard treatment to date, and management often includes a multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Surgery is considered first-line treatment in order to relieve pulmonary artery obstruction and associated pulmonary hypertension and to palliate symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Surgical intervention is dependent on the location on the extension of the mass and can include pulmonary endarterectomy, pneumonectomy, or a lobectomy. Additionally, surgery is noncurative as it is difficult to achieve clear margins; therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation are utilized, in addition to surgery, to achieve better disease control 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. For systemic therapy, anthracyclines are most commonly used along with taxanes, ifosfamide, platinum, and gemcitabine 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Despite the above treatment options, prognosis remains poor due to the difficulty in achieving complete disease control. In the metastatic setting, chemotherapy and radiation therapy should be considered prior to any surgical intervention 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In the presented case, given the high-grade nature of PAIS with pulmonary and bone metastasis, palliative chemotherapy with doxorubicin was considered. After six cycles of doxorubicin, the patient had a partial response to his disease; hence, palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) was considered. Among several other alterations, CDK4 amplification was found to be prominent in intimal sarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. The role of palbociclib treatment of intimal sarcomas with CDK4 amplification is still under investigation and remains unclear.\n\n【23】#### 5\\. Conclusion\n\n【24】PAIS is a rare entity often resembling lung carcinoma or pulmonary thromboembolism as a result of nonspecific symptomatology and analogous imaging findings, thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment. There is no standard of treatment for PAIS and its treatment often involves a multidisciplinary approach, with anthracyclines as the main systemic agent.\n\n【25】#### Data Availability\n\n【26】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【27】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【28】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The diagnosis requires a set of clinical criteria of thrombosis along with persistently positive anti-phospholipid antibody tests. In this report, we are presenting a case of APS, who is a 38-year-old male, presented with complains of seizures and found to have stroke, which on further investigation revealed to have been caused possibly from a left atrial mass. Therefore, high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis of APS in young patients, who present with various neurological and cardiovascular manifestations, mostly secondary to thrombosis.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Antiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder, which may present in various ways from cutaneous manifestation, obstetric complications, and neurological and cardiac manifestation to renal involvement. There are many cardiac complications of antiphospholipid syndrome, among them are valvular dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infarction, intracardiac thrombi, and ventricular dysfunction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. These morbidities occur with the presence of anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL), which are usually detected as cardiolipin or β<sub>2</sub>\\-glycoprotein I (β<sub>2</sub>\\-GPI) antibodies or as lupus anticoagulants 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Here, we describe an unusual case of APS, who presented with an episode of seizure and found to have stroke in the brain, which on further workup as part of “stroke in young” has revealed an atrial mass on echocardiography.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Description\n\n【6】A 38-year-old man, with no significant past medical illness, was brought to the emergency department initially, after he sustained an episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. On further questioning after being recovered from seizure, he complained of suffering from generalized headache for a duration of 10 days prior to the presentation. He denied having any weakness or numbness and denied any complains of speech or swallowing difficulties. On arrival, he was hypertensive up to 170/101 mm Hg and was hemodynamically stable otherwise. Neurological examination did not reveal any cranial nerve or cerebellar deficits and had no focal deficits, with normal symmetrical reflexes overall. Other system examinations were within normal limits.\n\n【7】On further investigation, initial CT brain was done, which did not reveal any abnormalities, and so he was admitted to the neurology critical care unit for further management. As a workup for seizure, MRI brain was performed, which revealed a right cerebellar small acute ischemic infarct . Subsequently, an MR angiography of the brain and neck was performed, which revealed filling defects causing focal narrowing in the origin of the internal carotid artery bilaterally. Routine brain EEG did not reveal any seizure activities.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】Axial view of MRI brain showing the right cerebellar infarct.\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【11】Coronal view of MRI brain showing the right cerebellar infarct.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【13】Coronal view of MRI brain showing the right cerebellar infarct.\n\n【14】Upon admission to the neurology unit, he was started on aspirin and atorvastatin for treatment of stroke. Carbamazepine was introduced in view of seizure due to focal organic cause. He was worked up thoroughly for his stroke considering his young age with complete collagen vascular disease and thrombophilia workup. He was initially found to have thrombocytopenia as low as 50,000 platelets per microliter. A transthoracic echocardiography revealed a pedunculated and lobular left atrial mass , which was measuring around 1 × 1.5 cm and was freely mobile across the mitral valve, oscillating across the left ventricular inflow. This finding was subsequently confirmed by a transesophageal echocardiography, with differential diagnosis of atrial myxoma at the top of the list. Cardiothoracic surgery opinion was sought and was planned for surgical removal of the atrial mass. Prior to transferring the patient to the surgical care center, his thrombophilia workup revealed to be positive for antibodies of antiphospholipid syndrome. Cardiolipin antibody immunoglobin G was positive in high titer >120 units/mL, and B<sub>2</sub> glycoprotein IgG level was 90 units/mL. Lupus anticoagulant 1 (LA1) screen was positive for 109.30 seconds, aPTT LA was 153.8 seconds, hexagonal phase neutralizing timing was 25 seconds, LA1 mixing time was 88 seconds, and lupus anticoagulant 2 (LA2) confirmation timing was 38.46 seconds, giving a LA1/LA2 ratio of 2.84. Based on these findings, it was confirmed that dRVVT screen and aPTT are prolonged. The dRVVT mixing study was prolonged, consistent with an inhibitor effect. Hexagonal phase and dRVVT ratio were both significantly elevated, consistent with phospholipid dependence. Overall, the findings are consistent with a strong lupus anticoagulant. Lupus anticoagulants may be transient. According to the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis, if positive testing is observed on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, this may be indicative of an anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, if observed in the right clinical setting. Based on this recommendation, it was decided to repeat the testing after 12 weeks. Apart from these findings, the anti-nuclear antibody results came negative, with normal ESR and CRP levels.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【16】Echo view showing the left atrial mass with color Doppler.\n\n【17】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n【18】Echo view showing pedunculated left atrial mass.\n\n【19】An opinion was sought from the rheumatology department, and finally the diagnosis of APS was confirmed. It was decided to start the patient on anticoagulation treatment but was delayed until the patient went for the surgery. However, on the days prior to the scheduled surgery date, he was kept on low molecular weight heparin at treatment dose and then was suspended on the operative day. The patient underwent successful surgical removal of the mass, which looked like a thrombotic clot rather than a tumor mass. Histopathological analysis confirmed that the mass is made up of a fibrinous clot, with no evidence of any tumor cells . He was started on full anticoagulation treatment with warfarin and was followed up regularly in the clinic, where he did not have any further complications from the disease. Shortly after the treatment and follow-up for 2 months, the patient repatriated back to his home country and to continue treatment there. So, it was not possible to repeat the LA and aPL studies after 12 weeks as recommended as he lost follow-up with us.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 </u>\n\n【21】Gross specimen of the clot after the surgery.\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 </u>\n\n【23】Intraoperative view, removal of the clot.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】Antiphospholipid syndrome is defined according to the clinical and laboratory criteria established by the updated international consensus (Sydney) classification (ICS) for definitive diagnosis, which requires a history of vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy morbidity, associated with the persistent presence of lupus anticoagulants and/or anti-cardiolipin antibodies of the immunoglobulin G and/or immunoglobulin M isotype, positive in medium or high titers (i.e. >40 GPL or MPL or >99<sup>th</sup> percentile), and/or anti-β<sub>2</sub>\\-glycoprotein-1 (a-β<sub>2</sub>\\-GPI) (IgG and/or IgM) > 99<sup>th</sup> percentile in the blood. These aPL should be persistent, defined as being present on two or more consecutive occasions at least 12 weeks apart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. APS usually is classified as primary and secondary, respectively, according to the absence or presence of an underlying disease as well as other autoimmune, malignancy, or drug-induced disorders. In both instances, every organ can be involved by thrombotic events. In a recent study of a cohort of 1000 patients affected by primary and secondary APS, cardiac involvement was observed in 27% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, mostly characterized by valvular and coronary artery disease. The most frequent echocardiographic findings are either valve vegetations or leaflet thickening. The literature reports only a few cases of intracardiac thrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> associated with primary APS, observed in all cardiac chambers, provoking either pulmonary or systemic embolism.\n\n【26】The major target of anti-phospholipid antibodies is β<sub>2</sub>\\-glycoprotein I (β<sub>2</sub>\\-GPI) in APS. Stroke and transient ischemic attack are the most common arterial events in patients with APS. The major nonthrombotic manifestations of anti-phospholipid antibody positivity include valvular heart disease, livedo reticularis, anti-phospholipid antibody-related nephropathy, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and cognitive dysfunction.\n\n【27】Our patient was diagnosed to have APS based on the features of high positive anti-cardiolipin antibody IgG and B2 glycoprotein IgG, stroke, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal echocardiography findings. So far, only few cases of APS-associated right atrial thrombosis have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5–7\\]</u>. In our patient, it was difficult to distinguish between the left atrial myxoma as the primary tumor of the heart and cardiac thrombosis based on preoperative echocardiographic and angiographic findings. It was decided to go for surgical resection of the cardiac mass over any further imaging investigations, as it would help reaching the definitive diagnosis of the cardiac mass based on histopathology faster than investigating through other imaging modalities. This decision was considered clearly based on the severely affected mitral valve status, the size and mobility of the intracardiac mass, and also based on the suspicion of embolic stroke in the patient although the stroke could be due to the primary APS itself as the mass turned out to be a thrombotic clot rather than an atrial myxoma. Other cardiac manifestations of the APS include aseptic valve lesions, particularly of the tricuspid and aortic valves, coronary artery disease, and ventricular dysfunction because of the myocardial microthrombosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【28】In our patient, long-term anticoagulation was started with vitamin K antagonist (VKA) as it is a standard treatment for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis in definitive APS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Taking this into context, using VKA for some patients with APS could be difficult as the INR values may fluctuate based on the strong LA, depending on the prothrombin time reagent being used for the test. However, after fully explaining the risks and benefits to the patient, it was decided to start VKA treatment as per the patient and physician’s preference. It is true that there is no requirement for monitoring the anticoagulation effects routinely for the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), like factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban/apixaban) or the thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran), but, however, the recent case reports on patients with APS experiencing recurrent thromboembolic events while on therapy with DOACs have questioned their usefulness as safe and efficacious alternatives in this highly prothrombotic disorder 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. Further studies would be required to assess the eligibility and safety of using DOACs in patients with definitive antiphospholipid syndrome.\n\n【29】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【30】APS can present with neurological and cardiac manifestations, and therefore high index of suspicion is necessary for diagnosis of the disease in young patients with thrombosis as it can affect both short- and long-term treatment plan and prognosis. Therefore, in patients presenting with neurological symptoms like seizures, weakness, and radiological diagnosis of stroke in a young patient, where atrial masses could be thought to be the cause of stroke, they should be screened for any concomitant findings of thrombocytopenia and/or aPTT prolongation which should raise the suspicion of thrombotic vasculopathy, specifically APS, to be the primary cause of the clinical presentation.\n\n【31】#### Abbreviations\n\n| APS: | Anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome |\n| --- | --- |\n| aPL: | Anti-phospholipid antibodies |\n| β2\\-GPI: | β2\\-Glycoprotein I |\n| CT: | Computed tomography |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| EEG: | Electroencephalogram |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| CRP: | C-reactive protein |\n| aPTT: | Activated partial thromboplastin time |\n| VKA: | Vitamin K antagonist |\n| DOAC: | Direct oral anticoagulant |\n| LA: | Lupus anticoagulant |\n| dRVVT: | Dilute Russell’s viper venom test. |\n\n【33】#### Data Availability\n\n【34】The radiographical imaging and laboratory data were collected from electronic medical records and were used to support the findings of this study for publication of this individual case report.\n\n【35】#### Consent\n\n【36】Written informed consent has been taken from the patient to publish this case report.\n\n【37】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【38】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

They have widespread environmental distribution and have been isolated from water, soil, and plants as well as from some hospital devices such as intravenous catheters and water contained in humidifier reservoirs used in respiratory treatment. The genus Comamonas originally contained the following species: acidovorans, testosteroni, kerstersii, terrigena, denitrificans, and nitrativorans. It now contains 17 species, while acidovorans spp. have been reclassified as Delftia acidovorans. In spite of its uncommon human pathogenesis, there are few reports on the aggressive manner of it as an opportunistic pathogen, mostly related to testosteroni spp. We present a case of polymicrobial bacteremia involving Comamonas testosteroni. The aim of this case report is to alert clinicians to the potential diagnosis of bloodstream infections caused by uncommon pathogens.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Comamonas testosteroni, formerly known as Pseudomonas testosteroni, is an aerobic, motile, nonspore forming, ubiquitous Gram-negative organism. Although it has low virulence potency, there are few reports on its involvement in human infections. It became clinically important after 1987, when reports began accumulating on human infections such as cellulitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>, peritonitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, endocarditis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>, meningitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, endophthalmitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>, tenosynovitis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, and pneumonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, cases of bloodstream infections caused by Comamonas testosteroni have been infrequently reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 8–12\\]</u>. The name of testosteroni was given due to its characteristic of utilizing carbon from the metabolism of testosterone 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, although this property has also been demonstrated by some Pseudomonas spp. and fungi 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Some strains of Comamonas testosteroni have acquired the plasmid-mediated blaNDM1, gene that confers broad spectrum antimicrobial resistance thus potentially hampering treatment options in the event where this bacterium causes human infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. In this report, we present an uncommon case of polymicrobial bacteremia involving Comamonas testosteroni with a detailed review of the literature.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】An 80-year-old African American female, morbidly obese, was brought to emergency department complaining of generalized body aches (predominantly in shoulders) and nondocumented fevers at home for about 1 week. Her past medical history was significant for systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hiatal hernia, osteoarthritis, and cholelithiasis (s/p cholecystectomy). On arrival to the hospital, her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure of 150/77 mmHg, a regular heart rate of a 106 beats/minute, a respiratory rate of 21 breaths/minute, a temperature of a 100.8°F, and an oxygen saturation of 96% breathing ambient air.\n\n【6】Remarkable laboratory findings on admission were a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14, 500/mm<sup>3</sup> (4.8–10.8), a sodium level of 129 mmol/L 通用删除7(英):<u>(135–147)</u>, a potassium level of 5.5 mmol/L (3.5–5.3), and a creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL (0.8–2.0). C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrosedimentation rate (ESR) levels were both elevated at 152.7 mg/L (1.0–4.0) and 130 mm/h 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–20)</u>, respectively. Her urine analysis showed positive leukoesterase and a WBC count of 10–15/hpf 通用删除7(英):<u>(0–5)</u>. Coagulation and liver profiles were within normal limits. Bilateral shoulder X-ray demonstrated degenerative changes, with a right rotator cuff tendinitis but no fractures. Chest radiography revealed no infiltrates.\n\n【7】She was admitted to the medicine ward with the presumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), and empiric antimicrobial therapy was initiated with ceftriaxone 2 grams intravenously daily. Blood cultures drawn on admission grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and antimicrobial therapy was stream lined to nafcillin 2 grams intravenously every 4 hours. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed no vegetations. On day 3 of admission, her hospital course was complicated by worsening leukocytosis and a transient episode of hypotension which responded to intravenous fluids therapy. At that time, a new set of blood cultures was obtained from which Comamonas testosteroni was isolated (sensitive to ceftazidime, carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Antimicrobial therapy was then escalated to cefazolin 1 gram intravenously every 8 hours plus doripenem 250 mg intravenously every 8 hours. Abdomen, pelvis, and chest computed tomography (CT) were obtained, demonstrating the presence of diverticulosis but no abscess formation or mass. Repeated blood cultures were negative, and the patient was discharged home to complete a total of 4-week course of intravenous antimicrobial therapy.\n\n【8】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【9】This is one of fewer than 15 cases of Comamonas testosteroni bacteremia reported in the literature and the first reported case of Comamonas testosteroni and Staphylococcus aureus polymicrobial bloodstream infection, according to a MEDLINE search using the words “Comamonas” and “bacteremia” and “bloodstream infection.” Approximately 35 cases of infections involving Comamonas testosteroni have been reported in the medical literature. Majority of infections are community-acquired rather than nosocomial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5\\]</u>, and most of the patients reported had some degree of immunosuppression such as malignancy, chronic liver disease, and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 11, 12\\]</u>. Bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of infections caused by Comamonas spp. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 16\\]</u>.\n\n【10】Based on results from previous reports, majority of the 14 reported patients with bacteremia caused by Comamonas testosteroni were males, their median age was 47 years (range, newborn–89), only one patient died, and predisposing factors for infection were not identified in two of them. Most of the patients responded well to appropriate antimicrobial therapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Comamonas spp. isolates are usually susceptible to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, cephalosporins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【11】The patient discussed in this report did not have any obvious source of infection. She did not have central venous catheters, and the abdominal imaging did not evidence any acute inflammatory process or mass. Her immunosuppressive state was limited to diabetes mellitus, which might have played a role as a possible predisposing factor. Therefore, the authors hypothesized that the most likely source might have been the right shoulder rotator cuff tendinitis. Although this hypothesis cannot be proven, it is supported by the fact that the patient reported shoulder pain, the CRP and ESR levels were markedly elevated, and the right shoulder imaging showed rotator cuff tendinitis. In 2000, Isotalo et al. reported a case of polymicrobial tenosynovitis, involving an organism most likely to be related to Comamonas spp. based on biochemical factors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. If proven, our patient may have been only the second case of tenosynovitis caused by Comamonas spp. reported in the literature. We also postulate that the second likely mode of bacteremia in this case could have been dissemination of Comamonas testosteroni from the bowel following gastrointestinal translocation, given the finding of extensive diverticulosis demonstrated in the abdominal imaging.\n\n【12】Polymicrobial bacteremia involving Comamonas testosteroni have been reported in association with Streptococcus parasanguis and Ralstonia pickettii 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Two other cases of polymicrobial bacteremia involving Comamonas spp. (Delftia acidovorans (formerly known as Comamonas acidovorans) and Comamonas kerstersii) were previously reported in association with Streptococcus agalactiae and Bacteroides fragilis, respectively 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. To our knowledge, this is the first case of bloodstream infection involving Comamonas testosteroni and Staphylococcus aureus.\n\n【13】In this report, we have highlighted an unusual cause of bloodstream infection. Comamonas spp. should be kept in mind as a rare cause of bacteremia.\n\n【14】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【15】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors report no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

SRGC cells are characterized by abundant intracytoplasmic mucins, ample and clear cytoplasm, and eccentrically located nuclei compressed by intracytoplasmic mucins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. The clinicopathological characteristics of SRGC are known to differ from other types of gastric cancer. Some reports have suggested a higher rate of formation of multiple gastric cancers if the primary lesion is SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【4】In general, SRGC is believed to behave more aggressively and have a worse prognosis than other forms of gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>; however, recent studies from Asia have demonstrated that when adjusted for stage, this might not be the case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Early SRGC does not demonstrate more frequent lymph node (LN) metastases than other types of gastric cancer; improved survival has been reported for early stages of SRGC compared with other types of gastric cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, but relatively worse survival in later stages of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Once early SRGC evolves into advanced gastric cancer, the diffusely infiltrating characteristics of SRGC may involve the entire stomach, resulting in what is known as linitis plastica, which is associated with a poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thus, the idea that signet ring cell histology conveys a worse prognosis might not always be correct.\n\n【5】Here, we report a rare case of SRGC in a male patient whose flat pale mucosal lesion was endoscopically unchanged 15 months after the initial endoscopic examination, when he was diagnosed with intramucosal SRGC.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【7】A 58-year-old man who had suffered from appetite loss underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) during a medical check-up in October 2011. A flat, pale, mucosal lesion (5 mm in diameter; Figure 1(a)) on the posterior wall of the distal gastric body was observed. Chromoendoscopy with indigo-carmine dye added to acetic acid did not show any staining indicating gastric neoplasia, so we planned to repeat EGD 1 year later. The herbal medicine rikkunshito was administered for 4 weeks, and the patient’s appetite gradually improved. The next EGD to which the patient consented, taken in January 2013, revealed the flat, pale, mucosal lesion to be the same size as it had been in October 2011 (Figure 1(b)); it was not enhanced by indigo-carmine dye staining added to acetic acid (Figure 1(c)). Additionally, image-enhanced EGD using the narrow-band light method did not reveal any findings of significance (data not shown). At this time, we took a biopsy to pathologically diagnose and characterize this gastric lesion, which allowed diagnosis of SRGC (Figure 1(d)). The endoscopic diagnosis was Type 0-IIb in accordance with the Japanese Classification of Gastric Carcinoma (JCGC) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>, which is a manual that describes the classification of cancer according to its stage and histology, classifies its curability via surgery and the extent of lymphadenectomy, and evaluates responses to chemotherapy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Computed tomography (CT) showed fluffing surrounding the gastric body and no distinct regional LN or distant metastases . The fluffing indicated inflammatory changes suspected to be serosal invasion from the gastric tumor. Laboratory results were within normal limits and the serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was normal. We diagnosed this lesion as clinical(c) T1(M), cN0, cM0, and cStage IA according to the JCGC. The CT finding of inflammatory changes surrounding the gastric body suggested a risk of serosal invasion, so laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy was performed rather than endoscopic resection. The regional lymph nodes (LN stations 1, 3, 4d, 5, 6, 7, 8a, 9, and 12a) were resected. The surgical specimen revealed signet ring cells alone, limited to the mucosa without lymphovascular involvement or ulcerative findings (Figures 3(a)\\-3(b)). The lesion was 5 mm in diameter, and the resection margin was free of tumor cells. Portions of the resected regional LNs did not include metastatic cancer cells. Thus, this lesion was diagnosed as pathological (p)T1(M), ly0, v0, pN0, pM0, R0, and pStage IA according to the JCGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In addition, immunohistochemical analysis showed that tumor cells were negative for both Ki-67 (Figure 4(a)) and p53 (Figure 4(b)). Eleven months after surgery, the patient was in good condition and disease-free without any signs of tumor recurrence based on the latest follow-up EGD and CT examinations.\n\n【8】(a)\n\n【9】(b)\n\n【10】(c)\n\n【11】(d)\n\n【12】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【14】Endoscopic examination before treatment.

Discussion\n\n【28】Early SRGC tends to be superficial and large, so it is usually diagnosed earlier than gastric cancer of other histological types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. At the first endoscopy (October 2011), we could detect a small, flat, pale mucosa in the stomach. Chromoendoscopy with indigo-carmine dye added to acetic acid improves the detection rates of early gastric cancer and precancerous lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. In this case, indigo-carmine dye added to acetic acid staining did not show any signs indicating gastric neoplasia, so we did not take any biopsies in the initial EGD. Therefore, it is unknown whether signet ring cells had been histologically localized in this gastric lesion in the initial EGD. The next endoscopic images taken in January 2013 showed that the lesion was unaltered in size and shape; satellite lesions were not seen, and biopsy was carried out at this time. Unexpectedly, the biopsy revealed SRGC histology. It is unknown whether SRGC usually arises from a preexisting precancerous lesion or as a so-called de novo carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Conventional endoscopy and chromoendoscopy did not show any alterations in size or shape of this gastric lesion for 15 months between the first and second examinations, and this tumor showed only signet ring cells without accompanying adenoma or other types of cancer cells. Thus, there was a low possibility that a preexistent precancerous lesion had turned into SRGC in the intramucosal layer between the first and second examinations; therefore, it is likely that signet ring cells might have been localized in this gastric lesion in the initial EGD.\n\n【29】In general, Ki-67 and p53 are highly expressed in SRGC cells 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. Ki-67 is an antigen that corresponds to a nuclear nonhistone protein expressed by cells in the proliferative phases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Ki-67 labeling is relatively low in normal gastric epithelium (<15%), while Ki-67 labeling of primary SRGC is high 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. p53 is a nuclear protein thought to be involved in the control of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and maintenance of genomic stability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. The immunohistochemical demonstration of p53 highly suggests a p53 gene mutation and malignant potential of tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. While normal epithelium never expresses p53, p53 is highly expressed in SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>. The expression levels of Ki-67 and p53 in early SRGCs are still unknown. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed Ki-67 and p53 mutations to be negative in this case, which might be the reason why it had not progressed to advanced gastric cancer for 15 months.\n\n【30】Recently, endoscopic submucosal dissection has been carefully applied in early SRGCs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, there are no specific guidelines for the endoscopic treatment of SRGCs. The differences in outcomes between early- and late-stage SRGC described above could reflect the aggressive resection strategies. Furthermore, it must be emphasized that forming satellite lesions is another characteristic of SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, for which extending endoscopic resection criteria is inappropriate. On the other hand, because there have been some reports that early SRGC carries a lower rate of LN metastasis, which is specifically related to recurrence of gastric cancer including SRGC, and better prognosis compared with advanced SRGC 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, it is possible that endoscopic resection can be performed on patients with small SRGC limited to the mucosa and with no LN metastasis or satellite lesions. CT indicated that there was a risk of serosal invasion of the gastric body, so we judged that laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, rather than endoscopic resection, was the most suitable treatment option to resect this gastric tumor completely. If serosal invasion had not been suspected, it might have been appropriate to treat this case with endoscopic resection such as endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection. The surveillance of LN metastasis in addition to other organs and the residual stomach for primary SRGC is particularly important after endoscopic resection or surgery. Moreover, both endoscopic follow-up and biopsy are necessary to find SRGCs at early stages before diffuse infiltration can occur.\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</u>\n\n【33】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【34】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors thank Shunichi Manabe for his excellent technical assistance.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

In this report, we present a case of a 46-year-old patient with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) who avoided insulin treatment due to associated peripheral edema. Though rare, this phenomenon is typically seen in patients with elevated glucose levels who are initiated on insulin treatment, resulting in rapid correction and tight control of glucose levels. The diagnosis of insulin-induced edema is made after other causes of acute edema are ruled out. Furthermore, in this case report, we will also discuss the postulated mechanisms for the edema-causing property of insulin.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Insulin edema syndrome is a rare complication of insulin therapy. Edema resulting from initiation of insulin therapy or intensification of glycemic control is an under-recognized complication 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. This phenomenon has typically been described in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus during the initiation of insulin treatment, with rapid correction and tight control of glucose levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. However, the rarity and lack of awareness of this phenomenon creates challenges in establishing the prevalence, making an accurate diagnosis, and creating guidelines for treatment. We report a case of insulin edema during rapid correction and strict glucose control in a diabetic patient with poorly controlled glucose levels and elevated hemoglobin A1c level, with the goal of highlighting this complication, exploring the etiology and pathophysiology of insulin-related edema, and acknowledging it as a potential reason why patients decline insulin therapy.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 46-year-old man with a medical history significant for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), recurrent pancreatitis, alcohol use disorder, and hypertension presented with severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. His abdominal symptoms occurred intermittently for approximately three weeks prior to admission, during which time he had stopped using his insulin pump with continuous glucose monitoring after his device broke over two months ago. Ten days before his current admission, he was admitted to the hospital for diabetic ketoacidosis during which time he was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin and discharged on insulin detemir 8 units twice daily, insulin lispro 8 units 3 times daily with meals, calcium carbonate 750 mg every 6 hours, pancrelipase 12,000-unit capsule 3 times daily, sucralfate 10 ml four times daily, and trazodone 50 mg tablet nightly. He reported stopping the use of his insulin because he believed it was causing bilateral pedal edema to the level of his knees. He noted consistent patterns of developing edema in his lower extremities a few days after insulin administration. The patient stated that the swelling in his legs resolved after cessation of insulin use. During his hospital admission, the patient refused diabetes education and insisted on the side effect of insulin as a reason for non-compliance with treatment routine.\n\n【6】Social history was remarkable for 60 pack-year tobacco use, daily marijuana use, and no other illicit drug use. Review of systems was remarkable for recent weight loss due to poor diet, chronic smoker's cough, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, and lower extremity bilateral pedal edema present on days of insulin use that resolves when the patient does not use his insulin. He also reported having chronic diabetic neuropathy and numbness in his feet bilaterally.\n\n【7】Physical examination was notable for temperature of 98.2 degrees Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 151/76, heart rate of 88, respiratory rate of 20, and oxygen saturation of 98 percent on room air. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal rate and regular rhythm, there was no elevated jugular venous pressure, and lung sounds were with no rales. He had generalized abdominal tenderness on palpation without guarding, rebound tenderness, or distension. There was bilateral pedal pitting 4+ edema up to his knees .\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】Bilateral pedal edema to the level of the knees secondary to insulin therapy (photograph was taken with patient’s permission).\n\n【10】Laboratory results were consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): anion gap of 23, bicarbonate of 11 mmol/L, sodium of 130 mmol/L, chloride of 93 mmol/L, creatinine of 0.41 mg/dL, glucose of 374 mg/dL, total protein of 5.4 g/dL, albumin of 3.4 g/dL, and positive beta hydroxybutyrate of 2.74, and urinalysis showed 1+ ketones and 3+ glucose and was negative for proteinuria. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was remarkable for scattered calcification along the atrophic pancreas suggesting chronic pancreatitis and normal liver texture. Lower extremity venous Doppler was not done due to lack of recent immobility, negative Homans’ sign, bilaterality, and low clinical suspicion for deep venous thrombosis. Transthoracic echo was unremarkable without any ventricular systolic or diastolic dysfunction.\n\n【11】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【12】Insulin edema syndrome is an adverse effect of insulin therapy ensuing from the rigorous correction of hyperglycemia in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In addition to poor glycemic control, having a low body mass index increases the risk of developing insulin edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. It is also seen in younger patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes mellitus. The edema is generally mild, affecting the lower extremities. However, there have been reports of severe presentations causing anasarca, ascites, and pleural effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【13】The cause of our patient’s insulin-dependent diabetes was believed to be secondary to his history of recurrent pancreatitis in the setting of alcohol abuse, also known as pancreatogenic diabetes or Type 3c 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Insulin edema may have variable presentations, from benign to frank heart or renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【14】The edema has been postulated to result from several mechanisms, including increasing capillary permeability and renal salt retention, thus inducing extravasation of fluid, resulting in edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Insulin is known to cause the reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys by stimulating the Na<sup>+</sup>/K+-ATPase as well as expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 3 in the proximal tubule, and it also causes vasodilation, which contributes to fluid retention. Hyperglycemia independently also causes an increase in vascular permeability, which is consistent with the development of edema in patients that have persistently elevated glucose levels 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Persistently elevated glucose levels in diabetic patients cause poor integrity of the vascular membrane, which increases the risk of edema as a result of rapid serum osmolar changes. This proposed mechanism is supported by the phenomenon of “refeeding edema.” Refeeding edema occurs with an increase in endogenous plasma insulin associated with carbohydrate ingestion after prolonged starvation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【15】There are different approaches to treating insulin edema, ranging from conservative management with restriction of salt and liquid intake to pharmacotherapy with diuretics, epinephrine, or ephedrine in refractory cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Adjusting the dose of insulin has also been shown to reduce the degree of edema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. As discussed above, the patient in this presentation noticed improvement of the leg swelling with cessation of insulin usage, which unfortunately resulted in his non-compliance and several sequelae of hospital admission as a result of DKA. During his admission, he received 20 mg of furosemide daily with rapid improvement in his symptoms.\n\n【16】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【17】Insulin edema syndrome is a rare complication of insulin therapy. Appropriate patients who present with edema should have this clinical entity as an element in their differential diagnoses. Potential complications involving the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems should be considered. After other cardiac, hepatic, vascular, and nephrotic causes of sudden onset edema have been excluded, it is reasonable to attribute the etiology to this under-recognized phenomenon. Awareness of this condition can give patients reassurance and confidence in their insulin regimen.\n\n【18】#### Data Availability\n\n【19】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【20】#### Disclosure\n\n【21】This study was part of the employment of University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus.\n\n【22】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【23】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Here, we report a new case of a TMTC3\\-related syndrome in a Lebanese family with two affected siblings showing severe psychomotor retardation, intellectual disability, microcephaly, absence of speech, muscular hypotonia, and seizures. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous pathogenic variant c.211 C > T (p.R71C) in the TMTC3 gene in both siblings. A review of the literature on TMTC3\\-related syndrome and its causal mutations is provided.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】The protein O-mannosyl-transferase TMTC3 belongs to a family of four recently discovered ER transmembrane O-mannosyl-transferases, each of which is characterized by the presence of four tetratricopeptide repeats. Recent studies have shown that this protein is involved in the O-mannosylation of cadherins and protocadherins, thereby affecting cellular adhesion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. In addition, there is some evidence to support the role of TMTC3 in modulating the ER stress response 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Recessive mutations in the TMTC3 gene have been reported in thirteen patients to date exhibiting development delay, intellectual disability (ID), seizures, and muscular hypotonia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. Many of these patients show a phenotype which is accompanied by neuronal migration defects expressed as either cobblestone lissencephaly or periventricular hypertopia.\n\n【5】In this study, we report a Lebanese family with TMTC3\\-related syndrome with two siblings showing severe psychomotor delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, absence of speech, muscular hypotonia, generalized seizures, and carrying a homozygous pathogenic variant in the TMTC3 gene. We also provide a review of the literature of patients with causal mutations in this gene.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Materials and Methods\n\n【7】The proband and her sister, from healthy, first-cousin parents, were seen in our clinic in Beirut, Lebanon. They underwent an extensive workup including a thorough clinical evaluation, total body X-rays, echocardiography, karyotype, routine blood tests, and molecular analysis.\n\n【8】##### 2.1. DNA Isolation\n\n【9】Informed consent for genetic analysis was obtained from the family in compliance with national ethics regulation. Genomic DNA for the two sisters and their parents was isolated from blood samples using standard techniques.\n\n【10】##### 2.2. Exome Sequencing\n\n【11】Shotgun libraries were generated from 1 μg of genomic DNA (gDNA). For each sample, gDNA was sheared to 150–200 bp using Covaris E220 instrument (Covaris, Inc.) under the following conditions: 50 μl total volume, 10% duty cycle, 175 as intensity, 200 cycles per burst, and 360 seconds in the frequency sweeping mode.\n\n【12】The rest of the library preparation followed the manufacturer’s instructions as described in the SureSelectXT2 Library Prep Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). In brief, the sheared DNA was end-repaired and A-tailed to generate blunt ends and then ligated to Illumina compatible indexed adaptors; finally, the adaptor-ligated DNA fragments were PCR-enriched. The quality and quantity of each library were assessed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 Assay (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), to confirm a distribution with an average DNA fragment size of approximately 250 to 275 bp. Equal amounts of each indexed whole genome library were pooled to make 1500 ng in 7 μl. The pooled libraries were hybridized to SureSelect Human All-Exon V6 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), following manufacturer’s instructions. Then, the SureSelect-enriched indexed library DNA pool was PCR-amplified. Finally, the amplified captured libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The quality of the library was assessed with the 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA assay (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Captured libraries were sequenced on a single lane on the Illumina HiSeq4000 in a paired-end 150 bp run following the manufacturer’s instructions and using the standard sequencing primer.\n\n【13】##### 2.3. Bioinformatic Analysis\n\n【14】The captured libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq4000 Analyzer following the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, USA). The reads were mapped to human genome reference (hg19) using Burrows–Wheeler Aligner . Single-nucleotide variants and indels were called with GATK 3.8, SAMtools , and Picard . All single-nucleotide variants and indels were filtered via multiple databases. Pathogenic variants were assessed under the protocol issued by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【15】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【16】##### 3.1. Case Report\n\n【17】The proband (Figure 1(a), II.I) was born at term after a normal pregnancy with generalized hypotonia, a head circumference (OFC) of 33 cm (25<sup>th</sup> centile); a weight of 1800 g (3<sup>rd</sup> centile); and a length of 48 cm (35<sup>th</sup> centile). She had a delay in developmental milestones as she sat at age 2 and started to walk at age 3.\n\n【18】(a)\n\n【19】(b)\n\n【20】(c)\n\n【21】(a) (b)   \n(c)\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【23】(a) Pedigree of the affected family. (b) Sanger sequencing electropherograms showing the TMTC3 variant c.211C > T (red box) at a heterozygous state in parents and at a homozygous state in the affected daughters. (c) Photographs of the patients.\n\n【24】At the age of 5 years, her parents started to note episodic crises, mainly nocturnal, consisting of abnormal breathing and generalized stiffening and contraction of the limbs. Different treatment regimens were initiated, until she was more or less stabilized under Depakine and Rivotril.\n\n【25】She presented to the clinic at the age of 14 years (Figure 1(c)). She had severe psychomotor delay which was speechless and could understand simple orders. She was moving continuously, had a tip-toe walk, had stereotypic hand movements, and hit herself from time to time. Her OFC was 50.8 cm (<3<sup>rd</sup> centile), her height was 143 cm (<3<sup>rd</sup> centile), and her weight was 33 kg (<3<sup>rd</sup> centile). Upon examination, she had no dysmorphic facial features. A single palmar crease was noted on the right hand. She showed muscular hypotonia and had no osteotendinous reflexes. She had a delay in puberty as breasts had just started to grow, and she still had an absence of menses. Cardiac and ophthalmological examination, as well as brainstem auditory evoked response, was normal. Brain MRI showed the presence of an Arnold-Chiari type 1 malformation .\n\n【26】Table 1 \n\n【27】Phenotypic and genotypic features of patients reported with TMTC3 mutations.\n\n【28】Her younger sister (Figure 1(a), II.II) was born 7 years later after a normal pregnancy. At birth, OFC was 33.2 cm (25<sup>th</sup> centile); weight was 2410 g (5<sup>th</sup> centile); and length was 47 cm (25<sup>th</sup> centile). According to the parents, she had the same clinical course as of her affected sister. Nocturnal episodes of seizures appeared at age 3.5 years and were controlled by Convulex and Lovipram.\n\n【29】She was seen at the age of 8 years (Figure 1(c)). Her OFC was 49.7 cm (5<sup>th</sup> centile), height was 123 cm (50<sup>th</sup> centile), and weight was 17 kg (<3<sup>rd</sup> centile). She had severe psychomotor delay and displayed autistic behaviour. She was hypotonic, still could not walk alone, and, when helped, had a severe ataxia. However, in her case, she had a divergent strabismus, a hypodontia, a left single palmar crease, and no cardiac abnormalities . MRI was performed but did not reveal any remarkable findings.\n\n【30】For both sisters, results of routine blood analyses and karyotype were all unremarkable.\n\n【31】##### 3.2. Molecular Analysis\n\n【32】Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed the presence of a homozygous pathogenic variant c.211C >T (p.R71C) in the TMTC3 gene in both affected sisters. The parents were both found to be heterozygous for this variant. The presence of this variant was confirmed by Sanger analysis (Figure 2(b)). This variant introduces a missense mutation, which is predicted to be a damaging mutation altering the structure of the protein and its biological role. The variant was not found in the 1000 Genomes Project  or the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project , but it was found in dbSNP (rs758540759) and the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). In the latter, the variant was extremely rare, being detected in only two out of 280532 individuals; both of whom were heterozygous. The CADD score of 32 indicates the variant is within the top 0.1% deleterious variants in the human genome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. SIFT function prediction was damaging, while PolyPhen-2 function prediction was probably damaging. To determine amino acid conservation, human protein sequences were aligned to the other protein sequences from a dispersed set of species using ClustalW 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, highlighting the conservation at the residue affected in the siblings reported here (Figure 2(a)).\n\n【33】(a)\n\n【34】(b)\n\n【35】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【36】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【37】(a) ClustalW alignment of TMTC3 residues showing conservation of the p.71R residue across diverse species.

Discussion\n\n【39】Here, we report a Lebanese family with two siblings affected with severe psychomotor retardation, ID, and muscular hypotonia, with homozygous mutations in the TMTC3 gene. To date, 13 patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in this gene, from six families, have been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>.\n\n【40】A comparison of phenotypes between the patients clearly marks mild-to-moderate ID and the presence of seizures as the common clinical features in all cases . In the patients described here, psychomotor development was severely delayed, as it was in a few cases reported by Jerber et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, in the Pakistani family 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>, no such delay was noted. Speech development has also been reported to range from normal to severe delay. The two siblings reported here had absent speech, with the older sibling still unable to speak at 14 years of age. Truncal hypotonia has also been reported in most patients, as is the case here. Based on the data available so far, we propose a clinical key for TMTC3\\-related disorders. The core phenotype for this disorder includes ID in the presence of generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, or nocturnal seizures. In addition, most patients may also show a combination of additional features, such as psychomotor and/or language delay, muscular hypotonia, autistic behaviour, and brain findings suggestive of neuronal migration defects.\n\n【41】A comparison of all the 11 TMTC3 mutations so far known to be associated with a pathogenic phenotype showed some interesting results . All mutations are located within the exons and are either missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations. Splice site mutations have not so far been observed. We used lollipops, a variant visualization tool 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>, to map these 11 mutations onto the primary structure of the TMTC3 protein . The mutations were found to be located across several regions of the protein. The most severe reported phenotypes, especially with relation to psychomotor and speech delay, were associated with homozygous mutations towards the N\\-terminal part of the protein. Interestingly, the c.211C > T mutation we report in our patients affects the same arginine residue at codon 71 that has been shown to be mutated in one of the previously reported families 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Although the phenotype of the ID and seizures is similar between these patients, the latter family had a milder phenotype, especially in relation to motor and speech development. This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that, in the family reported here, the mutation was present in a homozygous state, while the patients with the milder phenotype carried compound heterozygous mutations, with the second mutation affecting the C-terminal domain.\n\n【42】Table 2 \n\n【43】Comparison of TMTC3 mutations reported in literature.\n\n【44】It is known that glycosylation of cell-surface binding receptors, such as cadherins and alpha-dystroglycan, is important for maintaining the interaction between the glial limitans and the extracellular matrix. Defects in mannosylation of these proteins result in developmental disorders associated with neuronal migration defects 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. In our study, no such migration defects were noted. An Arnold-Chiari type I malformation was visible on the first brain scan, but not in a subsequent scan 10 years later. No other anomalies were noted. This is of interest since all patients reported so far, with the exception of the youngest sibling in the Pakistani family, were reported to have migration defects in the MRI, either in the form of cobblestone lissencephaly or periventricular hypertopia.\n\n【45】With the exception of the one patient from the USA, all others are from the Eastern Mediterranean region. In fact, 6 of the original 13 patients are from the Arab ancestry. Rare recessive disorders tend to appear in populations with a high rate of consanguinity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Apart from the Pakistani family and the American patient, all other patients come from consanguineous families and carry homozygous TMTC3 mutations.\n\n【46】The ease of access to high-throughput molecular technologies such as whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in the clinic has opened new vistas for the molecular diagnoses of patients with rare genetic disorders 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. Particularly for disorders that have not yet been clearly phenotypically delineated, as are many ID disorders, WES offers a straight-forward and reliable diagnostic tool, which in turn will lead to a more comprehensive clinical characterization of such disorders.\n\n【47】#### Data Availability\n\n【48】No data were used to support this study.\n\n【49】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【50】The authors declare no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Introduction\n\n【3】Biliary microhamartomas, also known as bile duct hamartomas and von Meyenburg complexes, develop in hepatobiliary system and do not generally give clinical outcomes. They are detected incidentally in most cases.

Case Report\n\n【5】A 61-year-old, mildly obese woman with short stature was referred with right upper quadrant pain. The history of the patient was unremarkable, and she did not mention any medical or surgical illness. Laboratory examinations revealed hemoglobin (Hb): 13.6 g/dL, white blood cell (WBC): 7,100/mm³, serum albumin: 3.7 g/dL (N: 3.8–5.1 g/dL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT): 24 U/L (N: 0–31 U/L), alkaline phosphatase: 202 U/L (N: 0–240 U/L), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT): 24 U/L (N: 0–38 U/L). The patient was informed about the imaging procedures, and consent was obtained from her. All the procedures were performed according to the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. Initially, we performed abdominal ultrasonography (US), but we were unable to demonstrate any prominent lesion in liver .\n\n【6】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Ultrasonographic image of liver (L).

MRCP depicted an abundant number of hyperintense small lesions allover the liver which showed no association with the biliary system.

Discussion\n\n【21】Biliary microhamartomas are tumor-like lesions of the liver 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Histologically, they are clusters of proliferated bile ducts lined by single layer of cuboidal cells embedded in fibrocollagenous tissue, and their size varies between 0.1 and 10 mm, but lesions measuring 1.5 cm in diameter can be demonstrated, as it was in the present case. Biliary microhamartomas do not generally give any symptoms 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 5\\]</u>. Adult polycystic liver disease (APLD) was reported to associate with biliary microhamartomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 6\\]</u>. With any imaging modality mentioned above, we could not be able to demonstrate larger and more numerous liver cysts which we are used to see in enlarged, diffusely cystic livers with APLD. But we decided to include the patient in a follow-up program to monitor the liver lesions.\n\n【22】US, CT, MRI, MRCP, and hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) were used as imaging modalities in the diagnosis of biliary microhamartomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. On US, the lesions can be seen as multiple, small, hypoechoic, or anechoic cystic lesions involving all segments. However, besides small cystic lesions, biliary microhamartomas can also be seen as hyperechogenic areas or lesions, and comet-tail artifacts may be seen posterior to the lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. In the present case, US did not reveal any prominent lesion, suggesting that US may not be a suitable modality to show biliary microhamartomas. On CT, biliary microhamartomas are observed as multiple, round or irregular, small, hypodense lesions up to scattered throughout the liver on precontrast images. Luo et al. reported that on CT, lesions showed no enhancement, but increased in number by approximately 80–150% after administration of intravenous contrast medium 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. On MRI, lesions appear hypointense and hyperintense on precontrast T1-weighted images and T2-weighted images, respectively. They show no communication with the biliary tree and demonstrate irregular delineation with no or slight rim enhancement following gadolinium administration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【23】In differential diagnosis, it is necessary to consider peribiliary cysts, simple hepatic cysts, autosomal dominant polycystic disease, metastatic liver disease, microabscesses, dilated biliary ducts, and Caroli’s disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8, 9, 12\\]</u>. Peribiliary cysts are multiple, small, cystic dilatations of the intrahepatic extramural peribiliary glands, but they are located exclusively in the hepatic hilum and along the larger portal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>, which is different from the scattered distribution of biliary microhamartomas. Simple hepatic cysts are not as numerous and uniformly small as biliary microhamartomas. In autosomal dominant polycystic disease, cysts are usually larger and more numerous. Liver metastases are more variable in size, density, or signal intensity on CT and MRI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. MRI can aid in the differentiation of liver cysts (such as biliary microhamartomas) and liver metastases by identifying the hyperintense signal from liver cysts on heavily T2-weighted sequences 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Differentiation of biliary microhamartomas from microabscesses can generally be made clinically. Differentiation from dilated biliary ducts and Caroli’s disease can be made by looking at their association with biliary ducts using MRCP. Nuclear imaging can also be performed in differentiation of biliary microhamartomas from Caroli’s disease. In Caroli’s disease, HBS shows a particular pattern of cystic dilatation with accumulation of tracer in the intrahepatic ducts of the biliary tree 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Zheng et al. performed HBS in a case of biliary microhamartoma by using 99mTC-N-pyridoxy 1-5-methyl tryptophan (99mTC-PMT). HBS revealed that biliary system excreting function of radioisotope was normal and demonstrated normal appearances of biliary system without pooling areas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u> which helped to differentiate the entity from Caroli’s disease. In our case, since MRCP depicted bile ducts with their normal width, shape, and contours, we did not need to perform further imaging with HBS. We recommend the clinicians to use MRCP as an ultimate imaging modality to differentiate biliary microhamartomas from Caroli’s disease as we did in our case, but whenever they experience difficulty in diagnosis, we suggest that they can use HBS as a confirmative tool to solve the problem.\n\n【24】In conclusion, CT, MRI, and MRCP were useful in differentiating biliary microhamartomas from other cystic liver diseases and metastatic liver lesions in our case. Though biliary microhamartomas rarely show malignant transformation, this probability make radiological imaging of biliary microhamartomas necessary for early diagnosis.\n\n【25】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【26】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors declared that they have no conflict of interests.</u>\n\n【27】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Disclosure</u>\n\n【28】通用结尾删除-1:<u>This case report was presented in 16th Annual Meeting of Turkish Society of Magnetic Resonance, 19–21 May 2011, Istanbul.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We describe here the successful use of percutaneous biventricular Impella (Bi-Pella) for cardiogenic shock secondary to acute biventricular myocardial infarctions (AMI-CS), as guided by parameters such as mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi), central venous pressure (CVP), and cardiac power output (CPO). We aim to highlight the promising outcomes of timely implanted biventricular Impella in (AMI-CS).\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Cardiogenic shock is responsible for a significant percentage of morbidity and mortality after acute MI. However, early identification of cardiogenic shock and the early use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) result in favorable outcomes. The Detroit Cardiogenic Shock Initiative described that patients with AMI and cardiogenic shock were supported with Impella (Abiomed, Inc. Danvers, Massachusetts, USA) before PCI resulted in survival to device removal of 89% and survival to discharge of 84% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. We present a case of AMI-CS in which a patient underwent insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and associated coronary revascularization. Despite this, he experienced resistant cardiogenic shock that necessitated Impella CP and subsequent Impella RP, which resulted in a dramatic improvement in his hemodynamic parameters and overall condition.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. History of Presentation\n\n【5】A 43-year-old man transferred from a non-PCI-capable hospital with acute onset chest pain for 4 h. He had no associated shortness of breath, cough, or fever. On examination, his blood pressure was 100/58 mm Hg, pulse rate was 120 beats/min and regular, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, oxygen saturation was 96% on room air, and his temperature was 37.2°C. He was fully conscious and had cold extremities. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds and jugular venous distension. Lungs were clear with good air movement bilaterally, and the rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Learning Objective\n\n【7】 Case: a patient who presented with resistant cardiogenic shock secondary to acute myocardial infarction.通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u>We consider the early use of biventricular Impella in resistant cardiogenic shock secondary to acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【8】##### 2.2. Medical History\n\n【9】The patient did not have any past medical history.\n\n【10】##### 2.3. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【11】The differential diagnosis of acute chest pain without hypoxia in such a 43-year-old man is broad. A typical presentation of acute coronary syndrome was a major concern. Other differential diagnoses include acute heart failure and acute pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n【12】##### 2.4. Investigations\n\n【13】Results of the patient’s laboratory tests were as follows: high-sensitivity (hs) cardiac troponin (cTn) was 2700 ng/l (normal range < 14 ng/L), mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) was 40% (normal range 65–70%), and serum creatinine was 398 μmol/L (baseline creatinine level was not available). An electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevation in leads III, avF, and V3– V4 and new-onset right bundle branch block, and the rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed severe biventricular dysfunction, and the estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 15%.\n\n【14】##### 2.5. Management\n\n【15】He presented to a non-PCI capable hospital and was treated with fibrinolytic therapy. The patient was then transferred to our center for rescue PCI, which revealed chronic total occlusion (CTO) of mid-LAD, acute occlusion of the RCA, and critical occlusion of the left midcircumflex coronary artery. The operator inserted the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and referred the patient to surgical revascularization.\n\n【16】A few hours later, the patient became more hypotensive, and we elected to proceed with PCI, with successful stenting to RCA, LCX, along with the insertion of Impella CP support. The mid-LAD (CTO) was left for a staged procedure. Despite successful coronary revascularization and Impella CP support, the patient developed overt cardiogenic shock, resistant to intravenous fluid and vasopressors. The next morning, repeat mixed venous oxygen saturation remained as low as 40%, and transthoracic echocardiography showed persistent severe biventricular dysfunction with akinetic and severely dilated right ventricle.\n\n【17】Based on the clinical presentation and workup findings, the diagnosis of cardiogenic shock secondary to acute inferior myocardial infarction was made. In an attempt to improve his worsening hemodynamic instability, Impella CP (Abiomed, Inc. Danvers, Massachusetts, USA) was deployed and achieved 3.2 L/min of flow at performance level 8 (performance level ranges from P0 to P9), along with successful removal of IABP therapy. The anticoagulation therapy targeted an activated clotting time between 160 and 180 s with heparin. On the next day, his right ventricular function hemodynamic parameters indicated a picture of poor right ventricular function , and there was evidence of severe RV dilatation and systolic dysfunction on bedside echocardiogram. Impella RP was then inserted and achieved 3.4 L/min of flow activated at P7 . Weaning off Impella devices after 24 hours included stepwise reduction of support level to evaluate the recovery of each ventricle. Impella CP was implanted for a total of 5 days and 4 days for the Impella RP. He underwent 7 continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) sessions to manage his severe acute kidney injury. A marked improvement of renal and liver function parameters was noticed in the first week after successful explanation of Impella devices. On hospital day 18, the patient was discharged from the coronary care unit, to spend another 14 days in the ward before being discharged home, with LVEF improved to 35%.\n\n【18】Table 1 \n\n【19】Hemodynamic parameters before and after biventricular impella support.\n\n【20】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【21】A fluoroscopic image showing the Bi-Pella configuration using the Impella CP and Impella RP axial flow catheters.\n\n【22】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【23】In situ Bi-Pella: consoles for the right and left ventricle.\n\n【24】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【25】CS secondary to biventricular heart failure is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is considered a real medical challenge 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) due to cardiogenic shock (AMI-CS) is linked with in-hospital mortality between 33% and 55% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. This alarming data have laid the road for the utility of MCS in AMI-CS. Impella CP and RP are examples of microaxial percutaneous MCS devices. They both have different yet similar functions; for the Impella CP, blood is pumped from the left ventricle towards the ascending aorta , and as for the Impella RP, blood is pumped from the vena cava towards the pulmonary arteries  bypassing a failing right ventricle.\n\n【26】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【27】Echocardiographic view of the two pumps in place.\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【29】Echocardiographic view of the Impella RP in the right ventricular outflow tract.\n\n【30】With data suggesting that LV dysfunction (LVD) is responsible for the vast majority of shock after AMI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>, results from the IABP-SHOCK II trial, and evidence suggesting improved survival benefits with early application of Impella CP 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>, one can understand the reasons behind its increased use in such clinical scenarios. Despite that, it may provide up to 4.0 liters per minute of forwarding flow; some patients, such as in our case, remain hemodynamically unstable. A possible explanation for this is the presence of concomitant severe right ventricular dysfunction (RVD). In fact, in most cases, concurrent RV failure, requiring MCS, is detected after the application of LV hemodynamic support devices or at the initial stages of evaluating a patient presenting with severe biventricular failure.\n\n【31】The pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPi), defined as \\[(systolic pulmonary artery pressure– diastolic pulmonary artery pressure)/central venous pressure\\], is a reliable predictor of outcome in AMI-CS secondary to RV failure, with values <0.9 suggesting RVD 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Poor RV function is strongly associated with a PAPi <0.9 and cardiac power output (CPO) <0.6, especially in patients who are already receiving LV hemodynamic support therapy. Time is a major consideration in RV failure (RVF); ideal management would aim to effectively minimize the delay between the incidence of RVF and implantation of right ventricular hemodynamic support 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Due to persistent RV hemodynamic instability, the team elected to insert an Impella RP device, just 24 hours after implantation of Impella CP.\n\n【32】This resulted in significant correction of cardiac index, CVP, SvO2, PAPi, and CPO , which strongly correlates with the Recover Right Study 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【33】##### 3.1. Follow-Up\n\n【34】Shortly after the Impella RP implantation, rapid improvement of hemodynamics was seen in the study patient, as suggested by Table 1. A repeat transthoracic echocardiogram performed 3 months after discharge showed improvement of both LVEF (25%) and RV function.\n\n【35】#### 4\\. Conclusions\n\n【36】We report the first case from the Middle East of AMI complicated by the refractory cardiogenic shock due to biventricular failure that was successfully managed with the early utility of Impella CP and RP (Bi-Pella). The promising survival benefits and the lack of adequate randomized trials to support the use of Impella in AMI-CS warrant urgent additional research on this topic.\n\n【37】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【38】The authors declare no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

However, migration of the inserted stent can occur, either distally or proximally; proximal migration is less common, but it also presents a greater challenge for endoscopic resolution. We present a case of a 67-year-old woman who had locally advanced pancreatic cancer and developed a common bile duct obstruction. Upon clinical presentation of chronic, painless, progressive jaundice, the obstruction was managed by placing of a 10 mm × 60 mm covered self-expandable metal stent (CSEMS), which successfully facilitated palliative biliary drainage. Six months later, however, the patient developed recurrent jaundice, which was determined to be due to proximal migration of the CSEMS. Repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was performed, and initial attempts to retrieve the migrated stent failed. Finally, another 10 mm × 60 mm CSEMS was placed across the stricture site, inside the previous stent, which remained in place. The treatment resolved the obstruction and jaundice, and the patient experienced no adverse events.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Endoscopic biliary decompression via stent placement is an important modality for the palliative management of distal malignant biliary obstruction. The demonstrated longer stent patency of self-expandable metal stents (SEMSs), over that of the plastic-type stent, underlies the physicians’ preference for their use, especially for cases in which the patient’s survival is expected to be longer than 3 months 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2\\]</u>. Many different designs of SEMSs are available, and in use, worldwide; these include uncovered, partially covered, and fully covered SEMSs. The choice of the specific SEMS type to be used is made on a case-by-case basis, usually by the endoscopist, based on the biliary pathological characteristics of the patients, including etiology, location of the obstruction, and institutional availability of the various SEMS types. The potential of SEMS malfunction is related to postplacement events, including stent migration or occlusion, and SEMSs can ever lead to life-threatening complications, such as stent-induced ulceration, duodenal obstruction, and perforation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 4\\]</u>. For stent migration, many studies have demonstrated that covered SEMSs (CSEMSs) migrate more frequently than uncovered SEMSs (USEMSs) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. To resolve this issue, endoscopic techniques, using foreign body forceps, biopsy forceps, or polypectomy snares, have been used for stent retrieval. Stents can move either distally or proximally, and while proximal movement occurs less frequently, it presents a more difficult situation for endoscopic removal.\n\n【4】Here, we report an alternative endoscopic approach for the management of proximally migrated CSEMSs that was successfully applied in a case of malignant distal common bile duct obstruction, in which the endoscopist had failed to retrieve the stent; placement of another CSEMS was performed distally using a stent-in-stent technique after navigating through the previous CSEMS with a guidewire.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】A 67-year-old woman presented to our department with a complaint of a 3-week history of progressive painless jaundice. Laboratory tests revealed no leukocytosis but mild anemia (hemoglobin: 11.5 g/dL, reference range: 12.0–18.0 g/dL). The liver chemistry panel revealed the following: aspartate aminotransferase: 38 U/L (reference range: 0–32 U/L); alanine aminotransferase: 31 U/L (reference range: 0–33 U/L); total bilirubin: 18.8 mg/dL (reference range: 0.0–1.2 mg/dL); direct bilirubin: 16.4 mg/dL (reference range: 0.0–0.3 mg/dL); alkaline phosphatase: 252 U/L (reference range: 35–105 U/L); and carbohydrate antigen 19–9: <0.6 U/mL (reference range: 0–39 U/mL). A computed tomography scan demonstrated an ill-defined mass at the pancreatic head (4.0 cm × 4.2 cm in size) causing distal common bile duct and pancreatic duct dilatation . The tumor encased the superior mesenteric vein and multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies were also apparent.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】Computed tomography scan showing an ill-defined, hypodense mass at the pancreatic head, causing upstream dilatation of the common bile duct (a) and pancreatic duct (b) compatible with the double duct sign.\n\n【9】After the cytological assessment (using endoscopic ultrasonography with fine-needle aspiration) indicated adenocarcinoma, a locally advanced pancreatic malignancy was diagnosed. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) was subsequently performed and showed a long-segment stricture at the distal common bile duct that caused upstream dilatation (1.5 cm in diameter, together with dilations of the bilateral intrahepatic ducts; Figure 2(a)). The obstructive jaundice was resolved by placing a 10 mm × 60 mm fully covered SEMS (Niti-S Biliary Covered Stent™; TaeWoong Medical Co, Ltd. Gimposi, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), which facilitated biliary drainage (Figure 2(b)). The patient received palliative chemotherapy, consisting of cycles of a cisplatin and gemcitabine regimen.\n\n【10】(a)\n\n【11】(b)\n\n【12】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【14】Cholangiography showing a long-segment stricture at the distal common bile duct.

A computed tomography scan demonstrated proximal migration of the previously placed CSEMS , and the patient was scheduled for endoscopic intervention. In the endoscopy suite, the cholangiogram verified proximal migration and showed upstream dilation of the common bile duct . The initial attempts to retrieve the migrated stent endoscopically by using rat tooth grasping forceps (Rat Tooth Alligator Jaw Grasping Forceps; Olympus Medical System Corporation, Aomori, Japan) and snares (Captivator™ Single-Use Snare, Boston Scientific Corporation, Costa Rica) failed. As a result, deep cannulation using a sphincterotome (Ultratome™ XL Triple Lumen; Boston Scientific Corporation, Costa Rica) was performed by navigating a 0.035-inch guidewire (Jagwire™, Boston Scientific Corporation, Costa Rica) until passage through the previous CSEMS was achieved proximally. A 12-mm balloon retrieval catheter (Extractor<sup>TM</sup> Pro RX Balloon, Boston Scientific Limited, Ireland) was then inserted over the guidewire and inflated within the migrated stent to confirm proper location of the guidewire. Then, retrieval of the migrated stent was attempted by pulling the balloon back distally, but the attempt failed. Finally, an additional 10 cm × 60 mm CSEMS (Niti-S Biliary Covered Stent™; TaeWoong Medical Co, Ltd. Gimposi, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) was placed across the stricture site, inside the previous stent.

Discussion\n\n【24】The majority of malignant distal common bile duct strictures are caused by pancreaticobiliary cancers. It has been reported that up to 80% of patients with pancreatic carcinoma develop obstructive jaundice; unfortunately, most of these patients have advanced-stage disease at the time of diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Endoscopic biliary drainage via biliary stenting is the most common approach for addressing the issue of obstructive jaundice and can improve the quality of life of the patient, regardless of the predicted cancer-related survival time 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. SEMSs have gained popularity among treating physicians, as they have longer stent patency than plastic-type stents, which are prone to occlusion by microbacterial biofilm formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Nevertheless, SEMSs harbor their own disadvantages; for example, USEMSs can be occluded due to tumor ingrowth through the mesh 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. CSEMSs have better patency than USEMSs due to their thin, nonporous membrane, which is located inside of their mesh and prevents tumor ingrowth 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. The disadvantage of CSEMSs, however, is their lower axial force, which leads to an increased risk of migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Unfortunately, the multitude of studies comparing CSEMSs and USEMSs to determine which is superior for the treatment of malignancy distal biliary obstruction have yielded conflicting results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10, 12, 13\\]</u>. Adding to the controversy, a prospective randomized trial published in 2010 showed no significant difference in stent patency between CSEMSs and USEMSs for the palliative treatment of distal malignant biliary obstruction, but confirmed that tumor ingrowth was more common in USEMSs and that CSEMSs had an increased risk of stent migration 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Stent migration is a well-known clinical problem, affecting 1.8% to 11.5% of biliary stent patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 9, 10, 12, 13\\]</u>. When stented patients develop recurrent obstructive jaundice or cholangitis, migration should be among the first events suspected. Proximal migration is much less common than distal migration, reportedly affecting only 1.7% of partially covered SEMSs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Regardless of the migration pattern, several techniques for retrieval have been described in the literature, including the use of foreign body forceps, biopsy forceps, polypectomy snares, or Dormia baskets 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16–18\\]</u>.\n\n【27】In our patient, the initial attempt to remove the proximally migrated CSEMS was carried out with several of the commonly used accessories, all of which failed. Since the upper border of the migrated stent was still wide open, the endoscopist decided to abandon removal of the migrated stent and instead place another stent across the stricture point, using a stent-in-stent technique. No stent-related complications were observed in the patient following the procedure, including the most common complication, cholecystitis, which occurs in up to 10% of patients after SEMS placement and is associated with preexisting cystic duct lesions, such as cholelithiasis or tumor invasion of the cystic duct 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【28】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【29】The proximal migration of a fully covered self-expandable metal stent in patients with distal malignant biliary obstruction occurs less frequently than distal migration and presents a more difficult situation for endoscopic removal. The stent-in-stent technique is an alternative treatment approach in cases where endoscopist had failed to retrieve the stent.\n\n【30】#### Abbreviations\n\n| SEMS: | Self-expandable metal stent |\n| --- | --- |\n| CSEMS: | Covered self-expandable metal stent |\n| USEMS: | Uncovered self-expandable metal stent |\n| ERC: | Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography |\n\n【32】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【33】The authors declare no conflicts of interest related to the publication of this case report.\n\n【34】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【35】VP conceived and designed the study; AC reviewed the study design and data and drafted and revised the manuscript.

A 23-year-old male had a giant-cell tumor occurred in the distal end of the ulna. After wide resection of the distal segment of the ulna including giant-cell tumor, ulnar components of the wrist joint were reconstructed with modified Sauvé-Kapandji procedure using the iliac bone graft, preserving the triangular fibrocartilage complex and ulnar collateral ligament in order to maintain ulnar support of the wrist, and the proximal stump of the resected ulna was stabilized by tenodesis using the extensor carpi ulnaris tendon. One year after operation, the patient's wrist was pain-free and had a full range of motion. Postoperative X-rays showed no abnormal findings including recurrence of the giant-cell tumor and ulnar translation of the entire carpus. The stability of the proximal stump of the distal ulna was also maintained.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Giant-cell tumor (GCT) of the bone is a rare, benign, and locally invasive tumor. It is accounting for about 3% to 5% of all primary bone tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. GCTs of the bone usually occur at the epiphysis of the long bone such as femur, tibia, humerus, and radius. GCTs occurred at the distal end of the ulna are extremely rare, accounting for 0.45% to 3.2% of all the cases of GCTs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. This paper described a young male with a GCT of the distal end of the ulna treated by a wide resection and ulnar support reconstruction of the wrist.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 23-year-old male, manual laborer, noticed a movemental pain and swelling around the ulnar head of the left wrist on January, 2008. Pain suddenly increased two months after the onset without any particular event. The patient was seen to a clinic on March, 2008. In there, the patient was informed that there was an abnormal shadow in the ulnar head of the left wrist. There was no history of any other swelling in the body, fever, and loss of weight. The patient was introduced and first seen in our hospital on May, 2008.\n\n【6】Physical examinations revealed that there was an oval swelling of 4 × 3  cm in the distal end of the ulna. There was no color change and redness on the overlying skin. The swelling was diffusely tender and uniformly elastically hard. There was no adherence of the skin to the under lying bone. The range of motion of the patient’s left wrist was limited to 60° (contralateral side: 80°) in dorsiflexion and 50° (80°) in palmar flexion, 60° (90°) in pronation and 80° (90°) in supination. Moderate movemental pain was present at the extremes in all directions. The grip strength of his nondominant left wrist showed 27 kgf compared with 42 kgf of the unaffected dominant hand.\n\n【7】Blood examinations were within normal limits. Plain X-ray of the left ulna showed an expansile, multilobular, and radiolucent lesion with a clear margin, so-called soap-bubbled appearance lesion at the distal end with absence of periosteal reaction and incomplete fracture . Other X-rays including chest showed no abnormality. Computed tomograms showed thinning and protrusion of the cortex, but no destruction of the cortex of the distal ulna . Magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a low intensity in T1 weighted image and a relatively high intensity in T2 weighted image. A clinical diagnosis of GCT was made. Therefore, open biopsy was performed to make an accurate diagnosis. Histological findings revealed that the tumor was consisted of mononuclear tumor cells with eosinophilic oval and short fusiform nucleus and osteoclastic multinuclear giant cells, indicating typical benign GCT of the bone. On the basis of clinical and radiographic evaluations, the lesion was graded as stage 3 (aggressive) as per the Enneking Staging system for benign bone tumors 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Preoperative plain X-ray showed an expansile, multilobular, and radiolucent lesion with a clear margin in the distal end of the left ulna. |\n| --- |\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Computed tomogram showed thinning and protrusion of the cortex but no destruction of the cortex of the distal ulna. |\n| --- |\n\n【12】Reconstructive surgery with tumor resection was performed under general anesthesia six weeks after his first visit to our hospital. The distal ulna including healthy proximal bone was resected en bloc to preserve the origin at the ulnar fovea of the triangular fibrocartilage with the ulnar collateral ligament. Iliac bone was harvested from the contralateral iliac crest by using separate instruments and was grafted to the ulnar side of the sigmoid notch of the radius-like Sauvé-Kapandji procedure. The grafted iliac bone was fixed with a small cannulated cortical screw and a 1.5 mm diameter Kirschner wire . The triangular fibrocartilage with the ulnar collateral ligament, which had been preserved, was attached to the distal radial aspect of the grafted iliac bone in order to reconstruct the ulnar support.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| Iliac bone was grafted to the sigmoid notch of the radius.

The cut end of the proximal stump of the ulna was smoothed with a rongeur and rasp. A 3.5 mm hole was drilled from the dorsoulnar aspect of the ulnar shaft into the intramedullary cavity. The extensor carpi ulnaris tendon was split in the central sulcus and the radial half was released at the ulnocarpal level. It was then reflected proximally, leaving it attached at the musculotendinous junction. This proximally based slip, approximately six to eight cm long, was then passed into the medullary canal through the drill hole, retrieved at the distal stump of the ulna, and then sutured back on itself in an interlacing fashion. Final pathological examination confirmed a benign giant-cell tumor (Grade II).\n\n【16】A long arm splint was applied for two weeks, after which gentle active motion of the wrist and forearm was encouraged. Bony fusion between the radius and grafted ilium was confirmed on X-ray films eight weeks after the operation. Full range of motion in all directions was allowed and encouraged.\n\n【17】The patient’s wrist was free from pain one year after the operation, the range of motion of the wrist was full (90° in dorsiflexion, 80° in volar flexion, 90° in pronation, and 90° in supination), and the grip strength was improved to 37 kgf. The stability of the proximal stump of the distal ulna was also maintained. X-rays of the patient’s left wrist showed no recurrence of the tumor, no absorption of the grafted bone, and no ulnar translation of the entire carpus. There was no convergence of the proximal stump of the ulna toward the radius . Chest X-ray showed no metastases in the lung.\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| One year after the operation, X-ray showed no recurrence of the tumor, no absorption of the grafted bone, and no ulnar translation of the entire carpus.

Discussion\n\n【21】Giant-cell tumor (GCT) of bone is a rare and essentially benign tumor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. GCT occurred in the ulnar epiphysis is furthermore extremely rare 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. There has been an intralesional curettage with bone or artificial material graft or en bloc resection in the treatment of a low-grade GCT of the distal ulnar end. Resection of the distal end of the ulna, so-called the Darrach’s operation, is a simple and easy solution but long-term results are still unpredictable, especially with high stress manual labor 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–9\\]</u>. This may be attributed to abnormal stress distribution after resection of the distal ulna.\n\n【22】Resection of the distal ulnar end is most commonly performed for disorders of the distal radioulnar joint 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10–12\\]</u>. Long-term results of the Darrach’s procedure are not predictable 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. Ulnar carpal translation and snapping of the distal ulnar end and finger extensor tendon rupture due to instability of the ulna may occur as in our case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The Sauvé-Kapandji procedure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4–6, 14\\]</u> and radiolunate fusion have been used for reconstruction to prevent ulnar translation of the entire carpus 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. However, there are many problems including the necessity of a healthy distal end of the ulna and an unacceptable decrease in range of motion of the wrist after these surgeries.\n\n【23】Goal for our young active patient was to preserve as much wrist instability and movement as possible. Hashizume et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u> used a longer iliac bone graft to achieve the buttress effect against axial stress loading, hence the term “ulnar buttress arthroplasty”. Our method should be called a modification procedure described by them.\n\n【24】Excessive resection of the distal ulna usually results in painful instability of the stump or a click 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17–20\\]</u>. In the present case, the distal stump of the ulna after resection of the distal ulna including GCT lesion was stabilized by the method previously reported in our papers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【25】In conclusion, our procedure is useful for the ulnar support reconstruction after wide resection of the distal ulna including ulnar head. The ulnar support consisting of iliac bone graft, preservation of the TFCC and the ulnar collateral ligament, can lead to good results.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

We present an 18-year-old high school student who presented with a sore throat, macular rash, abdominal pain, diarrhea, fevers, and joint pains. He presented with acute kidney injury and confusion with multiple tests and was eventually diagnosed with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Presentation\n\n【3】An 18-year-old African male high school student with no prior comorbid conditions presented with a 2-day history of tonsillitis and was noted to have a macular rash that started on his chest and extended to his arm. He had received symptomatic treatment by a school clinician with oral chlorohexidine and lozenges. Three days into the initial symptom, he developed abdominal cramping and multiple episodes of non-bloody diarrhea, watery in nature, without nausea nor vomiting. He also had fevers and joint pains (both wrist, elbows, and knees). He was taken to a nearby health facility, where he was noted to have a high temperature and tachycardia. Within 24 hours in this facility, he developed confusion and was reported to have increasing creatinine, which rose from 200 μmol/L to 400 μmol/L. Treatment received included ceftriaxone 2 grams once a day for three days, paracetamol 1 g three times a day, loperamide 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea, and one dose of IV methylprednisolone 1 g. Given his deterioration, he was transferred to our facility for further evaluation and treatment.\n\n【4】On arrival at this hospital, he was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 50 breaths per minute, febrile at 40 degrees Celsius, hypotensive at 70/40 mmHg, and desaturating to 86% on room air. His GCS was 14/15; respiratory exam revealed bilaterally coarse crepitations throughout the lung fields with an audible S3 gallop rhythm on cardiovascular examination. Per abdomen was distended, tense with hypoactive bowel sounds. The musculoskeletal examination was unremarkable. He underwent acute management with fluid resuscitation, an urgent central line was placed, and he was initiated on inotropic support at 0.4 mcg per kilogram per minute.\n\n【5】The initial laboratory findings included a full hemogram which depicted an elevated white cell count of 27.12 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dl (normocytic normochromic), and platelets of 281 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Inflammatory markers were elevated with a procalcitonin of 71.58 ng/ml and C-reactive protein of 287 mg/L. The kidney fuctions were deranged with a creatinine of 494mmol/L, urea 26.70 mmlols/L, sodium 128 mmol/L, potassium 4.87mmol/L, and bicarbonate 15.5 mmol/L (blood gas analysis supoorted a metobaolic acisosis with a pH7.33, PCO2 23 PO2 122 and HCO3- 19.8). His liver function test represented ischemic hepatitis with an elevated AST of 1461 units/L ALT 812 units/L normal bilirubin (hepatitis screens A, B, and C were negative, including an HIV test). Urine analysis showed proteinuria with protein three-plus and blood four plus (with no red blood cells) and a urine albumin creatine ratio confirming proteinuria of 52.28 mg/mmol. The cardiac markers were elevated with a troponin of 17,137 ng/ml with an elevated creatine kinase of more than 7800 units/L. At this point, a diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease and rheumatic fever was entertained; an ASOT titer was obtained, being negative.\n\n【6】His radiological investigation included a chest X-ray that showed a feature of pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly; a 2D echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy with a low ejection fraction of 30 to 35% and normal valves. A CT scan abdomen showed distended bowel with splenic and renal infarcts as highlighted in Figures 1 and 2, and an HRCT redemonstrated the cardiomegaly and bi-basal lung atelectasis.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showing multiple hypodense wedge-shaped parenchymal defects involving the cortex and medulla consistent with renal infarcts (black arrow).\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【10】Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showing hypodense pyramidal wedge-shaped defect consistent with splenic infarcts (black arrow).\n\n【11】Multiple differential diagnoses were entertained at this point, such as vasculitis (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, medium-sized vasculitis) and multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, which has been superimposed by septic shock. Within a few hours, the patient deteriorated, requiring intubation, and his norepinephrine requirements had increased to 0.7 mcg per kilogram per minute. He had been initiated on meropenem one gram three times a day and was started on urgent dialysis to help with the pulmonary edema, and supportive management was commenced for the fevers (given liver dysfunction, paracetamol was avoided, and other measures were integrated, which included cooling and icepacks). Because of the above differential diagnosis, an autoimmune panel was sent. Complement 3 and Complement 4 (C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>) were low at 0.51 g/L and 0.04 g/L, respectively. The patient was initiated on a low-dose steroid pulse at 250 mg once a day and, due to the high risk of immunosuppression secondary to the steroids, was given broader cover with vancomycin 500 mg twice a day (renally adjusted doses); the rest of the autoimmune panel results are as follows: positive beta2-glycoprotein IgA antiphospholipid antibody and negative ANA, antiDS DNA, ENA, pANCA, and cANCA. COVID-19 PCR from tracheal aspirate and nasal swab was negative. However, to our surprise, the COVID-19 antibody test was positive, giving us strong evidence that our patient was suffering from the multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. By this point, all cultures, including blood and urine, had no growth.\n\n【12】With the first pulse of steroids, the patient showed marked improvement with a decreasing pressor requirement from 0.7 mcgs of norepinephrine to 0.16 mcgs. Currently, the patient is doing well and has been successfully extubated, off inotropic support, with good urine output. He has remarkably overcome an acute process with four days of treatment with antibiotics and steroids and will continue on a tapering dose of steroids. He was successfully discharged from the hospital with some mild left leg weakness. As demonstrated by the MRI in Figures 3 and 4, the brain had developed small lacunar infarcts with residual neurological deficits.\n\n【13】(a)\n\n【14】(b)\n\n【15】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【17】ADC mapping with an area of low signal intensity (left image orange arrow).

Discussion\n\n【24】Multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is where you have multiple organ inflammation, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. COVID-19 pneumonia in children presents very mild symptoms and can often be asymptomatic. There is a specific criterion that should be met for the diagnosis of MISC. As per the European and US center of disease prevention and control the diagnostic criteria is as follows: <21 years of age, fever for more than one day, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and more than two organ failure with a positive SARS-COVID 19 PCR or positive antigen test 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. As seen in our case, the criteria were met given that the patient was 18 years old and had increased inflammatory markers evidenced by increased CRP and ferritin levels. The patient also had multiple organ failure including a positive antigen test, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, and brain.\n\n【25】The pathogenesis of COVID-19 pneumonia in children is similar to that of adults, where viral entry is via angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2, the difference being that fewer receptors in children give milder symptoms. In MIS-C, once the viral entry has been established, the early infection activates the macrophages after the T-helper cells causing cytokine release 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. One after that develops a hyperimmune state by activating the B-cells causing the production of autoantibodies. The hyperimmune state leads to autoantibodies attacking the endothelial cell and gastrointestinal cells; myocardial damage’s exact mechanism is unknown, but one can present with myocarditis or acute ischemic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【26】The clinical presentation of MIS-C is a multisystemic disease, one of the most common manifestations is fevers occurring in 97–100% of patients, and dermatological manifestation includes rash and conjunctivitis (30–94%) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestation are the most common presenting complaints which include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Cardiac involvement includes features of myocarditis and ischemic events; around 31–100% of the patients may have left ventricular diastolic function evidenced by an echocardiogram 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Thrombotic complications like splenic infarction and cerebral strokes are also common manifestations 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. On the other hand, renal infarctions are rare, and only a few cases reported in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have developed renal infarctions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6–8\\]</u>. Based on this evidence, one can see that the above patient presented with almost all the clinical signs making the diagnosis even stronger.\n\n【27】Acute kidney injury is prevalent amongst the SARS-COVID-19 patients. AKI and renal parenchymal disease may be caused by the ACE-2 receptors on the kidney parenchyma, causing microvascular injury triggered by the cytokine storm 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 10\\]</u>. As noted in outpatient, there was proteinuria, which has been reported in COVID-19 pneumonia patients. The theory is that viral replication occurs in the podocytes causing damage that can ensue in proteinuria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Renal infarction resulting in AKI is rare; studies have shown renal infarction resulting in AKI but none requiring hemodialysis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. This case stands out as it is one of the only cases of renal infarction requiring renal replacement therapy. Most cases of renal infarction lead to AKI with no additional intervention required.\n\n【28】There is a unique coloration between SARS-COVID-19 pneumonia and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome; there can be an elevated anticardiolipin IgA antibody or an anti-B2-glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies (as seen in our patient); this manifestation can lead to cerebral vascular infarctions, although studies do not support this hypothesis as in antiphospholipid syndrome it is the IgM and IgG titers that collate to thrombotic events 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Further studies need to be conducted to prove the thrombotic sequela amongst those with increased IgA titer, as clearly evidenced not only in our patient but in other case series conducted by Zhang et al. where all three patients had thrombotic events (multiple cerebral infarctions) and positive anticardiolipin IgA, anti-β2-glycoprotein I IgA, and IgG 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【29】MIS-C and COVID-19 pneumonia is a pediatric syndrome characterized by increased inflammatory markers, fever, and multiorgan failure. There is a significant increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality, but some cases have a reasonable response rate, as seen in our patient. The unique events of positive IgA antiphospholipid antibodies and thrombotic events as seen in our patient may need further studies to prove any correlations.\n\n【30】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【31】COVID-19 pneumonia can lead to MIS-C resulting in multiple organ inflammation. Patients with MIS-C are more prone to thrombotic events and multiple organ failures. Therapies with steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins have been shown to improve outcomes significantly. AKI caused by renal infarction is rare; this may be the only case resulting in renal infarction requiring renal replacement therapy.\n\n【32】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【33】In line with our Institutional Ethics and Research Committee (IERC) guidelines, this case report was exempted from full IERC review.\n\n【34】#### Consent\n\n【35】We have obtained written consent from the patient to publish his case and images.\n\n【36】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【37】The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Clinical signs, biochemical parameters, histologic findings, and/or ATP7B genetic testing are required to diagnose Wilson’s disease. Case Presentation. 25-year-old and 22-year-old young women (siblings) presented to the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, with difficulty of keeping balance of 3-year duration and progressive extremity weakness of 5-year duration, respectively. Both siblings had visible ocular Kayser–Fleischer rings, low serum ceruloplasmin level and increased urinary copper content, ultrasound-evidenced cirrhotic liver disease, and axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted MRI hyperintensities in basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem (midbrain and pons).

Background\n\n【3】Wilson’s disease (WD) was first described by Kinnear Wilson in 1912, as “hepatolenticular degeneration” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder, caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene, leading to impaired hepatocellular copper transport, and subsequently results in deleterious accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea.

Here, we discourse two cases of Wilson’s disease presented with neurologic deficits.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【6】##### 2.1. Case-1\n\n【7】A 25-year-old young woman presented to the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, with progressive difficulty of keeping balance of three-year duration and change in voice (slurring of speech) and tremor of hands of six-month duration. She had no visual disturbance, weakness of extremities, or bladder or bowel problem. She had no memory loss or epileptic fits. Her younger sister has been wheel-chaired due to neurologic problem. No preceding head injury or excess alcohol intake. Serology for HIV infection was negative. There was no history of yellowish discoloration of eyes, urine color change, or abdominal distension.\n\n【8】On physical examination, she was nourished, conscious, and oriented. Vital signs were within normal limits and stable. She had pink conjunctivae and nonicteric sclerae. Her lungs, heart, and abdomen examinations were unremarkable. On neurologic examination, she was oriented in time, place, and person. There were no cranial nerve abnormalities. No motor or sensory deficits occurred. Tandem walk and heel-to shin tests were poorly performed. She had dysarthria (slurred speech) and intention tremor of hands. Then, diagnosis of ataxic disorder due to multiple sclerosis was made at initial evaluation. Diagnosis of Wilson’s disease was considered by the neurologist by pointing out the Kayser–Fleischer ring on both eyes, after the radiologist reported the possibility of Wilson’s disease on MRI imaging.\n\n【9】A laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin 15 gm/dl (normal, 12–18 gm/dl), total leukocyte count 5,200/μl (normal, 4000–11,000/μl; granulocyte 54%, lymphocyte 35%), platelet count 87,000/μl (normal, 150,000–450,000/μl), and ESR 01 mm in first hour. Serum biochemical tests were normal. Serum tests for ANA and RF were negative. The serologic test for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C infections was negative. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed the coarse echotexture liver with surface irregularity. Axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted MRI images showed bilateral hyperintensities on basal ganglia and thalamus . Serum ceruloplasmin level by immunoturbidimetry and 24 hr urinary copper content by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) were determined in the International Diagnostic Laboratory in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to support the imaging diagnosis. Serum ceruloplasmin concentration was reduced (<10 mg/dl), and 24 hr urinary copper excretion was increased (142.2 μg/24 hrs). In sum, the clinical signs, biochemical tests, and imaging findings met diagnostic criteria for Wilson’s disease (K-F rings present, score 2; mild neurologic symptoms, score 1; serum ceruloplasmin level <10 mg/dl, score 2; urinary copper content >2 × ULN, score 2; diagnosis of Wilson’s disease established if score ≥4) .\n\n【10】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【11】Axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted MRI image showing increased signal intensity in basal ganglia and thalamus (case-1).\n\n【12】Table 1 \n\n【13】Laboratory results of case-1 and case-2 at time of clinical evaluation at the Neurology Clinic, University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.\n\n【14】Table 2 \n\n【15】Diagnostic scoring system for Wilson’s disease proposed by “8<sup>th</sup> International Meeting on Wilson Disease and Menkes Disease, Leipzig 通用删除7(英):<u>(2001)</u>.”\n\n【16】Global Assessment Score (GAS) for WD was determined to quantify burden of disability using domains of liver (scale 0–5), cognition and behavior (scale 0–5), motor (scale 0–5), and osseomuscular (scale 0–5) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. The patient scored L3C0M2O0 at time of diagnosis. Then after, she was started on D-penicillamine, 300 mg, po, daily, and dose escalated by 300 mg weekly, to reach a target dose of 900 mg, po, daily. She was as well started on zinc sulphate, 110 mg, po, twice daily, and pyridoxine 25 mg, po, daily, and advised to avoid copper-rich diet. Then, the patient was referred to the Neurology Clinic, Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Ethiopia, for close follow-up. Screening of family members for Wilson’s disease was recommended.\n\n【17】##### 2.2. Case-2\n\n【18】A 22-year-old, wheel-chaired, young woman presented to the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, with progressive weakness of proximal muscles (difficulty to go upstairs and stand from toilet, followed by difficulty of combing hair, and at last unable to stand) of 5-year duration and unable to keep balance of 3-year duration. She has been wheel-chaired in the last six months due to neurologic problem. She had been transiently incontinent to urine. She was treated with high-dose prednisolone (60 mg, po, daily) for six months with presumptive diagnosis of inflammatory myopathy but had no improvement. She had no memory loss or epileptic fits. Serology for HIV infection was negative. There was no history of yellowish discoloration of eyes, urine color change, or abdominal distension.\n\n【19】On physical examination, she was undernourished, conscious, and oriented. Vital signs were with in normal limits and stable. She had pallor of conjunctivae and nonicteric sclerae. Kayser–Fleischer rings were visible with naked eye. Her lungs, heart, and abdomen examinations were unremarkable. On neurologic examination, she was oriented in time, place, and person. No cranial nerve abnormalities occurred. She had proximal muscle weakness and atrophy on both upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were variable. Tandem walk was difficult to perform due to weakness. She had head titubation and intention tremor of hands. Finger-to-nose was poorly performed. Diagnosis of ataxic disorder and myopathy due to Wilson’s disease was considered after confirmed diagnosis of prior case. Laboratory investigations including complete blood count, biochemical tests, copper studies, and brain MRI were requested.\n\n【20】A laboratory examination revealed hemoglobin 8.6 gm/dl (normal, 12–18 gm/dl), total leukocyte count 3,700/μl (normal, 4000–11,000/μl; granulocyte 57%, lymphocyte 30%), and platelet count 137,000/μl (normal, 150,000–450,000/μl). Serum biochemical tests were normal. Serum tests for ANA and RF were negative. The serologic test for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C infections was negative. Abdominal ultrasound examination revealed the coarse echotexture liver with surface irregularity. Axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted MRI images showed bilateral hyperintensities on basal ganglia, thalamus, and brain stem. “Face of the giant panda” in the midbrain was spotted on the MRI image . Serum ceruloplasmin level was reduced (10.5 mg/dl), and 24 hr urinary copper content was increased (110.5 μg/24 hrs). In sum, the clinical signs, biochemical tests, and imaging findings met diagnostic criteria for Wilson’s disease (K-F rings present, score 2; severe neurologic symptoms, score 2; serum ceruloplasmin level = 10.5 mg/dl, score 1; urinary copper content >2 × ULN, score 2; diagnosis of Wilson’s disease established with score ≥4) . The global assessment score (GAS) was L3C0M4O4 at time of diagnosis. Then after, she was started on D-penicillamine, 300 mg, po, daily, and dose escalated by 300 mg monthly, to reach a target dose of 900 mg, po, daily. She was as well started on zinc sulphate, 110 mg, po, twice daily, and pyridoxine 25 mg, po, daily, and advised to avoid copper-rich diet. Then, the patient was referred to the Neurology Clinic, Tikur Anbessa Hospital, Ethiopia, for close follow-up.\n\n【21】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【22】Axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted MRI image showing classic “face of the giant panda” sign in midbrain hyperintensity of the tegmentum except for the red nucleus (the eyes), substantia nigra (the ears), and superior colliculus (the mouth) (case-2).\n\n【23】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【24】Wilson’s disease (WD) is an inherited autosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired hepatocellular copper metabolism. Mutation of ATP7B gene at chromosome 13 encodes defective hepatic copper transporting P-type ATPase at trans-Golgi network and cytoplasmic vesicles, which hinders ceruloplasmin synthesis and biliary excretion of copper. Hence, excess serum nonceruloplasmin bound copper results in tissue toxicity via oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis in hepatic and extrahepatic organs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Clinical characteristics of reported Wilson’s disease in Sub-Saharan Africa in the last three decades are shown in Table 3. Patients with WD initially present with a variable degree of hepatic (40–50%), neurologic (50–60%), and ophthalmic (50–90%) manifestations. Mean age of onset for hepatic disease is 10–15 years and unusual beyond 40 years. The clinical spectrum of hepatic disease may assume several forms. The asymptomatic state with persistently elevated serum transaminase activity has been witnessed. Presence of Coomb’s negative hemolytic anemia, hepatic dysfunction with jaundice, ascites, coagulopathy, elevated serum transaminase activity, and hyperbilirubinemia heralds acute hepatitis. Progressive cirrhosis is a frequent mode of hepatic presentation of WD. Mean age of onset for neurologic disease is often a decade later than hepatic disease. Most patients with neurological symptoms have some degree of liver disease. The spectrum of neurological syndromes comprises Parkinsonian-type (bradykinesia, rigidity, and cognitive deficit), pseudosclerotic-type (tremor, ataxia, and dysarthria), and arrhythmic-hyperkinesia-type (chorea, athetosis, and dystonia). Tremor and dysarthria are the most common initial neurologic symptoms. Dystonia and gait disorders are often reported. A variety of psychiatric problems were documented in WD. Inappropriate behaviors include labile mood, irritability, impulsiveness, and disinhibition. Antisocial or criminal behaviors have been reported. Severe depression with suicidal attempts and frank psychosis were observed as major psychiatric disorder. Cognitive changes manifest with reduced scholastic performance, executive abilities, and visuospatial processing. Kayser–Fleischer rings and sunflower cataracts are ocular hallmarks of WD. Few of the extra hepatolenticular features consist of neuropathy, myopathy, renal tubulopathy, premature osteoporosis, and arthritis. Biochemical findings in WD consist of low serum ceruloplasmin level and increased urinary copper content. Axial T<sub>2</sub>\\-weighted and FLAIR-MRI images suggest bilateral hyperintensities on basal ganglia, brain stem, and cerebellum. “Face of the giant panda” in the midbrain is classic MRI sign 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–11\\]</u>. Diagnosis of Wilson’s disease is established by the scoring system proposed by “8<sup>th</sup> International Meeting on Wilson Disease and Menkes Disease, Leipzig 通用删除7(英):<u>(2001)</u>,” which encompasses the combination of clinical signs, biochemical parameters, histologic findings, and mutation analysis of ATP7B gene 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>.\n\n【26】Table 3 \n\n【27】Summary of Wilson’s disease reported in Sub-Saharan Africa in the last three decades.\n\n【28】Our patients presented with pseudosclerotic-type neurologic deficit, ocular Kayser–Fleischer rings, ultrasound-evidenced cirrhotic liver disease, axial T2-weighted MRI-hyperintensities on basal ganglia and brainstem, and abnormal copper studies (low ceruloplasmin level and increased urinary copper content), which established diagnosis of Wilson’s disease. The most likely differential diagnosis for pseudosclerotic-type Wilson’s disease includes Friedreich ataxia, multiple sclerosis, and manganese storage disease. Features of progressive limb and gait ataxia, dysmetria, dysarthria, and motor weakness at young age favored the autosomal recessive inherited ataxic disorder, Friedreich ataxia. Genetic testing for frataxin, containing expanded GAA triplet repeats, confirms the diagnosis. The other likely diagnosis was multiple sclerosis, as patients presented with gait ataxia, intention tremor, and slurred speech due to inflammatory, demyelinating cerebellar pathways. Presence of MRI-evidenced plaques in the brain and spinal cord, which disseminate in time and space, supports the diagnosis. Manganese storage disease, autosomal recessive disease, is named as “new Wilson disease” as it often presents with pseudosclerotic- or Parkinsonian-type neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Bilateral hyperintensities in basal ganglia is spotted in T1-weighted MRI imaging. Genetic testing for SLC30A10 gene mutation settles the diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Medical therapy such as chelators (penicillamine and trientine) and zinc salts effectively controls symptoms of WD via decoppering effect and enterocytic metalothionein-inductance, respectively. Liver transplantation is indicated in those with fulminant hepatic failure (Revised King’s Score ≥11), progressive hepatic dysfunction due to advanced hepatic cirrhosis, and severe progressive neurologic deficit unresponsive to chelation therapy. Majority of patients with WD succumb from complications of progressive liver disease. Screening of family members of the index case should be routinely practiced to identify and treat early symptomatic and asymptomatic cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–5, 10–14\\]</u>.\n\n【30】In conclusion, Wilson’s disease, declared to be an orphan disease, requires clinical acumen of physicians and expensive investigation modalities for prompt recognition and is inaccessible as required, lifelong drugs for treatment.\n\n【31】#### Abbreviations\n\n| ATPase: | Adenosine 5′ triphosphatase |\n| --- | --- |\n| ATP: | Adenosine triphosphate |\n| ALT: | Alanine aminotransferase |\n| AST: | Aspartate aminotransferase |\n| ANA: | Antinuclear antibody |\n| BUN: | Blood urea nitrogen |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| FLAIR: | Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery |\n| HIV: | Human immunodeficiency virus |\n| HBsAg: | Hepatitis B surface antigen |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| RF: | Rheumatoid factor |\n| ULN: | Upper limit of normal |\n| WD: | Wilson’s disease. |\n\n【33】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【34】The authors declare that ethics approval was not required for this case report as we did not use any new procedures or any treatment which was not approved for clinical use in our institution.\n\n【35】#### Consent\n\n【36】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.\n\n【37】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【38】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【39】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【40】NB, FE, and AT performed clinical diagnosis and participated in patient care.

The patient’s clinical course is retrospectively reviewed. A 34-year-old female affected by NF1 was referred to our institution for persistent low back pain and MRI diagnosis of pseudomeningocele located at L3 level with paravertebral extension. From the first surgical procedure by a posterior approach until the relapse of the pseudomeningocele documented by MRI, the patient underwent two subsequent posterior surgical procedures to repair the dural sac defect with fat graft and fibrin glue. One month after the third operation, the abdominal MRI showed a giant intra-abdominal pseudomeningocele causing compression of visceral structures. The patient was asymptomatic. The pseudomeningocele was treated with an anterior abdominal approach and the use of the acellular dermal matrix (ADM) sutured directly on the dural defect on the anterolateral wall of the spinal canal. After six months of follow-up the MRI showed no relapse of the pseudomeningocele. Our case highlights the possible use of ADM as an effective and safe alternative to the traditional fat graft to repair challenging and large dural defects.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Pseudomeningoceles are extradural collections of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with no dural covering resulting from a dura-arachnoid defect or improper closure during spinal surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. There are three groups of pseudomeningocele: congenital, traumatic, and iatrogenic. Majority of pseudomeningoceles occurs after lumbar spine surgery and resolves spontaneously. Usually pseudomeningoceles remain embedded in the posterior paraspinal soft tissue and cause no symptoms. The MRI is the radiological examination of choice for diagnosis and follow-up after treatment 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Surgical exploration and repair should be reserved for symptomatic cases presenting with clinical features of intracranial hypotension, CSF leak, or infection. Besides pseudomeningocele is an extremely rare cause of spinal cord compression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. The association with congenital giant spinal pseudomenigocele and meurofibromatosis type 1 is rare and at the best of our knowledge there is no literature about this association. We describe a case of recurrent spontaneous lumbar giant pseudomeningocele 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> in patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 and the surgical technique to repair the defect.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】This is the case of 34-year-old female with neurofibromatosis type 1 and scoliosis who underwent surgery for low back pain and MRI diagnosis of pseudomeningocele at L3 level with paravertebral extension (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)). The neurological examination was negative. The patient was operated by L3 hemilaminectomy, reconstruction of the dural sac with water tight stitch, and L2–L5 stabilization with Hartshill rectangle and titanium wire (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) as reported in the treatment of thoracolumbar instability and deformities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 6\\]</u>. At the end of surgery, there was no intraoperative evidence of any residue. After one-year follow-up, the patient referred progressive pain and numbness in L5 left distribution and MRI disclosed a relapse of the operated pseudomeningocele at L3-L4 level (Figures 2(c) and 2(d)). However, since a postoperative MRI was not available, the symptomatic recurrence might be also due to the increase of a hidden residual. A second operation was performed by removing the Hartshill rectangle with posterior reconstruction of the dural sac with fascia lata, fibrin glue, and tight water closure of the dura mater. A postoperative MRI was not available for this time point. After one year an MRI disclosed a pseudomeningocele relapse (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)) and the patient underwent a third surgical procedure by L2–L4 hemilaminectomy and reconstruction by synthetic dura mater and autologous fat grafts with postoperative subarachnoid drainage for one week. After six months MRI showed a giant pseudomeningocele with intra-abdominal extension (Figures 4(a), 4(b), and 4(c)). At the end of each operation, there was no intraoperative evidence of any residual of the pseudomeningocele. However, since postoperative MRI images of the dural sac are not available until the fourth and last surgery, the multiple relapses might be also due to the progression of an unknown residual. The patient was asymptomatic without neurological deficit or abdominal symptoms. The operation was performed via anterior intra-abdominal exposure and reconstruction of the lateral wall of dural sac with a ADM sutured directly on the dural defect with reabsorptive stiches. After six months, the patient was fine without neurological deficit or abdominal symptoms and the spinal MRI showed no relapse of the pseudomeningocele (Figures 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c)).\n\n【6】(a)\n\n【7】(b)\n\n【8】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】Preoperative MRI sagittal and axial T2-weighted postgadolinium images showed a pseudomeningocele at L3-L4 levels with paravertebral extension and psoas muscle remodeling (black arrow).\n\n【11】(a)\n\n【12】(b)\n\n【13】(c)\n\n【14】(d)\n\n【15】(a) (b) (c)   \n(d)\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【17】Postoperative CT and X-rays (a and b) showing L3 hemilaminectomy and L2–L5 stabilization with Hartshill rectangle and titanium wire.

Discussion\n\n【36】Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic multisystemic disorder involving skin, central and peripheral nervous systems, bones, and cardiovascular and endocrine systems. This condition is caused by inherited or de novo mutations of the NF1 gene at the 17q11.2 chromosomal region, a gene that codes for the protein neurofibromin 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. It is a relatively common genetic disorder affecting about 1 in 3000 individuals. The features of the disorder are quite diverse and can include dermatologic, cognitive, and osseous diseases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Known focal osseous complications include long bone dysplasia with pseudarthrosis, sphenoid wing dysplasia, nonossifying fibromas of long bones, chest wall deformities (pectus excavatum), and focal, short-segmented scoliosis. The coexistence of hydrocephalus and NF1 is known 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>, but the presence of a spinal pseudomeningocele is very rare. The pathogenesis of the pseudomeningocele is a tear of the dural sac with a valve mechanism and the local alteration of the cerebrospinal fluid flow may cause the growth of the defect. When discovered, immediate surgical repair has been recommended especially for large pseudomeningoceles with the goal to prevent fistulous tract and infections 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11\\]</u>. Various treatment options like close observation for spontaneous resolution of small lesions, epidural blood patch, lumbar subarachnoid drainage and synthetic dural patch have been described in the literature for management of pseudomeningoceles with good results 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12–14\\]</u>. It is well known that the presence of dystrophic features in patients with type 1 neurofibromatosis increases the risk of relapse of pseudomeningocele after surgery 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. The presence of a spinal scoliotic curve with imbalance and the remodeling of foramina and bony structures caused by CSF pulsation could be the possible reason of the multiple relapses of pseudomeningocele in our patient. For these reasons the traditional fat graft and the fibrin glue were not appropriate to repair the dural defect. Today tissue engineering is an emerging multidisciplinary field in which researchers are striving to replace or regenerate damaged or lost tissues. The principle common to tissue engineering is to produce new tissues by seeding cells onto a suitable three-dimensional scaffold in an appropriate growth environment. According to this principle, acellular dermal matrix can be regarded as a natural acellular scaffold to facilitate healing. In this patient the repair of the defect was possible only with an intra-abdominal approach and the use of an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) sutured directly on the dural defect 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Acellular dermal graft is processed from banked cadaver skin. The cellular elements are removed in the processing of the allograft but the native collagen and elastin matrix and the basement membrane complex (BMC) are preserved. It is also treated with agents that prevent any viral transmission when implanted. Because the tissue is acellular, it does not produce an antigenic inflammatory response after implantation. This tissue becomes vascularized like autologous tissue after implantation and is used especially in the reconstruction of contaminated abdominal wall defects. In our patient the integration of the implant with the dural sac allowed the reconstruction of the dural defect and the healing of the giant pseudomeningocele. In conclusion, in our particular case ADM was found to be a safe and effective alternative to traditional fat graft for a very big dural wall reconstruction, even in the setting of contaminated fields where also posterior fusion is now allowed 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>.\n\n【37】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【38】All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.\n\n【39】#### Consent\n\n【40】Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.\n\n【41】#### Competing Interests\n\n【42】The authors declare that there are no competing interests regarding the publication of this paper.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Peripheral blood smear examination is an invaluable laboratory test, which provides the complete hematologic and/or nonhematologic picture of a case. In addition to verifying the results of automated cell counters, it has the potential to identify some pathologic and morphologic changes that remain hidden using the cell counters alone. Case Presentation. A 40-year-old man with a three-year history of alcohol intake and marijuana abuse presented with severe lower extremities of the bone and abdominal pain. Physical examination showed high blood pressure, high pulse rate, and abdominal tenderness. He underwent extensive laboratory and imaging tests, and cholecystectomy and bone marrow studies were associated with no definite diagnosis. Right after all these invasive, expensive, and time-consuming investigations during a month, finding coarse basophilic stippling in the red blood cells in the peripheral blood smear by an expert led to the final diagnosis. Elevated blood lead level and the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow study confirmed the diagnosis of lead poisoning, and the patient responded well to chelator therapy in a short period. Conclusion. This case clearly showed the value of peripheral blood smear review and its impact on patient care. In order not to lose the cases, laboratories are recommended to design their own policy for peripheral blood smear review. The peripheral blood smear is the fastest, simplest, and most available screening test, which can prevent many misdiagnoses and malpractices. It provides rich morphological information, among which basophilic stippling is highly suggestive of lead poisoning.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Background\n\n【3】A manual blood smear review is defined as the thorough and careful microscopic analysis of a well-prepared and stained smear of peripheral blood, with the objective of seeking morphological changes relevant to the diagnosis and monitoring of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Laboratory-initiated examinations of blood smears for patients with anemia are usually the result of a laboratory policy, according to which a blood smear is ordered whenever the hemoglobin concentration is unexpectedly low. In these cases, despite the wealth of the captured information from modern automated cell counters, including red cell count, mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and red cell distribution width (RDW), there are still morphologic abnormalities that are critical in the differential diagnosis of anemia and can be determined only from a blood smear. The detection of variations in the cell shape and red cell inclusions, such as Howell–Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies, and basophilic stippling or punctate basophilia, is highly important. The latter can be suggestive of lead poisoning according to the clinical data 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 40-year-old man was transferred to our center at Abu Ali Sina Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, to be evaluated for severe bone pain and abdominal pain for a month, which was worsened one week ago. It was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and constipation. The patient was also complaining of severe weight loss (15 kg during a month). His past medical history was not significant, and he was not taking any medication. He was a fast-food worker with a history of excessive alcohol intake over three years, with no periods of abstinence. He was drinking 1-2 liters of homemade alcohol (using a traditional container for distillation) daily until few days prior to admission. Additionally, he reported a history of on and off synthetic marijuana abuse until three days prior to admission. The bone pain was mostly limited to the lower extremities, and the abdominal pain was severe with a colicky pattern and radiation to both scrotums. Physical examination was significant for high blood pressure (180/100 mmHg), tachycardia (108/min), low-grade fever (37.9°C), and pallor with abdominal and scrotal tenderness. There was no gingival hyperpigmentation, and all deep tendon reflexes were unremarkable.\n\n【6】Laboratory investigations at presentation showed moderate microcytic and hemolytic anemia in addition to significantly elevated liver enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Abdominopelvic sonography and CT scan showed biliary sludge and small liver hemangioma, respectively. Other laboratory and imaging investigations (color Doppler sonography of the mesenteric artery and vein, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and colonoscopy) were unremarkable. He underwent cholecystectomy with the impression of acute cholecystitis, and the microscopic pathologic diagnosis was just chronic cholecystitis without cholelithiasis. Due to the presence of unexplained anemia and severe bone pain, a bone marrow study was done for him to rule out leukemia, which was in favor of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with 10% ring sideroblasts . The cytogenetic study was normal. Complete blood count (CBC) test with peripheral blood smear (PBS) checking (according to our policy in the hematology laboratory) was done for the patient several times at presentation and during hospitalization. Peripheral blood film examinations, stained by the Wright–Giemsa method, revealed mild to moderate anemia, microcytic hypochromic red blood cells with anisocytosis, polychromasia, and also frequent coarse basophilic stippling of the red cells (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)); the last one was missed at the first PBS review. Regarding the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow report, the possibility of lead poisoning was considered, and surprisingly, the blood lead level (measured on K2EDTA-whole blood by atomic absorption spectrophotometry) was markedly raised (151 µg/dL; reference range was 10 µg/dL). Since there was no occupational exposure, the traditional distillation dish (made of copper and lead) was traced as the possible source of lead.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】Bone marrow smear showing that about 10% of erythroid precursors are ring sideroblasts (arrow) (Perl’s Prussian blue stain, ×1000).\n\n【9】(a)\n\n【10】(b)\n\n【11】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【13】(a, b) Peripheral blood smear with basophilic stippling of red blood cells  (Wright–Giemsa, ×1000).\n\n【14】The patient stopped drinking alcohol and marijuana abuse.

All signs and symptoms were removed, and all laboratory findings changed to normal condition. Additionally, no clinical or laboratory deficits were noted during the 6-month follow-up visits. Informed consent was requested and obtained from the patient for publishing the case report and the accompanying images. Although some reports are supporting the correlation between hypertension and lead poisoning, in our case, marijuana withdrawal could also be the cause of sympathetic overactivity 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. Table 1 shows the transition of laboratory data from the first presentation to recovery time.\n\n【15】Table 1 \n\n【16】The initial and posttreatment results (after 4 weeks) of the laboratory tests.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】CBC is the most commonly ordered test in hospitalized patients. Modern automated blood cell counters produce a detailed report on the red cells, white cells, and platelets, with differential white blood cell counts. A drop of the remaining blood could then be smeared and stained 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. Microscopic examination of this smear under the expert eye yields useful information and further details regarding all formed elements of blood 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. “More information can be gained from examining the blood smear than any other single hematologic procedure,” Jandl in 1987 said 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. This shows the value of PBS review in medical management. Initiation of a PBS review depends on the laboratory policy. It can be a clinical request by the attending clinician due to clinical suspicion or can be initiated by the laboratory due to clinical information, numerical deviations in the automated counts, flags raised by the analyzers, or based on a designed protocol in the laboratory (based on the workload of the laboratory) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7\\]</u>. For certain disorders, for instance, hematologic malignancies or parasitic infestations, examination of the PBS can be diagnostic. For others, such as our case, the PBS provides important clues in the clinical management and determines which diagnostic tests are indicated 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Among all useful data obtained from the blood smear, valuable information about the red blood cell size, shape, staining (color), and intracellular inclusions can be obtained. Red cell inclusions often result from defective maturation of the erythrocytes, oxidant injury to the cells, or infections and are almost always indicative of some sort of pathology 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【20】Basophilic stippling (punctuate basophilia) is well-known red cell inclusions. The occurrence of basophilic stippling is caused by aggregates of ribosomes or fragments of ribosomal RNA precipitating throughout the cytoplasm of erythrocytes. These inclusions stain a deep blue color with Wright’s stain, and unlike other erythrocyte inclusions, they lack polarity and are dispersed throughout the cell. The inclusions might have a coarse or fine appearance, and these different morphologies can be linked to particular disease processes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>.\n\n【21】Fine basophilic stippling may be seen artifactually and is linked to increased production of the red cells, while coarse basophilic stippling is always clinically significant. Classically, coarse basophilic stippling is associated with heavy metal toxicity with a focus on lead poisoning. Patients with anemia secondary to hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease can demonstrate basophilic stippling that is finer than that seen in lead toxicity. Lead can increase membrane permeability; furthermore, it can alter erythrocyte morphology, giving rise to macrocytic and echinocytic forms as well as basophilic stippling. Lead toxicity causes coarse basophilic stippling due to suppression of pyrimidine 5′-nucleotidase, which prevents ribosomal RNA breakdown in circulating erythrocytes. In lead poisoning, basophilic stippling is a pathognomonic feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7–11\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Lead exposure usually occurs through contaminated air and food. Excess lead affects almost every organ in the body. The major anatomic targets are the blood (bone marrow), nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys. Lead has a high affinity for sulfhydryl groups and interferes with the enzymes involved in heme synthesis. Iron incorporation into heme is impaired, leading to microcytic hypochromic anemia with distinctive punctate basophilic stippling of the red cells. Lead also inhibits sodium- and potassium-dependent ATPases in the cell membranes, which may increase the fragility of red cells, causing hemolytic anemia 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The classic form of lead neuropathy consists of weakness that primarily involves the wrist and finger extensor (wrist drop and foot drop). Excess lead could induce “lead lines” formation in epiphyses of the bone and gum. The gastrointestinal tract is also a locus for major clinical manifestations. Lead “colic” is characterized by extremely severe, poorly localized abdominal pain, and finally, because the excretion of lead occurs through the kidneys, exposures may cause damage to the proximal tubules, interstitial fibrosis, and possibly renal failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Since lead poisoning is a condition with potential multiorgan damage, it can be traced in the human body with various laboratory tests. The half-life of lead in the blood and bone is 35 days and 32 years, respectively; thus, the blood lead level just reflects the current and recent exposure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5, 13\\]</u>. Table 2 shows different laboratory tests, their properties, and changes in cases of lead poisoning. Elevated blood lead (>10 µ/dL) and red cell-free protoporphyrin levels (>50 µg/dL) or, alternatively, zinc protoporphyrin levels, are required for definitive diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>.\n\n【25】Table 2 \n\n【26】Change of different laboratory tests in lead poisoning.\n\n【27】Impairment of the hematological system is one of the earliest signs of lead accumulation and could be characteristic. Even in milder cases of lead exposure, anemia may be the only obvious abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. The PBS is the fastest, simplest, and cost-effective test, which can also be made and examined at emergency and screening rooms at hospitals and could prevent unnecessary laboratory tests and other invasive diagnostic procedures, including inappropriate laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17\\]</u>. Because this process is among the most time-consuming ones in hematology laboratories and requires high technical competence to minimize the errors of subjectivity, each laboratory should make its policy to review the blood smears. Providing clinical data including occupational and environmental health history through communication between the clinicians and the laboratory team could lead to a more rapid and accurate diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[18\\]</u>.\n\n【28】Our patient was a case of chronic lead poisoning with atypical symptoms and signs, such as severe bone pain and highly elevated liver enzymes, which caused delayed diagnosis. In this case, a lot of laboratory and imaging workups, including hematologic tests (and also the initial PBS) failed to reach a correct diagnosis, while the second PBS review by an expert clarified the long and painful story. We believe that even the first PBS review may discover the problem if it is reviewed accurately and/or is provided with typical clinical data.\n\n【29】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【30】This case emphasizes that all patients with unknown diseases should be evaluated in terms of PBS at the first workup, and the PBS in all patients (hematologic and nonhematologic) should be reviewed systematically regarding all blood elements. Lead poisoning is more common than our estimation. As clinical manifestations are nonspecific and may be misdiagnosed with other pathophysiological conditions, at least it should be included in differential diagnosis lists of adult unexplained anemia (especially in the setting of matched clinical data), and basic initiative laboratory tests, such as PBS, could rule out the need for invasive, expensive, and time-consuming procedures.\n\n【31】#### Abbreviations\n\n| ALT: | Alanine aminotransferase |\n| --- | --- |\n| ALP: | Alkaline phosphatase |\n| AST: | Aspartate aminotransferase |\n| BUN: | Blood urea nitrogen |\n| BM: | Bone marrow |\n| CBC: | Complete blood count |\n| Cr: | Creatinine |\n| ESR: | Erythrocyte sedimentation rate |\n| HB: | Hemoglobin |\n| LDH: | Lactate dehydrogenase |\n| MCH: | Mean cell hemoglobin |\n| MCHC: | Mean cell hemoglobin concentration |\n| MCV: | Mean cell volume |\n| MDS: | Myelodysplastic syndrome |\n| PBS: | Peripheral blood smear |\n| PLT: | Platelet |\n| RDW: | Red cell distribution width |\n| WBC: | White blood cell. |\n\n【33】#### Data Availability\n\n【34】All data generated or analysed during this study are included within this published article.\n\n【35】#### Ethical Approval\n\n【36】Our institutional approval was not required to publish the case details.\n\n【37】#### Consent\n\n【38】Written informed consent was obtained by the patient for publishing the case report and the publication of the accompanying images.\n\n【39】#### Disclosure\n\n【40】A preprint has previously been published by Research Square 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>.\n\n【41】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【42】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n【43】#### Authors’ Contributions\n\n【44】ZA, SKE, and SN developed the concept of the study and the study design and wrote the draft manuscript.

Although surgical management gained priority due to the evolution of techniques, there is currently no consensus in the literature regarding the best type of surgical approach. The most commonly preferred surgical procedure among gynecologists is McIndoe operation which involves the creation of a space between bladder and rectum, insertion of a mold covered with split-thickness skin graft into that neovaginal space, and use of postoperative vaginal dilation to avoid stenosis. However, many modifications have been introduced in time in an attempt to increase the success rates. In this paper, we describe two cases with vaginal agenesis with functioning uterus who were subjected to surgery by combined abdominal-perineal approach. The surgical technique also included the use of a specially designed vaginal mold made up of polymethyl methacrylate and use of Hyalobarrier gel which is an adhesion-preventing agent.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Vaginal agenesis is a rare condition with an incidence ranging from 1 in 4,000 to 1 in 10,000 females 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common etiology is Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser-Mayer (RKHM) syndrome or Mullerian agenesis which is described as congenital absence of uterus and vagina in an individual with normal female genotype, normal secondary sexual characteristics, and normal ovaries. Vaginal agenesis may also occur as an isolated abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Detection of vaginal agenesis is readily achieved through well-defined diagnostic steps performed for primary amenorrhea at puberty 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. However, the optimum therapeutic approach has always been an area of extensive controversies. Although surgical management gained priority due to the evolution of techniques, there is currently no consensus in the literature regarding the best type of surgical approach 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. The most commonly preferred surgical procedure among gynecologists is McIndoe operation which involves the creation of a space between bladder and rectum, insertion of a mold covered with split-thickness skin graft into that neovaginal space, and use of postoperative vaginal dilation to avoid stenosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3, 5, 6\\]</u>. Many modifications have been introduced in course of time regarding the mold features, surgical technique, and postoperative care to obtain increased therapeutic success with relatively low morbidity.\n\n【5】The aim of this paper is to report two cases of vaginal agenesis with functioning uterus who were subjected to a new surgical technique including the use of a specially designed vaginal mold made up of polymethyl methacrylate and use of Hyalobarrier gel, an agent originally used to prevent postoperative adhesions.\n\n【6】#### 2\\. Case One\n\n【7】A 14-year-old girl who had normal female genotype and normal secondary sexual characteristics presented with primary amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain. Pelvic examination revealed vaginal dimple without a normal vaginal orifice, and an enlarged uterus was palpated on rectoabdominal examination. On pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the uterus which was enlarged due to hematometra was deviated to left side, and a left-sided hematosalpinx was detected. The ovaries looked normal. Surgical treatment with a preoperative diagnosis of vaginal agenesis was scheduled after a detailed counseling regarding the surgical method and its possible complications.\n\n【8】The patient had an overnight fasting before the day of surgery. A single intravenous dose of 1000 mg cefazolin was given 30 minutes before the operation for antimicrobial prophylaxis. Under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. However, in order to allow the combined perineal-abdominal approach, the lower extremities placed in stirrups were positioned with the hips abducted 45 degrees and flexed 45 degrees. After catheterization of bladder, the abdominal and vulvar areas were cleaned and draped. The operation began with a transverse incision at the site of vaginal dimple. A potential space was created between the bladder and urethra in front and rectum behind by blunt dissection. The surgeon palpated the catheter in bladder and assistant's finger in rectum to avoid vesical or rectal injury during the dissection. The dissection continued until a neovagina was obtained with a length of 9-10 cm and a diameter of 3-4 cm. The walls of the cavity were carefully checked for hemostasis .\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Neovaginal space created by blunt dissection. |\n| --- |\n\n【11】After the creation of neovagina, a second surgeon performed a laparotomy via pfannenstiel incision. On exploration, both ovaries and right Fallopian tube were normal. A rudimentary uterine horn was detected on the right side which seemed to be nonfunctioning, and no hematometra or hematosalpinx was evident . On the left side, a relatively enlarged uterine horn and hematosalpinx were seen . Hematoma within the left tube was drained, and neosalpingostomy was performed which was secured via eversion provided by 3.0 polyglactin sutures. A hysterotomy was performed subsequently on right anterolateral fundal portion of left uterine horn. The uterine cavity was identified, and hematometra was drained. The cavity was catheterized with a hysterometer which was pushed slowly downward until neovaginal space was accessed . The hysterometer used was a straight, graduated, and sounding metal hysterometer with a rounded tip which was slightly conical with outside diameters ranging from 3 to 5 millimeters. The specially designed vaginal mold was inserted into the neovagina with an 8-french pediatric Foley catheter placed in its central lumen . The tip of the Foley catheter was located in the uterine cavity, and its balloon was insufflated with 3 mL saline . Endometrium and myometrium were closed separately with 2.0 interrupted polyglactin sutures. To maintain the mold in position, sutures were put in between labia majora and the small holes located at the distal end of the mold with 1.0 polyglactin sutures . Hyalobarrier gel was applied between neovaginal walls and the mold.\n\n【12】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n| Right rudimentary uterine horn (black arrow) with normal tube and ovary. |\n| --- |\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n| Enlarged left uterine horn (black arrow) with hematosalpinx (red arrow). |\n| --- |\n\n【16】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n| Uterine cavity catheterized with a hysterometer which is pushed downward until neovaginal space was accessed. |\n| --- |\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 5 </u>\n\n| The specially designed vaginal mold with an 8-french pediatric Foley catheter placed in its central lumen. |\n| --- |\n\n【20】(a)\n\n【21】(b)\n\n【22】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【23】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 6 </u>\n\n| The Foley catheter passing through the lumen of the mold with its tip located in the uterine cavity ((a) and (b)). |\n| --- |\n\n【25】(a)\n\n【26】(b)\n\n【27】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【28】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 7 </u>\n\n| The mold in neovagina (a) and sutures put in between labia majora and the small holes located at the distal end of the mold (b). |\n| --- |\n\n【30】The bladder catheter and the mold were maintained for 10 days postoperatively. Because mobilization was restricted, low-molecular-weight heparin was administered twice a day, and the patient was given low-residue diet during this period. After removing the mold, the patient was advised to use the mold almost constantly for 3 months postoperatively and at nights for the subsequent 3 months to prevent stricture of the neovagina. The mold had to be cleaned on a daily basis, and the patient was explained the method of cleaning and inserting the mold on her own. 10% iodine and 3% hydrogen peroxide solutions were used, respectively, for cleaning the mold. Then, for lubrication and to support an enhanced epithelization, the mold was covered with 0.1% estriol cream just before the insertion. Gauze bandages tied around the waist and upper calves were used to maintain the mold in the neovagina after removing the sutures put in between labia majora and the mold. The patient was discharged from hospital on 14th postoperative day with an uneventful postoperative course. Her last visit was 1 year after the operation, and she experienced regular menses without pain. Her neovagina was patent on examination with normal cervix and uterus.\n\n【31】#### 3\\. Case Two\n\n【32】A 16-year-old girl having normal female genotype and normal secondary sexual characteristics presented with primary amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain. On pelvic examination, she did not have vaginal orifice, and her uterus was enlarged on rectal examination. Pelvic MRI could not detect a normal vagina, but uterus was filled with blood and proximal vagina was dilated due to proximal hematocolpos. The ovaries were normal. After counseling the patient and her family, surgery was planned with a preoperative diagnosis of distal vaginal agenesis.\n\n【33】After similar preoperative preparation and anesthesia induction, bladder was catheterized, and abdominal and vulvar areas were cleaned and draped. A transverse incision was done on vaginal dimple. A space with a length of 4-5 cm and a diameter of 2-3 cm was created by blunt dissection until proximal vagina was reached and hematometra and proximal hematocolpos drained. Hemostasis was achieved.\n\n【34】Second surgeon started laparotomy via pfannenstiel incision. On exploration, ovaries, tubes, and uterus were normal. Hysterotomy was performed on uterine fundus to identify endometrial cavity. The cavity was catheterized with a hysterometer which extended into neovaginal space. Vaginal mold was inserted into the neovagina with Foley catheter placed in its central lumen in a similar fashion to that already described for the former patient. Balloon of Foley was insufflated and left in the uterine cavity. Endometrium and myometrium were closed, the mold was fixed to labia majora, and Hyalobarrier gel was applied on neovaginal walls.\n\n【35】Postoperative followup was similar, and the same protocol was used. The patient was discharged from hospital on 15th postoperative day. Her last examination was 16 months after the surgery when she reported regular and painless menses and her examination revealed normal vaginal cavity, cervix, and uterus.\n\n【36】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【37】Vaginal agenesis is an uncommon condition which is encountered for a few times during the professional career of a general gynecologist 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3\\]</u>. However, the diagnosis may considerably unsettle the girl or the young adolescent and her family. Therefore, attention must be given to the psychosocial issues as well as to the correction of the anatomical abnormality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Also, counseling about future fertility is of vital importance. However, normal future fertility may be expected in patients with isolated vaginal agenesis in whom normal functioning uterus and intact cervix are present. On the other hand, future fertility problems may be encountered due to hematosalpinx, endometriosis, and the surgery itself which should be emphasized during counseling.\n\n【38】The timing for both nonsurgical and surgical correction of this anomaly is purely elective 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Nevertheless, in patients with intact uterus experiencing cyclic pelvic pain due to the obstructed menstrual fluid flow, immediate surgical correction is mandatory at the time of diagnosis. In the literature, although more than 10 surgical procedures for neovaginal reconstruction have been described so far, an ideal approach has not yet been identified 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 9\\]</u>. Especially vaginal molds which are used to prevent restenosis of created neovagina may be associated with most of the problems. Poor drainage, graft maceration, sloughing, and graft detachment may be caused by nonideal vaginal molds and lead to an unsatisfactory reconstruction. Using an appropriate vaginal mold is one of the keys to achieving a successful result in McIndoe neovaginal reconstruction 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Since the first operation had had the best chance of success, we were motivated to seek a new vaginal mold that has advantages for clinical use. For this purpose, we designed special mold which may specifically be used for pubertal girls with complete or partial vaginal agenesis and a normal uterus where a patent uterocervicovaginal canal is required to allow normal flow of menstrual and mucosal fluids. The mold is made up of polymethyl methacrylate which is commonly used for the production of most denture base prosthetics. Therefore, it is a relatively simple and a cheap mold which may be readily produced in dentistry laboratories in a short period of time. The mold has a length of 9-10 cm and a diameter of 2-3 cm. It has a central lumen in which an 8-french pediatric Foley catheter is placed. The tip of the Foley with the insufflated balloon is placed and left in the uterine cavity to allow the drainage of blood during the early postoperative period. Also, the Foley allows irrigation with saline which may be needed to facilitate the drainage of bloody fluid or to manage postoperative local infection. The mold we designed has small holes located at both sides of the distal end which is used to put sutures in between labia majora and the mold to maintain the mold in position and to prevent its displacement during the postoperative period.\n\n【39】The surgical technique we described has not only involved the use of a specially designed vaginal mold, but also Hyalobarrier gel was used which was applied between neovaginal walls and the mold at the end of the surgery. Hyalobarrier is an autocrosslinked derivative of hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid, HA) which is a natural polysaccharide found in almost all tissues and body fluids. HA plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues. Hyaluronan has been recognized in clinical medicine due to its high degree of biocompatibility, favorable safety profile, tissue protective properties, and positive biological effects on healing. The autocrosslinking process increases viscosity and extends in vivo residence time while preserving the favorable properties of hyaluronan. Also, the only product of in vivo degradation is natural HA since no foreign molecules are used during this process 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12, 13\\]</u>. During the healing process, prolonged presence of HA in increased amounts was shown to be associated with lack of fibrosis and scar formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[14\\]</u>. Also, exogenous HA was reported to decrease the synthesis of collagen in human dermal fibroblasts without effecting endogenous HA synthesis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15\\]</u>. Actually, deposition of hyaluronan around surgically treated tissues reduces postoperative adhesion formation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. In this context, use of Hyalobarrier gel was associated with a reduction in the incidence and severity of postoperative adhesions after hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, and laparotomy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[17, 18\\]</u>. Highly viscous Hyalobarrier gel provides a biodegradable physical barrier that limits the contact among injured sites for a protracted period 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[19\\]</u>. Hyalobarrier gel use was considered in this patient due to the assumption that presence of high amounts of HA on the surgical wound may cause a healing process without fibrosis and scarring. Given the stenosis of vagina mostly caused by the thick scar just at the surgical site, a second failure might be observed with surgery only. In fact, successful use of Hyalobarrier gel in such a condition was first reported by our team in the literature previously 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[20\\]</u>. As a result, use of adhesion-preventing agents may be considered in women who are scheduled for the surgical correction of vaginal agenesis.\n\n【40】Finally, when a patient is diagnosed to have vaginal agenesis, she and her family should be counseled in detail before the surgery. The surgical method with its possible complications including bladder and rectum injury should be discussed. Also, they should be informed about relatively long postoperative care period of almost 6 months which is critical for the success of the surgery when vaginal mold is removed and inserted on a daily basis. If postoperative recommendations are not performed properly, neovaginal space may be closed, and reobstruction of menstrual flow may occur which necessitates further surgical interventions.\n\n【41】In conclusion, in female patients with complete or partial vaginal agenesis and normal, functioning uterus, a combined perineal-abdominal surgical approach may be performed successfully in association with the use of specially designed vaginal mold and Hyalobarrier gel. However, further studies are needed to warrant the use of this surgical technique of combined perineal-abdominal approach in association with this type of mold and Hyalobarrier gel or other adhesion-preventing agents in patients with vaginal agenesis. Also, abdominal component of the surgery can be completed laparoscopically in experienced hands which may decrease the morbidity and provide a faster postoperative recovery compared to laparotomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

Clinical presentation includes fever, leucocystosis, and abdominal pain. CT SCAN is a must for diagnosis. The preferred treatment is either conservative, with intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous drainage, or splenectomy. We report the thirteen case of a splenic abscess after LSG. In our patient, the abscess occurred three weeks after LSG in a 21-year-old man, and it was successfully treated conservatively.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Morbid obesity is nowadays a common disease affecting large amount of adults worldwide. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is a simple procedure to treat morbid obesity. However, complications occur and include hemorrhage, leak of luminal contents, obstruction, and infection (wound and intra-abdominal abscess).

And to the best of our knowledge, there were only twelve cases reported in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 21-year-old obese male with a body mass index of 45 kg/m<sup>2</sup> underwent LSG in our department in April 2018. The patient did not have any past medical or surgical history. No systemic CT scan was done preoperatively, only gastroscopy that showed normal mucous of the stomach. The operation was very smooth without any complications: no splenic infarction nor a tear was detectable. No hemostatic agents were used. Immediate postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 2 after tolerating a clear diet. No routine CT scan or opacification was made. Three weeks after surgery, the patient presented high fever and chills and took 24 hours of oral antibiotics before consulting his surgeon who decided to rehospitalize the patient.\n\n【6】At admission, his temperature was 38.5°C, and pulse rate was 120/min with a normal blood pressure. The blood results revealed 17,700 WBC and a CRP level at 295. Abdominal CT scan  showed a splenic abscess of 10 cm with no evidence of leakage. Initial management included hydration, intravenous antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam), and percutaneous drainage . The liquid culture was negative. The drain was removed after two days to avoid the risk of splenic hemorrhage without follow-up imaging.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】Splenic abscess of 10 cm with no evidence of leakage.\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【10】Percutaneous drainage of the splenic abscess.\n\n【11】The patient got better clinically and a full fluids diet was initiated, but he continued to experience low grade fever with a WBC count of 14,400 and CRP at 240. A new abdominal CT scan showed a residual splenic collection of 2 × 3 cm with a pleural effusion . The pleural effusion was drained, and it revealed a transudate liquid with negative culture. The splenic collection was considered as a residual abscess, and then we decided to upgrade antibiotherapy to a larger broad-spectrum one (imipenem) without radiologic or surgical drainage of the residual splenic abscess. A total of ten days with intravenous antibiotic treatment was necessary before fever disappearance.

It was also reported after some gastric procedures like Nissen fundoplication and gastrectomy for cancer 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【17】Splenic abscess after LSG is a very rare condition, and the literature enumerates twelve patients who experienced this condition  通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–8\\]</u>. The mechanism of formation of splenic abscess described by the previous authors include iatrogenic splenic injury during surgery, splenic ischemia after LSG, extension from a gastric staple-line leak, and temporary immune suppression in the immediate postoperative course.\n\n【18】Table 1 \n\n【19】Characteristics of the different cases.\n\n【20】In our case, there was no evidence of leakage nor a spleen ischemia or a spleen injury during the operation. Therefore, the formation of splenic abscess could be related to temporary immune suppression that results from rapid weight loss, limited oral intake, and a transient bacteraemia as it was noticed by Sakran et al. 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In most of the cases, the patient presented with fever, leucocytosis, and left upper quadrant pain. Our patient experienced the same symptoms. The diagnosis was made on CT scan of the abdomen, as it remains the gold standard for diagnosis of splenic abscess 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Splenic abscesses tend to be polymicrobial 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[11, 12\\]</u>, so they should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4\\]</u>. Enteric Gram negative and Gram positive were the common organisms as presented in Table 1. In our case, the culture was negative because the patient started on antibiotics without our knowledge before being admitted.\n\n【23】Solitary spleen abscesses are actually treated with percutaneous or laparoscopic drainage, in order to preserve the spleen. When symptoms persist or when multiple abscesses exist, splenectomy remains the definitive management 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 11, 12\\]</u>. However, our patient experienced a good evolution and a stable condition under conservative treatment, although a residual collection was documented on the last CT scan.\n\n【24】After all, would a splenectomy be beneficial even if the patient is completely asymptomatic, knowing that he is actually 6 months off treatment postoperatively?\n\n【25】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【26】Splenic abscess is a very rare complication after LSG. The etiology of formation of splenic abscess needs further studies. The patient must benefit from a conservative treatment based on antibiotics and percutaneous drainage. The decision to undergo a splenectomy will be based on clinical status and response to treatment.\n\n【27】#### Consent\n\n【28】The consent was obtained from the patient.\n\n【29】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【30】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The physical examination revealed subcutaneous emphysema in zone II of the neck. The tomography revealed an anterior and proximal tracheal lesion, a 2-mm solution of continuity of the anterior infraglottic airway in the proximal third with subcutaneous emphysema and a decrease in the diameter of the airway at the level of the glottis. The PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. The medical procedure consisted of orotracheal intubation to guarantee the safety of the airway, in addition to close surveillance in the intensive care unit and constant monitoring of vital signs. In tracheal perforation due to closed neck trauma, it is recommended to evaluate the clinical parameters periodically, including the stability of respiration and subcutaneous emphysema.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Tracheobronchial injuries occurring after penetrating or blunt trauma are rare, although unfortunately they can be life-threatening. It has been indicated that a high percentage of these patients die before being admitted to the hospital, and a significant number die within the first hours after admission 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Penetrating injury to the airways can occur from sharp objects, or from wounds firearm injury 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>, while iatrogenic airway injury can occur during surgery, endotracheal intubation, or bronchoscopy 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. However, the incidence of airway injury is likely to be underestimated since these injuries are often poorly recognized and reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>. According to some case reports, the therapy of choice for these tracheal injuries is early surgical repair. However, conservative management using endotracheal tubes has also been reported 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. This article reports the case of a patient with tracheal perforation due to closed neck trauma, and the presence of SARS-CoV-2, who had conservative medical management through orotracheal intubation.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】The case of a 42-year-old female patient with no medical history is described. She was admitted to a high-complexity hospital after suffering a traffic accident. The patient presented amnesia of the event and an altered state of consciousness. She also presented facial trauma, closed trauma to the neck and left arm, and lacerations to the lower extremities.\n\n【6】Upon her admission, the following vital signs were observed: blood pressure 130/64 mmHg, heart rate 90 per minute, respiratory rate 17 per minute, and oxygen saturation 98%. The physical examination revealed an alert patient, oriented in the three spheres, with left periorbital ecchymosis, wound in the upper eyelid on its medial side, with little active bleeding and limited eye-opening. She was immobilized with a rigid collar, with a nonpulsatile hematoma in the neck area, with pain on palpation in the left lateral face, and with subcutaneous emphysema in zone II of the neck. Moreover, she had no stigmata of the chest  or abdominal trauma.\n\n【7】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【8】Chest X-ray: emphysema is observed in the cervical region, the cardiothoracic index was within normal limits, and no rib fractures, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion are identified, without consolidations or interstitial infiltrate.\n\n【9】High-risk mild cranial brain trauma was suspected with a left orbital fracture, without compromise of visual acuity, with closed cervical trauma, with soft signs of the airway and/or vascular injury. Initially, continuous monitoring was requested, intravenous fluids (500 cc bolus), angiotomography of neck vessels, and tomography of the paranasal sinuses and face, in addition to contrast-enhanced tomography of the chest and abdomen. Administration of tetanus toxoid, analgesics, and paraclinical were also ordered. Furthermore, the patient incidentally reported 5 days of dry cough, no runny nose, no fever, no signs of respiratory distress, and no diarrhea. However, due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, an antigen test and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were requested to detect the virus. The patient was isolated in the acute respiratory care unit.\n\n【10】The computerized axial tomography (CT) of the neck, thorax, and abdomen showed anterior and proximal tracheal injury and dissolution of continuity of 2 mm of the anterior infraglottic airway in the proximal third , with emphysema subcutaneous dissecting the visceral, carotid, and prevertebral space and causing anterior and middle pneumomediastinum, with a decrease in the diameter of the airway at the level of the glottis . The tomography of the paranasal sinuses showed fractures of the nasal bones, local and left periorbital edema. Simple skull CT showed no pathological findings. No lesions were found in large vessels of the neck . It was decided to intubate the patient on an emergency basis in the hands of anesthesiology with all protective measures in the context of a patient suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【12】A 2 mm continuity solution of the anterior infraglottic airway is observed.\n\n【13】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【14】Subcutaneous emphysema is observed dissecting the visceral, carotid, and prevertebral space and causing anterior and middle pneumomediastinum, with a decrease in the diameter of the airway at the level of the glottis.\n\n【15】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【16】No lesions are evident in large vessels of the neck.\n\n【17】The patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit due to anterior and proximal tracheal injury of the anterior infraglottic airway in medical management with orotracheal intubation. In addition, the result of the PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was positive, an issue that could complicate the outcome of the case. The medical conduct consisted of orotracheal intubation to guarantee the safety of the airway, in addition to close surveillance in the intensive care unit and constant monitoring of vital signs. During clinical surveillance, there was no evidence of an increase in subcutaneous emphysema, nor the presence of signs of respiratory distress.\n\n【18】In these cases, bronchoscopy should also be performed to confirm the diagnosis and see the injury site. However, considering that the patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2, the bronchoscopy was not performed because the risk of contagion could be increased during the procedure. Moreover, at that time, the patient already showed signs of improvement.\n\n【19】The patient was discharged on the eighth day after her admission with anterior and proximal tracheal injury and nasal fractures; she was given follow-up and outpatient rehabilitation.\n\n【20】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【21】In the present case, the conservative medical management of a tracheal perforation after blunt trauma in a patient diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 is described. Although the tracheobronchial injury is more common among women, men tend to have a higher risk of mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Moreover, the most frequent cause of tracheobronchial injuries due to blunt trauma is motor vehicle accidents 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【22】As observed in the present case, the typical findings in the context of tracheobronchial injury include subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. In the diagnosis of tracheal injury, the degree of clinical suspicion, CT, and bronchoscopy are helpful. Radiographic images may reveal pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or the tracheal tear itself 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【23】The treatment of tracheobronchial injury in most cases must be individualized, depending on the patient’s comorbidities, the clinical presentation, and the anatomy of the tracheobronchial injury. As in the present case, it has been described that in tracheobronchial lesions involving the mucosal layer with mediastinal or subcutaneous emphysema (level II lesions), patients are treated according to their manifestations with nonsurgical therapy. However, it has been reported that if managed conservatively, tracheal perforations are associated with a 10-fold increase in mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>, although in the absence of progressive deterioration, open lesions, or mediastinitis, conservative treatment has not been associated with increased mortality 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【24】As described in this report, it is recommended to periodically assess clinical parameters, including stability of respiration and subcutaneous emphysema 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【25】The prognosis for the patient with tracheobronchial injury depends on several factors related to the underlying clinical status of the patient, the degree of the tracheobronchial injury, and the type of repair 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>; consequently, the prognosis of the patient in the present case was good. However, it is necessary to highlight that when a tracheal perforation occurs, in addition to an infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there could be a greater risk of causing a ventilatory failure that could cause complications such as severe pneumonia due to COVID, a longer stay in intensive care unit and even death.\n\n【26】#### Data Availability\n\n【27】The clinical data utilized in this report are described in this article.\n\n【28】#### Consent\n\n【29】The patient’s legal representative signed the informed consent related to hospital care and for academic purposes.

Although Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is associated with diminished bone mineral density in addition to multiple skeletal abnormalities, there are few reports of the association with stress fractures or pathologic fractures in low energy trauma or delayed healing of fractures. Presented is a case of a young adult male with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome presenting with multiple episodes of long bone fractures caused by low energy trauma with one of the fractures exhibiting significantly delayed healing. The patient was also found to have an asymptomatic stress fracture of the lower extremity, another finding of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome rarely reported in the literature. A thorough review of the literature and comprehensive presentation of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is provided in conjunction with our case.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Case Report\n\n【3】An 18-year-old male with history of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome diagnosed at the age of two presented with acute right mid leg pain while cutting to kick the ball during a soccer game. He reported a history of prior right leg fracture four years ago sustained while playfully wrestling with his younger brother. After the prior fracture healed, the patient noticed a bump at the level of his mid right shin, which corresponded to the site of the patient’s current leg pain. He denied any pain in the right leg prior to sustaining the fracture, and he denied any other preexisting medical conditions.\n\n【4】Presenting radiographs of the right tibia-fibula showed mild deformity of the right tibia from prior healed fracture with mildly displaced and comminuted fracture through the mid diaphysis of the tibia . Focal anterior cortical thickening of the tibia was present at the level of the acute fracture. The fracture was treated with closed reduction and casting. Serial follow-up radiographs obtained over the next 13 months showed delayed and incomplete union across the tibia fracture . At the 13-month follow-up, additional radiographs of the left tibia were obtained to evaluate a focal painless bump of the mid left shin the patient reported developing shortly after his right tibia fracture. Left tibia radiographs showed focal anterior cortical thickening of the mid tibia diaphysis corresponding to the palpable bump . No fracture line or lytic bone lesion was appreciated. The patient did not return for additional follow-up.\n\n【5】(a)\n\n【6】(b)\n\n【7】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【8】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【9】Young adult male with history of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome diagnosed at 2 years of age.

Technique: (a) AP radiograph kVp = 63, mAs = 3, and (b) lateral radiograph kVp = 63, mAs = 3.\n\n【21】The patient returned to clinic 4 years later for treatment of a left olecranon fracture sustained during a fall playing soccer 3.5 weeks earlier. Presenting radiographs showed a mildly displaced subacute fracture through the left olecranon . There was early cortication along the fracture margins and more osteolysis than expected along the fracture line given the reported age of the fracture. Therefore, a bone biopsy of the fracture was performed, which was negative for neoplasm and infection. Tension band wiring of the olecranon fracture was subsequently performed . Early remodeling without bridging bone formation was present on two-month follow-up radiographs . The patient did not return for any additional follow-up of his elbow fracture.\n\n【22】(a)\n\n【23】(b)\n\n【24】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【25】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 4 </u>\n\n【26】Young adult male with history of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome diagnosed at 2 years of age.

Introduction\n\n【60】Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS) was first described in 1868 by Auguste Rothmund in inbred family members with an unusual rash and juvenile cataracts 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. Sydney Thomson in 1923 described a condition in patients with a similar rash and skeletal anomalies but no cataracts, which he called “poikiloderma congenitale” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. In 1957, Taylor postulated that these two syndromes share the same pathophysiology and proposed the name Rothmund-Thomson syndrome 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>. RTS is a rare genetic disorder with only a few hundred cases reported in the literature. RTS typically presents with a poikilodermatous rash in infancy in conjunction with a wide array of other dermal, skeletal, and gastrointestinal findings. While RTS is associated with diminished bone mineral density creating a potential risk for pathologic and stress related fractures, there is little literature discussing the occurrence of fractures in RTS patients. This case illustrates the risk of stress and acute insufficiency fractures in a patient with diffusely demineralized bones related to RTS.\n\n【61】##### 2.2. Etiology and Incidence\n\n【62】RTS is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. It is frequently, but not always, associated with a mutation in the RECQL4 gene. This association was first discovered in 1999 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u> and has led to RTS being divided into two disease types: patients with a mutation in the RECQL4 gene (RTS type 2) and patients without RECQL4 gene mutation (RTS type 1). Approximately 66% of patients with RTS have a mutation in the RECQL4 gene, which encodes one of the five proteins in the RecQ helicase family of proteins 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. RecQ helicase proteins unwind DNA during replication or repair, and mutations in the RECQL4 gene are believed to cause inaccurate DNA replication and repair leading to an increase in genome instability 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. It is uncertain how this inaccurate DNA replication and repair lead to the specific physiologic abnormalities associated with RTS. While a specific gene mutation has not been identified for most of the other third of patients with RTS, it is believed that most of these patients likely have a mutation in another gene encoding a protein in the RecQ helicase family. Recently, in 2010, a second gene (C16orf57) mutation was identified in three families with RTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. The C16orf57 gene has been found to contribute to synthesis of U6 snRNA, which is important for gene splicing 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. However, how mutations in the C16orf57 gene specifically lead to the development of RTS and the prevalence of the C16orf57 gene mutation in the RTS population remain unknown.\n\n【63】RTS is typically diagnosed in the first two years of life when the characteristic skin rash appears. No race or gender predilection for the disease has been identified. The incidence of RTS and carrier frequency of the RECQL4 gene mutation is unknown; however, there have been less than 400 reported cases in the literature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【64】##### 2.3. Clinical Findings\n\n【65】The diagnosis of RTS is made on clinical findings. The diagnosis of RTS can be made definitively if the characteristic poikilodermatous rash demonstrates the classic age of onset (between three and six months old), spread (beginning in the face and spreading to extensor surfaces of the extremities), and appearance (erythema/swelling gradually transitioning to chronic hyper- and hypopigmentation, telangiectasias, and skin atrophy) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. A diagnosis of probable RTS can be made if an atypical poikilodermatous rash is present in conjunction with two of the following findings: sparse scalp hair, sparse eyelashes and/or eyebrows, small stature, gastrointestinal disturbances in childhood, radial ray defects, radiographic bone abnormalities, dental anomalies, nail abnormalities, hyperkeratosis, juvenile cataracts, and osteosarcoma/skin cancers 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【66】The characteristic poikilodermatous rash is invariably present, typically presenting before one year of age. Areas of decreased scalp hair or eyebrows/eyelashes are also common. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as chronic diarrhea or emesis have been reported in approximately 17% of patients. Although juvenile cataracts are one of the first described findings of RTS, it is a relatively uncommon finding being seen in less than 10% of patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【67】##### 2.4. Imaging Findings\n\n【68】While most of the findings of RTS will be elicited on clinical exam and history, there are several characteristic findings that will be encountered on imaging of the teeth and skeleton. Several types of dental abnormalities have been described in association with RTS, including rudimentary or hypoplastic teeth, microdontia, delayed eruption, supernumerary or absent teeth, ectopic eruption, and increased incidence of caries 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10, 11\\]</u>. Skeletal anomalies are seen in approximately 75% of patients, with anomalies including osteopenia, pathologic fractures, dislocations, patella ossification anomalies, metaphyseal irregularities, and radial limb abnormalities 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9, 12\\]</u>. A strong association has been found between mutations in the RECQL4 gene and the presence of these skeletal anomalies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[12\\]</u>.\n\n【69】Patients with RTS carry increased risk of developing both skin cancers and osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is the most common malignancy occurring in RTS, with an incidence as high as 30% reported in some studies 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. A strong association has also been found between osteosarcoma and presence of the RECQL4 gene mutation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13\\]</u>. The appearance of osteosarcoma in RTS is similar to sporadic osteosarcoma with RTS patients having a slightly earlier mean age at diagnosis of between 9 and 12 years of age 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[13, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【70】##### 2.5. Treatment and Prognosis\n\n【71】There is little published data on the life span of patients with RTS. However, in the absence of malignancy, the life expectancy is likely close to normal. Treatment of RTS primarily consists of preventative and surveillance care. Baseline skeletal radiographs by 5 years of age are recommended to identify underlying skeletal dysplasias, as are annual ophthalmic exams to identify cataracts. Calcium and vitamin D supplements may also be given in RTS patients that have bone demineralization or history of fractures. Patients are advised to avoid excessive sunlight, and close monitoring for changes in skin lesions is recommended due to the increased incidence of skin cancer. No screening recommendations for osteosarcoma have been described, but a low threshold for imaging is recommended in patients presenting with bone pain due to the increased risk for malignancy. The treatment recommendations for skin cancer and osteosarcoma are the same for RTS patients as for the rest of the population 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【72】##### 2.6. Differential Diagnosis\n\n【73】Two other syndromes are also associated with mutations of the RECQL4 gene, RAPADILINO, and Baller-Gerold syndrome. Patients with RAPADILINO will often have osteopenia, small stature, radial ray defects, patellar hypoplasia, and GI abnormalities similar to RTS patients. However, RAPADILINO lacks the characteristic poikiloderma rash, with patients instead presenting with café au lait spots 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. Baller-Gerold syndrome (BGS) also presents with osteopenia, short stature, radial ray defects, and other skeletal dysplasias similar to RTS, and patients with BGS may have poikiloderma. However, BGS patients frequently exhibit craniosynostosis, which is not typically associated with RTS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8, 15\\]</u>.\n\n【74】Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) describes a group of heredity disorders of connective tissues characterized by increased bone fragility and decreased bone mineral density. OI is the most common cause of pediatric osteoporosis with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 12,000 to 15,000 children 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>. While some forms of OI present with multiple deforming fractures or perinatal death, the more retarded forms of the disease can present with short stature, osteoporosis, and only a few bone fractures, similar to RTS. However, OI is not associated with radial ray deformities; and wormian bones are present in the skull in approximately 60% of patients with OI 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[16\\]</u>, a feature not common in RTS. No specific skin changes have been described with OI. However, some forms of OI are associated with a blue sclera, which is a characteristic not seen in RTS.\n\n【75】#### 3\\. Conclusion\n\n【76】Rothmund-Thomson syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder most commonly characterized on imaging by dental and skeletal abnormalities, particularly radial ray defects. Skeletal abnormalities are particularly common in RTS patients with mutations in the RECQL4 gene, and RTS patients with skeletal abnormalities are at increased risk for pathologic fragility fractures and delayed fracture healing due to associated diminished bone mineral density. Unfortunately RTS patients with the RECQL4 gene mutation are also at a high risk of developing osteosarcoma, which may also present as a pathologic fracture. Therefore, careful consideration for underlying malignancy should be made in all fractures occurring in RTS patients.\n\n【77】#### Abbreviations\n\n| BGS: | Baller-Gerold syndrome |\n| --- | --- |\n| cm: | Centimeters |\n| FOV: | Field of view |\n| kVp: | Peak kilovoltage |\n| mAs: | Milliampere-second |\n| mL: | Milliliters |\n| mm: | Millimeters |\n| MRI: | Magnetic resonance imaging |\n| OI: | Osteogenesis imperfecta |\n| PD: | Proton density |\n| RTS: | Rothmund-Thompson syndrome |\n| ST: | Slice thickness |\n| TR: | Relaxation time |\n| TE: | Echo time. |\n\n【79】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【80】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The author declares that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

The patient, a 42-year-old female, presented after hemithyroidectomy for benign follicular adenoma with lower back pain associated with fever and sweating. A lytic lesion of the left sacral bone was found on the CT with biopsy showing metastatic carcinoma with morphology and immunophenotype of thyroid gland primary tumor proven to be FVPTC. The patient had completion thyroidectomy with benign pathology.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Occult presentation of primary thyroid malignancy can be defined by the McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine 通用删除7(英):<u>(2002)</u> as “Unknown primary malignancy that is symptomless, which first manifest itself as metastasis or secondary-para-neoplastic phenomena” 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.

In this case the patient presented with an apparent metastasis with pathology showing benign follicular adenoma.\n\n【4】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【5】A 42-year-old female presented with right neck swelling which was initially diagnosed as follicular adenoma. Patient underwent a right hemithyroidectomy and isthmus resection and was maintained on levothyroxine. Nine years later she presented with lower back pain associated with fever and sweating. CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed lytic lesion of the sacrum. Three-phase bone scintigraphy showed substantial perfusion to the soft tissue mass located in left side of sacrum with photogenic area in the left sacroiliac joint region, surrounded medially with actively metabolic bony lesion. Sacral biopsy showed metastatic carcinoma with morphology and immunophenotype suggestive of thyroid gland primary tumor (positive thyroglobulin) and positive CK7+/CK20− . Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan showed large destructive left sacral lesion of 6.2 × 3.5 × 8.6 cm in size with soft tissue component involving S1, S2, and S3 vertebra, extending to the neural foramina of the involved vertebra and L5 vertebra, as well with very intense hypermetabolism . Patient was having decreased sense of vibration on her left lower limb. Patient was referred to the oncology center for palliative radiotherapy and completed 13 cycles. Patient was found to have left lobe thyroid nodule of 0.43 × 0.87 × 0.8 cm; FNA showed benign follicular hyperplastic nodule. Thyroglobulin level was elevated up to >600.0. Patient had completion thyroidectomy and lymph nodes dissection. Histopathology showed benign nodular hyperplasia of thyroid with negative lymph nodes. Iodine 131 uptake scan showed minimal uptake in thyroid bed, high uptake in pelvic region on the sacral mass, and hot round area in the posterior parietal region of the skull.\n\n【6】(a)\n\n【7】(b)\n\n【8】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【9】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【10】PET CT left osteolytic sacral lesion of 6.2 × 3.5 × 8.6 cm S1, S2, and S3 vertebral involvement extending to the neural foramina with very intense hypermetabolism.\n\n【11】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 2 </u>\n\n【12】HE ×4 showing tumor invading bone.\n\n【13】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【14】This patient was found to have sacral mass which was diagnosed as an invasive tumor of thyroid origin. This was proven via the characteristic of the tumor with 通用删除7(英):<u>(1)</u> bone invasion , 通用删除7(英):<u>(2)</u> follicles filled with colloid, and 通用删除7(英):<u>(3)</u> positive thyroglobulin and CK7+/CK20−. This current histopathology finding could be presented in papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid carcinoma, and FVPTC, but the histopathology result was more suggestive of FVPTC which is represented in the higher magnification micrograph showing optical clear, overlapping, and grooved nuclei. This is highly suggestive of the papillary characteristics 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u> (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)).\n\n【15】(a)\n\n【16】(b)\n\n【17】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【18】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 3 </u>\n\n【19】(a) HE ×20-nuclear overlapping is obvious in the lining tumor cells. (b) HE ×40-nuclear clearing in some nuclei .\n\n【20】FVPTC has follicular architectural pattern with nuclear features of PTC. FVPTC can be misdiagnosed as follicular adenoma or follicular thyroid carcinoma in the presence of capsular or vascular invasion. It can present in larger size and in younger age groups. Although it is believed that FVPTC has similar prognosis of PTC, it can mimic the features of follicular neoplasm in terms of distal metastasis with absence of lymph node involvement and prevalence of vascular and capsular invasion. In spite of that, recent studies show FVPTC has favorable clinic pathological features compared to PTC, but similar long-term outcomes 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[3\\]</u>.\n\n【21】In this case the primary tumor was not found since both histopathology reports for the thyroid tissue in 2003 and 2013 revealed benign follicular adenoma. The absence of the primary tumor in this case can be either due to regression of tumor at the primary site with distant bone metastasis or due to a small primary tumor that could not be detected despite thorough examination 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4\\]</u>.\n\n【22】It is believed that 1%–3% of thyroid cancer can develop distant metastasis. Occult clinical presentation delays the diagnosis and management of metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. After the fourth decade 10% of patients with papillary thyroid cancer develop distant metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Metastases outside the neck and mediastinum are considered in 11% of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. 2–13% of patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer develop bone metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>. Bone is the second most commonly involved site after the lungs 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Compared to follicular thyroid carcinoma 28–97% papillary thyroid cancer has 1.4–7% of bone metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[7\\]</u>.\n\n【23】There have been cases in the literature reported in papillary thyroid metastasizing to the bone at different metastatic sites . Bone metastasis increases mortality rate, decreases the quality of life, and shortens the patients’ survival 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>. The presence of metachronous bone metastasis alone is a significant indicator of poor prognosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>. Large invasive bone metastases can be managed with aggressive surgical approach. Nevertheless, not all bone lesions are amenable to surgical excision 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【24】Table 1 \n\n【25】Cases of occult and overt papillary thyroid carcinoma metastasis to the bone indicating different metastatic sites.\n\n【26】Giving this case as an example, surgical excision in her condition will affect mobilization in addition to the neurological function due to the extensive invasionue to the extensive invasiveness to the bone and the involvement of the nerve roots at the level of the tumor. Alternative treatment such as arterial embolization or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation can be offered in her case 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>. Patient’s case was discussed in the tumor multidisciplinary meeting and conservative palliative management was decided for the patient as surgery’s risk exceeded the benefit in this case.\n\n【27】#### 4\\. Conclusion\n\n【28】This case illustrates a rare presentation of metastatic lesion to the sacrum and the skull of histopathology highly suggestive of FVPTC. In addition to the rare finding of absence of primary lesion the histopathology result of the thyroidectomy showed benign follicular adenoma. Metastasis to the bone is considered more common in follicular thyroid carcinoma compared to papillary thyroid carcinoma which tends to increase the morbidity and mortality. Although FVPTC can mimic follicular thyroid cancer, it has similar prognosis to papillary thyroid carcinoma. Not all bone metastases can be managed surgically depending on the location and the postoperative outcome. Alternative treatment should be considered to improve patient morbidity.\n\n【29】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Conflict of Interests</u>\n\n【30】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors have no conflict of interests to declare.</u>\n\n【31】通用结尾删除-1:<u>#### Acknowledgment</u>\n\n【32】通用结尾删除-1:<u>The authors would like to thank Dr. Michael Jansen, Consultant Histopathologist and Neuropathologist, at the Department of Pathology and Genetics in Dubai Hospital, for his contribution to the case.</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}

So far there are no cases in the literature defining the histological features of this morphologic spectrum in detail. In this study we presented two classical-type cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma cases with histologic findings resembling cavernous hemangioma in company with clinical and histopathological data. Cases. One hundred and eighty-five classical-type cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma lesions in 79 patients were assessed retrospectively in terms of histopathological features. Findings of two cases showing features of cavernous hemangioma-like Kaposi sarcoma whose clinical data could be accessed were presented in accompany with the literature data. Both cases were detected to have bluish-purple, protruded, irregularly bordered cutaneous lesions. Histopathological examination revealed a lesion formed by cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures organized in a lobular pattern that became dilated and filled with blood. Typical histological findings of early-stage KS, consisting of mononuclear inflammation, extravasated erythrocytes, and a few immature vascular structures in superficial dermis, were observed. All cases were serologically HIV-1 negative. A positive reaction with HHV-8, CD31, CD34, and D2-40 monoclonal antibodies was identified at both cavernous hemangioma-like areas and in immature vascular structures. Results. Cavernous hemangioma-like Kaposi sarcoma is a rare Kaposi sarcoma variant presenting with diagnostic challenges, that may be confused with hemangioma. As characteristic morphological features may not be observed in every case, it is important for diagnostic purposes to show immunohistochemical HHV-8 positivity in this variant.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a rare vascular lesion with four different epidemiological forms (classical, African (endemic), iatrogenic, and AIDS related) caused by human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. It may have various clinical and histopathological features. More than 10 histological subtypes has been defined so far (e.g. anaplastic, lymphangioma-like, and micronodular KS) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. While clinical appearance of lesions is different from usual type KS in some subtypes (e.g. bullous, verrucous, and ecchymotic KS), most histological subtypes do not have a prominent discriminatory clinical feature 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–7\\]</u>. Despite being variable by lesion stage, some characteristic findings are important in histopathological diagnosis. Among these are immature vascular formations intersecting collagen to form cleft- or mesh-like patterns and spindle cells that are considered to be the main neoplastic component. Hyaline globules, hemosiderin pigment, and lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory cells frequently accompany neoplastic vascular structures 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8\\]</u>. In KS spindle cells and neoplastic vascular structures react positively with endothelial markers (e.g. CD31, CD34, and D2-40) 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most important point in the diagnosis of KS is to show HHV-8 immunopositivity supporting histological findings in the neoplastic component 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>.\n\n【4】Since they are considerably rare, we discussed two cases of classical-type cutaneous KS exhibiting cavernous hemangioma-like features in company with clinical and histopathological findings and stressed the importance of HHV-8 immunoreactivity in differential diagnosis of these lesions.\n\n【5】#### 2\\. Case Report\n\n【6】This study enrolled 185 cases of classical-type cutaneous KS lesions of 79 patients who were diagnosed at Bülent Ecevit University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Pathology, and Dr. Lütfi Kırdar Kartal Training and Research Hospital between 2001 and 2012 and whose data could be retrieved. Clinical information of the cases was obtained by screening medical files and reassessing materials of pathology archive for histopathological and immunohistochemical data. No patient had a history of immunosuppressive drug use or transplantation. All patients were human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) negative.\n\n【7】##### 2.1. Histopathological and Immunohistochemical Assessment\n\n【8】Diagnosis of KS was confirmed by reviewing of Hematoxyline&Eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Histopathological progression of the lesions were grouped into early (patchy), intermediate (plaque), and late (nodule/tumor)-stage KS according to previously specified criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 8\\]</u>. All lesions were examined immunohistochemically with HHV-8 (LNA-1) and endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, and D2-40).\n\n【9】Among retrospectively examined biopsy samples, lesions, the dominant histopathological component which is composed by cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures and in which typical histological features of KS are observed at focal areas, were classified as cavernous hemangioma-like Kaposi sarcoma (CHLKS) . Vascular structures that were lined by flattened endothelium, dilated, and filled by blood were considered to have cavernous hemangioma-like feature. Characteristic findings of KS (e.g. those of immature vascular proliferations that are infiltrative bordered, contain intracytoplasmic lumen, and form mesh- and cleft-like structures and/or spindle cell proliferation) were assessed in accordance with the previously specified criteria 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 8\\]</u>.\n\n【10】#### 3\\. Results\n\n【11】Retrospective assessment of archive materials of 185 classical-type cutaneous KS lesions belonging to 79 patients revealed that histopathological features of lesions of 2 cases were consistent with CHLKS. Clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical findings of these cases were summarized below.\n\n【12】##### 3.1. Case 1\n\n【13】###### 3.1.1. Clinical Assessment\n\n【14】A 69-year-old man presented with purple spots at both feet. The lesions had begun at the lateral aspects of the feet and their number and size increased gradually. He had a 10-year hypertension history for which he had been taking medications. Dermatologic examination revealed multiple purple-colored plaques and papules of 0.5–1.5 cm, some of which were covered with crust on the dorsum of feet and around the ankles. He had no pathology in laboratory and serologic examinations. Physical examination revealed no signs suggestive of systemic involvement of KS, including suggestive symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and visceral involvement. He was HIV-1 negative in serological examination. Biopsies were taken from the lesions with an initial diagnosis of KS.\n\n【15】The patient underwent cryotherapy for the Kaposi sarcoma lesions in lower extremity. The patient was followed at 6-month intervals for 22 months, and new cutaneous lesions of Kaposi sarcoma in lower extremities were treated with cryotherapy. No systemic involvement or an aggressive course was present.\n\n【16】###### 3.1.2. Histopathological Findings\n\n【17】H&E sections of the lesion demonstrated a dilated, blood-filled vascular proliferation lined by flattened endothelium stretching from papillary dermis under hyperkeratotic squamous epithelium to reticular dermis, forming lobular patterns. A few thick-walled vascular structures were observed in that lesion that was composed of thin-walled vessels. A hemosiderin accumulation was noted at the vessel wall and surrounding stroma. Chronic inflammatory cells and histological findings of early-stage KS such as vascular structures forming clefts, hemosiderin pigment, and extravasated erythrocytes were observed around the cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures, and these findings were more prominent at papillary dermis. At these areas a prominence of nucleolus and mild atypia was notable in endothelial cells lining vascular structures. The lesion did not show spindle cell proliferation, a finding observed at advanced stages of KS. Cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures formed about 80% of the lesion, and typical histopathological findings of early-stage KS were observable at focal sites inside the lesion.\n\n【18】##### 3.2. Case 2\n\n【19】###### 3.2.1. Clinical Assessment\n\n【20】A 70-year-old female patient presented with the complaint of purple discolorations on the dorsum of the right foot, which had been present for 2 years and growing in number. Her past history was remarkable for an operation against colon carcinoma 10 years ago. She had not taken chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She also had goiter for 5 years. Dermatologic examination revealed multiple purple-colored macular lesions with diameters ranging from 0.5 to 1 cm on the dorsum of the right foot. Her serologic examination was negative for HIV-1. Systemic examination and laboratory tests were negative for a finding suggestive of systemic involvement of KS. Biopsies were taken from the lesions with an initial diagnosis of KS.\n\n【21】The patient was treated with local excision and cryotherapy for cutaneous Kaposi sarcoma lesions. The patient was followed at six month periods for a total of 11 months. During follow-up, local recurrences were detected in lower and upper extremities and treated with cryotherapy. No systemic involvement or an aggressive course was present during follow-up.\n\n【22】###### 3.2.2. Histopathological Findings\n\n【23】H&E sections of the lesion revealed a vascular proliferation forming more than 90% of the lesion at the dermis, which had similar features with the first case. The lesion was composed of vascular structures filled by blood, which were lined by flattened endothelium and organized as lobular patterns, some of which included fibrous septa. Some vascular structures were closely spaced from skin adnexae that were surrounded by hemosiderin pigment. At the papillary dermis adjacent to the lesion were immature vascular structures intersecting collagen and extravasated erythrocytes, findings of the early-stage KS. No spindle cell proliferation was evident in the lesion.\n\n【24】###### 3.2.3. Immunohistochemical Findings\n\n【25】Immunohistochemical examinations of lesions from both cases showed a strong reaction with endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, and D2-40) and HHV-8 (LNA-1) both in endothelia of the cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures and at the areas of early-stage KS. Endothelia of the mature vascular structures adjacent to the lesions had a positive reaction with Factor VIIIra whereas neoplastic vascular structures were negative. A focal positive reaction was present with actin and desmin at the walls of the cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures. In the light of clinical, histopathological, and immunohistochemical findings, both lesions were interpreted as classical-type early-stage cutaneous KS, that showed features similar to cavernous hemangioma.\n\n【26】#### 4\\. Discussion\n\n【27】KS is a vascular neoplasm with a low malignancy potential, which is caused by HHV-8, has four different epidemiological forms, and has considerably different clinical and histopathological features 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 8, 12\\]</u>. Cases in which the typical histological features of KS are dominant are designated as usual type KS, and these lesions are classified into patch, plaque, and nodule phases, depending on the clinical progression 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>. The most common histological subtype in all epidemiological forms of KS is the usual type KS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 3\\]</u>. Other common histological subtypes include lymphangioma-like and lymphangiectatic types 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–4, 13\\]</u>. While bullous, verrucous, and ecchymotic type KS lesions include clinically distinguishable features, most histological subtypes cannot be distinguished clinically from the usual type KS lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5, 6\\]</u>. Anaplastic KS and lymphangioma-like KS have been reported to have a more aggressive course than usual type KS 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 4, 14\\]</u>.\n\n【28】A wide spectrum of clinical and histopathological morphologies of KS poses a difficulty in differential diagnosis and a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[15, 16\\]</u>. In certain areas of our country classical-type KS is a commonly encountered cutaneous vascular neoplasm. Thus, knowledge of the histological subtypes and a search for the presence of the virus HHV-8 in cases suspected for KS are important for differential diagnosis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9–11\\]</u>.\n\n【29】Studies investigating histological subtypes of KS have been mostly case reports including a low number of cases. There are a few studies studying histological subtypes of KS in large samples 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2–6, 16, 17\\]</u>. In this study 185 classical-type cutaneous KS lesions from 79 patients were retrospectively assessed, and two cases showing cavernous hemangioma-like features were reported with regard to histopathological features and differential diagnosis in company with the literature data.\n\n【30】In our study both cases considered as having CHLKS were elderly patients having multiple cutaneous lesions of blue-purple color located in lower extremity. These lesions include typical clinical findings of early-stage KS and do not contain distinguishing features. No history of drug use with attending immunosuppression, transplantation, or HIV infection was notable after clinical and laboratory examinations in the patients.\n\n【31】The common histopathological features of the lesions considered as CHLKS were formation of nearly all lesions by cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures and the presence of typical histological features of early-stage KS at focal areas. The congested vascular structures forming the main component of the lesions are lined by flattened endothelium, and an intimal thickening is notable at the walls of some vascular structures. Although there are no evident atypia in endothelial layer, some endothelial cells became prominent to form protrusions into the lumen. Hemosiderin pigment accumulation is observed at the vessel walls and the surrounding stroma . In the first case, cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures formed nearly the entire lesion, and typical areas of early-stage KS were hardly distinguished. In the second case, on the other hand, characteristic findings of early-stage KS including chronic-type inflammatory cells at the papillary dermis adjacent to the lesion were more marked. It was noteworthy in one case that cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures were in close proximity with skin adnexae without infiltrating them . Immunohistochemical examination of lesions of both cases revealed a strong positive reaction with endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, and D2-40) and HHV-8 (LNA-1) in both endothelial lining of cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures and at areas of typical early-stage KS. While a positive reaction with Factor VIIIra was observed in endothelia of the mature vascular structures neighboring the lesion, no reaction was observed in neoplastic vascular structures. A focal positive reaction with actin and desmin was detected at the walls of the cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures. In the light of all these clinical, laboratory, and histopathological findings, these two cases were interpreted as classical-type cutaneous KS showing features similar to cavernous hemangioma.\n\n【32】Differential diagnosis of CHLKS includes many reactive and benign vascular lesions 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 15, 16\\]</u>. In addition, dilated vascular structures resembling cavernous hemangioma may also be seen around the spindle cell proliferation in some lesions at the nodular stage of the usual type of KS . These vascular formations do not contain a prominent wall, and they consist of either spindle cells giving a positive reaction with HHV-8 or a single-row endothelial layer . In these lesions spindle cell proliferation typical of advanced-stage KS is prominent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 18\\]</u>.\n\n【33】(a)\n\n【34】(b)\n\n【35】(a)   \n(b)\n\n【36】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n| Biopsy samples of both cases reveal lesions composed of dilated vascular structures with blood-filled lumen.

Cavernous hemangioma is a vascular lesion that is seen particularly in childhood period and more commonly involves the upper part of the trunk 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 19, 20\\]</u>. These lesions have a less defined border and a deeper location, and they may contain degenerative changes including thrombus and dystrophic calcification. Cavernous hemangiomas have dilated vascular structures lined by flattened endothelium, some of which have thick walls containing intimal fibrosis. Mature endothelial cells in cavernous hemangioma give a positive reaction with Factor VIIIra, and pericytic cells give a positive reaction with actin/desmin. Histological differential diagnosis from KS importantly includes spindle cell proliferation, endothelial atypia, and inability to see neoplastic and abnormal vessels intersecting collagen. Absence of immunohistochemical HHV-8 reaction is a finding in favor of cavernous hemangioma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 15, 19, 20\\]</u>.\n\n【59】Another lesion in the differential diagnosis of CHLKS is spindle cell hemangioma. Clinically, they present with purple-red, painless, nodular at the acral regions. Histologically, they are formed by spindle cell proliferation forming clefts intertwined with thin-walled cavernous hemangioma-like vascular structures. In some cases, similar to hemangioendotheliomas, an intracytoplasmic lumen or a vacuole may be seen in neoplastic cells. The component consisting of spindle cells does not react with endothelial cell markers and it is positive for vimentin/actin/desmin.

The presence of cardiac metastases, often in the pericardium, besides indicating disseminated oncological disease, represents a diagnostic challenge since they tend to be asymptomatic. Malignant cutaneous melanoma (MCM) is the neoplasm that most often affects the heart. Patients and Methods. The authors describe a case report of a 59-year-old female patient with a history of non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, and remitting cutaneous malignant melanoma who underwent skin excision, lymphadenectomy, and adjuvant chemotherapy in 1996. In April 2014, she resorted to emergency service due to epigastric pain and progressive tiredness. Due to the persistence of the complaints, abdominal ultrasound was performed, which showed a large pericardial effusion, corroborated later by teleradiography and echocardiography. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis, which isolated neoplastic cells. A computed tomography study of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed bilateral and pericardial pleural effusion, as well as alterations suggestive of pericardial and pulmonary metastasis. Later, fine-needle aspiration puncture of the left posterior cervical nodule confirmed histologically malignant melanoma metastasis. Discussion. Given the natural history of melanoma that when metastasized has an overall survival of 15–20% for 5 years, its metastatic spread may occur several years after its surgical excision. Thus, patients with a history of melanoma and heart failure who develop new cardiac symptoms of unknown aetiology should undergo imaging studies such as echocardiography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n【2】#### 1\\. Introduction\n\n【3】Primary cardiac tumours are specific cases, and in adults, the most frequent malignant tumours are angiosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, and fibrosarcomas 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1–3\\]</u>. Regarding benign neoplasms, myxomas and lipomas are the most prevalent 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1\\]</u>.\n\n【4】The heart and pericardium are often affected in the context of disseminated metastatic tumour 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–6\\]</u>. Secondary cardiac metastasis is found in 20% of autopsies and approximately 10% of metastatic cancer patients 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4–6\\]</u>. Any cardiac structure may be metastasized, but the epicardium is the preferred site, as described in 75.5% of the cases, and at least half of these are accompanied by pericardial effusion 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. The main forms of neoplastic dissemination are essentially by lymphatic route, hematogenous route, and contiguous extension 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>.\n\n【5】The main malignancies with frequent cardiac involvement are the lung and breast cancers, mainly due to their anatomical proximity and high prevalence 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 6, 7\\]</u>. Nonepithelial tumours have cardiac involvement in 22.7% of cases 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>. Lymphomas, in the context of secondary immunodeficiency, also present an extensive cardiac involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2\\]</u>.\n\n【6】Cardiac metastases indicate a state of advanced oncological disease, which usually are asymptomatic 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 5\\]</u>. In some cases, they may manifest as arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, pericardial effusion, and acute heart failure 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 3–5\\]</u>.\n\n【7】Cardiac tamponade as the first manifestation of neoplasia is unlikely since, in addition to pericardial infiltration by malignant cells, the presence of other circumstances, such as an acute event or even lymphatic obstruction, is necessary 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 6\\]</u>.\n\n【8】#### 2\\. Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 59-year-old female patient presented with a personal history of non-insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, usually medicated with metformin, perindopril, and simvastatin.\n\n【10】The patient attended to emergency service (ES) due to epigastric pain and feeling of fullness, for which was submitted to dioctyl sulfosuccinate enema and later discharged. Due to the persistence of the complaints and, now, with progressive tiredness, the patient frequented the ES two days later, where she underwent an abdominal ultrasound, which revealed pericardial effusion.\n\n【11】Objectively, on admission, the patient was conscious, oriented, collaborative, eupneic at rest and hemodynamically stable with rhythmic heart tones, no murmurs, decreased vesicular murmur in the right pulmonary base, free and defenceless abdomen, and lower limbs without oedema.\n\n【12】The patient displayed on electrocardiogram a sinus rhythm, 90 bpm heart rate, low amplitude QRS complexes, and nonspecific alterations in ventricular repolarization; chest X-ray was performed with increased cardiothoracic index and bilateral pleural effusion, especially at the base of the right hemithorax; echocardiogram was with large pericardial effusion “swinging heart” and partial collapse of the right heart chambers. The patient is admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit, in the context of cardiac tamponade.\n\n【13】During hospitalization, the patient underwent: pericardiocentesis, with a total drainage of 1250 cc, whose fluid, according to the pathological anatomy, evidenced neoplastic cells. She also underwent a thoracic-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography which revealed bilateral pleural effusion, with adjacent parenchymal atelectasis, slight pericardial effusion , and zones on the left side, with clear pericardial thickening suggestive of pericardial metastasis, after intravenous contrast. Several nodules in all lung lobes were indicative of metastases. The patient also underwent fine-needle aspiration biopsy of a cervical nodule, which has shown to be a melanoma metastasis. Later on, it was found out that the patient had malignant melanoma with inguinal ganglion metastasis in 1995 and completed chemotherapy, cutaneous excision, and lymphadenectomy in 1996.\n\n【14】通用删除16(英):<u>Figure 1 </u>\n\n【15】Thoracic computed tomography showing the presence of pericardial effusion.\n\n【16】During hospitalization, the patient had several periods of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, despite chemical cardioversion with amiodarone. The patient was discharged with oral anticoagulation and digoxin, as an effective heart rate management agent.\n\n【17】#### 3\\. Discussion\n\n【18】Melanoma most often affects the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[5\\]</u>. Its cardiac involvement is identified in more than 50% of autopsies, but it is challenging to diagnose since it spreads asymptomatically to the heart 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 4, 7\\]</u>. It is even more difficult to establish the prime diagnosis of melanoma through cardiac metastasis 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[6\\]</u>. Once metastasized, the survival rate of patients with stage IV melanoma is very low as their 5-year survival is 15 to 20% 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[4, 7, 8\\]</u>. It is metastasized via the hematogenous pathway, by the coronary arteries or the vena cava 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 7\\]</u>. Myocardial and pericardial involvement implies extracardiac metastatic involvement 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[1, 2, 7\\]</u>. Like cardiac tamponade, the clinical presentation of metastatic melanoma through cardiac arrhythmia is rare. To date, the arrhythmogenic mechanism of melanoma is unknown. It is admitted that there is intramyocardial invasion with compromise of the right atrium impairing the electrical myocardial conduction system. The maintenance of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation presented in case may be explained by the electrical myocardial alterations due to melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[9\\]</u>.\n\n【19】Pericardiocentesis besides being lifesaving in the context of cardiac tamponade also allows establishing the etiological diagnosis. Treatment in these scenarios is limited to serous sclerosis or the establishment of pericardial windows 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[8\\]</u>.\n\n【20】New therapeutic regimens for malignant cutaneous melanoma (MCM)—immunotherapy, BRAF, and MEK inhibitors—demonstrated a significant improvement in relapse-free survival, although they are associated with cardiotoxicity. Among the documented adverse effects, the prolongation of QTc implies a monthly electrocardiographic evaluation 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[10\\]</u>.\n\n【21】The authors intend to emphasize that given the natural and unpredictable history of melanoma, the patient’s history must be taken into account. Cardiac events can occur several years after surgical excision of skin melanoma 通用删除6(英):<u>\\[2, 5\\]</u>.\n\n【22】Due to the abovementioned conditions, all patients with the diagnosis of MCM should be followed and treated by a multidisciplinary team with Oncologists, Cardiologists, Radiologists, Endocrinologists, Surgeons, and Internal Medicine specialists, for proper treatment of the disease and adverse events from its’ treatment.\n\n【23】#### Data Availability\n\n【24】通用删除5(英):<u>The data used to support the findings of this study have been deposited in the PubMed repository 通用删除1(英):<u>(DOI: https://doi.org/10.25504/FAIRsharing.a5sv8m)</u>.</u>\n\n【25】#### Conflicts of Interest\n\n【26】The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "hindawi_case", "batch_name": "20240410", "version": "version1"}
